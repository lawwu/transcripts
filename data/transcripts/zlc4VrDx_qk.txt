[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.660]   where we discuss science
[00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:05.900]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.220]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.380]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.340]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.520]   My guest today is Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.260]   Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher is a professor of pediatrics
[00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.460]   and adolescent medicine
[00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.900]   at Stanford University School of Medicine.
[00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.700]   A developmental psychologist by training,
[00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.340]   Dr. Halpern-Felsher is a world expert
[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.480]   in the risk behaviors that adolescents,
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.840]   teens, and young adults participate in.
[00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.520]   Today, we discuss nicotine use,
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.140]   both by way of smoking,
[00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.340]   as well as vaping and e-cigarette use.
[00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.780]   We also discuss cannabis
[00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.140]   and some of the correlative
[00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.180]   as well as possibly causal data
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.520]   linking cannabis use to psychosis in young adults.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.800]   And we discuss some of the other common risky behaviors
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.520]   that adolescents, teens, and young adults participate in,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.300]   including risky driving behavior,
[00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.420]   alcohol consumption, and risky sexual behavior.
[00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.660]   We discuss the various factors
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.480]   that impact whether or not a young person
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.600]   will participate in risky behaviors,
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.100]   including the family and home,
[00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.740]   as well as peer group and social media.
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.540]   And as we discuss social media,
[00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.820]   we get into a deep discussion
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.620]   about how marketing is combining with peer pressure
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.100]   in order to drive youth
[00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.060]   toward particular risky behaviors.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.820]   By the end of today's conversation,
[00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:20.680]   you will have learned from Dr. Halpern-Felsher
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.160]   the latest research on risk-taking behavior
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.420]   in adolescents, teens, and young adults,
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.480]   and what we can each and all do
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.980]   to ensure that they either avoid these behaviors
[00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.800]   or if they are already engaging in these behaviors,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.900]   that we can mitigate some of the potential harms
[00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.660]   and potentially get them to eliminate these behaviors
[00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.840]   toward having a life of enhanced mental and physical health.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.780]   Before we begin,
[00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.500]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.340]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.260]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.180]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.260]   about science and science-related tools
[00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:53.740]   to the general public.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:54.840]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.740]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.120]   Our first sponsor is Eight Sleep.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.780]   Eight Sleep makes smart mattress covers
[00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.820]   with cooling, heating, and sleep tracking capacity.
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.920]   Now, I've spoken many times before on this podcast
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.900]   about the critical need to get sleep,
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.700]   both enough sleep and enough quality sleep.
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:12.900]   When we do that, everything,
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.420]   our mental health, our physical health,
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.900]   performance in any sports or school, et cetera,
[00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.740]   all get better.
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.860]   And when we're not sleeping well or enough,
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.140]   all those things suffer.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.380]   One of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.400]   is that your body temperature actually has to drop
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.760]   by about one to three degrees
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.200]   in order to fall and stay deeply asleep.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.920]   And in order to wake up feeling refreshed,
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.880]   your body temperature actually has to increase
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.620]   by about one to three degrees.
[00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.480]   One of the best ways to ensure that happens
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.240]   is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.160]   And with Eight Sleep, it makes it very easy to do that.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.880]   You program in the temperature that you want
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.760]   at the beginning, middle, and end of the night.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.080]   You can even divide the temperature
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.920]   for two different people
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.800]   if you have two different people sleeping in the bed,
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.200]   and it tracks your sleep.
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.480]   It tells you how much slow wave sleep
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.400]   and rapid eye movement sleep you're getting.
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.600]   It really helps you dial in the correct parameters
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.760]   to get the best possible night's sleep for you.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.440]   I've been sleeping on an Eight Sleep mattress cover
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.040]   for well over three years now,
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.840]   and it has completely transformed my sleep for the better.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.140]   If you'd like to try Eight Sleep,
[00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.920]   you can go to eightsleep.com/huberman
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.080]   and save $150 off their Pod 3 cover.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.040]   Eight Sleep currently ships in the USA, Canada, UK,
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.360]   select countries in the EU, and Australia.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.560]   Again, that's eightsleep.com/huberman.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Matina.
[00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.020]   Matina makes loose leaf and ready to drink yerba mate.
[00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.080]   I often discuss yerba mate's benefits,
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.620]   such as regulating blood sugar,
[00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.060]   its high antioxidant content,
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.340]   the ways that it can improve digestion,
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.540]   and possible neuroprotective effects.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.140]   I also drink yerba mate because I love the taste.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.600]   While there are a lot of different choices
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.540]   of yerba mate drinks out there,
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.740]   I love Matina because, again,
[00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.760]   they have the no sugar variety,
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.000]   as well as the fact that both their loose leaf
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.600]   and their canned varieties
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.040]   are of the absolute best quality.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.120]   So much so that I decided to become
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:57.840]   a partial owner in the company.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.200]   Although I must say,
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.500]   even if they hadn't allowed me to do that,
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:02.920]   I would be drinking Matina.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.680]   It is the cleanest tasting and best yerba mate you can find.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.960]   I love the taste of brewed loose leaf Matina yerba mate,
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.400]   and I particularly love the taste
[00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:15.880]   of Matina's new canned cold brew zero sugar yerba mate,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.640]   which I personally helped them develop.
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.140]   If you'd like to try Matina,
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.620]   go to drinkmatina.com/huberman.
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.280]   Right now, Matina is offering a free one pound bag
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.360]   of loose leaf yerba mate tea and free shipping
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.760]   with the purchase of two cases
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.600]   of their cold brew yerba mate.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.040]   Again, that's drinkmatina.com/huberman
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:37.720]   to get the free bag of yerba mate loose leaf tea
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:39.040]   and free shipping.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.720]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.160]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.280]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.640]   That means zero sugar
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.040]   and the appropriate ratios of the electrolytes,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.160]   sodium, magnesium, and potassium.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.140]   And that correct ratio of electrolytes
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.280]   is extremely important because every cell in your body,
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.560]   but especially your nerve cells, your neurons,
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.400]   relies on electrolytes in order to function properly.
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.880]   So when you're well hydrated
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.520]   and your hydration also includes
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:06.560]   the appropriate ratios of electrolytes,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.640]   your mental functioning
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.800]   and your physical functioning is improved.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.160]   I drink one packet of Element
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.040]   dissolved in about 16 to 32 ounces of water
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.600]   when I wake up in the morning,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.560]   as well as while I exercise.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.640]   And if I've sweat a lot during that exercise,
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.120]   I often will drink a third Element packet dissolved
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.000]   in about 32 ounces of water after I exercise.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.160]   If you'd like to try Element,
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.400]   you can go to drinkelement spelled element.com/huberman
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.640]   to try a free sample pack.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.160]   Again, that's drinkelement.com/huberman.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.880]   And now for my discussion with Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.160]   Dr. Halpern-Felsher, welcome.
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.280]   - Thank you so much for having me.
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.500]   - We're going to talk about a very important
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:49.440]   and sometimes troubling period of life.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.920]   Not always troubling, but I think for everyone,
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.680]   adolescence and the teen years,
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   youth essentially is a tricky landscape.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.560]   - Yes, it is.
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.380]   It can be.
[00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:05.480]   - Yeah, as our brain and bodies mature,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.160]   we have more autonomy in where we take them,
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   but that means also more exposure to the ideas,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.320]   suggestions, actions, peer pressure of others.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.400]   And that's sometimes where the problems arise
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.120]   and who knows, probably also where the solutions come from
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.720]   too from time to time.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:26.520]   But I think as conscientious people
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.580]   who mind the wellbeing of others of our species,
[00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.640]   we'd all like to know sort of like,
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.680]   what are the key features
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:34.480]   that mark this stage of development?
[00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:36.880]   Maybe we'll just start off by talking about this
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.360]   through the lens of your expertise
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.160]   as a developmental psychologist.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.200]   You know, what is adolescence in the teen years?
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.920]   Like what's going on?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:49.000]   What sorts of things are being worked out psychologically
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.840]   that we might not be aware of?
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.880]   And then we can talk about some of the common pitfalls
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.320]   and the risk-taking behavior,
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   everything from smoking, vaping, drug use, sexual behavior,
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.080]   addictive behaviors as it relates to social media,
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.040]   bullying, risky driving, there's so much there.
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.920]   But maybe we could just look at this stage of youth
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.880]   through the lens of a developmental psychologist
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.280]   and share with us anything you feel is worth knowing.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.520]   - Sure, so first of all, ages.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.560]   Adolescence can be anywhere
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.720]   from starting roughly around age 10.
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:26.800]   Some people would say ending around age 18, maybe 21.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.040]   If you wanna go into young adulthood, then maybe mid-20s.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.880]   And really adolescence is a wonderful time of,
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.840]   as you said, exploration.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:37.800]   It's a time when, first of all,
[00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:41.680]   marked by pubertal changes, onset of menses for girls,
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:47.000]   and really the pubertal and physical development,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:50.200]   secondary sexual characteristics are coming out.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.120]   We also have a lot of emotional development
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:54.360]   going on during this time.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.000]   Height changes are occurring during this time.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.280]   But we're getting a lot of social changes as well.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.840]   As you said, peer pressures.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.120]   So while misnomer as parents think
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.320]   that they don't matter during adolescence,
[00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.760]   they still really matter.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.440]   But peers also come in and matter quite a bit.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.480]   And then teens are really trying to figure out who they are.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:15.200]   You get a lot of questions.
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.440]   Who am I?
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.880]   Where am I going in life?
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.360]   What do I wanna do when I grow up?
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.280]   What's important to me?
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.640]   How do other people feel about me?
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:26.920]   And then how do I feel about other people?
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.400]   So a lot of the social and psychosocial development
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.840]   is happening as well.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:35.960]   And you get asynchronous development too
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:37.840]   if a young person, for example,
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.520]   starts puberty at a younger age, say 10,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.120]   where they're physically looking older, more mature.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:46.040]   But emotionally and psychosocially,
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.280]   they still might be young versus the late matures,
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.480]   physical matures who may be not having
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:57.480]   and looking like an older teen or an adult till 16, 17, 18,
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.360]   but they're more mature emotionally than others.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.680]   Then you might have some confusion to that young person.
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:06.880]   I look older, but I don't feel older and stuff like that.
[00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.120]   But it's really this wonderful time of exploration
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.880]   for an adolescent and a time of really wanting autonomy
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.760]   and wanting to make a lot of decisions
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.400]   that we should let them make,
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:18.440]   but there are some risks that we have to be careful about
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.280]   at the same time.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:22.480]   - I've often heard this word autonomy
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.320]   as it relates to this stage of puberty in the teen years.
[00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.840]   You mentioned that kids of that age
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.280]   still really need their parents.
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:35.360]   You know, in the last, gosh, 20, 30 years in this country,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:39.200]   there's been a marked increase in the frequency of divorce.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:43.400]   Is there any direct evidence that single parent homes
[00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.800]   or homes where, I don't know, people are remarried
[00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.560]   or just basically divorced homes
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.880]   are somehow creating more challenges
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.760]   in terms of risk-taking behavior in adolescents and teens
[00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:56.200]   or not?
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:59.040]   Because I know plenty of people who had, you know,
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:01.400]   grew up in single parent homes,
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:03.520]   sometimes parents remarried and sometimes didn't,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:05.680]   and by my mind,
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.160]   I can't seem to come up with any direct correlation.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.600]   You know, plenty of those kids did fine
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.480]   and plenty of kids in two-parent homes
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.600]   that I know had challenges and vice versa.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   - Yeah, I haven't contributed.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.120]   Actually, I have some of my earlier dissertation work
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:21.320]   and I haven't really contributed
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:22.640]   to that literature for a while,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:24.800]   but what you're saying is pretty accurate
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:26.520]   to what I've seen,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.120]   which is really the literature would say
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.080]   it's not the divorce per se,
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.440]   it's the conflict that is happening.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.600]   So if parents actually get divorced,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.200]   usually if the conflict resumes,
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.520]   teenagers and children generally do well,
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:42.360]   and particularly within about two years.
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.640]   - If the conflict resolves.
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.360]   - If the conflict resolves, right.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.440]   So you can have two parents who are married
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.200]   and living in the same home
[00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.920]   and may or may not be a good relationship,
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:54.960]   but living in the same home,
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.360]   if there's no conflict,
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.920]   or then generally teens will do well,
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:01.000]   or as you're saying,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.280]   there's not necessarily a direct correlation.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.520]   The problem comes in whether parents
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.200]   are living at home together or separated or divorced
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.520]   is if there's conflict.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:14.160]   And then that conflict tends to result in social issues,
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:17.400]   emotional issues, a lot of social anxiety,
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:19.680]   a lot of feeling like I need to do better
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.840]   so that way my parents like me more.
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:23.120]   And we see that with children too,
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:25.240]   that's not just adolescents.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   A lot of depression,
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.200]   and with depression can come self-medication,
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:33.280]   self-medicating around other drugs and so on.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.520]   But that generally is resolved if the conflict resolves.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.600]   But as you're saying,
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.720]   we're seeing adolescents angst regardless of parenting.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.320]   What we really need though,
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:46.080]   it's not a matter of just the divorce or not divorce
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.840]   or the relationship between the parents,
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.520]   it's parenting that's important.
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:52.760]   So parents being good monitors,
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.640]   being involved in their kids' lives,
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.520]   not this, oh, you're 16, you have a car,
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:57.600]   you can go wherever you want
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.320]   and we're not gonna keep an eye on you.
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:03.200]   We still need parents to monitor, to pay attention,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:05.480]   to find out their kids' friends,
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:07.320]   where are they going after school,
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.160]   that discretionary time when parents are working
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.120]   and teenagers come home between three and five
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:17.280]   or three and six tends to be the most risky couple of hours.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.040]   They're, it's called discretionary hours
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.600]   where there's no parent around
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:23.920]   and we don't always know where those teenagers
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:24.760]   are hanging out.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:28.280]   So that's more important knowing where their children are
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.440]   and what they're doing
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:32.320]   and that there's some adult presence, some monitoring
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.520]   than whether or not they're still in a relationship.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:38.800]   - My sense is that smartphones have allowed more
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.960]   communication and monitoring between parents and kids,
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.280]   but also more interactions between kids
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.320]   and other kids and kids and adults more broadly.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.800]   So is there any evidence that the advent of smartphones
[00:12:52.880 --> 00:12:55.720]   is directly creating problems for kids
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.960]   that has to do with just so much more
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:02.520]   peer-to-peer interaction or peer-to-peer exposure?
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.240]   Like when I was growing up, we didn't have smartphones.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.760]   If you did something stupid like that,
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.760]   meaning that kids would laugh at,
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.720]   it might get told to a small group of people,
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:13.960]   maybe a larger group of people,
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.600]   but in general, it just kind of didn't go anywhere.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   You're like, ah, I screwed up
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.880]   and then you'd get teased a bit
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.320]   and then it would kind of dissipate.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.400]   But now, of course, that can propagate
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.320]   very, very far, very fast.
[00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.040]   Is there any evidence that that mere fact
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.720]   is creating issues for kids?
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.440]   - So I would say it's not a blanket statement.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.360]   I think it depends on the behavior
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.520]   that we're talking about.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.640]   Bullying, no doubt, and the example that you gave,
[00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:43.200]   no doubt that if you mess up, if you do something stupid,
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:45.500]   it's getting filmed and it's gonna go viral.
[00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:49.920]   It will go on social media and then it will perpetuate
[00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.840]   and escalate amongst the peers.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.240]   That we definitely know is happening.
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.360]   And certainly in terms of drug use and marketing,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:00.780]   there's definitely some peer-to-peer interaction.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:01.840]   Look how cool I am.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.720]   Look at the smoke ring I did.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.960]   Look at other things that I've been doing.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:07.500]   There's no doubt.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:10.120]   But in general, there are also some good things about it.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.440]   Parent communication.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.400]   They can monitor where their children are.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:16.600]   They can put a tracker on the phone.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.840]   I know with my own kids,
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.760]   sometimes it was the best way to say,
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.720]   you seem a little sad when face-to-face communication
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.560]   wasn't happening.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:26.560]   I could use the phone to have that conversation.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.380]   So yes, there is some evidence that overall phones
[00:14:30.380 --> 00:14:34.320]   and smartphones have increased risk behavior,
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:36.880]   but it's more the access to the behavior
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.820]   and then the viralness of really getting
[00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:41.240]   that information out.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:43.920]   Like you said, if somebody screws up,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:47.240]   somebody dresses wrong, if somebody kisses somebody,
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:49.600]   that that could go pretty viral.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.720]   I wouldn't say that smartphones and social media
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   as a whole is the problem.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:58.440]   I think it's situation-specific and behavior-specific
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.580]   that we're seeing, and particularly around marketing,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:04.680]   for example, that teenagers have more access now
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:08.480]   to YouTube, to marketing, that they're promoting,
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.360]   not only are industries promoting, for example,
[00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:14.680]   e-cigarettes or cannabis promoting to young people,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   but teens are promoting to each other.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.080]   And that we didn't see before smartphones, right?
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:21.520]   We didn't see, I took a picture, or Instagram,
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.680]   look at me smoking, or look at me dressing sexy,
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:28.480]   or look at me looking cool, or anything like that.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:30.720]   That didn't happen before.
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:32.600]   It was more just word of mouth.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:35.520]   So that is definitely where we're a lot more concerned
[00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:40.200]   about social media, but more my concern about social media
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.000]   is the outside world targeting young people.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.800]   That's where I've been the biggest concerned about it.
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:49.280]   Teenagers targeting each other with bullying,
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:51.120]   no doubt, big issue.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:53.120]   But in other ways, there's more support,
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:54.900]   there's more social interaction.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:58.840]   The other time I get concerned, though, around teenagers
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.320]   is more the social piece of sitting around together
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.560]   at a table, and they're not talking, they're on the phones.
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.320]   So what we really don't know enough is
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.640]   how is the not getting out and playing,
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:13.800]   and instead playing on a game, not going to the park,
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.520]   and instead communicating through phones,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.720]   how is that changing their social and physical development
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:22.920]   is where I'm also very concerned.
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:29.440]   - Yeah, I have family relatives who are in their teens,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:33.520]   and it's interesting to see them interact
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.240]   where they're on their phones a lot of the time.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.320]   But I've also noticed that there's a cohort of kids
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.760]   that are really trying to put their phones away
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.060]   and just spend time together.
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.500]   And that was actually directly stated to me,
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:46.000]   that, oh yeah, we hang out and we make it a point
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.880]   not to be on our phones when we hang out.
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.160]   But then, of course, they'll text or be on the iPad
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:53.600]   with one another in the evening when they're apart.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.120]   So they're sort of never apart.
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.280]   - Right.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:59.200]   - But I do think there seems to be at least a sub-movement
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.120]   of kids and teens that are trying to do
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.220]   more face-to-face interaction with devices,
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:06.080]   at least put aside.
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:07.040]   - I think that's a really good point.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:08.880]   I've talked to some teens who say that they all,
[00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:11.640]   they get together and they will deliberately put the phones
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:14.480]   face down in the middle, no phones,
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:16.120]   and have dinner or have a conversation.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:17.220]   So I think you're right.
[00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:20.400]   I definitely think that that has been a movement
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.600]   and I really appreciate that and I think that's fantastic.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.300]   I've also seen circumstances where two teens
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:27.880]   are trying to help each other with homework
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.880]   and they're texting each other, which is fine.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.960]   But I've often said, why don't you just pick up the phone
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.080]   and call the person and in five minutes
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.600]   you can figure out the math assignment
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.400]   instead of 20, 30 minutes of back and forth.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.000]   It's just not as efficient unless you're literally copying
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.400]   and showing the picture.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.240]   But is that having a change on their social
[00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:47.600]   or physical development or emotional development?
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.440]   Probably not.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:51.800]   It's just a different world, the way that they communicate.
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:54.760]   And that's why I say, I'm less worried in some ways,
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:56.560]   as long as they're still getting out and they're playing
[00:17:56.560 --> 00:17:58.560]   and they're being creative, I'm less worried
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:01.120]   about that kind of social interaction
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:03.480]   on phones and social media.
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.060]   It's a different way.
[00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:07.480]   We don't have a lot of evidence to say one way or the other,
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.020]   but if they're still doing the things
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:10.760]   that they should be doing as young people,
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:13.560]   my concern is that outside world,
[00:18:13.560 --> 00:18:17.600]   the concern of predatory behaviors,
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:21.000]   the concern of industry, the concern of mass media
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.440]   and marketing to teens.
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:25.440]   That's the part that gets me particularly worried.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.760]   - Yeah, well, we know for sure that this is the first time
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.440]   in human evolution that humans have essentially written
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.600]   with their thumbs.
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.240]   It's gotta be a massive expansion
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.600]   of the brain's representation of the thumbs
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.880]   relative to 20, 30 years ago.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.720]   But maybe now would be a good time to talk
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.200]   about risky behaviors or even just behaviors
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.840]   that are known to have some detriment to health,
[00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:53.840]   smoking and vaping and e-cigarettes primarily.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:57.520]   And we should be probably distinguishing
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:00.480]   between nicotine and cannabis.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:03.200]   Maybe let's just start with nicotine.
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   What are the statistics on smoking, vaping and e-cigarettes?
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:09.500]   Just rough statistics.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.000]   I saw a talk that you did online,
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   decided some pretty outrageous increases
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.840]   in or shocking increases in smoking and vaping
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:22.480]   in the last couple of years, just staggering.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.040]   So maybe if you give us the top contour of those.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.320]   - Sure, absolutely.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.720]   So the good news is smoking rates,
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:30.360]   conventional cigarette smoking rates
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:31.800]   has gone down pretty dramatically
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:34.420]   in the last couple of decades with teenagers,
[00:19:34.420 --> 00:19:37.000]   with all people in the US, which is wonderful,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.120]   but teenagers to well below 10%,
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:43.440]   if not really well below 5% of teenagers.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.320]   That's the good news.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:46.920]   In terms of e-cigarette use,
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.560]   which I prefer the term e-cigarette use than vaping
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:52.280]   'cause they're not vapes, they're aerosols.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:54.840]   But e-cigarette use has gone up pretty dramatically.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.840]   So e-cigarettes came on the market in the US in 2007.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:03.440]   And they were slowed for uptick amongst teenagers.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:06.480]   They look like cigarettes when they first came on the market.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:08.360]   They weren't very popular with teenagers.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.560]   They didn't have, they had some flavors, not a lot,
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:12.560]   didn't have a lot of nicotine.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.360]   It was probably around 2011 to 2014,
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.960]   we started seeing an uptick,
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.000]   but then it was really in 2017 to '19
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.120]   that we saw a dramatic increase.
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:24.560]   And that was the statistics there.
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:28.280]   We saw upwards of 27 to 29% of teens
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.360]   using e-cigarettes during those couple of years.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:32.360]   - Daily use?
[00:20:32.360 --> 00:20:36.400]   - Past 30 days, so any use in the past 30 days
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:40.080]   was, and daily use will be some smaller percentage of that.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.960]   It was something like a 78% increase
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:44.280]   in high school student use
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.880]   and a 48% increase in middle school use
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.960]   over those couple of years.
[00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:52.080]   So a very dramatic increase in use.
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:56.680]   Since 2019, it's gone down, but I'm gonna give a caveat.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.600]   It's gone down in 2020 to the national numbers are showing
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:03.920]   that went to around 20% and now around 10%.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:07.080]   Part of that was in 2020 we had COVID
[00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:12.080]   and initiation of e-cigarette use really occurs socially.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.000]   And going back to socialization,
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:16.240]   it's a lot of teens getting together
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:18.560]   and it's not peer pressure of you have to try,
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.440]   come on, try this.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.960]   It's more like my friends are using, I'm at a party,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.560]   I feel like using, yeah, I'll try it.
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:28.080]   Well, during the pandemic and the shutdown,
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:30.680]   teens were not at school, they weren't with their friends.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:33.200]   So initiation went down.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.720]   Teens who were addicted,
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:36.280]   and we can certainly talk about levels
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:38.160]   of nicotine in e-cigarettes,
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.720]   but teens who were addicted continues to use.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.000]   Some try to quit, which was great,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.120]   but we still saw a fair amount of use.
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:49.160]   So part of the decrease in those 2020 to 2021
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.920]   have to do with just access and socialization had changed.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.120]   And so rates went down.
[00:21:56.120 --> 00:21:58.720]   Since then, even we published a paper
[00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.120]   showing relationships between COVID and vaping.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:04.880]   We saw EVALI, e-cigarette and vaping
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.040]   associated lung illness.
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.320]   So that we think was part of why
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.280]   we also saw further drops around 2021,
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.160]   but people were concerned about their lung health
[00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.440]   in teens as well, and that's great.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:21.400]   The latest data show that the rates are under 10%,
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.840]   the national data.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.400]   I actually don't think it's true.
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.480]   And the reason I don't think it's true
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.960]   is I'm in the schools doing curriculum presentations
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.440]   all the time where I teach and educate teachers
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:37.400]   to use our tobacco and cannabis prevention curriculums.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:40.480]   And we've never been busier than we are right now
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:43.000]   with schools just crying for help.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.080]   We have another group of teenagers using e-cigarettes,
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:49.600]   nicotine or cannabis or whatever.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.240]   It's way more than 10%.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.200]   I would say schools are telling me it's 40 to 60%
[00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.160]   of their students are using e-cigarettes.
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.800]   - For nicotine?
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:00.640]   - We don't know.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.160]   It's very hard to know.
[00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:05.000]   It's very hard to know what's in there, but-
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.440]   - 40 to 60%.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.120]   - That's what the schools are saying.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.840]   - At some point in the last 30 days.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.520]   - At some point in the last 30 days.
[00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.320]   They're catching just exorbitant numbers
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.280]   of students using right now.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.560]   And so from a science perspective, is it 10%, 20%, 30?
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.400]   We don't know.
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:25.400]   I can just tell you that the national CDC data
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.240]   would say 10% and maybe it's a problem with the surveys
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.960]   or the questions or teens aren't being honest,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.800]   but from a school's perspective, it's much higher.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.240]   And then we have some national data suggesting
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.800]   it's more in the 20 to 30 to 40% range as well.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:41.440]   Whatever it is, it's too many.
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:44.480]   It's too many teens who are inhaling nicotine
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:46.760]   and cannabis as well.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:48.400]   - Well, a lot to unpack there.
[00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.840]   First of all, nicotine.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.040]   I did an episode of the podcast about nicotine
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:57.560]   and a little bit of that got confused
[00:23:57.560 --> 00:23:58.640]   in the way it landed.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:03.260]   So I'll just quickly state that nicotine,
[00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.440]   known cognitive enhancer,
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:08.680]   also known to dramatically increase blood pressure
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.200]   and vasoconstriction, not healthy for the body,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   just to be clear, it's not healthy for the body.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.880]   So when people hear that it's a cognitive enhancer,
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:19.440]   increases focus and alertness, that's true.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.880]   In the short term, highly addictive,
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:25.560]   highly, highly addictive and habit forming
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:26.960]   since sometimes those are separated.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.680]   Maybe we delve into that distinction.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.120]   But by my observation,
[00:24:32.120 --> 00:24:35.920]   very few people can use nicotine occasionally.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:40.920]   People who try it seem to like it,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.320]   at least in the short run and keep using it.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:49.280]   So presumably kids are using,
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.320]   or I should say youth are using nicotine
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:53.920]   either by vape or e-cigarette
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.640]   and they quote unquote like the way it makes them feel.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.880]   Who knows, maybe it allows them
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:01.940]   to focus on their studies better, I don't know.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:06.560]   But it is known to improve certain forms of cognition,
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.460]   but only transiently and it's highly addictive
[00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:11.580]   and it's bad for their health, for anyone's health.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.520]   So that puts us in a kind of a tricky situation
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:17.200]   when evaluating in the statistics that you just laid out
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:20.840]   because one wonders, are they taking it
[00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:24.280]   and then continuing to take it because of peer pressure,
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.160]   because of lack of peer pressure to not do it,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:30.440]   because it helps them with their schoolwork,
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:32.200]   because they're naturally a little bit depressed
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:36.000]   and it provides a kind of antidepressant signal.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.640]   I mean, what do we know about why they're actually starting
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.320]   and why they're continuing
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:43.120]   and why they are reluctant to quit?
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.920]   Maybe we just parse those.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:48.980]   So why does a teenager try nicotine?
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.800]   So there are a few reasons why they start
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.760]   based on the scientific literature and just talking to teens.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.040]   One has to do with the marketing, no doubt.
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:04.680]   If you look at the marketing, it is targeting young people.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.240]   It's targeting them with first of all,
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:10.960]   the devices themselves, they are cool looking,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:15.520]   they're easy to hide, they look like USB devices,
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:17.280]   they look like highlighters.
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.760]   In fact, there's a new brand out called Highlight
[00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:22.480]   that is a highlighter, that's a working highlighter,
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:24.800]   but it's actually a nicotine e-cigarette.
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:26.920]   - So a highlighter pen to study.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.920]   - Highlighter pen to study,
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:30.880]   but it's actually, you take the cover off
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.520]   and it's actually a nicotine e-cigarette device.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.560]   - Clearly marketed towards students.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:37.560]   - Clearly marketed towards students.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:42.560]   You have, what's it called, boba teas, drinks.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:44.520]   - Oh yeah, the tea with the, yeah.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.880]   - Yeah, mimicking that drink that's actually,
[00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:51.960]   that the straw is actually the vaping inhaling there,
[00:26:51.960 --> 00:26:53.120]   little pieces.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:58.120]   You have Star Wars shapes, it goes on and on,
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:02.840]   just the cartoon shapes that are clearly being targeted
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:07.160]   to not just teenagers, children that we're seeing.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.480]   - Children, like young children?
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.520]   - Children, like young children, so.
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:14.960]   - Wait, so I'm shocked.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.080]   So kids younger than 10
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:20.560]   are having these products push their way?
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:22.800]   - They are, and actually I didn't tell you
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:25.560]   in the statistics, the statistics I was citing,
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.960]   I should go back and clarify a couple there
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:30.000]   that are even more shocking.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.360]   So those are the numbers for middle and high school.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.600]   We don't have data from elementary,
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.160]   but again, the other part of,
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.880]   in addition to the science I contribute to,
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.760]   the interventions I do,
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:44.720]   I am getting elementary school teachers calling us
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.120]   for help, they are catching second and third graders
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.760]   using nicotine cigarettes, I'm not kidding.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.600]   And not just one or two, quite a bit.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.000]   We said we would never develop an elementary school version
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   of a vaping prevention curriculum,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.840]   that's what we call ours, you and me together, Vape Free.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.200]   We would never, we have a middle school and a high school,
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:09.320]   we were never gonna do elementary.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   We've had so many schools across the country
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.580]   call us and say, "We need something for elementary."
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.440]   So we actually created a curriculum.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:22.240]   So we're having, there was a story of an eight-year-old
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:26.360]   back east who was caught and using,
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.960]   and the teachers and police didn't know what to do,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:31.120]   and of course I said, "It's not a police matter,
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:33.680]   "why aren't we helping this young person?"
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:36.480]   So we are, we're seeing younger now,
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:39.640]   sometimes they're starting because their siblings,
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:44.200]   older siblings, it's being marketed to,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.000]   they don't realize that it's a nicotine e-cigarette
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.560]   or a cannabis e-cigarette,
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:51.440]   they just don't realize what it is.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:54.080]   But the number of these products
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.640]   that are being targeted to young people
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.120]   is absolutely ridiculous what they look like.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.600]   The pictures are endless, and the problem is
[00:29:02.600 --> 00:29:06.160]   they're coming out with new products every few months
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.040]   that are targeting kids.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.640]   So marketing, and the other is flavors,
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.880]   and flavors and marketing go hand-in-hand.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.760]   If it looks bad, it looks like, or it smells like,
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.640]   and tastes like nicotine or tobacco,
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.680]   teens know that that's gross.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.840]   That's why we don't have cigarette use anymore.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:30.240]   Teens, we've socialized our country to say
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:33.800]   if you smell tobacco, it's nothing that we want to smell,
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.360]   we walk away from it, you walk across the street,
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.600]   whatever, we've done a really good job
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.240]   in tobacco control getting the word out around
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   that these products, e-cigarettes, smell and taste
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:51.760]   like sugar, like sweets, like dessert, like candy.
[00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:56.120]   So you've got, and the names are things like Unicorn Poop
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:59.440]   and Sugar Booger and Honey Doo Doo.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:00.800]   That's not for adults.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:03.680]   Those names are squarely for kids.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.520]   It's kids who are using chocolate,
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.460]   it's kids who are using these flavors
[00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.160]   that are on the market.
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:11.840]   And then the marketing around it are these,
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:13.040]   I mean, they're beautiful.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:17.440]   There are these pizazz of pineapple dancing around
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:22.440]   or strawberries dancing or whatever it is
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.640]   that are very animated.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.080]   There are juice box style that have come out,
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.560]   juice box style vaping devices
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:33.720]   that are marketed looking like juice boxes.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.000]   Again, that's not targeting you and me.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.540]   That's targeting a kid.
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:42.100]   - Interesting and scary to hear all this.
[00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.280]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.800]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:47.740]   By now, most of you have heard me tell my story
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.420]   about how I've been taking AG1 once or twice a day
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.120]   every day since 2012.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.540]   And indeed that's true.
[00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:55.820]   I started taking AG1 and I still take AG1
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:58.480]   once or twice a day because it gives me vitamins
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.400]   and minerals that I might not be getting enough of
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.040]   from whole foods that I eat,
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.960]   as well as adaptogens and micronutrients.
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:07.320]   Those adaptogens and micronutrients are really critical
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:09.960]   because even though I strive to eat most of my foods
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:12.880]   from unprocessed or minimally processed whole foods,
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:13.920]   it's often hard to do so,
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.800]   especially when I'm traveling and especially when I'm busy.
[00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:19.040]   So by drinking a packet of AG1 in the morning
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:22.360]   and oftentimes also again in the afternoon or evening,
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.340]   I'm ensuring that I'm getting everything I need.
[00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:27.160]   I'm covering all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   And I, like so many other people that take AG1 regularly,
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.720]   just report feeling better.
[00:31:31.720 --> 00:31:33.000]   And that shouldn't be surprising
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.280]   because it supports gut health
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.920]   and of course gut health supports immune system health
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:37.920]   and brain health.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.040]   And it's supporting a ton of different cellular
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.520]   and organ processes that all interact with one another.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.280]   So while certain supplements are really directed
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.840]   towards one specific outcome,
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.000]   like sleeping better or being more alert,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.340]   AG1 really is foundational nutritional support.
[00:31:52.340 --> 00:31:54.640]   It's really designed to support all of the systems
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:56.840]   of your brain and body that relate to mental health
[00:31:56.840 --> 00:31:57.880]   and physical health.
[00:31:57.880 --> 00:31:59.160]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:02.520]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:03.960]   to claim a special offer.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.360]   They'll give you five free travel packs with your order
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.020]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:13.480]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:15.760]   - What percentage of adults in the US
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.680]   vape or use e-cigarettes just by way of comparison?
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:22.360]   - So I've seen numbers anywhere from 5% to around 20%,
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:23.600]   depending on the statistic.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.880]   I actually haven't looked at the latest data on adults,
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:32.400]   but the majority of adults who are using,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.880]   it's a little bit different to think about it.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:36.840]   Adults are using generally,
[00:32:36.840 --> 00:32:40.680]   they're not initiating tobacco through e-cigarettes.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:43.880]   They're generally, and I'm talking 30 and up,
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.140]   they generally have been smoking cigarettes
[00:32:46.140 --> 00:32:49.280]   and then maybe they're trying to use e-cigarettes to quit,
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:52.540]   which is a whole nother set of literature
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:54.440]   that it's not necessarily as effective
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.680]   as we're hoping that it is.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:58.900]   There isn't good literature on a population level
[00:32:58.900 --> 00:33:02.420]   that e-cigarettes help adults quit cigarettes.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.140]   The difference with teenagers
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:08.860]   is they're initiating with e-cigarettes
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.660]   and they're not saying, huh, here's a cigarette,
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:14.060]   here's an e-cigarette, which one do I choose?
[00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.820]   It's not that they're substituting or replacing.
[00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.580]   They're not using cigarettes.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:21.580]   Some are now because they're switching back and forth,
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.820]   but they're initiating with e-cigarettes.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.860]   They're initiating because of the marketing.
[00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:28.420]   They're initiating because of the flavors
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.340]   and the products and the ability to hide it.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.500]   Parents don't know what these products look like.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:36.740]   So the landscape is very different.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.460]   - So you were telling us why teens
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:42.180]   and adolescents start vaping.
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.820]   The marketing is clearly oriented toward them.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:47.020]   There are a number of reinforcing factors
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:50.420]   that, at least to my mind, as you're describing all this,
[00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.740]   make it sound like this stuff is supposed to be,
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:58.220]   quote unquote, playful, that it's not a drug.
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:33:59.060]   That sort of thing.
[00:33:59.060 --> 00:34:00.900]   It reminds me a little bit of sugary cereals.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:02.620]   When I was a kid, you'd buy the cereal
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.900]   'cause you wanted the taste,
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.780]   but you also wanted the colorful box.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:10.100]   You had the cartoons that it related to on TV.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:12.640]   And there's usually a toy inside that you wanted,
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.740]   some surprise that you could then collect across boxes.
[00:34:15.740 --> 00:34:18.540]   So there was a lot of levels of incentivization.
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:21.260]   Why do they keep smoking or vaping?
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:23.020]   Are they addicted to nicotine?
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.340]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:28.460]   So the other reason why they start is they like the taste
[00:34:28.460 --> 00:34:30.060]   and they like the rush.
[00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.100]   So I've talked to, so that's the other pieces.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.820]   So a few more reasons why they start
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:37.820]   and then certainly answer your question around the nicotine.
[00:34:37.820 --> 00:34:42.800]   Teens have told me outright that they like the taste,
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:45.360]   they like the rush, they like the buzz.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.500]   And we could talk about how much nicotine is in there.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:49.700]   It's astonishing and I can explain that,
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.180]   but they like the buzz.
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.600]   Another reason, by the way, is stress and coping.
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:57.780]   Right now, teens are so stressed out.
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:34:59.460]   They've been stressed out for years,
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.600]   but they're particularly stressed with the pandemic.
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.080]   And even though we're a couple years out of the lockdown,
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.860]   teens are still, they're having socialization issues,
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:10.780]   social emotional learning issues.
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:12.460]   They're still confused.
[00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:13.860]   They missed a couple of years,
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.980]   particularly high school students
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.360]   may have missed part of middle school
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:19.460]   where you're learning to socialize with other people.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:20.460]   So they're very stressed.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.520]   And we know that there's a pretty strong relationship
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.420]   between stress, not being able to cope
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:28.600]   and using any drug, but including nicotine.
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.380]   So there's a lot of different reasons why young people
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.500]   and certainly the peers.
[00:35:33.500 --> 00:35:35.600]   And again, it's not peer pressure.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.500]   It's more like a lot of friends are using it.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.980]   I've talked to teens who say,
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:41.700]   I wasn't intending on, but I tried it.
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.060]   Wow, I really liked the taste, I liked the flavor.
[00:35:45.060 --> 00:35:48.260]   And then there's the amount of nicotine that's in there.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.980]   In 2015, when the newer products came on the market,
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:54.220]   it was a salt-based nicotine.
[00:35:54.220 --> 00:35:57.380]   So cigarettes and then earlier e-cigarettes
[00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:59.300]   have a free-based nicotine.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.700]   Free-based nicotine uses ammonia and sugar
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:04.820]   to bind to the nicotine and the other chemicals.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.420]   There's hundreds of chemicals in there
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.740]   to go through the body, lungs into the brain
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.960]   and give you that rush.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:14.820]   The free-based nicotine is very caustic.
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:16.100]   If you think the litmus test,
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:19.620]   it's very much on the basic side of the litmus test there.
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:22.380]   And if you're a nicotine-naive youth,
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.180]   which again, most teens starting with nicotine e-cigarettes
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:28.340]   have not used nicotine before,
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:32.060]   when you start, you don't want that caustic throat hit
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.200]   feeling, that's how it's described.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:35.540]   Teens will say they don't like it,
[00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:37.460]   they cough, it tasted bad.
[00:36:37.460 --> 00:36:40.480]   Well, to an adult who's been using cigarettes,
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.200]   they don't mind that, they're used to it,
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:44.020]   but a teen is not.
[00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.500]   Well, I will mention Juul here 'cause it's relevant.
[00:36:47.500 --> 00:36:49.540]   Juul came on the market in 2015.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:51.700]   - With a salt-based nicotine.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.800]   - Which essentially, for those who aren't familiar
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:57.340]   with caustic and litmus tests and things like that,
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:36:59.400]   the salt-based nicotine, as I understand,
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.660]   is quote-unquote smoother.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:02.500]   - Correct.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.240]   - It causes less sort of coughing,
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.740]   static contraction of the muscles in the mouth and throat,
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:14.940]   you know, and so it's basically more palpable
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:18.380]   and more of a kind of gradual on-ramp,
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:21.060]   which is exactly what a company wants.
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:24.100]   If you want somebody to start using something,
[00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:26.500]   you don't want to hit them square in the face.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:28.260]   - That's exactly right, that's exactly right.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.380]   So salt-based nicotine generally uses benzoic acid
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.520]   to move that litmus test needle from the caustic
[00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:36.940]   towards acidic because it's an acid,
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:39.180]   but really towards neutral, exactly.
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:42.820]   So when you use it, it's smooth, it's easy to use,
[00:37:42.820 --> 00:37:45.640]   you don't have that throat hit, you don't cough,
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.260]   you don't feel sick from it.
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.100]   So teens will say, and I've talked to teens
[00:37:50.100 --> 00:37:52.860]   and young adults who tried earlier e-cigarettes
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:55.540]   and didn't like it and then tried the salt-based style
[00:37:55.540 --> 00:37:59.140]   and said, "Ooh, I like it," coupled with the flavors,
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.740]   it's also more absorbent.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:03.380]   So there's some suggestion and some early evidence
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:04.980]   that it's also more addictive.
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.620]   So when those products first came on the market,
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.220]   before, earlier e-cigarettes had, say,
[00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:15.380]   zero to 36 milligrams of nicotine.
[00:38:15.380 --> 00:38:18.900]   Suddenly we jumped up to 59 milligrams per mil,
[00:38:18.900 --> 00:38:22.820]   which is generally about a 40, 41 milligram,
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:25.340]   'cause it's about a 0.7 mil.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:28.520]   Sorry, a little chemistry and math that we do a lot here.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.020]   But you're looking at, basically,
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:33.340]   it's anywhere from the nicotine that you see
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.780]   in either one to two packs of cigarettes.
[00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:39.380]   - Per? - Per device, per pod,
[00:38:39.380 --> 00:38:41.140]   per e-cigarette device.
[00:38:41.140 --> 00:38:44.060]   - And how long does a pod typically last?
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.140]   Let's say, like, a 15 or 16-year-old kid
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:50.080]   who's, you know, taking a hit off the vape pen,
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:54.180]   I don't know what, five times a day?
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:56.820]   - So I've asked teens,
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.140]   in some of the earlier publications we did,
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:02.780]   now, not with the newer devices, but the older devices,
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.460]   and they would say that they were using a pod a week,
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:07.860]   which is about two or three cigarettes a day,
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.520]   to one to four pods a day.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:12.420]   - One to four pods a day? - One to four.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:15.140]   Now, these are highly addicted teenagers.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.400]   That is one to eight packs of cigarettes,
[00:39:17.400 --> 00:39:19.860]   depending on the debates on how much nicotine is in there,
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:21.140]   but you're looking at several packs
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.780]   of cigarettes worth of nicotine.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:24.860]   - Okay, so just to backtrack a little bit,
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.920]   'cause we got a little bit technical, which is great,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.060]   but I wanna make sure everyone's on board.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.300]   The amount of nicotine in one of these pods
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:36.140]   that goes into the vape pen, or e-cig,
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:39.980]   is significantly greater than the amount of nicotine
[00:39:39.980 --> 00:39:42.380]   in one pack of cigarettes, in many cases.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:43.220]   - In many cases.
[00:39:43.220 --> 00:39:47.440]   - And there are many youth, so adolescents and teens,
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.860]   you said before, between the ages of 10 and 21,
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.060]   roughly 10 to 18, 10 to 21,
[00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:57.220]   that are going through as many as four pods per day,
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.260]   which has to be at least the equivalent
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.380]   of four packs of cigarettes,
[00:40:00.380 --> 00:40:03.680]   but could be as much as eight packs of cigarettes per day.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:04.520]   - Correct.
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:05.740]   - In terms of nicotine concentration.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:06.580]   - Correct.
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.460]   - Now, I guess, to be fair,
[00:40:08.460 --> 00:40:11.120]   they are not smoking in the traditional sense,
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:13.420]   so that presumably there's some tars and other contaminants
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:15.180]   that are not going into their system,
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.780]   but we know that there are a lot of chemicals
[00:40:17.780 --> 00:40:20.520]   in these pods besides just nicotine,
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.900]   and I think that's where a big source
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:25.460]   of the debate and interest is now,
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.260]   is how dangerous are those other chemicals?
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.860]   It's really an interesting question.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.900]   - So, a lot of things that you said
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.980]   are really important to highlight.
[00:40:33.980 --> 00:40:35.940]   Absolutely, now, not all teenagers
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.260]   are using four pods a day.
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:40.820]   These are extremely, very highly addicted teens,
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:45.060]   and unfortunately, teens we've seen with lung collapses
[00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:48.640]   and other pretty significant health issues.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:52.020]   Typically, teens are using maybe a pod a day.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:54.520]   The newer e-cigarettes, by the way,
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.840]   have probably four times that.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:59.220]   They're bigger volume,
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.820]   so you're looking at 60, 70 milligrams of nicotine.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:04.980]   Some of them are equivalent
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.840]   to about three to 500 cigarettes worth of nicotine.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:10.280]   Now, are they using them in a day?
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.220]   Probably not.
[00:41:11.220 --> 00:41:13.500]   We haven't done the studies on that,
[00:41:13.500 --> 00:41:16.320]   but it's really the first nicotine product we've had
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:18.080]   that you can use 24/7.
[00:41:18.080 --> 00:41:19.280]   When I've talked to teens,
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:20.480]   you know, I wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:22.800]   I may check my phone and check my email.
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.760]   Teens are waking up in the middle of the night to take a hit,
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.800]   and they're hiding them under their pillows
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.160]   and their nightstands, whatever,
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.000]   and they're telling me
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.960]   that they're just using them all the time,
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.360]   and they could just suck on them all the time.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.960]   - Are they using, when you say all the time,
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.880]   that's interesting, forgive me for interrupting,
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:41.760]   but are they using it specifically to wake up,
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:45.120]   to study, or just to maintain baseline?
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:47.600]   I mean, that's the problem with any addictive substance
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.480]   or habit-forming substance is that
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.720]   what starts off as a rush becomes less of a rush,
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.720]   and then when one doesn't use, they feel below baseline.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.220]   I've done a lot of discussions about dopamine and baseline
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:03.920]   versus, you know, non-baseline peaks in dopamine,
[00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:07.120]   and some of that is smoothed out for general discussion.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:10.000]   Dopamine does many things besides set up reward systems
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.160]   and incentives in the brain,
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:14.100]   but it's at least one of the things it does.
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:17.800]   So are kids starting off taking nicotine
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.480]   and then, and feeling like, whoa,
[00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.180]   that makes them feel really elevated
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.840]   in terms of mood, focus, and alertness,
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:27.520]   and then finding that without it, they're just depressed?
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.960]   Is that the general thing?
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.440]   I'm not trying to lead the witness here.
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:34.000]   I just wanna know what's going on internally.
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.680]   - Absolutely, no, no, no, all great questions there.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.520]   So what we're finding when we talk to teens
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.840]   is that pretty rapidly, they're going from,
[00:42:42.840 --> 00:42:44.680]   I like it to I need it.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:47.780]   So, you know, your multi-part question, which is great,
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:51.040]   what makes them start and what makes them continue?
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:54.120]   They start because of the flavors and the marketing,
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:56.200]   and they like the taste and all that.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.960]   They continue because of that high level of nicotine,
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.160]   and we are seeing that teens are addicted.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:04.880]   And we're seeing, we actually published a couple of studies
[00:43:04.880 --> 00:43:07.920]   showing that teens who have been using e-cigarettes
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.520]   in the past 30 days, that the majority
[00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:13.860]   are showing signs of addiction pretty rapidly, too,
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.380]   within a few weeks.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:18.000]   It's such high levels of nicotine.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.540]   And there are some people who don't believe
[00:43:19.540 --> 00:43:22.200]   that teens are becoming addicted to nicotine
[00:43:22.200 --> 00:43:25.260]   and that the levels of nicotine are not the same
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.680]   as what we're seeing in cigarettes.
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:28.000]   That's actually not the case,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.320]   and we've seen more and more studies.
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.960]   And to the question of using it as soon as they wake up,
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:35.920]   there's a study by a colleague of mine
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:38.200]   that showed in the last few years,
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:40.400]   the data are showing that teens,
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   a greater percentage of teens who use e-cigarettes
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:45.960]   are doing so in the first five minutes, awaking.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.720]   That is a sign of addiction.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:51.440]   So you wake up, maybe go to the bathroom, maybe not,
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:52.760]   and you take that hit.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:56.200]   And so, and all the national data are showing,
[00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.920]   even though initiation may go down,
[00:43:58.920 --> 00:44:02.960]   the percentage of teens who are using daily has gone up.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:06.200]   And I attribute that a lot to the type of nicotine,
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:07.720]   the salt-based nicotine,
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.520]   and to the huge amount of nicotine
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.320]   that's been on the market.
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.920]   So yes, teens are definitely feeling it.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.920]   They're definitely going through withdrawal symptoms,
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:20.700]   that feeling, shaking, the sweats,
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:24.560]   all the feelings that they need, lack of concentration.
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:26.360]   The problem is when you talk to teens,
[00:44:26.360 --> 00:44:29.600]   they think that e-cigarettes are helping with school.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.680]   And by the way, I've not heard a teen tell me
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.240]   that they started because of school reasons
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:35.960]   or concentration.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.240]   Maybe they're continuing for that reason,
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.900]   but teens have said that taking the hit
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:42.200]   makes them feel good.
[00:44:42.200 --> 00:44:44.040]   What they don't understand is it's that
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:46.540]   it makes them feel not bad, right?
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:48.600]   The withdrawal is making them feel bad,
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:50.880]   and they don't realize that that hit
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:54.920]   and that dopamine rush that they now need it,
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:58.120]   that they're going through withdrawal either way.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:44:59.680]   - I'm wondering where they're getting the money
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.160]   to pay for all this nicotine.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.120]   When I was a kid, I worked.
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:07.280]   I had mowed lawns.
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:08.960]   I had a newspaper out for a little while,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.960]   but mostly started working when I,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.720]   I think I was about 14 or so.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.160]   Coffee shop, skateboard shop,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.920]   bus tables, did that kind of thing.
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:22.240]   So I made money and I was able to use that money
[00:45:22.240 --> 00:45:23.280]   on the things that were important,
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:26.040]   music, skateboarding, and bus passes and stuff.
[00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:27.480]   That's what it was back then.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.980]   Food, et cetera.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.960]   Where are 12-year-olds getting the money to buy
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:37.480]   four or even one vape cartridge pod,
[00:45:37.480 --> 00:45:38.960]   as you called it, per day?
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.240]   I mean, someone's got to pay for this stuff.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:43.880]   I mean, unless they're stealing it,
[00:45:43.880 --> 00:45:45.600]   and I can't imagine that they're all stealing it.
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:47.040]   Where are they getting it?
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:48.580]   How are they getting it?
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:49.800]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.480]   So there's not one way.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.000]   In terms of money, I think there's questions around money
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.160]   and questions around access, right?
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:45:58.080]   And they're not necessarily the same thing.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:45:59.440]   Money, babysitting.
[00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:02.380]   The problem is when some of the newer products
[00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:05.160]   came on the market, some of them,
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:10.160]   the say 2020, 2021 products were about $1 or $2 per pod.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:13.400]   Compare that with a pack of cigarettes,
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:16.880]   which is $10 to $15, depending on the state you live in.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:18.740]   So they are cheap.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:20.380]   They're easy to get.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.460]   Now, newer ones and older ones are a few dollars more,
[00:46:23.460 --> 00:46:24.800]   but they're not that expensive.
[00:46:24.800 --> 00:46:26.100]   They started off very expensive
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.980]   when they first came on the market, but they haven't been.
[00:46:28.980 --> 00:46:30.580]   The other is the sharing.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.940]   And we used to hear about pod parties
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:36.720]   where somebody buys the device, which is more expensive,
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:39.420]   buys the device, and then you bring your own, not beer,
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.900]   bring your own pod, which is a few dollars,
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:44.500]   then you pop it in, and then you share it around.
[00:46:46.040 --> 00:46:49.740]   We've also heard stories of a few teenagers buying them
[00:46:49.740 --> 00:46:53.940]   and then selling for a few cents or a few dollars a puff.
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.020]   So meet me in the bathroom for 50 cents or a dollar.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:46:58.980]   You can have a couple of puffs.
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.540]   So I think teens are getting very creative.
[00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:02.980]   We've also seen, unfortunately,
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:06.620]   parents buying e-cigarettes for their teens.
[00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:09.500]   Well, at least they're not smoking cigarettes.
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:11.140]   That's not the right comparison.
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:14.340]   So I think they're very creative.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:16.560]   They're getting it in many, many different ways.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   I've heard students say,
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:20.000]   "I'm not using my lunch money to buy lunch.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.820]   "I'm gonna use it to buy vapes."
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.640]   There's no one way.
[00:47:24.640 --> 00:47:25.660]   There's not.
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:31.080]   And unfortunately, access is easier than it should.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.880]   By the way, one thing I think is incredibly important
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:38.000]   for people to understand is across the U.S. in 2019,
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.480]   December of 2019, the legal age to be allowed to purchase
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:46.480]   or to sell nicotine products across the U.S. has become 21.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.540]   So many people think it's still 18.
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:52.220]   So you go into a vape shop or a tobacco shop,
[00:47:52.220 --> 00:47:55.260]   and if the shop owner doesn't realize it's 21,
[00:47:55.260 --> 00:47:57.280]   they'll sell it to somebody who's 18.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:01.260]   And even if they know it's 21, they're still selling it
[00:48:01.260 --> 00:48:04.100]   because there's not enforcement right now going on.
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.260]   So we really do need the public.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.980]   We need all the parents listening.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:11.920]   We need educators, police officers to really enforce
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.960]   and regulate this age restriction
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.200]   because teens are getting them from vape shops really easily.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:19.340]   They're getting it online really easily.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:23.120]   They're buying them for each other.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:26.440]   Somebody's going and buying 10 and then reselling them
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.240]   if the person looks older.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.120]   There's not a lot of carding going on or fake cards.
[00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:34.000]   ID cards is pretty easy still to get.
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.580]   So unfortunately we have a product
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:38.980]   that is appealing to teens
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:41.540]   in a very unregulated market right now.
[00:48:41.540 --> 00:48:43.060]   The FDA is not regulating it.
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.180]   Local shops are not regulating it.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:47.780]   That it's just, it is the Wild West out there.
[00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:51.140]   - So setting aside the issue of whether or not vaping
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:56.140]   is "better" for us than smoking cigarettes,
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:49:01.020]   because that argument is a complicated one,
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:02.460]   to say the least,
[00:49:02.460 --> 00:49:07.280]   what do we know about the health hazards of vaping per se?
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:11.600]   Does it increase lung disease?
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:13.400]   Does it increase cancer rates?
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.960]   I mean, my understanding is that nicotine,
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:19.400]   the chemical, is not what causes cancer in cigarettes.
[00:49:19.400 --> 00:49:24.240]   It's the tars and other things that are consumed
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.760]   or brought into the lungs
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:29.340]   and therefore bloodstream when one smokes.
[00:49:29.340 --> 00:49:31.160]   That's not to say nicotine is safe.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:32.420]   I have to be careful here.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:35.700]   Sometimes clips get cut and people run wild
[00:49:35.700 --> 00:49:37.420]   and I'm not saying nicotine is safe,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:42.420]   but what are the problems with vaping nicotine?
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:47.500]   Even, let's just say one or two hits per day,
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:49.700]   especially in kids.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:53.580]   Are there known challenges for brain development?
[00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:55.620]   Are there known challenges for cognitive development?
[00:49:55.620 --> 00:49:59.380]   Are there known challenges for lung function?
[00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:01.060]   I mean, nicotine is a vasoconstrictor
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:02.220]   and it raises blood pressure.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:06.540]   So that's basically stress on the system, chronic stress.
[00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.360]   But what do we know about what vaping
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:13.920]   and e-cigarettes are doing to malign health?
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:18.940]   - Yeah, so first of all, start with the brain and nicotine.
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.100]   Absolutely, these high levels of nicotine,
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:24.620]   and really any nicotine, is harmful to the developing brain.
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:26.260]   And our brains continue to develop
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:29.620]   until we're around 25, 24, 26, depending,
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:32.180]   but to around 25.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:36.940]   So in that process of your brain developing,
[00:50:36.940 --> 00:50:40.660]   of your brain changing, if you introduce nicotine,
[00:50:40.660 --> 00:50:41.660]   you're changing your brain,
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:43.380]   you're changing the brain chemistry,
[00:50:43.380 --> 00:50:46.500]   and you're so much more likely to become addicted
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:49.540]   as an adolescent and a young adult.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.180]   The tobacco industry knows this.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:53.300]   I mean, that's why they target teens.
[00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:55.860]   We've noticed with cigarettes, if we target a teen,
[00:50:55.860 --> 00:50:58.260]   then we're gonna have them for life.
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:02.340]   So significantly more likely to become addicted
[00:51:02.340 --> 00:51:04.380]   because it actually rewires your brain.
[00:51:04.380 --> 00:51:07.100]   And there's plenty of evidence for that.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:10.840]   The other pieces that we're worried about is,
[00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.880]   now you're right, nicotine in terms of cancer,
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:13.800]   although I will tell you,
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:15.260]   having talked to some oncologists,
[00:51:15.260 --> 00:51:17.900]   they would say the vast amount of nicotine
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:20.300]   still worries them in terms of cancer.
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.900]   We just haven't had enough research
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.040]   on e-cigarettes to really know.
[00:51:24.040 --> 00:51:26.500]   Now you're right, e-cigarettes do not have tar,
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.500]   but e-cigarettes have aldehydes,
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.680]   and aldehydes have been linked to cancer.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:33.340]   So there's still some concern there.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:36.300]   There's some early anecdotal evidence,
[00:51:36.300 --> 00:51:37.900]   and probably some of my colleagues out there would say,
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:40.380]   no, no, there's pretty good evidence around cancer.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:42.640]   We just don't have enough body of research.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:45.040]   But again, it took 50 years
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:47.300]   to figure out cancer in cigarettes.
[00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:51.540]   We've not had the amount of e-cigarette use
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:54.980]   or that we saw with cigarettes for that long
[00:51:54.980 --> 00:51:57.740]   for that many people to really know.
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:59.620]   It's still pretty new.
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:02.900]   - I just might wanna just interject that aldehydes,
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.460]   like paraformaldehyde, formaldehyde,
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:08.580]   these are the same chemicals that we use in laboratories
[00:52:08.580 --> 00:52:12.940]   to fix, as it's called, tissues, to make those tissues firm,
[00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:14.340]   so that then they can be cut
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:16.460]   and analyzed under the microscope.
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:18.940]   Aldehydes cross-link proteins,
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:21.260]   basically change the configuration of proteins
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.260]   and turn what would otherwise be a pliable tissue
[00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:26.740]   into kind of a hard, rubbery,
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:31.180]   think of like a dense eraser-like consistency.
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:35.060]   And in other words, not the configuration most conducive
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.660]   for those cells to live and thrive,
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.260]   actually quite the opposite,
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.540]   which is why that's for sake of doing anatomy
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:45.100]   on, well, any body part,
[00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:48.400]   you use paraformaldehyde, glutaraldehyde,
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:52.780]   and formaldehyde to cross-link proteins.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.860]   It basically kills tissue by cross-linking proteins,
[00:52:55.860 --> 00:52:58.460]   taking a nice pliable configuration
[00:52:58.460 --> 00:53:02.380]   that's amenable to life and twisting the,
[00:53:02.380 --> 00:53:04.540]   or shearing the proteins, more or less,
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:05.780]   relative, cross-linking them,
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.740]   and making them nice and rigid.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:11.100]   So if that's happening in the living child,
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.060]   that can't be good.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:13.380]   - That can't be good. - That can't be good.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:15.540]   - Flugs, bloodstream, everything.
[00:53:15.540 --> 00:53:17.940]   - And all the aldehydes are carcinogens.
[00:53:17.940 --> 00:53:19.300]   - Correct. - We know they cause cancer.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:20.700]   - Right, right, and so that's why
[00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:21.900]   there's a lot of concern there.
[00:53:21.900 --> 00:53:23.940]   And when I talk to teens,
[00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:26.840]   and in our curriculum, we often say,
[00:53:26.840 --> 00:53:28.020]   because when you just say,
[00:53:28.020 --> 00:53:30.260]   and you gave a beautiful explanation of the aldehydes,
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:33.340]   but for a teenager, what I generally say is,
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.900]   if you ever dissected a,
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:36.660]   had biology and you dissect a frog,
[00:53:36.660 --> 00:53:37.700]   yes, how did it smell?
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:38.540]   It was gross.
[00:53:38.540 --> 00:53:39.860]   Well, that's what you're putting into your body
[00:53:39.860 --> 00:53:41.420]   when you're vaping,
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.400]   because that's exactly the point,
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.060]   and that kind of helps them understand it
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:45.980]   a little bit more.
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:49.580]   But there's a lot of concern around the aldehydes.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:51.800]   There's lead, there's cadmium,
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.620]   there's propylene glycol and glycerin.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:56.460]   So there's a lot of other chemicals.
[00:53:56.460 --> 00:53:59.180]   So no, we may not have the thousands of chemicals
[00:53:59.180 --> 00:54:00.420]   that we have in cigarettes,
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:02.900]   but we certainly have hundreds of chemicals
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:03.940]   in an e-cigarette.
[00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:05.820]   That's very concerning.
[00:54:05.820 --> 00:54:07.500]   So there are a lot of studies now
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:09.860]   really showing pretty significant effects
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:13.120]   of e-cigarette use on heart and lungs a lot.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:17.300]   Not only all the chemicals we've mentioned,
[00:54:17.300 --> 00:54:19.060]   but also the flavorants.
[00:54:19.060 --> 00:54:22.160]   There's cinnamon aldehyde, another aldehyde.
[00:54:22.160 --> 00:54:23.440]   There's vanillin.
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.520]   There's, what is it?
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.240]   The buttery flavor that's in there
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:31.240]   is also a lot of concern.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:33.160]   So that you're inhaling these flavors,
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:36.720]   and I often explain, you can take flavors,
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:40.080]   you can take butter and heat it to several hundred degrees
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:42.240]   and eat it, you don't burn your tongue,
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.680]   but you then take it and really inhale
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.120]   the resulting aerosol,
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.700]   and then we're seeing the lesions on the lungs.
[00:54:49.700 --> 00:54:52.740]   We're seeing young people who have been using e-cigarettes,
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:55.780]   having lung collapses, pneumonia,
[00:54:55.780 --> 00:54:59.100]   asthma amongst people who have not had seizures.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.020]   One of the teens I know who was using four pods a day
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:03.340]   was having seizures.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:06.980]   - Makes sense because nicotine is a stimulant.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:07.820]   - Yes.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:09.860]   - It can cause runaway excitability in the brain
[00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:11.880]   if too much is taken.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:16.880]   If 40 to 60% of kids are using e-cigarettes,
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.760]   and it's destructive to the lungs,
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.320]   and it sounds like the brain as well,
[00:55:22.320 --> 00:55:24.580]   where are all the young athletes?
[00:55:24.580 --> 00:55:29.160]   Are they the remaining fraction?
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.960]   - Yeah, and I should say 40 to 60
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.220]   is what schools are telling me,
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.040]   and that might just be using once in a while,
[00:55:34.040 --> 00:55:35.160]   we don't really know.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:37.860]   - But even kids just, like I had to do PE class
[00:55:37.860 --> 00:55:39.360]   when I was in high school.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:40.200]   - Yeah.
[00:55:40.200 --> 00:55:41.920]   - Yeah, we had to run a few laps.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:43.080]   I can't imagine doing that
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:47.400]   if your lungs don't function properly.
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:49.280]   - No, it is actually much harder,
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.800]   and teens will say that, and adults I know.
[00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:54.400]   I actually know an adult who said that
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:58.040]   when he went from smoking cigarettes to e-cigarettes,
[00:55:58.040 --> 00:56:00.680]   it actually was harder for him to exercise
[00:56:00.680 --> 00:56:04.360]   and to ride his bike and exercise and do other things
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:07.240]   on the e-cigarette compared to the cigarettes,
[00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:10.880]   that the impact on the lungs is so strong.
[00:56:10.880 --> 00:56:14.920]   - You're right, it is probably hurting athletics right now,
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:17.040]   where actually there are some curriculums
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.440]   on athletes and vaping, and we're building one as well,
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:21.680]   because there's a lot of concern.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.460]   And when you tell a teen,
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:26.720]   I'm worried about lung cancer in 20 years,
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.560]   ah, I don't care about 20 years from now,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:31.000]   but you would tell a teen it's harder to run,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.160]   they're more likely to listen to you.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:34.360]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:37.220]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, Waking Up.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:38.720]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:56:38.720 --> 00:56:40.800]   that offers hundreds of guided meditations,
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:43.840]   mindfulness trainings, yoga needer sessions, and more.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:46.160]   I started meditating over three decades ago.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:48.000]   And what I found in the ensuing years
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.080]   is that sometimes it was very easy for me
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:51.800]   to do my daily meditation practice.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.420]   I was just really diligent.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.200]   But then as things would get more stressful,
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:56.220]   which of course is exactly
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:58.220]   when I should have been meditating more,
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:00.400]   my meditation practice would fall off.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.940]   With Waking Up, they make it very easy to find
[00:57:02.940 --> 00:57:05.400]   and consistently use a given meditation practice.
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:07.200]   It has very convenient reminders
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:09.000]   and they come in different durations.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.440]   So even if you just have one minute
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.800]   or five minutes to meditate,
[00:57:11.800 --> 00:57:13.200]   you can still get your meditation in,
[00:57:13.200 --> 00:57:16.040]   which research shows is still highly beneficial.
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:17.840]   In addition to the many different meditations
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.140]   on the Waking Up app,
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:21.020]   they also have yoga nidra sessions,
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:23.280]   which are a form of non-sleep deep rest
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.940]   that I personally find is extremely valuable
[00:57:25.940 --> 00:57:27.920]   for restoring mental and physical vigor.
[00:57:27.920 --> 00:57:30.040]   I tend to do a yoga nidra lasting anywhere
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:32.440]   from 10 to 20 minutes, at least once a day.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.520]   And if I ever wake up in the middle of the night
[00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:35.960]   and I need to fall back asleep,
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.720]   I also find yoga nidra to be extremely useful.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.680]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:57:40.680 --> 00:57:43.680]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:45.520]   to try a free 30-day trial.
[00:57:45.520 --> 00:57:49.120]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:51.480]   We haven't talked too much about peer pressure
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:52.840]   or just social pressure.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:55.000]   I remember when I was a kid,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.840]   it was in the just say no to drugs era.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:58:01.040]   And I remember seeing the television commercials
[00:58:01.040 --> 00:58:04.640]   with the eggs, like two, like really beautiful raw eggs
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.600]   and it'd say, "This is your brain."
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.960]   And then it was just your brain on drugs
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.440]   and it was frying, you know.
[00:58:08.440 --> 00:58:12.360]   Nancy Reagan was everywhere in that time.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:14.480]   You know, just say no, just say no.
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:18.320]   In any case, there must be a lot of data
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:20.940]   indicating what messages kids respond to.
[00:58:20.940 --> 00:58:22.960]   I was told, and I don't know if this is true,
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.680]   but I was told by a researcher
[00:58:24.680 --> 00:58:30.320]   that the anti-smoking campaign that was effective in kids
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.340]   was not one that convinced them
[00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:34.340]   that smoking was bad for their health,
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:37.080]   but was one that convinced them that it was
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:40.200]   their purchasing and use of cigarettes
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:43.940]   that was making other people rich
[00:58:43.940 --> 00:58:47.540]   and then kind of demonizing those people that was effective.
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:51.720]   Kind of like show the commercials of these guys,
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:53.920]   you know, kind of cackling behind closed doors,
[00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:57.860]   you know, making fun of the people that were,
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:02.000]   in their words, you know, not bright enough to know
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.100]   that they were being taken advantage of.
[00:59:04.100 --> 00:59:07.280]   And then that set a kind of a psychological warfare
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:11.060]   between teens and these people that they perceived
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:14.400]   as taking advantage of them for money.
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:15.240]   - Right.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:17.920]   - And that that was effective in getting them to smoke less
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.040]   as opposed to telling them,
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:21.400]   "Hey, listen, smoking is really bad for your health."
[00:59:21.400 --> 00:59:22.940]   - Right, absolutely.
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:26.120]   So first of all, the just say no, not effective.
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.960]   It's saying just say no around any behavior to a teenager,
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.940]   whether it's tobacco, cannabis, cigarettes,
[00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.580]   and sex does not work.
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:38.740]   It does not work.
[00:59:38.740 --> 00:59:42.220]   And for many reasons, first of all, teens are curious.
[00:59:42.220 --> 00:59:44.980]   And when you say, just say no, why?
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:46.900]   Well, because it's bad for you.
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.580]   Well, wait a second, exactly what you're saying.
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:50.560]   Just telling me that it's bad for me,
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:52.420]   if you tell me I'm gonna get lung cancer
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:54.660]   or I'm gonna have lung disease or anything,
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:58.660]   and I tried the e-cigarette and I didn't have lung problems
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:00.940]   and instead I actually liked it,
[01:00:00.940 --> 01:00:02.040]   then we look bad.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.880]   We look like we're lying to teenagers.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.800]   And instead, what we were talking about earlier,
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:11.720]   the feeling, the rush, the flavor, the taste,
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:14.620]   the perceived and real benefits
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:18.760]   outweigh the concerns over the risks as a teenager.
[01:00:18.760 --> 01:00:22.120]   So when we say to a teen, just say no, don't,
[01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:23.440]   and they say, well, why?
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:25.800]   Well, your brain or your heart or your lungs
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.240]   or it's bad for you, they don't believe us.
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:30.940]   And we absolutely lose credibility.
[01:00:30.940 --> 01:00:32.140]   So when we talk to teens,
[01:00:32.140 --> 01:00:34.120]   and this is based on decision-making research
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:36.100]   that I've been doing for 25 years,
[01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:38.940]   we have to help teens weigh the benefits and the risk.
[01:00:38.940 --> 01:00:41.820]   Now, I don't mean that we say, hey, it's good for you
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.360]   or you're gonna like it, certainly not.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:46.820]   But if we only come from a risk model
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:50.140]   and a just say no model, that never works for teens.
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:52.440]   We need to help them understand the balance.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:56.320]   And teens know that there are good things
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:59.540]   about using some drugs, real or perceived,
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.980]   and we can't lie to them on that.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:05.740]   So that gets to then how do we have those messages?
[01:01:05.740 --> 01:01:08.300]   And you're right, if we only harp on,
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:10.380]   and our research would show this too,
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:14.700]   the long-term health risks, your brain on drugs,
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:15.860]   those kinds of things,
[01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:18.380]   that's so far in the future are the trach.
[01:01:18.380 --> 01:01:20.340]   You know, you're gonna have a trach if you smoke,
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.940]   but they're showing the 80-year-old
[01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:25.220]   and no 16-year-old even looks at somebody at that age
[01:01:25.220 --> 01:01:28.600]   or cares about somebody that's so, that other person,
[01:01:28.600 --> 01:01:30.240]   that that's a problem.
[01:01:30.240 --> 01:01:33.000]   So we need to talk about the social aspects
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.780]   that teens really care about.
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:37.060]   You may get wrinkles, although we don't know that so much
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:40.340]   with e-cigarettes, but the athletics,
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:42.280]   the things that are important to teens.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:45.400]   Now, the campaigns that you're talking about
[01:01:45.400 --> 01:01:47.540]   are really effective as well,
[01:01:47.540 --> 01:01:49.220]   particularly the mass campaign,
[01:01:49.220 --> 01:01:51.980]   which level that we see social media campaign,
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:56.140]   which is, do you realize that the industry,
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:58.940]   e-cigarettes, tobacco, nicotine, cigarette,
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.180]   whatever you wanna call it,
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.100]   is targeting you as a teenager on purpose?
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:05.000]   They want you as a smoker.
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.260]   I used to go to middle school students and say,
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.680]   before e-cigarettes, when cigarettes were of concern,
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.140]   and I love saying to young people,
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:17.140]   400,000 adults are dying each year from cigarette use.
[01:02:17.140 --> 01:02:18.980]   You're a replacement smoker.
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:21.420]   And it was great 'cause teens would get really angry
[01:02:21.420 --> 01:02:23.700]   and say, wait, this 12-year-old boy was so cute.
[01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:26.500]   Wait, I don't wanna be a replacement smoker, Dr. Bonnie.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.020]   It was a big deal to him.
[01:02:28.020 --> 01:02:30.860]   And I don't wanna give money to the industry.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.680]   And it's great.
[01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:35.160]   Channel that energy and get young people mad.
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:37.300]   That's what really worked.
[01:02:37.300 --> 01:02:40.200]   Showing that the seven dwarfs, we call it,
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:44.660]   the seven CEOs of the big tobacco companies at the time
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:48.300]   said, nicotine's not addictive, nicotine's not addictive,
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:50.220]   our cigarettes are not addictive,
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.580]   and that clearly they were lying to teens.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:56.580]   You show that to a teen and explain how nicotine is addictive
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.160]   and they knew it, but they're trying to get you.
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.460]   Works really well.
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:02.740]   And same thing with marketing.
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:04.880]   We have a whole lesson on marketing.
[01:03:04.880 --> 01:03:08.340]   Do you think that that candy was for me
[01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.060]   as a middle-aged adult?
[01:03:10.060 --> 01:03:10.980]   It's for you.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:14.100]   And that gets them mad 'cause they don't wanna be duped.
[01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:15.700]   They don't wanna be targeted.
[01:03:15.700 --> 01:03:17.820]   That is a much better message.
[01:03:17.820 --> 01:03:19.980]   Now, we still have to tell them about the health risks.
[01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:20.820]   We absolutely do.
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:22.220]   They still need the knowledge.
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:23.900]   They still need to understand
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:25.900]   what they're doing is unhealthy.
[01:03:25.900 --> 01:03:27.980]   But we can't do it in a lecturing way
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.800]   and we can't do it in a way that makes them feel stupid.
[01:03:30.800 --> 01:03:33.460]   We can't tell them their brains are developing 'til 25
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:34.980]   and therefore they're dumb.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:38.140]   Our lessons on talking about brain are more like,
[01:03:38.140 --> 01:03:40.780]   it's really cool that you're developing.
[01:03:40.780 --> 01:03:42.820]   It's why you can do dance.
[01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.220]   That's why you can sing better.
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.380]   You can learn language.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:48.140]   There's so much that you could do that's really cool
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:52.100]   that I can't do right now, but because of that,
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:54.780]   that's why you're so much more likely to become addicted
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:56.960]   and the industry knew that.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.540]   That's why they're targeting you.
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:01.540]   Those are the messages that work a lot better for teens.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.660]   - Sounds like the key is to never undervalue
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:07.340]   the spirit of defiance in youth
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:09.820]   and perhaps to wager it
[01:04:09.820 --> 01:04:13.900]   against these clearly destructive behaviors.
[01:04:13.900 --> 01:04:16.900]   To be honest, I'm shocked that there's so much
[01:04:16.900 --> 01:04:19.060]   vape use and e-cigarette use.
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:21.300]   These numbers are staggering.
[01:04:21.300 --> 01:04:24.340]   Maybe we could weave in a discussion about cannabis.
[01:04:24.340 --> 01:04:26.580]   I did an episode about cannabis.
[01:04:26.580 --> 01:04:28.780]   The landscape around cannabis has changed so much
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:30.560]   since I was a kid.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:35.300]   It was highly illegal, at least where I grew up.
[01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:39.340]   Now I think it's been decriminalized certain places,
[01:04:39.340 --> 01:04:40.820]   still illegal elsewhere.
[01:04:40.820 --> 01:04:42.620]   I don't want anyone getting in trouble
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.420]   as a consequence of not understanding
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:50.420]   the laws in their area and outright legal,
[01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:53.060]   pretty easy to get in a lot of the country.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:57.900]   And it's not clear that at least with individual use
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:02.460]   that it's being punished nearly as frequently
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:03.580]   as it used to be.
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:08.580]   So the 10 word summary of the cannabis thing
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:14.380]   is that the ratio of THC to CBD is important.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.620]   It is true that a lot of cannabis has much,
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:19.540]   much higher levels of THC now than in the past.
[01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:22.660]   Although I'm told that high THC level cannabis
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:26.740]   always existed, but it seems to be the concentration
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:30.860]   of THC that is of, let's just say concern,
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:34.700]   as it relates to the potential development of psychosis.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:39.180]   If there's a predisposition in terms of the,
[01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:42.500]   how addictive the cannabis is and so on and so forth.
[01:05:42.500 --> 01:05:44.700]   Which is not to say that CBD is totally innocuous,
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:47.140]   but it seems to be like the THC concentration
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:50.180]   is the kind of the thing that to mainly focus on.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:54.300]   So what do we know about cannabis in here?
[01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:56.300]   We're going to assume cannabis with a reasonable
[01:05:56.300 --> 01:05:58.700]   to high level of THC in it.
[01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:00.700]   So not pure CBD.
[01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:05.700]   What do we know about vaping and e-cig use
[01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.700]   of cannabis specifically?
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.300]   Is it true that youth that are taking nicotine
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:14.940]   by way of vape or e-cigarette then transition
[01:06:14.940 --> 01:06:15.940]   into using cannabis?
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:18.340]   Is it sort of a gateway into cannabis use?
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:23.340]   And how prevalent is cannabis use in kids aged 10 to 21?
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.940]   - First of all, you're right.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:29.060]   I mean, THC levels we're seeing today's joint
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.740]   is about 10 joints when I was a teen.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:35.820]   So the dramatic increases in the potency right now
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:37.100]   that we're seeing around THC.
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:38.460]   And then you get something like dabbing,
[01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:42.660]   which is about 80% THC versus 20 to 30%
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:46.020]   of the more mainstream products that we have in the market.
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:50.900]   When I say mainstream, I mean like joints or e-cigarettes.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:52.980]   So the potency has gone up dramatically
[01:06:52.980 --> 01:06:54.460]   and it is of concern.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:56.380]   So depending on the study,
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:59.940]   you're going to see anywhere from 10 to 20% of teens
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.220]   is saying that they're using some form of cannabis,
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:06.940]   either smoked or in the form of a joint or a blunt.
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:09.420]   And for those who don't know a blunt,
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:11.780]   a lot of people don't realize is a combination
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:14.540]   of both tobacco and cannabis.
[01:07:14.540 --> 01:07:18.420]   So it's a cigar leaf, or some people buy a cigar
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:21.660]   and pull out the tobacco and put in the cannabis,
[01:07:21.660 --> 01:07:23.620]   or they'll just get the cigar leaf
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.100]   and roll the cannabis flower.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:28.140]   Then you're getting both the kind of the double whammy
[01:07:28.140 --> 01:07:32.620]   and the chaser, the high of both of nicotine and THC.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.220]   So we're seeing a fair number of...
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:37.740]   It's interesting, even though teens are not smoking cigarettes,
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.140]   they're still using joints, which is interesting.
[01:07:41.140 --> 01:07:45.260]   But very quickly increasing is e-cigarettes
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:47.940]   with cannabis in there.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:52.060]   You can buy a cannabis style e-cigarettes
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:53.580]   and that's been around for a long time
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:58.420]   with volcano vaporizers and specific cannabis vaporizers.
[01:07:58.420 --> 01:08:02.540]   That's not new, but it's become much, much more popular.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:07.540]   But now we're also seeing teens buy a nicotine e-cigarette,
[01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:12.620]   inhale half of it, and then add the cannabis wax
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.380]   or oil to it, and then basically get the combination.
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:20.540]   I had one young teenager, probably 12, 13, 14 year old
[01:08:20.540 --> 01:08:25.060]   young man who said, "Yeah, I got a cherry nicotine vape
[01:08:25.060 --> 01:08:27.300]   and I inhaled half of it."
[01:08:27.300 --> 01:08:30.140]   Probably didn't use the word inhale, but I used half of it.
[01:08:30.140 --> 01:08:32.940]   And then I added in some cannabis oil
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:37.940]   and now I had a cherry flavored cannabis nicotine device.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:39.700]   So we're seeing that more and more.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:42.100]   And even though you're not technically supposed to
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.860]   when the manufacturers of nicotine e-cigarettes will say,
[01:08:44.860 --> 01:08:47.180]   "Don't open them and add stuff."
[01:08:47.180 --> 01:08:50.740]   A simple YouTube video will teach you how to do it.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.460]   And unfortunately the videos are not using gloves
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:56.180]   and benzoic acid is covering your skin and things like that.
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:57.020]   - Which is bad for...
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:57.860]   - Which is bad.
[01:08:57.860 --> 01:08:58.700]   - Does it go transdermally?
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:08:59.700]   Does it go through the skin?
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:01.820]   - It supposedly it does, yeah.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:05.300]   - But if the benzoic acid is going transdermally,
[01:09:05.300 --> 01:09:08.020]   presumably when one inhales off one of these pods,
[01:09:08.020 --> 01:09:10.060]   they're also bringing benzoic acid into the lungs.
[01:09:10.060 --> 01:09:10.900]   - Correct.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:13.020]   - And hopefully people realize this
[01:09:13.020 --> 01:09:15.140]   from our episodes on breathing, but if not,
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:17.580]   I'll just make it clear now that when you breathe in
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:22.080]   a substance, an airborne substance into your lungs,
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.980]   because of the interface between the vasculature,
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:27.700]   the blood supply and the lungs,
[01:09:27.700 --> 01:09:30.220]   I mean, basically things pass from the lungs
[01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.500]   into the blood supply very, very readily.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.340]   - Very quickly.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:36.200]   - And then if those things are able,
[01:09:36.200 --> 01:09:37.780]   they'll cross the blood brain barrier.
[01:09:37.780 --> 01:09:38.900]   - Correct, correct.
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:40.860]   And it only takes about seven to 10 seconds
[01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:42.980]   to go through the whole system and into the brain too.
[01:09:42.980 --> 01:09:46.060]   So it's a very fast process.
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:49.260]   So yes, so teenagers are definitely vaping
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:52.500]   or using cannabis e-cigarettes.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:56.900]   And the problem is, for one,
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.140]   teens will think it's healthier than,
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:00.820]   just like nicotine e-cigarettes,
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.140]   they think it's healthier than combustible.
[01:10:03.140 --> 01:10:04.980]   I mean, yes, you're not burning it,
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:08.300]   but you're still inhaling and you still are inhaling.
[01:10:08.300 --> 01:10:11.020]   There seems to be the propylene glycol, the glycerin,
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.500]   the flavorants, all the aldehydes,
[01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   even if it's just a cannabis e-cigarette.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.180]   So there's a lot of concern there.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:21.900]   And then addiction is still huge.
[01:10:21.900 --> 01:10:24.820]   It's a huge issue when you're talking about cannabis.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.660]   The same reasons that we talked about with nicotine,
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.660]   the brain development and so on.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:35.500]   Psychosis, just a lot to think about here, psychosis.
[01:10:35.500 --> 01:10:37.220]   There's actually some scientists now
[01:10:37.220 --> 01:10:41.860]   who are really strongly saying it's not associated as causal.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:45.660]   That if you are predetermined to have a mental health issue,
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:47.740]   psychosis, schizophrenia,
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:51.180]   then starting to use or using cannabis
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:55.860]   can actually trigger and cause you to become psychotic.
[01:10:55.860 --> 01:10:57.860]   I don't totally understand the mechanism yet.
[01:10:57.860 --> 01:10:59.940]   I don't think we totally do yet,
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.060]   but that there seems to be more than just,
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.260]   eh, it might happen.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.500]   And it seems to be right in that
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:08.340]   older adolescent, young adult timeframe
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.660]   that it is happening.
[01:11:09.660 --> 01:11:12.780]   So around the same time that the brain's developing
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:15.220]   and we're hardwiring the rest of our brain,
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.780]   that that change is happening
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:20.260]   from a neuronal connection perspective.
[01:11:21.140 --> 01:11:22.740]   - My understanding, sorry to interrupt,
[01:11:22.740 --> 01:11:25.700]   but my understanding is that, indeed,
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:30.060]   the use of high THC cannabis in youth,
[01:11:30.060 --> 01:11:33.820]   in particular male youth, predisposes,
[01:11:33.820 --> 01:11:35.860]   and you're saying might even be causal,
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:39.100]   toward the development of psychotic symptoms
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.700]   in late teens, early 20s.
[01:11:41.700 --> 01:11:44.220]   And that some of those cases
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:48.500]   are ones in which the psychosis is irreversible.
[01:11:48.500 --> 01:11:49.820]   - Correct.
[01:11:49.820 --> 01:11:52.980]   - Is it sometimes the case that
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.580]   somebody exhibits psychotic symptoms
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.060]   as the consequence of using THC
[01:11:58.060 --> 01:12:00.700]   and the psychotic symptoms resolve?
[01:12:00.700 --> 01:12:03.460]   Or is it some sort of circuit switch
[01:12:03.460 --> 01:12:04.900]   that is then permanent?
[01:12:04.900 --> 01:12:05.740]   - You know, it's a good question.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.700]   I honestly don't really know the answer to that,
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:09.500]   of what percentage.
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:13.580]   The few cases I know of in talking to the psychiatrist
[01:12:13.580 --> 01:12:16.060]   would say that it's causal and it may be permanent.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:18.780]   Now, it could be managed.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:21.100]   It doesn't mean that somebody is going to be having
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.060]   psychotic episodes all the time.
[01:12:23.060 --> 01:12:24.580]   I mean, it certainly can be managed,
[01:12:24.580 --> 01:12:25.540]   and certainly we would say,
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:28.980]   please don't continue to use, would be very important.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:30.500]   But whether it's completely reversible
[01:12:30.500 --> 01:12:32.420]   is something that I'm not sure of.
[01:12:32.420 --> 01:12:34.180]   Somebody more versed in this.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:37.380]   But what you do in your research,
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.020]   and what I know is,
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.580]   changes to the neural circuitry is not changeable.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:46.740]   You know, when we hurt our brain cells,
[01:12:46.740 --> 01:12:48.860]   that is not something that we could recover from.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.660]   So that is very much concerning.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.100]   - Yeah, as adults,
[01:12:52.100 --> 01:12:55.780]   there are very few new neurons added to the brain.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:12:58.780]   There is significant plasticity and recovery of function
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:03.340]   in some cases, both by virtue of traumatic brain injury.
[01:13:03.340 --> 01:13:06.900]   Certainly people can get over certain behavioral patterns,
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:10.580]   and that no doubt involves plasticity, but it takes work.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:13.780]   And when it comes to addiction,
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:15.700]   there's evidence that some of the reward circuitry
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:17.700]   can adjust, but again,
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:21.620]   it takes adherence to specific things
[01:13:21.620 --> 01:13:23.380]   in order to make that happen.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.140]   I'm very concerned about this
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:28.340]   potentially causal relationship,
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:30.940]   but certainly correlation between
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:35.660]   high THC-containing cannabis and psychosis,
[01:13:35.660 --> 01:13:39.060]   mostly because we already have a serious problem
[01:13:39.060 --> 01:13:40.300]   with psychosis on the planet.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:42.020]   A lot of people don't realize that, you know,
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:44.700]   approximately 1% of the world's population
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:46.820]   has schizophrenia.
[01:13:46.820 --> 01:13:47.660]   And by the way,
[01:13:47.660 --> 01:13:48.940]   I have to be careful with the language nowadays,
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:51.340]   you know, has schizophrenia or is schizophrenic
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:52.980]   or all that language gets murky,
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:56.340]   but meet the diagnostic criteria for schizophrenia,
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:57.940]   I think is a safe way to put it.
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:03.340]   So if one is then adding to that number of people exhibiting
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:05.580]   and suffering from psychotic symptoms
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.140]   that prevent them from having functional work lives,
[01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:11.940]   et cetera, that's an issue.
[01:14:11.940 --> 01:14:16.540]   - How difficult is it for these adolescents and teens
[01:14:16.540 --> 01:14:21.420]   to quit vaping and e-cigarettes and cannabis?
[01:14:21.420 --> 01:14:25.540]   I mean, can they quit just by deciding?
[01:14:25.540 --> 01:14:26.500]   Are there programs?
[01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:30.220]   Are they all going into, you know, recovery programs?
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:32.460]   Are there recovery programs in schools?
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:35.260]   I mean, how successful are they in stopping?
[01:14:35.260 --> 01:14:38.220]   - It's really difficult.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.620]   And maybe I'll talk about nicotine first,
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.540]   and the same would be true for cannabis,
[01:14:42.540 --> 01:14:43.820]   but a little bit less extent.
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:45.140]   I mean, both are addictive.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:46.180]   And interestingly,
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:48.620]   not a lot of people realize that cannabis is addictive
[01:14:48.620 --> 01:14:52.300]   and about one in six teens or people who are using,
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.740]   particularly under the age of 25, do become addicted.
[01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:56.540]   - They don't realize that it's addictive.
[01:14:56.540 --> 01:14:57.740]   - They don't realize it's addictive.
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:02.300]   - The argument I often heard was it's not as bad as alcohol,
[01:15:02.300 --> 01:15:05.420]   which is a kind of a lame argument.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:07.220]   I understand why people default to that,
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.860]   but I mean, getting hit by a car
[01:15:09.860 --> 01:15:12.820]   might not be as bad as getting hit by a train,
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:16.740]   but I wouldn't even look at that analogy as accurate.
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:19.260]   There's just different levels of destructive,
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:20.940]   different types of destructive.
[01:15:20.940 --> 01:15:26.420]   Yeah, these not as bad as blank
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.900]   doesn't really seem to work.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.740]   - No, no.
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.660]   And, you know, I often say,
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.860]   people say, "Well, why'd you start studying tobacco?"
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:36.780]   I mean, there is no safe level of tobacco use, period.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:39.020]   - Yes, we have very few 30-year-olds
[01:15:39.020 --> 01:15:41.980]   who suddenly pick up a cigarette and become addicted.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:45.580]   You know, at that point, your development of your brain...
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:47.460]   Now, if you use regularly,
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:49.620]   are you still gonna hurt your lungs and heart
[01:15:49.620 --> 01:15:50.460]   and stuff like that?
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.420]   Absolutely.
[01:15:51.420 --> 01:15:54.780]   The brain changes may not be there in the same way,
[01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:56.900]   but most people don't pick up a cigarette
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:59.980]   or any cigarette for the very first time in their 30s
[01:15:59.980 --> 01:16:01.500]   or 40s and on.
[01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:03.860]   So, absolutely, it's addictive
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:09.060]   and it is probably the most difficult-to-quit drug
[01:16:09.060 --> 01:16:09.900]   that's out there.
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:11.500]   Whereas alcohol, we don't see.
[01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:13.180]   I mean, yes, we have alcoholism.
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:14.380]   I'm not downplaying that.
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.980]   It's a huge issue in this country.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.900]   It's a huge issue on this planet,
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:21.500]   but you're not gonna have people in two weeks, three weeks,
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.380]   suddenly say, "I'm addicted to alcohol."
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.780]   You are going to with nicotine
[01:16:25.780 --> 01:16:28.620]   and you are with cannabis to some extent as well.
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:33.540]   So, yes, nicotine is incredibly addictive
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:37.620]   and we have so many teens who are addicted to nicotine
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:41.260]   through e-cigarettes and really struggling to get off of it.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:43.860]   I gave a talk recently to a group of parents
[01:16:43.860 --> 01:16:46.180]   and they said, "This is all great information, Bonnie,
[01:16:46.180 --> 01:16:49.180]   "but how do I help my kid?"
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:50.460]   And I just felt awful
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:52.980]   because there's not a lot that we have.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.980]   So, taking a few different things.
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.860]   First of all, we don't have, there are some programs,
[01:16:58.860 --> 01:17:01.100]   there are inpatient programs, absolutely,
[01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:03.020]   showing some positive. - Inpatient programs.
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:04.820]   - There are actually some inpatient programs.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:06.500]   - But those are gonna be expensive or require
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:08.820]   that people have insurance that will cover that.
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:10.620]   - Absolutely, and they take weeks.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:12.220]   And then you're taking a young person
[01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.940]   out of their natural environment,
[01:17:13.940 --> 01:17:17.460]   out of their school, out of their friends, stigmatizing,
[01:17:17.460 --> 01:17:20.460]   which hopefully we're not stigmatizing drug use anyway,
[01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:24.140]   but you take a young person at 12, 14, 16,
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:25.740]   you put them in another place,
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:27.420]   that's very difficult on them.
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:29.780]   And if part of why they're using in the first place
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:31.900]   is stress, you're just enhancing that.
[01:17:32.900 --> 01:17:36.980]   Outpatient programs, we have some things,
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:40.380]   but the problem is we don't have the best recommendations
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.420]   because we don't have great research.
[01:17:42.420 --> 01:17:46.460]   So, for example, nicotine replacement therapy, the patch.
[01:17:46.460 --> 01:17:50.460]   First of all, it's not authorized for use by the FDA,
[01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:54.180]   it's not been approved by the FDA for anybody under 18.
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.900]   And yet we have a lot of teenagers who are addicted.
[01:17:57.900 --> 01:17:59.500]   We just don't have the right studies
[01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:02.420]   and they haven't gone to the FDA for that approval.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:06.260]   Now, a lot of doctors are using nicotine patches
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:08.220]   and prescribing them for somebody under 18.
[01:18:08.220 --> 01:18:11.020]   It's considered off-label, but you still can do it.
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:13.500]   And most people would recommend it.
[01:18:13.500 --> 01:18:16.300]   The problem is, and I don't mean problem with using them,
[01:18:16.300 --> 01:18:19.660]   I have no problem with, and I've often suggested to,
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:21.500]   I don't treat, I wanna make sure
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:23.100]   that I'm not misquoted there either,
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:25.780]   I don't directly treat and see patients myself.
[01:18:25.780 --> 01:18:27.060]   But based on the evidence
[01:18:27.060 --> 01:18:29.820]   and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations,
[01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:33.260]   we should be using a patch with those under 18.
[01:18:33.260 --> 01:18:35.780]   But then the question is, how much?
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:40.660]   If a nicotine patch is about 21 milligrams of nicotine
[01:18:40.660 --> 01:18:44.540]   and a teenager's using 40 milligrams in a day,
[01:18:44.540 --> 01:18:45.900]   do you give two patches?
[01:18:45.900 --> 01:18:49.500]   And I've had some doctors say, "Wow, that's a lot of nicotine."
[01:18:49.500 --> 01:18:52.860]   I say, "Well, they're using a lot of nicotine."
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:55.740]   What I've heard some of my adolescent medicine colleagues
[01:18:55.740 --> 01:18:58.220]   have suggested is one patch and then supplement
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:02.260]   with gums and suckers and lozenges, not as a starting.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:03.820]   I don't mean like what we're seeing
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:07.660]   with some pouches out there, like Xen, as a starter.
[01:19:07.660 --> 01:19:11.540]   I don't mean that, I mean as a form of treatment.
[01:19:11.540 --> 01:19:12.900]   - As a way to wean them off?
[01:19:12.900 --> 01:19:14.740]   So reducing the dosage over time?
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:16.100]   - Correct, correct.
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:21.940]   But then they also don't have the hand-to-mouth piece
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:23.380]   that we see that is difficult.
[01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:27.420]   So gum, in this case, I mean non-nicotine gum,
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.820]   just chewing regular gum.
[01:19:29.820 --> 01:19:32.540]   I've heard teenagers say that their withdrawal
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:33.820]   lasts three to four minutes.
[01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:35.500]   So they have a, one teenager said,
[01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.100]   "I have a playlist on my phone
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:39.940]   "that's each song is three to four minutes.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:41.380]   "And when I start to feel the withdrawal,
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.660]   "I pop the music in my ears and I go do something
[01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:45.660]   "and I listen to the song.
[01:19:45.660 --> 01:19:48.820]   "And by then that uncomfortable feeling is over."
[01:19:48.820 --> 01:19:51.220]   I've heard teens say that they'll run,
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.940]   that there's many different things that they'll do.
[01:19:53.940 --> 01:19:57.420]   Chewing on a toothpick, not a nicotine toothpick,
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.780]   but it's just a toothpick.
[01:19:58.780 --> 01:20:03.500]   Other ways to really get their mind off of that feeling
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:05.300]   is really important.
[01:20:05.300 --> 01:20:08.620]   But we also have to know with adults and cigarettes,
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:11.220]   it can take seven to 11 tries.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:14.380]   So we can't expect, until they're fully off of a cigarette,
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:17.540]   can't expect a teenager to quit overnight.
[01:20:17.540 --> 01:20:18.980]   - Especially with the social pressure.
[01:20:18.980 --> 01:20:20.220]   And again, sorry to interrupt, but I think that--
[01:20:20.220 --> 01:20:21.420]   - No, no, no.
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:25.420]   - The seven to 11 tries, I did an episode on nicotine
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:26.820]   and I talked about smoking a bit.
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:28.860]   And most people fail.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.700]   - Most people fail.
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:31.140]   - They relapse.
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.500]   It's very, very difficult to quit smoking.
[01:20:33.500 --> 01:20:34.940]   People that do it and stick to it
[01:20:34.940 --> 01:20:37.220]   are real heroes of the process.
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:38.700]   It's not easy.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:43.740]   But that's with a heavy incentive.
[01:20:43.740 --> 01:20:48.140]   Immediate health issues, sometimes it's financial, et cetera.
[01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:49.940]   With kids, it feels like all the pressures
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:51.900]   are pushing in the opposite direction
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:54.100]   'cause it's socially rewarded.
[01:20:54.100 --> 01:20:57.320]   They get that elevation of mood and focus.
[01:20:57.320 --> 01:21:02.320]   And there's just oh so much driving them to continue using.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:04.060]   - Absolutely right.
[01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.740]   One of the things that we do in our program
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:08.940]   to help teens quit is we talk about social withdrawal.
[01:21:08.940 --> 01:21:10.180]   And it was actually one of our,
[01:21:10.180 --> 01:21:14.340]   we have a wonderful group of 40 youth who work with us.
[01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:15.740]   We call it our Youth Action Board,
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:18.220]   our YAB, our Reach Lab YAB.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:20.700]   Our YABs say that we need to talk about social withdrawal,
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:22.460]   not just physical because of exactly
[01:21:22.460 --> 01:21:23.420]   what you're talking about.
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:25.140]   They may not be able to go to that party
[01:21:25.140 --> 01:21:27.420]   on a Saturday night where they know
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.180]   their friends are vaping because it'll,
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:32.220]   and we know the brain cues up,
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.980]   that they'll see or smell or witness somebody
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:38.460]   using an e-cigarette and those cues will happen
[01:21:38.460 --> 01:21:39.800]   and they'll wanna use it.
[01:21:39.800 --> 01:21:42.020]   So they actually have to isolate themselves
[01:21:42.020 --> 01:21:44.080]   from their friend group who is using.
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:45.900]   So it's very difficult.
[01:21:45.900 --> 01:21:48.340]   So really setting up your social milieu,
[01:21:48.340 --> 01:21:51.820]   really setting up your friends who are not using,
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:55.700]   really trying to talk and have your family around you.
[01:21:55.700 --> 01:21:58.300]   And I really tell parents it's not the time
[01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:00.500]   to get pissed off with your kids for using,
[01:22:00.500 --> 01:22:02.300]   it's the time to really help them.
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:04.100]   Let's be in this together.
[01:22:04.100 --> 01:22:06.580]   And often I say the reason why they're using
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:07.420]   is that their fault.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:09.300]   Let's go back to the beginning of our conversation
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:12.980]   about marketing and that they're being targeted.
[01:22:12.980 --> 01:22:15.520]   And teens didn't even know what was hitting them,
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.820]   what was going on.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:21.200]   So let's not be mad at them, let's be sympathetic and help.
[01:22:21.200 --> 01:22:24.160]   So they need the combination of nicotine replacement,
[01:22:24.160 --> 01:22:25.760]   they need to change their milieu,
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:28.760]   they need to have healthy snacks and water
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:31.600]   and exercise and all kinds of things around them.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:34.140]   And they may also need cognitive behavioral therapy
[01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.240]   or some other therapy to really get them.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.480]   It's not gonna be a one stop.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:39.600]   We need to work with them.
[01:22:39.600 --> 01:22:41.280]   And that's the same with cannabis, by the way.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:44.520]   This is just anti-drugs and just feels so bad.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:47.240]   It is such a problem right now.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:48.960]   When we built our curriculums,
[01:22:48.960 --> 01:22:52.120]   same thing I said I was doing middle and high school
[01:22:52.120 --> 01:22:53.780]   and never thought I'd do elementary
[01:22:53.780 --> 01:22:55.820]   and we have an elementary curriculum.
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:22:58.080]   I thought I was only gonna do prevention.
[01:22:58.080 --> 01:23:01.280]   We now have intervention and moving towards cessation.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.380]   That's how many young people are just struggling right now.
[01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.480]   - When I was in high school,
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:10.800]   there seemed to be a phenomenon of certain behaviors
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.920]   allowed kids to have some social clout
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:18.120]   by virtue of, I guess they used to call it holding.
[01:23:18.120 --> 01:23:21.280]   Like if someone had weed or if somebody,
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:24.000]   yeah, if they had weed,
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.640]   then it sort of gave them a position
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:27.960]   in the social structure.
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:31.760]   Oftentimes the kids that,
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.160]   you know, I mean, I was friendly
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:35.360]   and knew most people in my high school class.
[01:23:35.360 --> 01:23:39.520]   You know, and a few of them were kind of like
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.320]   less socially engaged than others.
[01:23:41.320 --> 01:23:43.820]   But then at some point, midway through high school,
[01:23:43.820 --> 01:23:44.680]   one of them was like,
[01:23:44.680 --> 01:23:46.880]   start showing up with weed at parties or something.
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:49.180]   And suddenly like they had like a social clout.
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:52.760]   It was kind of interesting to see how, you know,
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:23:56.760]   having paraphernalia, having nicotine or cannabis
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:23:57.640]   or whatever it is,
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.680]   is sort of, I think has long been a kind of like an instant
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:08.040]   sort of route to inserting oneself into a social structure,
[01:24:08.460 --> 01:24:10.300]   which is obviously unhealthy.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:12.380]   I'm not promoting this.
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:13.860]   And then it is social, right?
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.940]   That there's sort of an instant substrate for communication.
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.100]   When I was growing up, I worked at a skateboard shop
[01:24:19.100 --> 01:24:21.020]   and on my break, I would go behind the shop.
[01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.420]   There's a little alley there, we'd skateboard.
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:23.780]   There's this little bump.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.360]   But occasionally like employees would share a cigarette
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:30.180]   or you'd ask someone for a cigarette.
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.840]   This was kind of a way of bridging social gaps.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:40.180]   So again, I feel like it's so hard to be a teenager.
[01:24:40.180 --> 01:24:43.100]   There's so much going on internally and externally.
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:45.420]   And everything you're talking about, you know,
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:48.260]   in terms of the negative health effects, the paraphernalia,
[01:24:48.260 --> 01:24:49.620]   the marketing, the taste,
[01:24:49.620 --> 01:24:52.640]   the addictive qualities of it, et cetera,
[01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:55.860]   just start to pile on all these challenges
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.220]   to staying away from it.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:25:02.860]   But a big one seems to be the kind of instant social cred
[01:25:02.860 --> 01:25:05.700]   that one gets when they participate in something
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.300]   that other people are participating in.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:09.260]   Because for instance, like a sport,
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:10.580]   there's a pickup basketball game.
[01:25:10.580 --> 01:25:14.340]   You have to play reasonably well to get into the game.
[01:25:14.340 --> 01:25:16.500]   Otherwise, it's not gonna be easy
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.540]   or you have to be very bold, right?
[01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:21.060]   So unless you're engaged in a sport,
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.740]   you're in theater, you're doing other things,
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:25.100]   it's sort of an instant route.
[01:25:25.100 --> 01:25:27.220]   Okay, I think I've made my point.
[01:25:27.220 --> 01:25:30.140]   Is there anything about that,
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:32.380]   that by way of understanding,
[01:25:32.380 --> 01:25:35.860]   can help create like replacement behaviors?
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.300]   I mean, it's gonna be hard to take a kid
[01:25:37.300 --> 01:25:40.080]   whose entire life is hanging out with their friends
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.580]   and vaping cannabis or nicotine after school
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.260]   and hanging around and playing on their phone
[01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:45.100]   and saying, "Hey, listen,
[01:25:45.100 --> 01:25:46.920]   "you're gonna quit vaping nicotine.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:48.820]   "You're gonna feel worse.
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:50.740]   "Your friends are all gonna be doing it
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.180]   "and you'll still be their friend,
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:54.500]   "but you're not really part of it."
[01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:56.680]   It's almost like you have to create a culture of quitting
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:58.780]   before this can really go the other direction.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:26:02.700]   - You do and what you're saying is so correct
[01:26:02.700 --> 01:26:05.940]   and so relevant and why I feel so bad for teens right now.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:07.780]   And the social media, right?
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:09.500]   You put that in there as well
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.300]   and it's all over the place right now with them.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:14.700]   They're bombarded by all of the different factors
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:16.260]   that you talked about.
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.140]   And it was interesting,
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:20.180]   we were talking about earlier around the social aspects too.
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:23.140]   I was thinking there was a point where it was so cool,
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:23.980]   particularly around Joel,
[01:26:23.980 --> 01:26:26.620]   it was so cool to Joel that I had teens come up to me
[01:26:26.620 --> 01:26:30.380]   and say, "Dr. Bonnie, do you have a fake e-cigarette?"
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.300]   And I said, "A fake e-cigarette?
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:34.540]   "Well, yeah, all my friends are using
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:37.540]   "and I don't want to, but I wanna fake it."
[01:26:37.540 --> 01:26:39.380]   And I just felt so bad.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:42.040]   And I said, "Well, I'm not gonna get you a fake e-cigarette,
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:44.180]   "but I will help you with refusal skills
[01:26:44.180 --> 01:26:46.140]   "and teach you how to say no,
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:47.860]   "but in this case, not just say no,
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:50.640]   "but teach you how to feel good about saying no
[01:26:50.640 --> 01:26:53.660]   "to certain things that you don't wanna be doing."
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:55.300]   And during that time,
[01:26:55.300 --> 01:26:58.420]   it was very difficult for teens to come up and say,
[01:26:58.420 --> 01:27:00.920]   "I either wanna quit or I don't wanna be a user,
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:03.960]   "I just don't wanna start," because that was not cool.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.660]   I think we've changed in the last couple years, thankfully.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:10.400]   I think there are more teens who are not using,
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:13.060]   who are open to it or who are open to quitting,
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:15.580]   a lot of teens wanna quit right now.
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:18.180]   So thankfully, we're in a new era where this,
[01:27:18.180 --> 01:27:21.940]   yes, the pressures to use are absolutely there,
[01:27:21.940 --> 01:27:23.900]   but there's starting to be a tide change
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:25.180]   where we're getting more teens
[01:27:25.180 --> 01:27:27.500]   who are getting on the so-called bandwagon
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.160]   to either quit or not use.
[01:27:29.160 --> 01:27:31.500]   I think the social supports are being there
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.480]   a lot more than we've ever seen before.
[01:27:33.480 --> 01:27:36.280]   We have more youth groups who are getting on board
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.040]   of either trying to help quit
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.800]   or trying to make sure that it's okay not to use.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.860]   It's still hard and what you're talking about,
[01:27:43.860 --> 01:27:46.840]   so it's our job as adults and healthcare providers
[01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:48.780]   and community partners and educators
[01:27:48.780 --> 01:27:50.300]   to really talk to young people
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:52.260]   to set up those social groups
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:55.540]   and say, "It's okay not to use.
[01:27:55.540 --> 01:27:57.680]   "It's okay to come on over to this group
[01:27:57.680 --> 01:28:00.220]   "and yeah, maybe you're not gonna be
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:02.660]   "with that same social group on Saturday night.
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:05.020]   "Let's start a new social group for you."
[01:28:05.020 --> 01:28:06.340]   I'm not saying it's easy.
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:09.460]   This is not easy for young people and it's not easy.
[01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:11.420]   Parents are struggling too.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:14.700]   They're struggling to know how to talk to their teenagers,
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.740]   but this is what we have to work towards
[01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:19.740]   and setting up those social networks of,
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.440]   it's cool not to use.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:23.700]   One of the other things, by the way,
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:26.060]   that we talk about is the environment.
[01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:29.380]   When we talk to teens about not using
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.980]   and why it's bad for them, heart, lungs, et cetera,
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:33.900]   and all the things and being duped
[01:28:33.900 --> 01:28:37.040]   and be marketed to and the money,
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.080]   the environment piece has also been interesting.
[01:28:40.080 --> 01:28:43.500]   Teens right now may not care about their hearts,
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:45.340]   their lungs 20 years from now.
[01:28:45.340 --> 01:28:46.820]   They care about the environment
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:49.900]   and there are environmental aspects to these,
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:52.900]   the plastics, the pods don't disappear,
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.820]   the benzoic acid does not evaporate
[01:28:55.820 --> 01:28:59.700]   and we've got secondhand vapor, secondhand smoke,
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.860]   secondhand and thirdhand.
[01:29:01.860 --> 01:29:03.940]   So what I mean by that is if I were to use
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:07.260]   an e-cigarette near you, you would actually get
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:09.940]   a lot of the volatile organic chemicals,
[01:29:09.940 --> 01:29:12.260]   a lot of the nicotine is in the air.
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.980]   Actually, some studies suggest COVID
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:15.700]   might even be in those droplets.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.060]   There's a lot of issues there.
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:21.060]   And then thirdhand is it just doesn't dissipate.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:23.460]   That vapor, aerosol, it's not a vapor,
[01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:26.500]   that aerosol then settles into carpets
[01:29:26.500 --> 01:29:29.200]   and clothes and so on.
[01:29:29.200 --> 01:29:32.860]   And this is toxic to pets, to children, things like that.
[01:29:32.860 --> 01:29:34.920]   So when we talk to teens about that,
[01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:36.900]   that's another way to get young people
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:40.020]   to be willing to either quit or to rally around
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:42.160]   not using is the environment.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.860]   If I wash dishes for too long,
[01:29:45.860 --> 01:29:47.040]   my younger is out of the house,
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:50.360]   but when she comes over, I get yelled across the room,
[01:29:50.360 --> 01:29:52.340]   mom, turn the water off, the environment,
[01:29:52.340 --> 01:29:54.120]   we have to save water.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:56.600]   That's what they care about so much
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:29:58.200]   that if we could at least get that
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:00.920]   into young people's hands, say, you know what?
[01:30:00.920 --> 01:30:02.280]   You may not care about yourself,
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.400]   but what about your friends and what about the environment?
[01:30:05.400 --> 01:30:09.120]   I think we can also shift some of the generation right now.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:12.060]   - Interesting, yeah, I think replacement behaviors,
[01:30:12.060 --> 01:30:15.400]   concern for the environment seem like good incentives.
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:16.320]   I don't know, I'm hearing all this.
[01:30:16.320 --> 01:30:18.520]   I feel really lucky that I was always obsessed
[01:30:18.520 --> 01:30:20.640]   with something growing up.
[01:30:20.640 --> 01:30:22.980]   Whether or not it was like birds and fish tanks
[01:30:22.980 --> 01:30:26.460]   or skateboarding or prior to that, soccer.
[01:30:26.460 --> 01:30:30.980]   I mean, certainly there were drugs and alcohol around,
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.340]   but there were always activities that kept us busy.
[01:30:34.340 --> 01:30:37.700]   And I guess I wonder whether or not
[01:30:37.700 --> 01:30:42.000]   the advent of social media has created less interest
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.440]   in activities, after school activities,
[01:30:45.440 --> 01:30:46.680]   I guess they used to call them.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:50.000]   But I mean, even if it's video games,
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.720]   if it's playing a sport, if it's theater,
[01:30:52.720 --> 01:30:56.760]   if it's art, if it's music,
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:30:59.520]   presumably kids are still doing all that stuff.
[01:30:59.520 --> 01:31:02.820]   But is it the case that the kids that are vaping,
[01:31:02.820 --> 01:31:05.160]   let's say nicotine, maybe cannabis as well,
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:07.800]   are less likely to be engaged in other activities?
[01:31:07.800 --> 01:31:09.000]   I mean, is this thing becoming
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.220]   just kind of a closed loop of reward?
[01:31:11.220 --> 01:31:14.920]   I mean, that's, to me, the real danger of any substance
[01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:19.920]   that increases the dopamine system activation
[01:31:19.920 --> 01:31:22.280]   without a lot of effort, right?
[01:31:22.280 --> 01:31:25.860]   'Cause as you and I know, the whole of dopamine circuitry,
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:27.520]   as it relates to reward,
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:30.600]   is all about effort, reward, reinforcement,
[01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.400]   effort, reward, reinforcement.
[01:31:32.400 --> 01:31:34.920]   But the effort piece is key,
[01:31:34.920 --> 01:31:37.600]   and drugs basically bypass the effort piece,
[01:31:37.600 --> 01:31:39.560]   and then you get the reward reinforcement,
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.140]   and then eventually the rewarding and reinforcing levels
[01:31:43.140 --> 01:31:48.140]   of return on that drug, nicotine, cannabis, et cetera,
[01:31:48.140 --> 01:31:50.820]   diminishes, and then you're just caught in a behavioral loop.
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:52.740]   - Right, right, absolutely.
[01:31:52.740 --> 01:31:56.900]   - So, you know, are kids doing less stuff?
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:59.460]   Are they studying less as a consequence of this?
[01:31:59.460 --> 01:32:01.700]   Are they playing fewer sports?
[01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:04.340]   Are they less engaged in youth theater and music
[01:32:04.340 --> 01:32:06.420]   and youth groups and things like that?
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:07.980]   - When we were talking about cigarettes
[01:32:07.980 --> 01:32:11.580]   when I first started my career up until probably 2014,
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.580]   I would say, "Yes, you're absolutely correct."
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:17.200]   And it was generally the teens who would say, "I'm bored,
[01:32:17.200 --> 01:32:18.920]   "and I didn't know what to do with myself,
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:21.180]   "and that's why I picked up cigarettes,"
[01:32:21.180 --> 01:32:26.180]   or, "I'm not an athlete," or, "This was my social outlet."
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:29.460]   I haven't seen that as a result as much with e-cigarettes.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:31.580]   Now, as a result of e-cigarettes, yes,
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:35.820]   but not as a cause of using, because it's so ubiquitous.
[01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:37.940]   E-cigarettes, we're seeing everywhere.
[01:32:37.940 --> 01:32:41.540]   It doesn't matter if you're, how old you are, male, female.
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.980]   Used to be more males using,
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:45.980]   because some of the earlier devices were tech,
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:49.060]   and guys were using it, and some of the females
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:50.620]   didn't want to put 'em in their purse,
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:51.660]   'cause it would leak.
[01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:53.940]   We now are seeing more of an equal rate,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:56.240]   if not a little bit more female using.
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:00.820]   It's not your so-called bad or good kids.
[01:33:00.820 --> 01:33:03.580]   It's not anything, it's not the young people
[01:33:03.580 --> 01:33:05.380]   who are struggling with school.
[01:33:05.380 --> 01:33:09.820]   It's everywhere right now, independent of location,
[01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:11.620]   race, ethnicity, things like that.
[01:33:11.620 --> 01:33:15.020]   So I don't see so much what you're talking about
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:16.700]   in terms of a predictor.
[01:33:16.700 --> 01:33:19.660]   In terms of a result, absolutely.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:22.520]   I mean, then we're seeing teens who become more isolated,
[01:33:22.520 --> 01:33:25.760]   who are not engaged as much, who are more bored,
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:28.300]   because they're sitting home and they're vaping.
[01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:29.820]   But I also see a lot of young people
[01:33:29.820 --> 01:33:32.020]   sitting around together vaping.
[01:33:32.020 --> 01:33:35.100]   So I do think that that landscape has changed.
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.060]   Is it gonna change back?
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:39.460]   I don't know, as hopefully we change the culture again.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.900]   But it's an interesting thought.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.940]   I mean, as soon as you said that, I was thinking,
[01:33:42.940 --> 01:33:45.340]   yeah, I mean, they're certainly not out
[01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:48.300]   as much as they used to be in terms of,
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:49.820]   and we were talking about this at the beginning,
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.800]   we're not seeing them out in parks as much.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.420]   We're not seeing them playing pickup sports games
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.860]   as much as we used to.
[01:33:55.860 --> 01:33:58.260]   But I don't think that's because of e-cigarette use.
[01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:00.180]   I think that's because of social media
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:01.140]   and just the whole change.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:04.140]   And honestly, parents being afraid of letting their kids out
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:07.380]   for some predatory behavior and in other ways.
[01:34:07.380 --> 01:34:09.940]   - You mean if kids are let out of the house,
[01:34:09.940 --> 01:34:12.660]   they're more at risk to predatory behavior?
[01:34:12.660 --> 01:34:14.100]   But of course, they're also at risk,
[01:34:14.100 --> 01:34:15.220]   but just by use of the phone,
[01:34:15.220 --> 01:34:17.100]   because the phone connects everywhere.
[01:34:17.100 --> 01:34:19.100]   - Absolutely, the phone connects everywhere.
[01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:21.620]   And that's something we try to teach teens as well.
[01:34:21.620 --> 01:34:22.980]   But I think that that's been something
[01:34:22.980 --> 01:34:24.580]   that parents are worried about.
[01:34:24.580 --> 01:34:27.780]   I have to, almost the pendulum almost swung too much of,
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:29.140]   now I have to keep my kid in
[01:34:29.140 --> 01:34:30.940]   because I don't want to let them out of the house
[01:34:30.940 --> 01:34:32.580]   and I don't want to let them alone driving
[01:34:32.580 --> 01:34:34.700]   and alone at the park and things like that.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.460]   But I think that we've reduced,
[01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:38.500]   you were talking earlier about autonomy.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:41.860]   We've reduced teens just autonomy.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.740]   They have to get into a little bit of trouble.
[01:34:44.740 --> 01:34:45.740]   They have to jaywalk.
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:48.300]   They have to do, I mean, I'm not encouraging,
[01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:52.460]   but there's some natural amount of getting together
[01:34:52.460 --> 01:34:55.220]   and hanging out and being crazy at the park
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:57.780]   and playing and playing games and things like that.
[01:34:57.780 --> 01:35:02.220]   And I think that has stopped or slowed down a lot.
[01:35:02.220 --> 01:35:05.220]   I see it with some people in my own community.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:08.980]   I don't see as much just hanging out in the front yard
[01:35:08.980 --> 01:35:13.420]   and shooting the breeze and instead they're inside
[01:35:13.420 --> 01:35:16.540]   and they're on their phones and stuff like that.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:18.420]   So could that be part of why we're seeing
[01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:19.780]   more e-cigarette use?
[01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.620]   Possibly, I just don't have,
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:23.740]   I haven't seen the studies on it.
[01:35:23.740 --> 01:35:28.700]   - Yeah, perhaps that's a good segue into risky behaviors.
[01:35:28.700 --> 01:35:32.020]   When I was a kid, I mean, the dumb stuff that we did,
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:37.180]   meaning dumb because it was dangerous to ourselves.
[01:35:37.180 --> 01:35:39.740]   I mean, I am not suggesting people do this.
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:41.700]   Kids, please don't do this, just don't.
[01:35:41.700 --> 01:35:44.180]   But just the dumb stuff of, you know,
[01:35:44.180 --> 01:35:46.400]   jumping off roofs or between roofs.
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:51.900]   I'm not gonna give any other, any anecdotes.
[01:35:51.900 --> 01:35:56.900]   Just, it's amazing that we all survived and some didn't,
[01:35:56.940 --> 01:35:59.460]   but that was largely the consequence of drugs, alcohol,
[01:35:59.460 --> 01:36:02.300]   mental health issues of kids I knew.
[01:36:02.300 --> 01:36:07.020]   But car accidents, actually, I grew up
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:11.620]   in the Mothers Against Drunk Driving era
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:16.260]   and there was a real discouragement around drunk driving.
[01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:18.300]   I was fortunate that at least in high school,
[01:36:18.300 --> 01:36:21.780]   most of my friends didn't drink or didn't drink much.
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:24.820]   But you still heard about fatalities in kids.
[01:36:24.820 --> 01:36:27.980]   Happened, even one is too many, obviously.
[01:36:27.980 --> 01:36:33.280]   What's going on now in terms of risk-taking behavior?
[01:36:33.280 --> 01:36:34.980]   Driving fast, driving drunk,
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:39.540]   doing what used to be just described as dumb stuff
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:43.300]   that unfortunately sometimes is fatal
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:46.180]   or, you know, results in paralysis.
[01:36:46.180 --> 01:36:49.740]   People jumping off bridges into water
[01:36:49.740 --> 01:36:51.620]   without testing the water depth.
[01:36:51.620 --> 01:36:53.220]   You know, we've all heard the stories
[01:36:53.220 --> 01:36:56.380]   and sadly, they're true stories
[01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.740]   of people becoming paralyzed, that kind of thing.
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:01.980]   Dumb stuff, dangerous stuff, teens do more of it.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:06.660]   Is it still true that males are doing more of that
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:11.660]   physical danger stuff than females, or is that not true?
[01:37:11.660 --> 01:37:14.220]   That's what we used to hear, but then, of course,
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:16.740]   there's been this big push, importantly,
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:21.740]   really to balance out the amount of research on both sexes.
[01:37:22.740 --> 01:37:23.580]   - Yeah, it's a good point.
[01:37:23.580 --> 01:37:25.460]   I mean, some of it has to do with just the methods
[01:37:25.460 --> 01:37:26.500]   of our research to know.
[01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:27.340]   You know, it's interesting.
[01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:31.380]   I haven't seen more recent data in terms of differences
[01:37:31.380 --> 01:37:34.940]   by sex of engagement and risk behavior.
[01:37:34.940 --> 01:37:37.280]   I mean, a lot of what I've seen is balanced out.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:39.720]   I think it's maybe different kinds of risk behaviors
[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:42.980]   that people do, but we're still seeing it.
[01:37:42.980 --> 01:37:45.280]   We're still seeing teens drinking.
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:48.420]   We're still seeing teens going to parties and getting drunk.
[01:37:48.420 --> 01:37:50.940]   We're still seeing teens out on the beach and getting drunk.
[01:37:50.940 --> 01:37:53.100]   I think the big difference now is,
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:37:54.780]   whether it's from mothers against,
[01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:56.660]   now I think it's destructive driving.
[01:37:56.660 --> 01:37:57.480]   - Is that what it's called?
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.320]   - I think it's now mothers against--
[01:37:58.320 --> 01:37:59.320]   - Destructive driving.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:00.160]   - I think that's what it is.
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:01.980]   - So that includes drunk driving and racing.
[01:38:01.980 --> 01:38:05.560]   - And racing and driving under the influence of cannabis
[01:38:05.560 --> 01:38:08.660]   or anything else, which can be harmful.
[01:38:08.660 --> 01:38:12.740]   But at least in a lot of the teens and young adults
[01:38:12.740 --> 01:38:15.540]   I've talked to, at least we've gotten that word out to teens.
[01:38:15.540 --> 01:38:17.780]   So they're still drinking, and they're still doing
[01:38:17.780 --> 01:38:19.660]   stupid stuff when they drink,
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:23.380]   but they're not getting behind the wheel as much, much less.
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:28.300]   And this idea of a designated driver or a sober driver--
[01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:29.140]   - Uber.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:29.980]   - Or Uber.
[01:38:29.980 --> 01:38:30.800]   Uber's really changed.
[01:38:30.800 --> 01:38:31.640]   - Or Lyft, I guess we should leave there.
[01:38:31.640 --> 01:38:34.140]   - Or Lyft, or any ride share, let's just say,
[01:38:34.140 --> 01:38:38.820]   any ride share has certainly been a game changer
[01:38:38.820 --> 01:38:43.060]   in the landscape of teenagers and young adults right now.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:46.820]   And in fact, I've heard not just a designated driver,
[01:38:46.820 --> 01:38:51.820]   but a designated partner or a sober sitter.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:54.200]   So this idea that you go to a party
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:55.980]   and there may be drinking going on,
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:38:58.100]   but you make sure that there's one person
[01:38:58.100 --> 01:39:00.060]   who's sober not just for driving,
[01:39:00.060 --> 01:39:02.140]   but to make sure you're not going home with somebody
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:03.660]   you don't wanna go home with,
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:06.180]   to make sure that you're not leaving drunk
[01:39:06.180 --> 01:39:07.620]   and falling downstairs,
[01:39:07.620 --> 01:39:10.260]   to make sure that you're not falling out of that window.
[01:39:10.260 --> 01:39:13.520]   So that message we've gotten across really well,
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:15.760]   which I'm thrilled about.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:18.060]   Are we still seeing drunk driving in accidents?
[01:39:18.060 --> 01:39:20.500]   I certainly have among some people I know.
[01:39:20.500 --> 01:39:21.420]   Certainly we are,
[01:39:21.420 --> 01:39:23.380]   but I think that the message overall
[01:39:23.380 --> 01:39:24.500]   has gotten out there.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:25.740]   Some people I've talked to said,
[01:39:25.740 --> 01:39:28.700]   "We just don't get behind the wheel," period.
[01:39:28.700 --> 01:39:29.780]   What's also interesting
[01:39:29.780 --> 01:39:33.120]   is more and more teens are not driving.
[01:39:33.120 --> 01:39:35.480]   They're delaying driving more and more,
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.540]   whether that's because of Uber, Lyft.
[01:39:37.540 --> 01:39:41.300]   I mean, as a parent, it's less expensive
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:42.520]   to pay for a ride share
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.200]   than to pay for insurance for somebody under 25,
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:46.140]   or to pay for a car.
[01:39:46.140 --> 01:39:47.680]   So certainly that might be it.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:51.120]   But that is there.
[01:39:51.120 --> 01:39:52.420]   Doing other stupid stuff,
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:55.600]   I mean, in addition to drugs, jumping, skateboarding,
[01:39:55.600 --> 01:39:57.300]   certainly we're still seeing that.
[01:39:57.300 --> 01:39:59.020]   - Well, skateboarding is a good sport.
[01:39:59.020 --> 01:40:00.620]   Don't exceed your skill level,
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:03.700]   but jumping between buildings, not smart,
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:07.140]   unless you're super skilled and know what you're doing.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:08.700]   I mean, there are the parkour kids
[01:40:08.700 --> 01:40:10.380]   and the skateboard kids and the BMX,
[01:40:10.380 --> 01:40:12.740]   'cause we don't wanna take away
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.900]   what the incredible things that they can do.
[01:40:14.900 --> 01:40:16.700]   But there's risk there.
[01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.860]   I was referring to people who lack the skill
[01:40:18.860 --> 01:40:23.860]   to complete the maneuver and getting badly hurt,
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:27.380]   or in some cases, not getting badly hurt,
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:28.540]   but you just kind of shake your head
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.380]   and wonder why you ever engaged in that kind of stuff.
[01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:32.740]   Just so risky.
[01:40:32.740 --> 01:40:33.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.860]   We're definitely still seeing risk behavior
[01:40:35.860 --> 01:40:36.780]   amongst teenagers.
[01:40:36.780 --> 01:40:39.020]   And part of it has to do with impulsivity.
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:41.060]   We know that teens up until around,
[01:40:41.060 --> 01:40:42.540]   part of the development, right,
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:45.820]   of cognitive and psychosocial and social development,
[01:40:45.820 --> 01:40:50.140]   it's up until around 16, 17, they're still very impulsive.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:51.900]   We know with the brain development, right,
[01:40:51.900 --> 01:40:54.980]   the back of the brain develops faster and first,
[01:40:54.980 --> 01:40:57.980]   and that's our amygdala, our emotional center,
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:01.460]   our motor coordination, versus the front of the brain,
[01:41:01.460 --> 01:41:03.260]   which is our executive functioning,
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:06.820]   our planning for the future,
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:08.620]   our really slowing down and being able
[01:41:08.620 --> 01:41:10.740]   to think of the risks and benefits
[01:41:10.740 --> 01:41:12.980]   and make those decisions a little slower
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:15.300]   and a little bit better, more like we would as adults.
[01:41:15.300 --> 01:41:18.300]   So we certainly see impulsive decision.
[01:41:18.300 --> 01:41:20.740]   You know, hey, let's go teepee that house,
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:22.180]   or let's go ride on that car,
[01:41:22.180 --> 01:41:24.980]   or let's go do things that probably,
[01:41:24.980 --> 01:41:26.820]   hopefully wouldn't get them killed or injured,
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.140]   but may get them busted in other ways.
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:30.700]   We're still seeing that.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:33.140]   I think there've been more programs
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:36.580]   to help teens sort of rehearse in situations,
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:38.700]   so they're not, more life skills training,
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:41.460]   so they're not making some of those impulsive decisions,
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:42.300]   but teens will.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:43.980]   Teens are gonna be teens,
[01:41:43.980 --> 01:41:46.660]   which, by the way, is why we don't put things
[01:41:46.660 --> 01:41:49.460]   in front of them, like, you know,
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:52.380]   sugar booger and unicorn kind of marketing
[01:41:52.380 --> 01:41:54.060]   that's going to get teens attracted,
[01:41:54.060 --> 01:41:57.340]   because that is buying into that knee-jerk,
[01:41:57.340 --> 01:42:01.220]   impulsive, it looks cool, everyone's doing a kind of thing
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:02.820]   that they can resist.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.940]   I don't mean that they can't,
[01:42:03.940 --> 01:42:06.700]   but just buys right into, teens are going to be teens,
[01:42:06.700 --> 01:42:08.500]   and that's what they're going to do.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:11.540]   - What about sexual behavior?
[01:42:11.540 --> 01:42:15.100]   You mentioned that kids are driving less,
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:18.420]   are getting their driver's license less frequently,
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:23.020]   which, by the way, with respect to teens
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:25.500]   wanting to drive less, that just, like, baffles my mind.
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:27.340]   I mean, one of the reasons I like skateboarding as a sport
[01:42:27.340 --> 01:42:28.660]   is you could do it anywhere.
[01:42:28.660 --> 01:42:31.540]   It was also transportation, and I like the social milieu.
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:33.300]   I loved the social milieu of it.
[01:42:34.860 --> 01:42:36.860]   But getting my driver's license
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:39.060]   was, like, one of the most important events of my life.
[01:42:39.060 --> 01:42:39.900]   - Me too, me too.
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:42.380]   - I mean, I could drive to Yosemite in the summer.
[01:42:42.380 --> 01:42:44.340]   I could do all sorts of things with that.
[01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:47.580]   I'm so surprised that kids wouldn't want to do that.
[01:42:47.580 --> 01:42:49.780]   Such autonomy there, so much fun.
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.980]   - Oh, I agree.
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:55.700]   - But I've also heard that rates of sexual behavior
[01:42:55.700 --> 01:42:57.820]   are going down, is that true?
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:00.100]   - Yeah, stabilizing and going down,
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:02.380]   and certainly rates of risky sexual behavior
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:05.380]   has also gone down, so we are getting the message across
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:09.740]   around condom use, around STI testing,
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:11.460]   around birth control, things like that,
[01:43:11.460 --> 01:43:12.900]   which is also really good.
[01:43:12.900 --> 01:43:14.860]   But rates overall have gone down.
[01:43:14.860 --> 01:43:16.300]   - Is teen pregnancy down?
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:17.260]   - I think it's down.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:18.820]   Actually, I haven't looked at the latest numbers.
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:20.740]   I think it's down.
[01:43:20.740 --> 01:43:22.780]   Certainly I don't think it's gone up,
[01:43:22.780 --> 01:43:25.340]   but I actually would need to look back at those numbers.
[01:43:25.340 --> 01:43:27.260]   It's been a little while since I've looked at them.
[01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:29.220]   - And is what we're talking about today
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:32.020]   mostly within the United States and the United States alone,
[01:43:32.020 --> 01:43:34.940]   or does it carry over to other countries as well?
[01:43:34.940 --> 01:43:37.700]   - So it totally depends on the behavior
[01:43:37.700 --> 01:43:39.020]   that we're talking about.
[01:43:39.020 --> 01:43:44.020]   - Let's say vaping or e-cig use of cannabis or nicotine.
[01:43:44.020 --> 01:43:48.860]   - So interestingly, e-cigarette, nicotine, e-cigarette use
[01:43:48.860 --> 01:43:52.380]   has not been as high in a lot of other countries.
[01:43:52.380 --> 01:43:53.260]   It depends on the country,
[01:43:53.260 --> 01:43:55.500]   but for example, the UK or Europe,
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:58.700]   we haven't seen the rates as high in the last few years.
[01:43:58.700 --> 01:44:01.420]   Part of it was that a lot of other states
[01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:03.420]   have a nicotine standard.
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:06.660]   So that means a minimum amount or maximum amount,
[01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.780]   excuse me, of nicotine that you're allowed to have.
[01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:12.300]   So for example, the UK, I think it's around 1.7%.
[01:44:12.300 --> 01:44:15.140]   In the US, we have no nicotine standard,
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:18.260]   which is another major issue with regulation.
[01:44:18.260 --> 01:44:20.620]   We don't have, I mean, we have, as I was saying,
[01:44:20.620 --> 01:44:23.740]   5%, 10% nicotine levels.
[01:44:23.740 --> 01:44:26.260]   There is no regulation about how much nicotine
[01:44:26.260 --> 01:44:27.460]   that you could have.
[01:44:27.460 --> 01:44:29.180]   So in certain countries,
[01:44:29.180 --> 01:44:32.020]   if it's right around the addictive level
[01:44:32.020 --> 01:44:33.580]   or a little bit below it,
[01:44:33.580 --> 01:44:35.700]   we're gonna see fewer teens becoming addictive.
[01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:37.140]   It's still bad at any amount,
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:41.420]   but we're gonna see fewer people becoming addictive.
[01:44:41.420 --> 01:44:43.820]   The other is the marketing was not as big
[01:44:43.820 --> 01:44:45.860]   in other countries and really was,
[01:44:45.860 --> 01:44:47.540]   the marketing was e-cigarettes
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:50.700]   if you're trying to stop smoking cigarettes,
[01:44:50.700 --> 01:44:52.420]   not marketed to teens.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:54.500]   That has changed in the last year or two.
[01:44:54.500 --> 01:44:57.540]   So in countries I've talked to, for example, the UK,
[01:44:57.540 --> 01:44:59.260]   I've been interviewed by them many times
[01:44:59.260 --> 01:45:00.100]   in the last few years,
[01:45:00.100 --> 01:45:02.300]   that they would say, "We don't have the same problem."
[01:45:02.300 --> 01:45:04.540]   And now they're saying, "Boy, we are seeing
[01:45:04.540 --> 01:45:06.220]   "a pretty significant increase
[01:45:06.220 --> 01:45:09.020]   "in the number of teens who are using."
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:10.860]   Part of it is a different landscape
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:12.980]   of the kind of e-cigarette that's out there,
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:15.820]   the kind of marketing that's out there, whatever it is.
[01:45:15.820 --> 01:45:18.940]   We are now seeing, is it as high as we have in the US?
[01:45:18.940 --> 01:45:21.900]   I don't think so, but it's certainly increasing.
[01:45:21.900 --> 01:45:23.700]   Same thing in other countries
[01:45:23.700 --> 01:45:26.140]   where they actually didn't allow certain e-cigarettes
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:28.860]   to be on the market have now come in
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:31.380]   and been on the market and infiltrated.
[01:45:31.380 --> 01:45:34.820]   And even in this country, certain e-cigarettes are illegal
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:37.060]   and they're coming in illegally
[01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:38.780]   through illicit trading is happening
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:41.100]   and crossing the borders.
[01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:44.420]   So e-cigarette, we're still seeing.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.140]   Cannabis depends on the country, right?
[01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.500]   Whether it's legal or not.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.780]   Now, even in the US, I should say,
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:53.820]   even states that have legalized cannabis,
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:55.820]   you have to be 21,
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:58.660]   but we're still seeing underage cannabis use, of course,
[01:45:58.660 --> 01:46:00.340]   just like we're seeing underage drinking
[01:46:00.340 --> 01:46:01.920]   and underage nicotine use.
[01:46:01.920 --> 01:46:05.940]   In other states where it's just really difficult to get,
[01:46:05.940 --> 01:46:08.220]   we're not seeing cannabis as much,
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:09.660]   but we still are seeing it.
[01:46:09.660 --> 01:46:14.100]   - We didn't talk about things like Zin pouches,
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:17.020]   which are becoming more popular with adults as well.
[01:46:17.020 --> 01:46:21.460]   So no vaping, no e-cig, no smoking nicotine,
[01:46:21.460 --> 01:46:23.260]   but a little pouch,
[01:46:23.260 --> 01:46:27.020]   which is different than dipping tobacco or snuffing tobacco.
[01:46:27.020 --> 01:46:29.540]   As far as I know,
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:33.140]   Zin pouches and things similar
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:36.220]   deliver nicotine into the bloodstream,
[01:46:36.220 --> 01:46:37.800]   which then crosses the blood-brain barrier,
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.640]   goes into the brain,
[01:46:38.640 --> 01:46:41.380]   has this effect of creating focus and alertness
[01:46:41.380 --> 01:46:42.920]   kind of a little high,
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:47.980]   but doesn't carry the same carcinogenic risk.
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:49.960]   But presumably there are other risks,
[01:46:51.260 --> 01:46:52.460]   which include, of course,
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:54.420]   the addictive and habit-forming nature of it,
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:56.780]   the blood pressure increase, the vasoconstriction,
[01:46:56.780 --> 01:46:58.840]   which is related to the blood pressure, et cetera.
[01:46:58.840 --> 01:47:01.040]   But what do we know about Zin pouch use?
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.660]   Is it on the rise?
[01:47:02.660 --> 01:47:05.500]   Or is it that there's something so compelling
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:09.060]   about vaping and e-cigs that people,
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:14.060]   in particular kids, want the physical act of vaping?
[01:47:14.060 --> 01:47:16.580]   - So this is a case where,
[01:47:16.580 --> 01:47:17.900]   I've seen this one other time,
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:19.280]   where actually the popular press
[01:47:20.000 --> 01:47:21.600]   ahead of the scientific press
[01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.920]   and probably ahead of the science
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:25.060]   and teaching us scientists
[01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:27.840]   that we better hurry up and figure this out.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:28.680]   - How is that?
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:31.400]   - So the popular press has been talking about Zin a lot
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:34.920]   and arguing that it's a very popular product
[01:47:34.920 --> 01:47:36.060]   and that we're seeing,
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:36.900]   now this is true,
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:38.840]   we're seeing a very sharp increase
[01:47:38.840 --> 01:47:40.480]   in the market share of Zin
[01:47:40.480 --> 01:47:42.160]   compared to other nicotine products.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.440]   So we're seeing it on the rise.
[01:47:43.440 --> 01:47:44.960]   What I mean by science hasn't caught up
[01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.960]   is we don't have a lot of surveillance data
[01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:50.960]   to show whether or not teens are actually using Zin.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:51.980]   We have some data.
[01:47:51.980 --> 01:47:53.940]   We actually published a study a couple years ago
[01:47:53.940 --> 01:47:58.340]   showing around 20 to 25% of people in general,
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:47:59.640]   adolescents and adults,
[01:47:59.640 --> 01:48:03.940]   and about 11 to 15% of teens are using a pouch,
[01:48:03.940 --> 01:48:05.280]   presumably Zin.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.120]   We didn't ask.
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:08.540]   We now are looking at our data around Zin use.
[01:48:08.540 --> 01:48:12.340]   But we don't have wide-scale studies.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:15.360]   We do have studies of pouches more generally,
[01:48:15.360 --> 01:48:18.400]   like the CDC showed that about,
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:20.200]   I think it was a couple of percent,
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:21.760]   one and a half percent,
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:23.880]   and that it went up a little bit.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.800]   So I think, I can't remember.
[01:48:24.800 --> 01:48:25.640]   It was something like,
[01:48:25.640 --> 01:48:30.400]   I think it went from 1.1% to about 1.5% of teens
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:32.840]   seem to be admitting using pouches.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.120]   So not a huge increase,
[01:48:35.120 --> 01:48:37.760]   but a few hundred thousand teens are using
[01:48:37.760 --> 01:48:38.640]   across the country,
[01:48:38.640 --> 01:48:42.640]   as opposed to two and a half million plus using e-cigarettes.
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:46.160]   But with all those qualifications aside,
[01:48:46.160 --> 01:48:49.900]   yes, we are seeing an increase in Zin use amongst teenagers.
[01:48:49.900 --> 01:48:54.920]   What's most concerning is that it seems like it's teenagers
[01:48:54.920 --> 01:48:58.960]   who are not using it in addition to e-cigarettes,
[01:48:58.960 --> 01:49:00.220]   but new initiates.
[01:49:00.220 --> 01:49:02.760]   So they're now, just like I'm concerned about teens
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.200]   initiating tobacco or nicotine through e-cigarettes,
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:09.840]   now it seems like some are initiating through Zin.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:11.840]   - So Zin is kind of the gateway.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.120]   It may be an on-ramp to using,
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:16.360]   and the idea is that they're putting it
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:18.600]   in between their lip and their gum,
[01:49:18.600 --> 01:49:23.040]   and then each pouch of Zin is three or six milligrams.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:25.180]   It comes in a three milligram pouch
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:27.120]   or a six milligram pouch.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:28.640]   Now it is nicotine that,
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:32.160]   yes, it's originally derived from tobacco,
[01:49:32.160 --> 01:49:35.360]   but there's no tobacco in the pouch itself.
[01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:38.140]   It's a white powder nicotine.
[01:49:38.140 --> 01:49:40.320]   And I don't know what else is in there.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:42.860]   We are really lacking the research there,
[01:49:42.860 --> 01:49:44.720]   but my concern is we've seen this
[01:49:44.720 --> 01:49:48.520]   with smokeless tobacco for years is oral cancer.
[01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:51.280]   And you're putting this in the mouth
[01:49:51.280 --> 01:49:53.080]   and at the mucosal line,
[01:49:53.080 --> 01:49:56.960]   and are we going to start being concerned about oral cancer,
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.360]   which we've already been concerned about with other pouches?
[01:49:59.360 --> 01:50:02.140]   - How would you get oral cancer if there's no tobacco
[01:50:02.140 --> 01:50:03.840]   and it's just nicotine?
[01:50:03.840 --> 01:50:05.280]   I was under the impression,
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:06.440]   and please tell me if I'm wrong,
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:09.160]   that nicotine itself doesn't cause cancer.
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.600]   - The question is what else is in there?
[01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.720]   Is it just nicotine or is there aldehydes
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:14.600]   and other chemicals that are cut with it?
[01:50:14.600 --> 01:50:16.880]   So that's why I'm saying we don't know enough about it.
[01:50:16.880 --> 01:50:18.600]   My big concern is exactly what you're saying.
[01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:21.560]   Are we going to start seeing teens using nicotine
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:24.140]   and then nicotine pouches and moving on?
[01:50:24.140 --> 01:50:28.720]   But the brain piece, it doesn't matter.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:29.680]   What else is in there?
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:32.020]   We are still concerned about the brain development.
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.680]   And if you're using a three milligram
[01:50:34.680 --> 01:50:36.320]   or a six milligram pouch,
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:39.880]   and we know that a lot of teens are using multiple pouches,
[01:50:39.880 --> 01:50:41.740]   our study showed this as well,
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:43.400]   multiple pouches throughout the day,
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:45.400]   and actually some social media is showing
[01:50:45.400 --> 01:50:48.520]   teens putting in several pouches at the same time,
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:50.240]   then you might be getting, again,
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.440]   as much as a pack of cigarettes of nicotine,
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:54.160]   and that's very concerning.
[01:50:54.160 --> 01:50:56.080]   So the whole piece we talked about before
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:59.560]   about brain development and are we stunding or changing
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:02.360]   or really rewiring the brain with nicotine,
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:04.800]   doesn't matter what form it's in,
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:08.280]   it is not good and it's not good for teenagers.
[01:51:08.280 --> 01:51:11.900]   - Yeah, I get asked a lot of questions about zinc pouches
[01:51:11.900 --> 01:51:13.760]   and other nicotine pouches.
[01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:15.540]   And one of the more common questions
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:18.880]   is related to the fact that a lot of people start
[01:51:18.880 --> 01:51:20.520]   with one or two pouches a day,
[01:51:20.520 --> 01:51:21.940]   quickly moved to four to five.
[01:51:21.940 --> 01:51:25.880]   And the typical ceiling for most people
[01:51:25.880 --> 01:51:28.680]   that at least ask me questions about it
[01:51:28.680 --> 01:51:33.280]   is moving to quickly a canister a day,
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:35.400]   which is a lot of pouches.
[01:51:35.400 --> 01:51:38.920]   - I think it's 15 to 20 pouches per can.
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:41.600]   - Okay, so three to six milligrams.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:42.560]   - Right. - You can do the math.
[01:51:42.560 --> 01:51:43.400]   - Do the math.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:47.040]   What's that, 60 to upwards of 60 milligrams.
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:50.240]   That's three packs of cigarettes.
[01:51:50.240 --> 01:51:52.520]   - You got your step ahead of me, two steps ahead of me.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:53.720]   - Yeah, two.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:54.980]   Let's play it safe, two.
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:55.820]   I'll give you, if you know.
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:51:57.040]   - Two packs of cigarettes per day.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:59.360]   - At least two packs of cigarettes worth of nicotine.
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.680]   And it's interesting, in the old days,
[01:52:02.680 --> 01:52:04.120]   when we didn't have e-cigarettes
[01:52:04.120 --> 01:52:05.660]   and we were talking about cigarettes
[01:52:05.660 --> 01:52:07.460]   and we were talking about adults,
[01:52:07.460 --> 01:52:09.600]   we would talk pack cigarette years, right?
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:12.120]   How many packs of cigarettes and for how many years.
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:14.900]   And that language kind of reduced for a while
[01:52:14.900 --> 01:52:18.720]   because adults and people weren't using cigarettes as much.
[01:52:18.720 --> 01:52:21.600]   And so we weren't worrying about this concept of packs.
[01:52:21.600 --> 01:52:22.800]   I'm worried about it again.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:25.200]   We're getting so much nicotine now.
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:27.700]   Now, yes, not in the form of combusted,
[01:52:27.700 --> 01:52:29.160]   not in the form of burning.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:32.200]   Maybe it's in the form of e-cigarettes or pouches,
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.480]   but it's still a huge amount of nicotine
[01:52:34.480 --> 01:52:38.200]   that we're seeing that young, very young brains are using.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:40.680]   - Yeah, can't be good, in my opinion.
[01:52:40.680 --> 01:52:42.880]   I spent years studying brain development,
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:45.400]   still teach brain development every year.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:46.680]   Can't be good.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:49.640]   The brain doesn't do well developing
[01:52:49.640 --> 01:52:55.240]   with artificially high levels of any neuromodulator.
[01:52:55.240 --> 01:52:56.680]   - And then you go back to the eight-year-olds
[01:52:56.680 --> 01:52:58.040]   we were talking about earlier,
[01:52:58.040 --> 01:53:03.040]   and we have no studies on what does a drug like nicotine do
[01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:07.000]   to not a teen brain, but a child brain.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:10.880]   And clearly is not good, but what exactly is happening?
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:12.280]   We don't have those studies,
[01:53:12.280 --> 01:53:15.200]   but it's incredibly scary to think about
[01:53:15.200 --> 01:53:17.360]   what's happening with young people
[01:53:17.360 --> 01:53:19.840]   and getting addicted so young
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.560]   and then continuing that addiction
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:24.000]   of a lifetime of addiction that they might have.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.040]   - Seems like it would be appropriate now
[01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.600]   to kind of take a step back.
[01:53:29.600 --> 01:53:33.400]   I think everyone agrees that these are major problems
[01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:35.400]   that are in our youth,
[01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:40.160]   and just evaluate messaging and tools
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:44.880]   to overcome these issues, right?
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:48.120]   So obviously, if you never try a substance or a behavior,
[01:53:48.120 --> 01:53:50.280]   you can't get addicted to it.
[01:53:50.280 --> 01:53:52.960]   But given the prevalence of this stuff,
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:54.880]   what sorts of messaging work?
[01:53:54.880 --> 01:53:58.560]   - Earlier, we talked about accessing the rebellious spirit
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:02.840]   that is youth as a way to get youth
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.320]   to engage in healthier behaviors
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:06.240]   and abandon unhealthy behaviors.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:09.480]   But there's quitting, there's just saying no,
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:11.160]   and then there's harm reduction.
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:15.920]   There's convincing people
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:18.960]   that some substance is bad for them
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:21.560]   and scaring them to the point where they quit.
[01:54:21.560 --> 01:54:23.920]   There's incentivizing them to be healthy.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:26.120]   There's replacement behaviors.
[01:54:26.120 --> 01:54:28.080]   There's just so much in that landscape.
[01:54:28.080 --> 01:54:29.920]   I know you just held a conference
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.120]   on cannabis and tobacco recently.
[01:54:32.120 --> 01:54:34.440]   I'm sorry, I wasn't able to attend.
[01:54:34.440 --> 01:54:35.920]   It sounds super interesting.
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:37.480]   But whether or not we're talking about social media
[01:54:37.480 --> 01:54:40.360]   or cannabis or risky driving behavior
[01:54:40.360 --> 01:54:45.360]   or reckless behavior of any kind, I mean, what works?
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.800]   And when I say this,
[01:54:47.800 --> 01:54:49.720]   I don't necessarily just mean at the level
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:54.080]   of public health discourse, but also parent to child,
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:57.800]   peer to peer, sibling to sibling.
[01:54:57.800 --> 01:54:58.640]   What works?
[01:54:58.640 --> 01:55:01.280]   I mean, how should one approach a kid
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:04.640]   or an adult for that matter who's vaping cannabis
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:07.160]   or is vaping nicotine
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:10.440]   and is just clearly gonna be a bad trajectory?
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:11.520]   What can one do?
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:14.280]   I mean, we all also understand personal accountability
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:17.020]   and neuroplasticity generally emerges best
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:19.700]   when it comes from within as opposed from the outside.
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:21.380]   But what can we do?
[01:55:21.380 --> 01:55:24.760]   - The most important is, and I've said this for years,
[01:55:24.760 --> 01:55:27.160]   have a conversation.
[01:55:27.160 --> 01:55:32.000]   And some people think that having a conversation about,
[01:55:32.000 --> 01:55:34.040]   name your risk behavior.
[01:55:34.040 --> 01:55:37.440]   Drugs, of any sort, alcohol, tobacco, other drugs,
[01:55:37.440 --> 01:55:39.060]   having a conversation about sex,
[01:55:39.060 --> 01:55:41.360]   having a conversation about risky driving,
[01:55:41.360 --> 01:55:43.200]   gets young people curious.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:45.160]   That is not at all the case.
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:47.360]   There's nothing we can talk to a young person about
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:49.240]   that they don't already know.
[01:55:49.240 --> 01:55:50.880]   We're kidding ourselves to say,
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.400]   oh, we can't mention drugs to a 16-year-old
[01:55:53.400 --> 01:55:54.960]   because we're gonna get them curious.
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.680]   They've known about drugs since they were eight years old.
[01:55:57.680 --> 01:55:58.520]   We're not.
[01:55:58.520 --> 01:56:02.320]   And I often say to parents, start that conversation young.
[01:56:02.320 --> 01:56:04.720]   When your kids are really young, four or five,
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.100]   maybe the conversation is having a cookie
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:10.440]   or having some grapes or going to bed now
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.740]   or going to bed in five minutes.
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:13.160]   I used to say that with my own kids.
[01:56:13.160 --> 01:56:14.840]   You wanna go to bed now or in five minutes?
[01:56:14.840 --> 01:56:16.960]   So they felt like they were making the decision.
[01:56:16.960 --> 01:56:19.640]   I didn't really care which decision they were making.
[01:56:19.640 --> 01:56:21.040]   It was not a fight.
[01:56:21.040 --> 01:56:23.440]   We need to start having conversations
[01:56:23.440 --> 01:56:26.400]   around decision-making and healthy decision-making
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:28.600]   and not have a confrontation,
[01:56:28.600 --> 01:56:31.280]   but a conversation very young.
[01:56:31.280 --> 01:56:34.000]   Now, I'm not saying that we talk about drugs or sex
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.940]   when they're very young, although to be honest, I did.
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:40.600]   I talked about cigarettes and pubital development
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:42.600]   with my kids when they were very young,
[01:56:42.600 --> 01:56:45.320]   but just starting that conversation
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:48.680]   so that when you move into more sensitive topics,
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:51.400]   more difficult topics, as a child ages
[01:56:51.400 --> 01:56:54.960]   and becomes an older child and into adolescence,
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:57.600]   it's not shocking that you're having those conversations.
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:00.480]   And this is whether you're a parent, an educator,
[01:57:00.480 --> 01:57:03.880]   or whatever, so just talking, a conversation.
[01:57:03.880 --> 01:57:07.280]   And not scheduling it, by the way.
[01:57:07.280 --> 01:57:09.460]   Not on Saturday at three o'clock,
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.480]   we're gonna sit down and talk about sex,
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:13.560]   or at three o'clock, we're gonna talk about drugs.
[01:57:13.560 --> 01:57:14.880]   That does not work.
[01:57:14.880 --> 01:57:17.680]   You need to, I would joke that I was like
[01:57:17.680 --> 01:57:19.560]   the queen of organic conversation.
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:20.920]   You know, I'd see something on TV.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:23.680]   Oh, you know, oh, let's have a conversation about that.
[01:57:23.680 --> 01:57:25.600]   Just making it a natural part.
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:27.240]   And you were asking about differences
[01:57:27.240 --> 01:57:29.640]   in cultures and countries.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:32.120]   We don't normalize those conversations.
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:34.600]   Other countries do, and we need to be doing that.
[01:57:34.600 --> 01:57:35.440]   So that's one thing. - It sounds like
[01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:37.680]   we don't normalize them or formalize them.
[01:57:37.680 --> 01:57:39.760]   - Correct, we don't.
[01:57:39.760 --> 01:57:40.720]   So that's one thing.
[01:57:40.720 --> 01:57:43.160]   The other is, we're kidding ourselves
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:45.600]   if we just talk about the just say no,
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:46.960]   as we were saying before.
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:49.000]   Of course we want no use.
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.860]   Of course we want teens to wait.
[01:57:51.860 --> 01:57:54.720]   I mean, I often say, we hope and expect
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:57:57.420]   that most people, if not all, will grow up
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:57:59.520]   into a healthy sexual relationship,
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:01.200]   whatever that might look like.
[01:58:01.200 --> 01:58:03.340]   Even a healthy alcohol relationship,
[01:58:03.340 --> 01:58:05.080]   a glass of wine, or half a glass of wine
[01:58:05.080 --> 01:58:06.760]   at night with dinner.
[01:58:06.760 --> 01:58:10.800]   Again, no safe use of a lot of the other drugs,
[01:58:10.800 --> 01:58:14.720]   including nicotine, certainly fentanyl, illicit fentanyl.
[01:58:14.720 --> 01:58:16.440]   I want to make clear, not all fentanyl,
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:17.560]   but illicit fentanyl.
[01:58:17.560 --> 01:58:21.240]   But to just simply say no and don't do,
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:24.160]   and it's bad for you, is setting up, again,
[01:58:24.160 --> 01:58:26.000]   that failure of your conversation.
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.360]   Because, okay, well you're telling me it's bad,
[01:58:28.360 --> 01:58:31.240]   but I liked it, or my friend liked it,
[01:58:31.240 --> 01:58:33.360]   and it's not so bad.
[01:58:33.360 --> 01:58:35.460]   So you've lost credibility.
[01:58:35.460 --> 01:58:37.320]   The most important part of harm reduction
[01:58:37.320 --> 01:58:38.440]   is not to do it.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:39.960]   Absolutely, of course.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:41.960]   Not to use, not to have risky sex.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:44.280]   Maybe not to have sex at all until you're older.
[01:58:44.280 --> 01:58:46.960]   Not to use tobacco, not to use any drugs.
[01:58:46.960 --> 01:58:49.920]   But how do we do that with a young person
[01:58:49.920 --> 01:58:53.920]   who you go into a classroom and 10%, 20%
[01:58:53.920 --> 01:58:56.720]   have already started using, or having sex,
[01:58:56.720 --> 01:58:58.320]   or whatever the conversation is,
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:58:59.440]   you shut them down.
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:01.160]   Well, they don't understand me,
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:02.960]   so why should I listen to them?
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:04.400]   They're not talking to me.
[01:59:04.400 --> 01:59:07.960]   And so that no use conversation doesn't work.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:10.640]   There's a continuum, or a spectrum of use.
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:14.540]   Everything from no use, to once in a while,
[01:59:14.540 --> 01:59:17.440]   to regular use, all the way up to addicted use.
[01:59:17.440 --> 01:59:19.420]   We're talking about drugs.
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:23.400]   So to go in and assume that nobody's ever used,
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:25.400]   or nobody wants to use,
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:27.940]   you're setting yourself up for failure.
[01:59:27.940 --> 01:59:29.860]   That's the expectation, that's the hope.
[01:59:29.860 --> 01:59:32.360]   But what we really also need to talk about is,
[01:59:32.360 --> 01:59:35.960]   best if you don't use, but if you do,
[01:59:35.960 --> 01:59:39.000]   let's, if you are using, let's help you cut back or quit.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:42.920]   And if you are continuing to use, let's keep you safe.
[01:59:42.920 --> 01:59:45.160]   Let's make sure that you're not gonna die.
[01:59:45.160 --> 01:59:47.700]   And what I'm talking about here is,
[01:59:47.700 --> 01:59:50.480]   you know, when most parents,
[01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:52.040]   if their kids are gonna go to a party,
[01:59:52.040 --> 01:59:53.220]   well, I shouldn't say most parents,
[01:59:53.220 --> 01:59:55.560]   but a conversation often is,
[01:59:55.560 --> 01:59:56.880]   hey, I hope you're not drinking,
[01:59:56.880 --> 02:00:01.240]   but if you are, pick up the phone and I will come get you.
[02:00:01.240 --> 02:00:02.760]   That's harm reduction.
[02:00:02.760 --> 02:00:04.880]   And parents, oh, I didn't think about that.
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:06.520]   Well, that's putting safety first.
[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:08.760]   That is a harm reduction message.
[02:00:08.760 --> 02:00:12.760]   Or saying, you know, you're pretty young
[02:00:12.760 --> 02:00:16.200]   to start having sex, but here's a condom just in case.
[02:00:16.200 --> 02:00:18.200]   Why do schools have condoms in?
[02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:20.720]   Because they know that as much as we say
[02:00:20.720 --> 02:00:23.120]   it's best to delay, teens are going to.
[02:00:23.120 --> 02:00:24.600]   That's harm reduction.
[02:00:24.600 --> 02:00:28.320]   Let's at least reduce risk of STIs, pregnancy, and so on.
[02:00:28.320 --> 02:00:31.120]   - And what do the data say is the consequence
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:35.080]   of harm reduction versus the kind of like thick black line,
[02:00:35.080 --> 02:00:37.680]   don't go anywhere near this behavior?
[02:00:37.680 --> 02:00:39.680]   - All the research, or pretty much all the research
[02:00:39.680 --> 02:00:41.880]   that I've read and hopefully will contribute to
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:45.800]   shows that those messages, the harm reduction messages,
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.480]   or what I would say comprehensive,
[02:00:47.480 --> 02:00:49.120]   it really, the harm reduction.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:51.760]   Unfortunately, harm reduction has gotten a bad rap,
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:54.000]   partly because of cigarettes versus e-cigarettes
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.760]   and this harm continuum with tobacco.
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:00:59.240]   So maybe we don't say harm reduction,
[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:01.120]   we say comprehensive conversations,
[02:01:01.120 --> 02:01:04.260]   comprehensive education from no use all the way up to
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:06.240]   what do we do if you are using?
[02:01:06.240 --> 02:01:08.140]   And all the research is really saying
[02:01:08.140 --> 02:01:11.440]   that those messages are way more effective
[02:01:11.440 --> 02:01:14.280]   than not using at all, or than that.
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:16.240]   If we tell teens don't use,
[02:01:16.240 --> 02:01:18.560]   and we see this a lot in sexual behavior,
[02:01:18.560 --> 02:01:21.040]   we say do not have sex, period.
[02:01:21.040 --> 02:01:23.760]   Sign a contract that you're not gonna have sex.
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:25.360]   And then they're in a situation,
[02:01:25.360 --> 02:01:27.560]   and we don't arm them with the understanding
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:31.320]   of how to negotiate, how to have a healthy relationship,
[02:01:31.320 --> 02:01:32.760]   how to have a conversation.
[02:01:32.760 --> 02:01:33.840]   What do they do if they're thinking
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:36.040]   that they might want to have sex?
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:37.800]   What do they do in that situation?
[02:01:37.800 --> 02:01:39.740]   We then find that we're having teens
[02:01:39.740 --> 02:01:42.560]   who then don't know how to protect themselves
[02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:45.360]   and either have sex that was unwanted
[02:01:45.360 --> 02:01:48.000]   or sex that was unprotected.
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:51.920]   And teens want to understand, they want the truth,
[02:01:51.920 --> 02:01:53.760]   they want the knowledge.
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:56.600]   I went to a school and asked whether if I came
[02:01:56.600 --> 02:01:58.360]   and talked about cannabis, would they come?
[02:01:58.360 --> 02:02:02.320]   And they said, "Absolutely, I want to understand it."
[02:02:02.320 --> 02:02:05.280]   And there's this great quote that I recently learned
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:09.120]   that said, basically the concept is
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:10.200]   if you don't teach teens,
[02:02:10.200 --> 02:02:11.880]   they're gonna seek out information.
[02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:16.200]   So the quote is, "Having teens learn about sex from porn
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:20.460]   "is like having them learn physics from the Transformers,
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:23.400]   "or having them learn how to drive from Fast and Furious."
[02:02:23.400 --> 02:02:25.640]   We need to give teens the information
[02:02:25.640 --> 02:02:27.080]   'cause they're gonna find it.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.320]   - That's right, they're being exposed
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:32.600]   to other information elsewhere anyway.
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:34.120]   So what you're talking about here
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:36.620]   is coming up with counterbalances.
[02:02:36.620 --> 02:02:40.520]   - Counterbalances, real science-based information
[02:02:40.520 --> 02:02:43.880]   that's not overblowing the risks, that's not scaring them.
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.400]   And then that helps them understand it's best to say no,
[02:02:47.400 --> 02:02:49.600]   but if you do, fentanyl,
[02:02:49.600 --> 02:02:51.540]   let's make sure you're not using alone.
[02:02:51.540 --> 02:02:54.300]   I mean, obviously I don't want somebody using a drug
[02:02:54.300 --> 02:02:57.480]   that hasn't been tested and they got off the internet,
[02:02:57.480 --> 02:02:59.800]   period, because I know kids who have died.
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:00.920]   - It's so scary.
[02:03:00.920 --> 02:03:05.720]   We have close friends that, gosh,
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:08.540]   I would have never guessed that their kids were using drugs.
[02:03:08.540 --> 02:03:11.380]   And maybe they were using drugs at the frequency
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:16.160]   that was always typical of youth, I don't know.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:17.620]   I don't know the situations well enough,
[02:03:17.620 --> 02:03:21.200]   but I would say about once every four,
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:26.200]   sadly, once every four to eight months,
[02:03:26.200 --> 02:03:30.420]   I hear about someone's kid or close relative
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:32.540]   that died of a fentanyl overdose.
[02:03:32.540 --> 02:03:36.740]   It does seem to be kids, maybe 30 and younger.
[02:03:36.740 --> 02:03:39.100]   - Yeah, it was more in the 20s and 30s.
[02:03:39.100 --> 02:03:42.220]   It's now really getting into the teens and young adults.
[02:03:42.220 --> 02:03:43.100]   You're absolutely right.
[02:03:43.100 --> 02:03:46.780]   And some of the teens I know of and young adults
[02:03:46.780 --> 02:03:49.620]   who have died were not your drug users.
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:51.840]   We talked about not stigmatizing.
[02:03:51.840 --> 02:03:52.840]   And that's the other thing.
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:54.760]   If we don't talk, then we're stigmatizing.
[02:03:54.760 --> 02:03:56.640]   We need to have those conversations.
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:58.440]   But a lot of those teens were not using.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:04:00.560]   They needed a pill 'cause they were in pain
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:03.520]   or they needed something, and they were not told,
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:04.960]   and this is, again, that harm reduction
[02:04:04.960 --> 02:04:07.760]   and that conversation, they were not told,
[02:04:07.760 --> 02:04:09.480]   don't buy something off of the internet.
[02:04:09.480 --> 02:04:13.760]   If you do, test it, and test it with a fentanyl strip,
[02:04:13.760 --> 02:04:16.520]   for example, and make sure that you're not using a loan
[02:04:16.520 --> 02:04:17.920]   because if you're using a loan,
[02:04:17.920 --> 02:04:20.300]   we can't then give you Narcan.
[02:04:20.300 --> 02:04:21.420]   We can't do something.
[02:04:21.420 --> 02:04:23.820]   I carry Narcan with me all the time.
[02:04:23.820 --> 02:04:24.940]   - Do you really? - I do.
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:26.660]   I have it in my backpack all the time.
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:29.260]   - For anyone that you might see that's having an overdose
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:31.060]   or kids in particular? - Anyone you might see.
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:32.860]   Yeah, thankfully it hasn't happened.
[02:04:32.860 --> 02:04:37.780]   But if it does, and you can't hurt somebody from using it
[02:04:37.780 --> 02:04:39.180]   if that's not what's happening.
[02:04:39.180 --> 02:04:40.980]   So use it. - Should everyone
[02:04:40.980 --> 02:04:43.580]   carry a Narcan pen? - I think everybody
[02:04:43.580 --> 02:04:44.920]   should have Narcan.
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:46.380]   I do. - Wow.
[02:04:46.380 --> 02:04:48.340]   - I think every school should have Narcan.
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:50.500]   I think every library should have Narcan.
[02:04:50.500 --> 02:04:53.260]   I think every bar should have Narcan.
[02:04:53.260 --> 02:04:55.400]   I absolutely believe it.
[02:04:55.400 --> 02:04:57.880]   Now test strips is an interesting debate that I've had.
[02:04:57.880 --> 02:05:00.980]   So I totally believe in this concept of comprehensive,
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:02.500]   if you don't wanna say harm reduction,
[02:05:02.500 --> 02:05:06.620]   comprehensive drug education, comprehensive sex education.
[02:05:06.620 --> 02:05:09.780]   And what I mean by that is both the spectrum of use
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:14.280]   or behavior as well as all kinds of drug, sex, rock and roll
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:16.700]   that we talk about the whole thing.
[02:05:16.700 --> 02:05:20.140]   But fentanyl test strips has been an interesting dilemma
[02:05:20.140 --> 02:05:22.660]   within myself, and I'll explain why.
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:25.220]   I've been working with some groups to try to test
[02:05:25.220 --> 02:05:29.700]   whether we could study whether if we put both Narcan
[02:05:29.700 --> 02:05:32.340]   and fentanyl test strips in schools,
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:33.740]   would teens get them?
[02:05:33.740 --> 02:05:37.900]   So my fantasy, bowl of condoms, bowl of Narcan,
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:41.700]   bowl of fentanyl test strips, and you have it out for teens.
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:44.020]   - Wow, that's a bold statement.
[02:05:44.020 --> 02:05:45.260]   It is a very bold statement.
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:47.460]   - What about the argument that I imagine
[02:05:47.460 --> 02:05:50.540]   some people counter with?
[02:05:50.540 --> 02:05:52.520]   I'm not necessarily saying this is my argument,
[02:05:52.520 --> 02:05:57.140]   but just imagining that some people will hear that and say,
[02:05:57.140 --> 02:06:01.380]   having those things visible, freely available,
[02:06:01.380 --> 02:06:04.660]   will create more of an incentive for risk-taking.
[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:05.980]   - So I've grappled with that.
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:09.260]   And with condoms, we know that that's not the case.
[02:06:09.260 --> 02:06:12.340]   It's not going to create teens starting to have sex.
[02:06:12.340 --> 02:06:14.740]   Just going back to what we were saying a few minutes ago,
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:17.580]   you're not going to incentivize or create people
[02:06:17.580 --> 02:06:20.980]   engaging in any risk behavior by having the conversation.
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:22.900]   But my grappling with the Narcan
[02:06:22.900 --> 02:06:25.620]   and with the fentanyl test strips has been there.
[02:06:25.620 --> 02:06:28.420]   Oh, well, you tell me it's a bad idea to use a drug,
[02:06:28.420 --> 02:06:31.020]   but I'll just test it and make sure it's okay.
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.580]   Well, I have a couple of problems with that,
[02:06:33.580 --> 02:06:34.820]   even though I still believe in it.
[02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.580]   I still believe in having those there
[02:06:36.580 --> 02:06:39.740]   because right now we have an overdose epidemic
[02:06:39.740 --> 02:06:41.700]   with fentanyl and other drugs.
[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:44.380]   So I'll be honest with you.
[02:06:44.380 --> 02:06:45.220]   I grapple.
[02:06:45.220 --> 02:06:48.180]   If I were in a school and I saw a teenager
[02:06:48.180 --> 02:06:50.400]   taking a fentanyl test strip,
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.940]   which probably means that they're going to use it
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:54.300]   for themselves, is the first thing I want to do,
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:56.340]   shake the kid and say, are you crazy?
[02:06:56.340 --> 02:06:57.260]   Don't.
[02:06:57.260 --> 02:06:59.300]   That means that you're thinking about using drugs.
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:01.820]   Of course, that's my inclination as a parent,
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:04.440]   as a scientist, as a developmental psychologist,
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:08.380]   as a human being, you want to say, what are you doing?
[02:07:08.380 --> 02:07:10.540]   So yes, I would grapple.
[02:07:10.540 --> 02:07:13.900]   But at the same time, if I know that there's a chance
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:16.620]   that a teen's gonna go to a party or pick up a drug
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:20.140]   and not know, would I rather that they're safe?
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:21.300]   Yes.
[02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:23.420]   The problem with fentanyl test strips though
[02:07:23.420 --> 02:07:26.420]   is that they're not perfect.
[02:07:26.420 --> 02:07:29.300]   If you are testing the right side of the pill,
[02:07:29.300 --> 02:07:31.780]   but it's the left side that has fentanyl,
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:33.020]   you still could die.
[02:07:33.020 --> 02:07:36.060]   And so I don't want to give the impression
[02:07:36.060 --> 02:07:41.060]   that one stop is going to fix anything right now.
[02:07:41.060 --> 02:07:42.740]   It is not.
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:45.580]   And that is the issue with the comprehensive
[02:07:45.580 --> 02:07:49.000]   drug education or harm reduction conversations.
[02:07:49.000 --> 02:07:50.840]   I'm not saying that it's perfect.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:54.300]   I'm not saying that it's going to stop young people
[02:07:54.300 --> 02:07:57.400]   from engaging or young people from getting hurt
[02:07:57.400 --> 02:08:00.620]   or unfortunately dying.
[02:08:00.620 --> 02:08:03.140]   But if you have a group of youth who are going to use,
[02:08:03.140 --> 02:08:06.780]   I would still rather arm them with that information
[02:08:06.780 --> 02:08:09.340]   so they don't find themselves in trouble.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:11.380]   That is the biggest part that scares me.
[02:08:11.380 --> 02:08:15.820]   - Is fentanyl making its way into all pharmaceuticals?
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.620]   Like benzos, MDMA.
[02:08:20.620 --> 02:08:21.540]   I'm thinking about some of the things
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:23.700]   that are taken recreationally.
[02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:27.620]   Benzos, MDMA, is it in cannabis?
[02:08:27.620 --> 02:08:31.420]   - So most of what I've seen is either by itself fentanyl
[02:08:31.420 --> 02:08:36.420]   using or that it's mixed into pain pills a lot.
[02:08:36.420 --> 02:08:38.020]   - Why would kids want to take pain pills?
[02:08:38.020 --> 02:08:38.860]   I mean-
[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:40.060]   - They're in pain, they're stressed.
[02:08:40.060 --> 02:08:40.900]   - I see.
[02:08:40.900 --> 02:08:43.880]   So they're doing it sort of self-directed clinical.
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:44.720]   - Correct.
[02:08:44.720 --> 02:08:46.340]   Or Prozac, they're anxious.
[02:08:46.340 --> 02:08:47.160]   - I see.
[02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:48.000]   So it's not like they're doing it
[02:08:48.000 --> 02:08:49.340]   for recreational drug use at parties.
[02:08:49.340 --> 02:08:51.100]   - Some are, some aren't.
[02:08:51.100 --> 02:08:53.980]   I mean, there's been so many different circumstances.
[02:08:53.980 --> 02:08:58.580]   Cannabis and vaping have been interesting debates.
[02:08:58.580 --> 02:09:01.300]   And we actually had this just the other day.
[02:09:01.300 --> 02:09:06.300]   Some of the studies suggest that biologically,
[02:09:06.300 --> 02:09:09.820]   we can't necessarily combine cannabis or nicotine
[02:09:09.820 --> 02:09:12.660]   and fentanyl and have the same reaction on the body.
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:15.720]   And some suggesting that the studies haven't been there.
[02:09:15.720 --> 02:09:18.260]   And it's still so new,
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:21.500]   but I will tell you that talking to teens
[02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:24.200]   and some studies suggesting that yes,
[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:26.700]   teens are combining or at least getting.
[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:28.540]   And a lot of times it's not knowingly.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:30.580]   It's cut, the fentanyl is cutting.
[02:09:30.580 --> 02:09:34.580]   Or the drug manufacturers and sellers
[02:09:34.580 --> 02:09:36.540]   are cutting a drug with fentanyl.
[02:09:36.540 --> 02:09:38.940]   And so they're not even, teens are knowing it.
[02:09:38.940 --> 02:09:42.580]   But that some, I was talking to a person the other day
[02:09:42.580 --> 02:09:45.240]   who said that he has definitely heard of
[02:09:45.240 --> 02:09:48.560]   and seen some teens with fentanyl overdoses
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:50.920]   from cannabis or from vaping.
[02:09:50.920 --> 02:09:54.140]   So there's so much studies that are still needed right now
[02:09:54.140 --> 02:09:56.860]   and to understand the biological mechanism
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:10:00.480]   as well as the access to these drugs that we don't know.
[02:10:00.480 --> 02:10:02.240]   But I'm nervous.
[02:10:02.240 --> 02:10:04.300]   So we teach about drug testing.
[02:10:04.300 --> 02:10:06.420]   We teach about not going something off.
[02:10:06.420 --> 02:10:10.180]   It used to be a skittle drug parties.
[02:10:10.180 --> 02:10:12.300]   You'd go with people would take drugs
[02:10:12.300 --> 02:10:15.580]   and all different things and put them in the middle of a bowl
[02:10:15.580 --> 02:10:18.060]   in the middle of the room and just you take whatever.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:18.900]   - Whoa.
[02:10:18.900 --> 02:10:19.740]   - Oh yeah.
[02:10:19.740 --> 02:10:20.560]   - When was that?
[02:10:20.560 --> 02:10:21.400]   - This is not long ago.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:22.240]   Maybe five, 10 years ago,
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:23.080]   I was hearing about these skittle parties.
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:25.420]   - I never went to a party like that.
[02:10:25.420 --> 02:10:27.540]   - I didn't either, but I didn't go to many parties.
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.220]   I was a pretty square kid.
[02:10:30.220 --> 02:10:31.300]   - It's interesting.
[02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:32.780]   Maybe it was just, or it was.
[02:10:32.780 --> 02:10:34.620]   I mean, there were certainly drugs around,
[02:10:34.620 --> 02:10:39.020]   but I feel like now recreational pharmacology,
[02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.260]   it sounds like it's everywhere.
[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:41.260]   So different.
[02:10:41.260 --> 02:10:44.500]   - Yeah, and self-medication is everywhere.
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:46.260]   - That wasn't common.
[02:10:46.260 --> 02:10:47.620]   - That wasn't as common.
[02:10:47.620 --> 02:10:50.220]   - Or if it was, people weren't talking about it.
[02:10:50.220 --> 02:10:51.060]   - I think it was.
[02:10:51.060 --> 02:10:52.980]   I mean, I remember as a middle school student
[02:10:52.980 --> 02:10:55.140]   walking into the bathroom and somebody had taken,
[02:10:55.140 --> 02:10:58.360]   I think what's called a lewd then and had passed out.
[02:10:58.360 --> 02:11:02.780]   It was certainly around, different drugs,
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:05.100]   but not the same that we're seeing now.
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:08.740]   And we definitely saw cocaine overdoses when I was younger.
[02:11:08.740 --> 02:11:12.900]   - Yeah, I feel like there was a lot of weed, cannabis,
[02:11:12.900 --> 02:11:17.900]   that is alcohol, psilocybin then as a recreational drug.
[02:11:17.900 --> 02:11:21.580]   Now, obviously it's being explored as a clinical tool,
[02:11:21.580 --> 02:11:23.260]   as is cannabis for that matter.
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:29.540]   But hard drugs like cocaine, amphetamine,
[02:11:29.540 --> 02:11:32.940]   PCP were discussed in the media a lot,
[02:11:32.940 --> 02:11:35.340]   and it certainly existed in some high schools and colleges
[02:11:35.340 --> 02:11:36.160]   and things like that,
[02:11:36.160 --> 02:11:39.260]   but it sounds like it's seeping out of everywhere.
[02:11:39.260 --> 02:11:40.100]   - It is.
[02:11:40.100 --> 02:11:41.820]   - And it's in these commercial products.
[02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:43.900]   I mean, I think the picture that has been created here
[02:11:43.900 --> 02:11:46.380]   is kind of an ominous one.
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:49.420]   So how optimistic are you?
[02:11:49.420 --> 02:11:53.820]   - I will tell you, I'm optimistic in seeing a change
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:56.300]   in the landscape of education.
[02:11:56.300 --> 02:11:58.020]   Now, some people say education doesn't work,
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:00.580]   that we need policies, we need both.
[02:12:00.580 --> 02:12:03.420]   I mean, we have federal policies and regulations
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:05.380]   that are slipping through the cracks,
[02:12:05.380 --> 02:12:09.300]   FDA with regulation of e-cigarettes,
[02:12:09.300 --> 02:12:13.780]   with cannabis legalization, but not being enforced.
[02:12:13.780 --> 02:12:17.320]   We have age restrictions not being enforced.
[02:12:17.320 --> 02:12:18.740]   So we certainly need education,
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:20.340]   and I'm seeing more and more people,
[02:12:20.340 --> 02:12:23.460]   for example, the concept of harm reduction
[02:12:23.460 --> 02:12:26.220]   or comprehensive education, comprehensive sex ed,
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:29.160]   not everybody's, of course, up for it or open to it,
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:30.580]   but I'm seeing more of a shift
[02:12:30.580 --> 02:12:32.340]   towards understanding the need.
[02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:34.180]   I'm definitely seeing more teens,
[02:12:34.180 --> 02:12:35.340]   as we were talking about earlier,
[02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:38.260]   more teens being willing to say,
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:40.620]   "No, that's not something I'm gonna do."
[02:12:40.620 --> 02:12:42.620]   More teens joining youth groups,
[02:12:42.620 --> 02:12:46.140]   more teens speaking out about concerns
[02:12:46.140 --> 02:12:47.460]   and trying to be healthier
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:49.860]   and make healthier decisions for themselves.
[02:12:49.860 --> 02:12:52.340]   So I'm optimistic in the human capital
[02:12:52.340 --> 02:12:54.060]   and the social capital.
[02:12:54.060 --> 02:12:57.100]   I'm not optimistic when it comes to the pharmacology
[02:12:57.100 --> 02:13:00.260]   or the drug capital, so to speak.
[02:13:00.260 --> 02:13:04.140]   More and more drugs infiltrating our youth.
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:07.420]   I mean, you could vape dot, dot, dot anything nowadays,
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:09.220]   and that makes me very nervous.
[02:13:09.220 --> 02:13:11.940]   I do think vaping, and I am using vaping
[02:13:11.940 --> 02:13:14.100]   instead of e-cigarettes there to be more lay,
[02:13:14.100 --> 02:13:17.620]   conversations there or what the culture is saying.
[02:13:17.620 --> 02:13:22.100]   Vaping is just more normalized than we've ever had it,
[02:13:22.100 --> 02:13:24.580]   just like smoking was normalized.
[02:13:24.580 --> 02:13:27.140]   Vaping, and now vaping anything,
[02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:29.780]   is very scary to me and very much normalized.
[02:13:29.780 --> 02:13:31.540]   So that worries me.
[02:13:31.540 --> 02:13:33.940]   Again, the fentanyl, the hallucinogens
[02:13:33.940 --> 02:13:36.660]   making its way more and more.
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:41.540]   So the drugs themselves and the new devices scares me.
[02:13:41.540 --> 02:13:45.420]   The social and the human capital gives me optimism.
[02:13:45.420 --> 02:13:47.780]   - Very grateful to hear that you have optimism.
[02:13:47.780 --> 02:13:50.940]   Sounds to me, and correct me where I'm wrong, please,
[02:13:50.940 --> 02:13:54.580]   and add anything, that for parents, for siblings,
[02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:58.140]   for teachers, for educators, or for any concerned citizen,
[02:13:58.140 --> 02:14:01.580]   it seems like having conversations about these things,
[02:14:01.580 --> 02:14:03.140]   the fact that they're happening,
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:05.100]   so not turning a blind eye,
[02:14:05.100 --> 02:14:09.340]   the fact that kids are aware of it,
[02:14:11.060 --> 02:14:12.220]   that we're fooling ourselves
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:13.460]   if we think that they aren't aware
[02:14:13.460 --> 02:14:14.980]   of these risk-taking behaviors,
[02:14:14.980 --> 02:14:18.740]   they're sort of, they're all around them anyway,
[02:14:18.740 --> 02:14:21.060]   so we shouldn't shy away from those conversations,
[02:14:21.060 --> 02:14:23.380]   and that at least having a conversation
[02:14:23.380 --> 02:14:26.340]   about the difference between avoiding behaviors
[02:14:26.340 --> 02:14:29.500]   and harm reduction is something that one ought to consider.
[02:14:29.500 --> 02:14:32.420]   I mean, obviously, this is a household by household choice.
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:33.340]   - Absolutely.
[02:14:33.340 --> 02:14:34.660]   - In some cases, school by school
[02:14:34.660 --> 02:14:35.900]   or classroom by classroom choice,
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:39.000]   but certainly household, maybe even parent by parent choice,
[02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.080]   but that because of social media
[02:14:41.080 --> 02:14:43.000]   and just because of the nature of youth
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:46.160]   that young people are having these conversations anyway.
[02:14:46.160 --> 02:14:47.840]   That's what I'm hearing coming through,
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:52.180]   and that you said, don't formalize the conversation so much
[02:14:52.180 --> 02:14:53.560]   that Saturday at three o'clock,
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:55.240]   we're gonna have a discussion about drugs,
[02:14:55.240 --> 02:14:58.080]   but make it part of the landscape to create some ease,
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:03.840]   make it facile to talk about these things, concerns,
[02:15:03.840 --> 02:15:05.720]   and probably listen to them too.
[02:15:05.720 --> 02:15:08.200]   They're right there in the midst of it,
[02:15:08.200 --> 02:15:09.960]   so they have a dataset internally
[02:15:09.960 --> 02:15:12.560]   about what's actually happening.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:15.440]   - Totally agree, totally agree.
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:18.360]   And I often say to parents or educators,
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.560]   if they're listening to this podcast or anything,
[02:15:21.560 --> 02:15:24.920]   it's actually say, hey, I learned something.
[02:15:24.920 --> 02:15:28.560]   Can we have a conversation about what I learned?
[02:15:28.560 --> 02:15:30.240]   And not confront.
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:33.320]   Again, it's a conversation, not a confrontation.
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:36.200]   It's let's normalize drug discussions,
[02:15:36.200 --> 02:15:39.800]   let's normalize behavior discussions,
[02:15:39.800 --> 02:15:42.920]   not normalize the use or the behavior itself.
[02:15:42.920 --> 02:15:46.040]   So talk to your teens, you're absolutely right.
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:47.120]   Talk to your teens.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:48.640]   This is what I just learned.
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:49.740]   What do you know?
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:52.320]   Can we find out some information together?
[02:15:52.320 --> 02:15:56.680]   Go on our Reach Lab websites, go on other websites,
[02:15:56.680 --> 02:15:59.920]   go learn information out there, learn together,
[02:15:59.920 --> 02:16:03.460]   and not lecture, but have a conversation.
[02:16:03.460 --> 02:16:04.840]   You may not know right away.
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:06.440]   A teen may not tell you right away,
[02:16:06.440 --> 02:16:08.480]   yes, I'm using, or yes, I'm having sex,
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:10.880]   or yes, I'm drinking alcohol, or yes, I'm doing something.
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:13.880]   That is just a risky behavior.
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:16.240]   But that's not necessarily our goal as adults
[02:16:16.240 --> 02:16:18.600]   to find out today whether or not
[02:16:18.600 --> 02:16:20.480]   somebody is doing something.
[02:16:20.480 --> 02:16:23.240]   It's okay to let it be a little bit more organic.
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:26.240]   It's okay to start that conversation
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:28.940]   and see that you're building trust.
[02:16:28.940 --> 02:16:30.400]   It is parent to parent,
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:32.680]   but I would say I'm not gonna bust you.
[02:16:32.680 --> 02:16:34.320]   Certainly I'm not gonna be happy,
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:35.640]   but let's have a conversation
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:37.120]   so that way we can build the trust,
[02:16:37.120 --> 02:16:41.680]   and I can help you either not use, get help,
[02:16:41.680 --> 02:16:44.520]   stop using, or be safer in using,
[02:16:44.520 --> 02:16:46.800]   or help you prevent from using at all.
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:49.400]   So having that conversation, that organic,
[02:16:49.400 --> 02:16:52.040]   and talking to teens where they're at.
[02:16:52.040 --> 02:16:53.960]   As a developmentalist, that's what we do.
[02:16:53.960 --> 02:16:56.040]   Meet people where they're at.
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.400]   Meet youth where they're at,
[02:16:57.400 --> 02:17:00.600]   whether that's using already, not using.
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:02.760]   Don't come at them with your preconceived notions
[02:17:02.760 --> 02:17:05.720]   as an adult because it will not work.
[02:17:05.720 --> 02:17:07.320]   It will backfire.
[02:17:07.320 --> 02:17:08.800]   We need to use the strengths.
[02:17:08.800 --> 02:17:10.320]   Young people are strong.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:12.000]   Young people are smart.
[02:17:12.000 --> 02:17:14.960]   We need to use their strengths, take their lead,
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.440]   and then use our adult wisdom and experiences
[02:17:17.440 --> 02:17:20.400]   to then turn that into the proper conversation.
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:21.400]   - Love it.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:24.880]   Well, on the topic of conversation and communication,
[02:17:24.880 --> 02:17:27.940]   one of the kind of unique features of this podcast
[02:17:27.940 --> 02:17:32.440]   is that we have a large social media footprint,
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:34.520]   and inside of that footprint,
[02:17:34.520 --> 02:17:36.600]   we not only broadcast information,
[02:17:36.600 --> 02:17:37.900]   but we get information back.
[02:17:37.900 --> 02:17:41.240]   So in anticipation of this conversation today,
[02:17:41.240 --> 02:17:45.240]   I reached out to followers of Huberman Lab Social Media
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:48.520]   on X, formerly known as Twitter, and Instagram,
[02:17:48.520 --> 02:17:50.460]   and they had a lot of questions for you.
[02:17:50.460 --> 02:17:52.520]   We don't have time to go into the many thousands
[02:17:52.520 --> 02:17:55.960]   of questions, but I'm gonna just ask you, if I may,
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:17:59.100]   in kind of a short Q&A format, a few of them,
[02:17:59.100 --> 02:18:01.120]   and if you don't have answers, you can just say pass,
[02:18:01.120 --> 02:18:03.400]   we'll get back to that, maybe we'll do another episode
[02:18:03.400 --> 02:18:04.560]   another time.
[02:18:04.560 --> 02:18:08.780]   Please don't feel obligated to give thorough answers.
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:10.960]   This is, we just wouldn't have time.
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.580]   Yeah, so one of the top questions is,
[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:17.840]   "Would love to learn more about how to get teens
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:21.240]   "to see the longer-term implications of the choices they make
[02:18:21.240 --> 02:18:23.400]   "and the habits they form now.
[02:18:23.400 --> 02:18:26.520]   "Is there any way to get them to understand
[02:18:26.520 --> 02:18:28.560]   "how now leads to later?"
[02:18:29.680 --> 02:18:32.000]   We've done studies where we've asked teens
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:35.800]   about their goals, and I wanna be a dancer,
[02:18:35.800 --> 02:18:38.800]   we had one teen tell us, or I wanna be a doctor,
[02:18:38.800 --> 02:18:41.640]   or I want to be whatever it is.
[02:18:41.640 --> 02:18:45.640]   Asking teens about their goals, about their aspirations,
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:48.520]   and then connecting their current behavior
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:52.240]   and their current risks, and keeping themselves healthy,
[02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.780]   and how that plays into their goals.
[02:18:54.780 --> 02:18:57.240]   That tends to work a lot, and we've seen that
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:00.000]   in our studies, teens set boundaries.
[02:19:00.000 --> 02:19:02.760]   I don't wanna get pregnant 'cause I wanna be a dancer,
[02:19:02.760 --> 02:19:06.200]   things like that, so really linking what they're doing now
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:08.320]   to their ultimate goals is one way
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:10.320]   to really help them think that through.
[02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:14.100]   - I like that, how a different, maybe even larger goal,
[02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:19.920]   maybe could supersede these short-term behaviors,
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:21.680]   and they could see how those things link up.
[02:19:21.680 --> 02:19:23.840]   - Absolutely. - That's great.
[02:19:23.840 --> 02:19:26.480]   There's another question that came in,
[02:19:26.480 --> 02:19:30.480]   requesting some positive news about teenagers to be shared.
[02:19:30.480 --> 02:19:33.000]   Quote, every discussion is around risk or emotional distress
[02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:35.440]   or social anxiety or phone addiction,
[02:19:35.440 --> 02:19:37.800]   as if they're all dysfunctional because of their brains.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:40.280]   We never dismiss toddlers learning to talk and walk
[02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:41.760]   because their brains are offline.
[02:19:41.760 --> 02:19:44.200]   So I think the point is that, you know,
[02:19:44.200 --> 02:19:45.560]   can we highlight some of the ways
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:50.400]   in which the adolescent/teen brain is exceptional
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.160]   at something that perhaps the rest
[02:19:52.160 --> 02:19:54.580]   of the brains out there are not?
[02:19:54.580 --> 02:19:57.180]   - So I mentioned some of them around our youth group
[02:19:57.180 --> 02:20:00.160]   and about the youth movement now against drugs
[02:20:00.160 --> 02:20:01.240]   and other things.
[02:20:01.240 --> 02:20:03.540]   I think, and it comes to the optimism,
[02:20:03.540 --> 02:20:06.880]   I'm the biggest teen advocate out there.
[02:20:06.880 --> 02:20:09.520]   It's why I study adolescents and I do the prevention
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:11.680]   and advocacy work that I do.
[02:20:11.680 --> 02:20:15.840]   Teenagers are fundamentally fantastic.
[02:20:15.840 --> 02:20:19.040]   They're creative, they're passionate.
[02:20:19.040 --> 02:20:20.920]   Teens care about the environment.
[02:20:20.920 --> 02:20:25.340]   Kids really, teens really care about social justice.
[02:20:25.340 --> 02:20:28.780]   Teens do care about our future and our planet.
[02:20:28.780 --> 02:20:33.600]   That is wonderful, well more than do adults right now.
[02:20:33.600 --> 02:20:36.240]   So I think we should be capitalizing on that.
[02:20:36.240 --> 02:20:38.220]   Teens are incredibly creative.
[02:20:38.220 --> 02:20:41.760]   We need to be working with teens and young adults
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:45.420]   in everything that we do because they are our future.
[02:20:45.420 --> 02:20:48.500]   And I don't mean that as a cliche, I really mean that.
[02:20:48.500 --> 02:20:51.340]   So having the conversation, let them be part
[02:20:51.340 --> 02:20:55.500]   of that conversation, help them find out what they think
[02:20:55.500 --> 02:20:57.740]   we should do to solve some of the problems.
[02:20:57.740 --> 02:20:59.180]   They're the ones to talk to.
[02:20:59.180 --> 02:21:01.860]   So I am very optimistic about teenagers.
[02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:05.260]   We have 40 teenagers and young adults who work with us
[02:21:05.260 --> 02:21:08.380]   all the time in our work because we trust them.
[02:21:08.380 --> 02:21:11.900]   So I think some people are afraid of teens, I embrace them.
[02:21:11.900 --> 02:21:13.740]   I think they're fantastic.
[02:21:13.740 --> 02:21:15.240]   - Love it.
[02:21:15.240 --> 02:21:17.600]   Do we know how vaping shapes the teen brain?
[02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:20.540]   In other words, are there any known biological changes
[02:21:20.540 --> 02:21:23.840]   in the developing brain as a consequence of vaping?
[02:21:23.840 --> 02:21:26.060]   And here I'm going to assume it's vaping nicotine,
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:29.700]   but we talked about cannabis as it relates
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:31.980]   to psychosis earlier.
[02:21:31.980 --> 02:21:34.780]   So let's just keep it restricted to nicotine.
[02:21:34.780 --> 02:21:38.180]   - Sure, well we know that during the adolescence
[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:41.020]   that nicotine changes the brain wiring.
[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:42.320]   And what do I mean by that?
[02:21:42.320 --> 02:21:44.620]   We're actually born with the nicotinic receptors.
[02:21:44.620 --> 02:21:47.340]   We're born with the ability to become addicted to nicotine.
[02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:50.780]   Same thing with the cannabis you were talking about before.
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:54.060]   So if we don't, during the adolescent time
[02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:58.260]   when we're pruning away and getting rid of the connections,
[02:21:58.260 --> 02:22:00.260]   the neurons that we don't need,
[02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:03.100]   what happens is during that process,
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:04.260]   anything that we don't use,
[02:22:04.260 --> 02:22:06.460]   that we don't reinforce goes away.
[02:22:06.460 --> 02:22:09.180]   Well, if we introduce nicotine into our brain,
[02:22:09.180 --> 02:22:12.460]   it solidifies, it keeps that receptor there
[02:22:12.460 --> 02:22:15.460]   and also makes it to where our receptor is really kind of,
[02:22:15.460 --> 02:22:18.980]   I think of it as like keys and locks in a key
[02:22:18.980 --> 02:22:21.420]   and suddenly you've got that receptor and it says,
[02:22:21.420 --> 02:22:23.300]   ooh, you're putting nicotine in there,
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:25.260]   keep that in there or cups.
[02:22:25.260 --> 02:22:28.260]   It's developing those cups I often think about
[02:22:28.260 --> 02:22:30.260]   and filling those cups with nicotine
[02:22:30.260 --> 02:22:32.940]   and those cups are your receptors that were already there.
[02:22:32.940 --> 02:22:35.780]   You then take away that nicotine and your cups say,
[02:22:35.780 --> 02:22:37.180]   I need more.
[02:22:37.180 --> 02:22:38.980]   So you're rewiring your brain,
[02:22:38.980 --> 02:22:40.860]   you're wiring your brain to be more likely
[02:22:40.860 --> 02:22:43.740]   to become addicted and now you're addicted
[02:22:43.740 --> 02:22:47.740]   and you need to keep feeding those cups with nicotine
[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:49.340]   or you're gonna go through withdrawal.
[02:22:49.340 --> 02:22:52.580]   And so that is what is happening during an adolescent
[02:22:52.580 --> 02:22:55.620]   and young adult that we don't see in adults.
[02:22:55.620 --> 02:22:57.740]   That's why we really want to keep young people
[02:22:57.740 --> 02:23:00.540]   away from nicotine as long as possible.
[02:23:00.540 --> 02:23:02.140]   - A lot of questions about,
[02:23:02.140 --> 02:23:05.300]   are there negative effects of pornography
[02:23:05.300 --> 02:23:06.980]   on the developing brain?
[02:23:06.980 --> 02:23:08.620]   I imagine there's a lot of literature on that.
[02:23:08.620 --> 02:23:10.460]   - Yeah, I don't know as much actually
[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:12.980]   in the developing brain, I'm sure there is.
[02:23:12.980 --> 02:23:14.660]   I don't know it, there is,
[02:23:14.660 --> 02:23:18.660]   but there's clear evidence about viewing pornography
[02:23:18.660 --> 02:23:21.940]   around just not having good healthy sexual relationships
[02:23:21.940 --> 02:23:24.060]   because porn is not normal.
[02:23:24.060 --> 02:23:27.860]   It is not a normal relationship between two people.
[02:23:27.860 --> 02:23:31.020]   What you are doing is really making it so that way you,
[02:23:31.020 --> 02:23:34.900]   you're not necessarily developing a healthy relationship
[02:23:34.900 --> 02:23:37.100]   with your partner because you're assuming
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:39.100]   some gold standard out there
[02:23:39.100 --> 02:23:41.340]   that may or may not be able to be achieved.
[02:23:41.340 --> 02:23:45.860]   So, and it also is also a problem with body shaming
[02:23:45.860 --> 02:23:48.620]   and the body types that most people don't have
[02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:49.620]   and can't achieve.
[02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:54.620]   And that's another problem out there with pornography.
[02:23:54.620 --> 02:23:57.020]   - A lot of questions about how social media
[02:23:57.020 --> 02:23:58.380]   impacts brain development.
[02:23:58.380 --> 02:24:00.460]   That's probably an entire episode unto itself.
[02:24:00.460 --> 02:24:02.740]   - It is, it is, that we could do another time.
[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:05.380]   - And we should, and if you'd be so gracious
[02:24:05.380 --> 02:24:07.340]   to come back and do that, we will.
[02:24:07.340 --> 02:24:10.940]   I think as of just a final question,
[02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:14.740]   is there any information about potential causality
[02:24:14.740 --> 02:24:18.460]   between the mental health crisis that we observe in youth
[02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:21.340]   and let's just say substance use
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:25.540]   of the sorts that we talked about today?
[02:24:25.540 --> 02:24:27.820]   Obviously the directionality is tricky there.
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:30.580]   You can imagine that a lot of high GCC cannabis use
[02:24:30.580 --> 02:24:31.700]   is leading to more psychosis,
[02:24:31.700 --> 02:24:35.420]   but it seems more likely that kids are self-medicating
[02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.860]   in the face of like immense challenge,
[02:24:37.860 --> 02:24:42.420]   not just lockdowns and the culture around isolating kids
[02:24:42.420 --> 02:24:46.160]   from other kids and the stress that was on everybody,
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:51.540]   stress generally, the sociopolitical landscape, social media.
[02:24:51.540 --> 02:24:56.140]   I mean, it's hard to not feel like it's at least a cloudier,
[02:24:56.140 --> 02:24:58.940]   maybe a darker time than it used to be, but I don't know.
[02:24:58.940 --> 02:25:01.520]   I mean, humans have evolved through a lot.
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:05.180]   And I don't know that it's also fair to say
[02:25:05.180 --> 02:25:08.060]   that everyone's bummed out about what they see.
[02:25:08.060 --> 02:25:11.020]   Presumably there's still some optimists out there.
[02:25:11.020 --> 02:25:15.540]   - So absolutely, there are plenty of studies
[02:25:15.540 --> 02:25:18.100]   that show the bidirectional relationship
[02:25:18.100 --> 02:25:20.520]   between anxiety, depression, mental health,
[02:25:20.520 --> 02:25:21.780]   and substance use.
[02:25:21.780 --> 02:25:25.140]   You're right, a lot of teens are self-medicating
[02:25:25.140 --> 02:25:28.620]   by using various substances to reduce their anxiety,
[02:25:28.620 --> 02:25:32.220]   reduce their stress, and also just social lubrication,
[02:25:32.220 --> 02:25:34.900]   right, of going into a party and pre-gaming
[02:25:34.900 --> 02:25:36.620]   or going into a party and using drugs
[02:25:36.620 --> 02:25:38.980]   to make themselves less stiff,
[02:25:38.980 --> 02:25:41.700]   less stressed during that situation.
[02:25:41.700 --> 02:25:43.020]   But more what we're talking about
[02:25:43.020 --> 02:25:44.140]   is that they're self-medicating
[02:25:44.140 --> 02:25:46.420]   because they're feeling sad or uncomfortable,
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:48.260]   and this is, they think helping them.
[02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:50.900]   Again, it's not helping, it's making them feel less bad
[02:25:50.900 --> 02:25:52.740]   by continuing to use.
[02:25:52.740 --> 02:25:55.260]   But we also do know that drugs also lead
[02:25:55.260 --> 02:25:58.980]   to suicidal ideations, suicide attempts,
[02:25:58.980 --> 02:26:01.420]   psychosis, and other mental health issues.
[02:26:01.420 --> 02:26:04.780]   We also know that drugs lead to reduced academic achievement
[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:09.100]   even though there's some potential
[02:26:09.100 --> 02:26:11.660]   cognitive reinforcement that's going on,
[02:26:11.660 --> 02:26:14.640]   there's also some issues with lack of concentration.
[02:26:14.640 --> 02:26:16.580]   The other piece, by the way,
[02:26:16.580 --> 02:26:17.900]   that we don't really talk about a lot,
[02:26:17.900 --> 02:26:20.900]   but it's the co-use, that we're seeing a lot of teens
[02:26:20.900 --> 02:26:24.400]   not just using multiple products, but using them together.
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:27.980]   So a lot of teens who are chasing cannabis and tobacco
[02:26:27.980 --> 02:26:29.620]   because it enhances the high,
[02:26:29.620 --> 02:26:32.180]   or they're using cannabis with alcohol
[02:26:32.180 --> 02:26:36.380]   and other mixing of drugs, which is enhancing the high,
[02:26:36.380 --> 02:26:40.100]   but not in a good way and very scary for young people.
[02:26:40.100 --> 02:26:42.420]   And a lot of times, young people don't even realize,
[02:26:42.420 --> 02:26:45.500]   like with blunts, which is truly, as I was saying before,
[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:48.040]   using nicotine and cannabis together,
[02:26:48.040 --> 02:26:49.460]   that you're actually becoming addicted
[02:26:49.460 --> 02:26:53.060]   to both products really simultaneously.
[02:26:53.060 --> 02:26:54.860]   And that we're seeing young people
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:57.740]   who are having mental health issues and depression
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:00.120]   were likely to use both products.
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.780]   So definitely linkages there amongst mental health issues
[02:27:04.780 --> 02:27:06.740]   and multiple products as well.
[02:27:06.740 --> 02:27:08.500]   - So polypharmacology.
[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:09.340]   - Yeah.
[02:27:09.340 --> 02:27:12.620]   - Well, I don't wanna end on a down note,
[02:27:12.620 --> 02:27:14.520]   but I don't think it's a down note.
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:18.180]   I think what you've done today in sharing with us
[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:21.380]   that the realistic landscape of what's happening out there
[02:27:21.380 --> 02:27:24.380]   and the realistic landscape of what you're trying to do
[02:27:24.380 --> 02:27:29.380]   to ameliorate these issues is nothing short of spectacular,
[02:27:29.380 --> 02:27:34.820]   meaning as cloudy as it may seem in our youth,
[02:27:34.820 --> 02:27:40.580]   there's also great hope in everything that you're conveying,
[02:27:40.580 --> 02:27:43.940]   which is, to put it simply,
[02:27:43.940 --> 02:27:47.500]   why would you be trying so hard to fix these problems
[02:27:47.500 --> 02:27:49.920]   if you didn't believe that they could be fixed?
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:52.740]   So I find great optimism in the message.
[02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:54.900]   I also, I like data.
[02:27:54.900 --> 02:27:58.460]   And you've shared with us a tremendous amount of data
[02:27:58.460 --> 02:28:03.300]   about what's happening, what likely needs to change,
[02:28:03.300 --> 02:28:07.500]   and the optimal change and optimal route to change,
[02:28:07.500 --> 02:28:11.620]   as well as some realistic, perhaps less than optimal,
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:12.800]   but realistic approaches.
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:15.180]   Like sometimes it's just a matter of harm reduction.
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:16.180]   We're not gonna eliminate
[02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:20.180]   these potentially dangerous behaviors or dangerous behaviors.
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:22.580]   So for all of that, I wanna say thank you.
[02:28:22.580 --> 02:28:24.540]   It's a tremendous gift to us all.
[02:28:24.540 --> 02:28:27.280]   And I know that we have a lot of parents and kids
[02:28:27.280 --> 02:28:32.180]   and non-parents and every age and background
[02:28:32.180 --> 02:28:33.380]   that listen to this podcast.
[02:28:33.380 --> 02:28:35.580]   And what's clear to me is that it's going to be
[02:28:35.580 --> 02:28:38.720]   a community effort to try and face all this.
[02:28:38.720 --> 02:28:40.800]   And I keep hearing in the back of my mind
[02:28:40.800 --> 02:28:42.740]   this thing that you've said several times now,
[02:28:42.740 --> 02:28:45.900]   that kids know what's happening.
[02:28:45.900 --> 02:28:47.720]   We have to have these conversations.
[02:28:47.720 --> 02:28:51.500]   They're hard conversations to have for any of us.
[02:28:51.500 --> 02:28:53.720]   They're uncomfortable for adults to have,
[02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:58.180]   but that until we normalize at least the conversation,
[02:28:58.180 --> 02:29:00.100]   it's unlikely that we're gonna solve these problems.
[02:29:00.100 --> 02:29:02.260]   So thank you for your incredible efforts
[02:29:02.260 --> 02:29:05.980]   in the research domain and also for helping to normalize
[02:29:05.980 --> 02:29:07.540]   and bring about these conversations.
[02:29:07.540 --> 02:29:09.140]   They're oh so important.
[02:29:09.140 --> 02:29:10.060]   Thank you so much.
[02:29:10.060 --> 02:29:11.700]   - Thank you very much.

[02:29:56.820 --> 02:29:58.560]   I do read all the comments.
[02:29:58.560 --> 02:29:59.920]   Not so much on today's episode,
[02:29:59.920 --> 02:30:02.680]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:30:02.680 --> 02:30:04.020]   we discussed supplements.
[02:30:04.020 --> 02:30:06.060]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:30:06.060 --> 02:30:07.980]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:30:07.980 --> 02:30:09.460]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:30:09.460 --> 02:30:11.380]   for hormone support and for focus.
[02:30:11.380 --> 02:30:12.620]   To learn more about the supplements
[02:30:12.620 --> 02:30:14.460]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:30:14.460 --> 02:30:16.960]   you can go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S.
[02:30:16.960 --> 02:30:19.880]   So that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:22.100]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:30:22.100 --> 02:30:24.900]   I'm Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:30:24.900 --> 02:30:28.060]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and threads.
[02:30:28.060 --> 02:30:29.940]   And on all of those platforms,
[02:30:29.940 --> 02:30:32.000]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:33.520]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:30:33.520 --> 02:30:34.900]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:36.820]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:38.340]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:30:38.340 --> 02:30:41.360]   Again, that's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[02:30:41.360 --> 02:30:42.500]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:44.260]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:30:44.260 --> 02:30:45.560]   our Neural Network newsletter
[02:30:45.560 --> 02:30:47.200]   is a zero cost monthly newsletter
[02:30:47.200 --> 02:30:49.040]   that includes podcast summaries,
[02:30:49.040 --> 02:30:50.880]   as well as brief protocols in the form
[02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:52.720]   of one to three page PDFs,
[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:54.920]   covering everything from deliberate cold exposure
[02:30:54.920 --> 02:30:56.920]   to a foundational fitness protocol,
[02:30:56.920 --> 02:30:59.060]   optimizing and managing your dopamine,
[02:30:59.060 --> 02:31:00.420]   neuroplasticity and learning,
[02:31:00.420 --> 02:31:02.400]   all of which is completely zero cost.
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:05.300]   And to sign up, you simply go to HubermanLab.com,
[02:31:05.300 --> 02:31:07.640]   go to the menu tab, scroll down to newsletter,
[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:08.860]   and supply your email.
[02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:11.120]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:31:11.120 --> 02:31:13.560]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion
[02:31:13.560 --> 02:31:15.540]   with Dr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher.
[02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:17.680]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:19.680]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:31:19.680 --> 02:31:22.260]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:22.260 --> 02:31:24.840]   (upbeat music)
