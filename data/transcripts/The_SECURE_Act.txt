[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and happy 2020.
[00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.320]   Happy New Year.
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.840]   Can you believe that the decade is over and a new one has begun?
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.840]   I'm pretty pumped.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.980]   I'm actually really, really pumped.
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.940]   It's kind of like season two of your favorite Netflix show where I'm going to go on this
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:23.440]   new journey, and I hope you guys go on a great new journey as well and accomplish a ton of
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.640]   stuff.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.240]   So there's been a lot of stuff going on since the last podcast, and I just want to do a
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.360]   little recap and also talk about what I plan to do over the next three years.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.160]   So while we were relaxing and enjoying each other's company and the holidays, the SECURE
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.160]   Act passed.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.840]   And I think it's somewhat interesting.
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.320]   It's a net positive for most Americans and their retirement planning strategy at the
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320]   margin.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.080]   There are several things you should be aware of.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.480]   The first thing is the required minimum distribution starts at age 72 from 70 and a half.
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.600]   So that means there's another one and a half years of tax advantageous compounding of your
[00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.280]   accounts before you have to start withdrawing and therefore before you have to start paying
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.640]   taxes.
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.080]   So that's pretty good.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.000]   Given that our population as a whole is living longer, extending the RMD from 70 and a half
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.080]   to 72 makes sense.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.520]   We should be allowed to have our investments compound tax free for a longer period to pay
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.720]   for our longer lives.
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.400]   So your goal is to amass a large enough taxable retirement portfolio so that you can wait
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.160]   until 72 to withdraw from your retirement funds.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.080]   And of course, your goal should be to try to live as long past 72 as possible.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.040]   The second change due to the SECURE Act is pre-tax contributions can be made to your
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.600]   traditional IRA after age 70 and a half.
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.240]   So that's pretty good as well.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.360]   But it's kind of like a two-sided coin here.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.440]   One, if you're fortunate enough to still have the energy, ability, and desire to still have
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.400]   a W-2 income after age 70 and a half, that's good.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.160]   Just contribute to your traditional IRA.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.680]   But if you still have to contribute money to your IRA when you're 70 and a half plus,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.140]   I think that kind of sucks unless you really, really like your job.
[00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.240]   So the maximum IRA contribution for 2020 is $6,000, which is the same as in 2019.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.880]   I don't know why the government didn't raise that contribution limit as it raised the 401(k)
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.200]   contribution maximum limit to $19,500.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.600]   The IRA catch-up contribution limit will remain $1,000 for those age 50 and older for a maximum
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.560]   possible IRA contribution of $7,000 in 2020.
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.480]   The thing that bums me out most about the IRA is that the government still doesn't allow
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.920]   all Americans to contribute to a traditional IRA with pre-tax income.
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.800]   For some reason, it believes that once a single individual makes over $139,000 a year in 2020
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.880]   for a Roth IRA or more than $70,000 for a traditional IRA, they no longer want or need
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.800]   to save for retirement because the government says they're not allowed.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.080]   Well, for a traditional IRA, you can, but it's just not going to be with pre-tax money.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.600]   And for the Roth IRA, you cannot.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:15.440]   And so I just want everybody to realize the weird standards the government is giving to
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.440]   all Americans.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.040]   I mean, it's as if they believe all Americans face the same living expenses.
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.320]   Obviously, living in New York City is going to be more expensive than living in Des Moines,
[00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.320]   Iowa.
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.840]   And what also befuddles me is simple math.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.760]   If you're a single person and you make over $75,000 a year, you cannot contribute pre-tax
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.520]   money to a traditional IRA.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:48.120]   Now if you are married, the limit for contributing to an IRA, the income limit, is $124,000.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:54.400]   So once you make, combine more than $124,000, you cannot contribute to a traditional IRA.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.160]   But the funny thing is $75,000 plus $75,000 is what?
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.380]   $150,000?
[00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.980]   Not $124,000.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.200]   So the government also believes that 1 plus 1 does not equal 2.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.960]   And it just doesn't make sense.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.460]   What happened to the equality between man and woman or man and man and woman and woman?
[00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.400]   Both people deserve to make their money, have their careers.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.820]   So the government is always kind of determining the winners and losers.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.760]   So you just want to be aware of that.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:31.460]   A third item the SECURE Act changes is no more stretch IRAs.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.440]   So what is a stretch IRA?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.340]   Well it's an estate planning strategy that basically richer people use that extended
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:46.160]   the tax deferred status of an inherited IRA when it is passed to a non-spouse beneficiary.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.560]   Theoretically an IRA could be passed on from generation to generation while beneficiaries
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.020]   enjoyed tax deferred and/or tax free growth.
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.020]   But now that's gone.
[00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:59.600]   Under the new law, most beneficiaries will have to withdraw all the distributions from
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.640]   their inherited account and pay taxes on it within 10 years.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.240]   Exceptions are made for spouses and the chronically ill or disabled.
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.680]   Now there seems to be some kind of uproar about the elimination of stretch IRA.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.440]   But I say come on, give me a break.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:22.040]   If you are lucky enough to inherit an IRA and not need to use it, you know, after 10
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.840]   years, you're clearly doing very, very well.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.720]   So you're basically getting a gift when you don't really need the gift.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.520]   So I say hey, you know what, if the government wants the money after 10 years, then so be
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   it.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520]   It's fine.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.960]   You should be talking to an estate planning lawyer and he or she will tell you things
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.120]   that you probably have never considered before like the GRAT.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.520]   And you should also set up a revocable living trust if you have children.
[00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:51.280]   At the very least, everyone should have a clearly written will and an area where you
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.920]   have all your passwords and usernames because estate planning really is an act of kindness
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.800]   for your beneficiaries who will go crazy if they can't figure things out and will have
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.040]   to pay a lot of lawyer fees to figure out your estate.
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:10.720]   The fourth item the SECURE Act introduces are annuity options in your 401k.
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.400]   So annuities like whole life insurance is a very profitable product for financial companies,
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:21.600]   which is why I think financial companies were more lobbying hard for the SECURE Act to pass.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.400]   Annuities if you don't know, are insurance products that turn a lump sum investment into
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:28.080]   a lifetime of guaranteed income.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:33.160]   So besides the hidden cost of owning an annuity, one of the concerns companies had for offering
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:37.480]   them in a 401k was the viability of the annuity provider.
[00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:42.960]   So for example, what if your insurance company went bust or the annuity provider went bust?
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.920]   You may not get what is promised to you.
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.920]   Think about money.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.480]   It's just a promise that it's worth something.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.840]   We think it's worth something, so therefore it's worth something.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:57.680]   But one day we might think it's worth crap and money might not be worth anything.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.400]   And this is why I personally like to buy real assets such as real estate because if everything
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:08.160]   goes to crap, at least I can go to a property I own and take a crap.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.600]   You know, there's a utility there.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.880]   There's utility and it's just not going to disappear like poof, like many, many paper
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.220]   assets and things did during the 2008 to 2009 financial crisis.
[00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:25.800]   So I would say that's fine if there are annuity options, but I wouldn't go about selecting
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.360]   an annuity option.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.320]   It's just, I don't think it's a good idea.
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.480]   You lose your liquidity.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.760]   You lose your flexibility.
[00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.080]   You don't know what it costs.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:34.080]   It's kind of murky.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:36.560]   I would just pass.
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:40.600]   And if you're an employer, I would say you'd be foolish to offer an annuity option in your
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:47.560]   401k plan despite the increased legal protection because no employee is going to join an employer
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.560]   or stay at an employer because of its great annuity options in the 401k.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:58.520]   Really more so just do a better match or do some more profit sharing instead.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.520]   All right, what else?
[00:08:00.520 --> 00:08:05.980]   Five, 401k accounts may become more prevalent for part-time workers or employees of small
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.980]   businesses.
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:11.920]   And this is something I'm most excited about because I believe there is a change in the
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:12.920]   way we work.
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:18.120]   If you think about it, I don't know, going on a 30 minute to an hour commute to an office
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:22.880]   where you don't really need to be in the office because of technology doesn't make much sense.
[00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:26.840]   It's much more efficient to wake up, go to the bathroom, put on your underwear.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.240]   Hopefully you already have your underwear on and then get to work on your laptop and
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.360]   you can do teleconferencing and all that.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:39.560]   So if more 401k plans are going to be provided to small businesses, that's great for employees
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:43.480]   of small businesses and I think freelance workers.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.120]   The SECURE Act now requires employees who offer 401ks to expand its access to part-time
[00:08:49.120 --> 00:08:55.220]   workers who work at least 500 hours a year for three consecutive years or 1000 hours
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:57.300]   for one year.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.300]   To put these hours into perspective, a full-time worker who works 40 hours a week will work
[00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.760]   2080 hours a year.
[00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:08.520]   Therefore working 1000 hours for one year is a walk in the park.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:11.840]   We're talking only an average of 20 hour work weeks.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.240]   So I think that's really, really easy.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:18.420]   So at the margin, the offering of more 401k plans to part-time workers will probably further
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:22.160]   increase the rise of part-time and remote workers.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:27.840]   As a result, I foresee a continued demographic shift towards lower cost areas, which is why
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:33.120]   I'm diversifying my real estate holdings into the heartland of America.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.640]   Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to find part-time and remote work opportunities
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:42.560]   with employers who offer a 401k plan with a match.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:47.040]   Because there is so much dead weight working a full-time job with one employer.
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.360]   Think about all the meetings you have to go to, especially the ones that are meetings
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.420]   about meetings.
[00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.480]   Think about the commute.
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.160]   Think about all the distractions.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.760]   It's much more efficient, I think, to be a freelancer and get multiple clients.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.560]   Because if you are reasonably efficient, you can make a lot more money.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.520]   Sixth thing to note about the SECURE Act, 529 plans get more flexible.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:16.120]   After the tax cuts and jobs act passed in 2017, owners of a 529 plan could not only
[00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.840]   use these funds from the plan to pay for qualified college expenses, owners of the plan could
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   also use up to 10,000 of the funds annually for K-12 expenses.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:32.000]   And I thought this was really great, especially for folks living in big cities or coastal
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.360]   cities, maybe where the public school system isn't that well-funded or ranked.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   So 10,000 a year, that's pretty good.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.680]   So now with the SECURE Act, a 529 plan can also be used for apprenticeship programs,
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:49.280]   which is really, really popular in Europe, not so popular in the United States for some
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:54.520]   reason, and qualified expenses including fees, books, supplies, and equipment.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.120]   Further, 529 plan funds can be used to pay for principal and interest of qualified education
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:03.440]   loans in the amount of $10,000.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   So the details, I mean everything sounds good, but you gotta look at the fine print before
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.740]   you do anything, as always.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:17.040]   But your goal is to have a 529 plan for each kid, if you have kids.
[00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:22.080]   Yes, we all know that a college degree is getting devalued each year, but it's still
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.160]   worth opening up a 529 plan if you have children.
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.200]   You want a little bit of that flexibility, your contributions will grow tax-free, and
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:32.960]   if you don't end up using all the funds, you can change the beneficiary over to someone
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   else.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:39.160]   It can be another sibling, or it can be a grandchild, know the details, but it's not
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.360]   like you're stuck and uh-oh.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.280]   You want to be efficient in terms of saving for retirement and saving for your children's
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.720]   future as possible.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:52.920]   Finally, there's something good for folks who just had a baby or just adopted.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.920]   Bless you folks who have adopted children, I think that's awesome, and you guys are
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.880]   my favorite type of people.
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:04.360]   The SECURE Act allows Americans to withdraw up to $5,000 per parent from their retirement
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.560]   accounts, including a 401k or IRA, without a 10% penalty.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:12.320]   So in other words, a couple can withdraw up to $10,000 penalty-free per child.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:16.360]   Now this is good if you really, really, really need the money, but normally I would just
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:19.280]   recommend keeping things separate.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:24.440]   Don't touch the money that is compounding in your retirement plans for retirement.
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:29.720]   You want to save money set aside for your children's expenses.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.520]   Don't commingle because it'll make things a little bit messy and you're probably going
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:36.360]   to do a little bit of cheating and you're not going to be as disciplined in saving and
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.100]   investing your money.
[00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:43.880]   So overall, I think the SECURE Act is a net positive for millions of Americans.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:48.080]   It's really rare that the government does something specifically positive for Americans
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:53.520]   because it always seems like it's mismanaging funds, like the Social Security pension fund
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:56.360]   is 33% underfunded and stuff like that.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.600]   So this is pretty good, and what I do like is that the government recognizes there is
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:05.680]   this shift in the way Americans work from, again, going to the office to being able to
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.780]   work more remotely and giving Americans and freelancers and small business workers more
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:17.200]   freedom to live in lower cost areas of the country to take advantage of the arbitrage
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.400]   opportunities of being able to work from anywhere thanks to technology.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.800]   So I am encouraged that the government is taking right steps, positive steps to change
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:31.280]   along with the change in the way we earn and the way we save and live.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.000]   So I know I was going to talk about my future plans for 2020 and beyond, but I'm going to
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.720]   do that in another episode.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.800]   So talk to you guys later, folks.
