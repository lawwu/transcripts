[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.800]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.440]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. My name is Joshua Sheets. Today
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.100]   on the show, we're going to talk a little bit about living a meaningful life, partly
[00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.880]   in terms of serving others, but we're going to talk about what it's actually been like
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.520]   on the ground in Ukraine, as well as a few other things that you will hear. I'd like
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.240]   to welcome back to the show a friend of mine, Jimmy. Welcome back to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.920]   Thank you. Thank you for having me back.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.740]   So you were last on the show when you've been on the show a couple of times where we have
[00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:14.160]   been talking about Venezuela. And for any uninitiated listeners, you have an extensive
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.520]   amount of experience working on the ground, providing relief in Venezuela, providing relief
[00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.040]   supplies, disaster supplies, as well as being involved in other charitable works and Christian
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.560]   ministry works in the nation of Venezuela. However, recently you traded out that disaster
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:39.060]   zone and you spent some time in an active war zone in Ukraine. And then we'll get to
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.160]   some of the other more recent adventures, but I'd like to talk about your experiences
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:52.200]   in Ukraine. Tell us please, how did you wind up in Ukraine and what is happening on the
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.960]   ground? What did you observe? What was it like living in Ukraine recently?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:05.640]   Well, the war in Ukraine started on January 24th. And then a week later, after the war
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.840]   started, I got a phone call from a friend of mine and he said, "Hey, we're looking
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:18.720]   for volunteers to come and help in Venezuela. And you definitely qualify for coming up and
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.440]   helping out. Now, would you like to apply?" And then I said, "Well, I'm in Venezuela
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:32.920]   right now. I have to talk to my board." And so I phone my board, the group of people
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.200]   that I'm an accountant to in Venezuela. And I said, "I'm being asked to volunteer
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.960]   as a rescue technician and as a medic." Although I'm not a medic, but I have training
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:57.280]   on that, some training on that. So they said, "Please go. We're happy to support you
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:07.920]   and pray for you." So I phoned my friend back and like two or three days later, I don't
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:15.680]   know, I was on a plane to Ukraine. And then I arrived there, I think I arrived there in
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.920]   10 days, 10, 11 days after the war had started.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.800]   You began in Poland, right? You were doing some work in Poland and then you did eventually
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.440]   go with a convoy into Ukraine proper.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.560]   Yes, yes. I started off at the border between Poland and Ukraine. I was stationed in a place
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:42.720]   where we were helping out refugees cross the border. There were thousands of them. Like
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:48.200]   one night we counted, well, I didn't count them, but they told me that 74,000 people
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:55.720]   had crossed. And some of them needed help. I was doing triage, meaning helping people
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:01.560]   to assess their medical needs. I was doing all sorts of things, including helping them
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.280]   with their luggage or just sometimes their cars would break down in the middle of the
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.120]   road and it was very cold, incredible cold, minus 12 one night. And so we had to go and
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:20.760]   just pick them up, rescue them and then take them to the border.
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.360]   Tell us some of the stories. Why were people fleeing and what was happening when they were
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.360]   making that decision?
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:37.240]   Well, that time when I got there, they were coming from all over the west and north of
[00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:46.080]   Ukraine. At that time, they were certain and we were certain that the Russians were going
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:51.760]   to take over the whole country. There was no question about it. So people were naturally
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   fleeing and looking, trying to get out of there. Because it was a sure thing that with
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:13.440]   countless tanks and army personnel just surrounding Kiev and having taken all the northern part
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   of Kiev, it was a sure thing. It was just a matter of time before the Russians would
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.720]   come into Kiev. And then of course, once Kiev was taken, maybe everybody felt that the whole
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:35.520]   city was going to fall down. The whole country, I'm sorry, was going to go down.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:41.360]   So over the years, we've talked a lot about refugees and you have been involved in many
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:50.200]   different disasters where there have been refugees. You worked with the Red Cross in
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.520]   Chile after the big earthquake there. You volunteered for several years in Haiti after
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   the earthquake there. Recently, over the last few years, you have spent huge amounts of
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:06.920]   time volunteering in Colombia and Venezuela at the border there. In fact, we've worked
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.520]   with listeners of the show who've donated money and done relief for even several ministries
[00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:18.920]   that specifically work with refugees coming out of Venezuela into Colombia. And then you've
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:25.560]   told me that recently after the pandemic started, you started to work with and see refugees
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.840]   going from Colombia back into Venezuela, people heading home. And now of course, you've been
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:37.240]   on the border between Poland and Ukraine. How do you compare these different refugee
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.680]   movements? If you were to compare and contrast the Venezuela-Colombia border as compared
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:49.160]   to the Ukraine-Poland border, what did you observe?
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.640]   Yeah, what a question. Interesting. Well, the first, you could see the desperation for
[00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:05.280]   people to leave and living with really nothing, nothing because they cannot carry much when
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:13.680]   they leave. And you could compare also the family separation. I saw a lot of men, for
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:21.720]   example, cannot leave Ukraine. And so they were just, I saw a lot of men dropping off
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:29.800]   their families at the border and saying goodbye. We're talking not 10, 20, we're talking hundreds
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:38.560]   of them just driving their cars or just passing by. That didn't happen in Venezuela when I
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:44.680]   saw it. I saw a whole family, the father and the mother and the whole family crossing and
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:50.080]   escaping. But Venezuela, but Ukraine was different because men were not allowed to leave the
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.680]   country. I still not allowed to, they expected that they would volunteer for fighting in
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:05.560]   the war. So that was probably what, more than what I can compare, I could tell you the differences.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:11.120]   I'm sorry, I know I'm twisting the question and I ask for forgiveness. But the other thing
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:18.200]   was the cold. I remember in Venezuela, it was the rain because sometimes we had to halt
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:27.080]   and cross the river. And when the river was way up, we had to, well, we had to put ropes
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:35.600]   and bridges and be there waiting for them. We just bring shelter to the soccer fields
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:41.160]   where they were sleeping. One day I counted almost 2000 people sleeping in the soccer
[00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:52.560]   field. And in Ukraine, it was the cold. It was bitter cold. And so we had to have blankets
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:09:01.400]   and we had to be ready, especially because the border sometimes was slow in processing
[00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:08.080]   all refugees that were coming through. So they had to stay for three, four, five hours.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:16.960]   And it was one night, it was well, minus 12. I don't know, probably zero on your scale
[00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:19.560]   one night.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:25.580]   Were the Polish border, how strict were the Polish border officials on the documentation
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.760]   of fleeing Ukrainian refugees?
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.880]   I'm sorry, the question, you have to work it out again.
[00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:39.720]   So how strict were the Polish border officials on the paperwork requirements for fleeing
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:44.040]   Ukrainians? Were they allowing people to come across with expired passports? Were they allowing
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.320]   people to come in with no documentation? Or did they make sure that everyone had to have
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.960]   the proper international passports? How did they handle that?
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:10:03.560]   No, no, just they had, I think in Ukraine, people, every person gets a passport. I think
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:15.880]   it's the law in Ukraine. Your ID is your passport. So everybody seemed to have one. Except some
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:21.320]   people didn't. I saw them just showing a little piece of paper, but nobody was rejected for
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:29.160]   lack of papers. Definitely. Nobody was. If somebody didn't have a document, I never saw
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:35.640]   people rejected. The only people that I saw rejected was people that had some spending,
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:43.080]   I don't know, but I did help very few people having to return because they were missing
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:48.200]   something and I never understood what they were missing. But they were very few. For
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:54.600]   example, out of 74,000, probably one or two, three were rejected.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.840]   So as people were coming across the border, what were they doing for accommodation? Were
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.280]   they immediately getting on a train and heading further into Europe? Were they camping on
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:08.920]   the streets? Were locals taking them in? How were they being housed?
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:15.960]   At the border where I was, they had a very large reception center. I think they were
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:25.000]   capable of handling up to 5,000, 6,000 people per night. And then buses were coming from
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.080]   all over Europe to pick them up, or they could take the train to wherever they wanted to
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:39.720]   go. So I was surprised how efficient the Polish government was with handling the tremendous
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:48.840]   amount of refugees. We're talking gazillions, millions, literally millions of them actually.
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:12:00.360]   They had to be processed very quickly. So I was very impressed with how, it was chaotic,
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:07.560]   but there was some sense of order in the passing through of the refugees.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:12.600]   Right. In a moment, we'll talk about your experiences inside Ukraine, but I want to
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:18.040]   dwell on this topic of becoming a refugee. I teach a course called International Escape
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:27.000]   Plan, and part of it is in connection with Ukraine. And I basically, after years of watching
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:33.760]   disasters, I have observed that one of the best ways to survive and thrive in a disaster
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.560]   is by not being physically present where the disaster is located. So any Venezuelan who
[00:12:39.560 --> 00:12:46.040]   fled Venezuela and started living in Miami was able to avoid the worst of the collapse
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:54.360]   in Venezuela. Any Ukrainian who fled in the weeks prior to the invasion by Russia and
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:13:01.200]   went to another place was able to avoid some of the worst effects of the invasion. And
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:08.560]   so I teach a whole course on this, available at internationalescapeplan.com, and I basically
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.640]   talk about how if you can do nothing else, if you can prepare a passport and a credit
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:19.120]   card so you have money to spend and a cell phone, you can get out. And so you should
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:23.400]   prepare for that. Last time you were on, we talked about Venezuela and we discussed the
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.560]   preparations that you would make if you knew you were going to live in a Venezuelan-style
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.520]   economic crisis. Now I want to ask you, if you knew that you were going to become a Ukrainian-style
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:41.080]   refugee fleeing at the last minute across the Polish border while the Russian army is
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:45.680]   invading, what kind of preparations would you make in advance to be prepared for that
[00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:47.800]   kind of disaster scenario?
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:57.640]   Yeah, definitely the passport would be a plus, and the international credit card, some cash,
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   some cash available. I would have a ready-to-go backpack with all the basics, all the survival
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:27.120]   basic things that we need now, today, in today's world. As ironic as it may sound, having a
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:33.720]   charger, a phone charger, as simple as it is, I noticed a lot of people that are coming
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:39.640]   in and borrowing or asking for a phone charger, and I thought, I guess they were not prepared.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:50.920]   So there are simple things that, it's a list of things to run with in case I have to leave.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:58.600]   The problem is I don't think people understood, even though they could see all the signs that
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:06.540]   things were going not to go well in Ukraine, they were still confident that nothing would
[00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:11.760]   happen to them, there was not going to be an invasion, mainly because Russia kept saying
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:19.480]   that they were not planning such a thing. I think the Ukrainians trusted that the invasion
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:26.200]   was not going to happen, and when it did happen, they were not prepared, many of them were
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:35.880]   not prepared. I could tell you that. Winter clothing, that was the most. We had to help
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.200]   them because they were suffering from hypothermia in the middle of the winter, so either they
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:47.360]   didn't grab, or maybe they escaped in the middle of the night, and I didn't ask, but
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:55.400]   I think you have to, after that I kept my backpack with everything, the basics with
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:16:03.520]   me all the time. In fact, my escape backpack, I used it for the whole time as my pillow,
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:12.040]   because in case I said I had to run, a missile attack, which happened to me several times,
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:20.240]   so in case I had to run, I slept with my run backpack most of the time.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:27.160]   Do you think that, so obviously winter clothing, winter coats, etc., was important. Do you
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   think that if somebody had had things like camping gear, backpacking tents, things like
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:36.680]   that, do you think that would have been helpful, or would it have been more of a hindrance
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:41.400]   in that scenario because it was too much luggage, too bulky, and people could go and stay in
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   hotels?
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:52.360]   Oh, no, no, no, no. You could not possibly camp in Ukraine. The temperatures were just
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:17:02.120]   incredibly cold. I did camp one time out of necessity, and in the middle of the night,
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:10.760]   I ran for, because it's just impossible. Maybe now that it's summertime, maybe you could
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:19.120]   think of camping equipment. In fact, I have my camping equipment with me. I have two backpacks,
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:25.280]   one is with my camping equipment, and the other one is with my run supplies, runaway
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:34.240]   supplies. But I'm going to take it back when I go back, and in ten days, I will take my
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:36.920]   camping equipment with me.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:43.400]   With regard to money, was the financial system working? Could, for example, if the Ukrainians
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.360]   were fleeing, were they able to access their bank accounts, get money out so they could
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.040]   pay for their fares across Europe, or did you observe any problems in the local financial
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   system?
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:18:01.080]   No, the system was working quite well. I was surprised that you could even get money, Ukrainian
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:08.080]   money, from the cash machine in the Ukraine, and that never stopped working, which was
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:13.840]   very impressive because you would expect that the banking system would collapse. It didn't.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:22.000]   It kept going. The problem is, I think most people did not have the money to spare, say,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.920]   "Okay, I'm going to take so much money." But the other thing was that the Europeans
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:35.880]   were so well, they didn't have a standing job. People didn't need to pay, the trains
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:46.880]   were free, the shelters, there was food. Again, I'm going to reiterate, I was very impressed
[00:18:46.880 --> 00:18:55.000]   with the Poland side. I was very impressed with the way they handled the whole situation.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.280]   There's this idea that in certain disaster times, when you have to flee, that having
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:09.640]   alternative forms of money, for example, having a valuable piece of jewelry or a gold coin
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:15.080]   can be helpful to bribe a border guard to let you out. Also, there were reports with
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.920]   Bitcoin. There were several tweet threads that I archived while watching the situation
[00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:23.400]   in Ukraine, where people were saying, "I'm fleeing Ukraine, and the only thing that would
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:30.580]   work for me was Bitcoin, and I used that to get out." Did you personally observe anything
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.040]   like that, or did you hear any stories personally from anybody that used anything other than
[00:19:36.040 --> 00:19:42.200]   just the normal day-to-day banking system as part of their escape plan?
[00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:50.880]   Not really, because I was even able to use my credit card in the Ukraine, which all of
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:20:03.860]   that surprised me. I could use my credit card, my debit card, I could exchange US dollars
[00:20:03.860 --> 00:20:22.940]   or euros. Ukraine is a very difficult situation, because somehow the country did not, even
[00:20:22.940 --> 00:20:35.280]   though amazingly enough, it was supposed to collapse, and it didn't. I was expecting the
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:40.920]   electricity to go off, fuel shortages, although there are some fuel shortages, you could still
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:50.120]   travel around. So the country, during the first weeks, even up to now, when I left,
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.600]   it didn't hold very, very well. It was not like Venezuela, everything slowly, slowly
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:21:03.480]   collapsed and then suddenly they had a complete collapse. Banking, schools, everything, transportation,
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:17.400]   gas, everything collapsed. But in Ukraine, everything kept well. Kiev did have some issues.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:25.880]   When I got there, they were just too real. But they were managing very well, and they
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.600]   still manage very well, which is quite surprising, because they were facing one of the largest
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.720]   armies in the world.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:44.160]   You have extensive experience working in an economic collapse, right? You have experience
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:52.280]   of going to Venezuela and trading a $5 US bill for a backpack full of Venezuelan bank
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:58.280]   notes. You have experience knowing that the inflation is so bad that you can't even take
[00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.200]   20s and 50s, because no one has enough money to change it. So you have experience in both
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:06.960]   kinds of economies. What I'd like to ask, and the reason I'm asking this, is because
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.440]   most of my listeners are from the United States, and people are always trying to figure out,
[00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:16.320]   "Well, if there were a collapse in the United States, what would that look like?" And years
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:20.880]   ago I used to think, "Oh, well, it would look like Venezuela." I'm now convinced that it
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:26.640]   would not look like Venezuela, and I think that your recent experience in Ukraine is
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:34.480]   a good piece of data to fit in to that analysis. So here's my question. Why do you think it
[00:22:34.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   is so different in Ukraine versus Venezuela? What are the differences between the kinds
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:52.160]   of crisis that each country is facing that led to Venezuela having virtually no electricity,
[00:22:52.160 --> 00:22:57.880]   Venezuela having a collapsed financial system, but Ukraine continuing to be able to keep
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:02.680]   the lights on, continuing to have functioning ATMs, a functioning credit card system, etc.?
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:06.040]   What are the differences that contributed to that?
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:18.720]   Well, what are the differences? Well, the Ukraine, I'm going to talk about Ukraine,
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:26.280]   they're very confident, and they're really well-united. Like, whatever decision the president
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:34.720]   of the country makes is very well supported by everyone. And I think I'm very impressed
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:45.000]   by his leadership and how he, I think he's a hero, literally. He's the one who was able
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:58.800]   to gather everybody together as a community, and it's a community war. And there is a lot
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:08.360]   of unity. In the meantime, in Venezuela, there is no unity at all. There is a lot of fighting,
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:14.880]   there is within the different groups fighting between themselves. But Ukraine is certainly
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:22.720]   different. There is a lot of unity and a lot of commonality. ICE people, for example, volunteers
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:32.600]   taking food to the front lines, including myself, and picking up wounded soldiers, using
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:40.320]   their cars, their own cars, their own personal cars to go and deliver supplies, delivering
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:49.800]   anything that the people on the front lines may need. There is no such a thing.
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:57.040]   So I want to pivot now back to the story. I want to pivot to your story. After being
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:04.240]   at the border, working with refugees, you then went in with a relief convoy into Ukraine
[00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:14.280]   proper. Tell us more about that trip and what you wound up doing inside Ukraine.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:15.280]   Go ahead, please.
[00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:24.280]   Yes. First to Kiev, to Lviv, I'm sorry. And I made a lot of connections when I was at
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:31.560]   the border because we were sending supplies to different places, including the Christian
[00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:37.920]   church. And then I connected with one of the pastors of that church. So when I finished
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:46.720]   my work at the border, I decided to phone that pastor and I asked him if I could be
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:52.200]   of any use. And of course, he said, "Come right away." Of course, I had made connections
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:57.400]   for convoys to go to his church. So I was able to send a couple of two, three or four
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:04.480]   convoys that were coming with donations from Europe. So I was welcome there basically because
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:15.680]   I could be of help and I was a contact person for convoys to come into their warehouse.
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:19.520]   And then you stayed there in Ukraine for how long?
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.840]   I was there for a total of six weeks.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   And what were you doing?
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:30.000]   Seven weeks, I'm sorry. Well, in the first week and a half, I was at the border helping
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:36.760]   refugees cross the border. And then for the next two weeks, a week and a half, I'm sorry,
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:46.640]   I was two weeks, I was in Lviv helping, teaching, making water filters and emergency rocket
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:57.320]   stops, teaching people how to make them and helping also with the convoys, helping them
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.960]   sort through because we would divide, for example, the medicines for hospitals and the
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   medicines for trauma for people in the front lines because they all came in different boxes.
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:17.000]   So we needed to sort through according to the need that people had inside. So food,
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:23.960]   children, and depending on the requests we were getting, like field food. Also, people
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:30.920]   were donating camping supplies, which they would go to the front lines and medicine,
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:39.760]   trauma medicine. And since I have a background in medics, in rescue, I knew what to send.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:45.960]   I sort of have the knowledge of what to sort through. So I prepared, I helped guiding them
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:52.440]   to prepare the delivery packages to the soldiers or the volunteers that would come to pick
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:54.760]   them up.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:55.760]   In where you were?
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:05.400]   And then, and then I moved to Kiev. And in Kiev, I was connected with a search and rescue
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:17.720]   group of a Baptist church. And they were basically helping people escape from occupied territories.
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:25.800]   And they were delivering supplies to different places like Chernobyl, Bucha, and also helping
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:35.280]   we build a bomb shelter in case we were bombed. And they were also providing supplies to orphanages.
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.200]   And they're still doing that.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:41.240]   What was the risk of violence there where you were?
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:54.360]   Well, not different. The only risk of violence was the missile attacks that happened. And
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:04.920]   unfortunately, the missiles are quite inaccurate. And so they end up hitting the wrong places.
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:10.120]   Like they were on my last day when I was leaving, they were supposed to hit, I think they were
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:17.880]   planning to hit a bridge, but they destroyed seven houses, four houses instead. Seven people
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:20.440]   died.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:24.960]   What was it like? Were people going, were some people just trying to go around their
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:31.040]   normal day? Were people staffing the stores? Were people going to their offices and working?
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:37.240]   Or was everything shut down and nothing happening? What was it like?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:46.240]   Well, everything, people try to, in Lviv, people try to live a normal life. And the
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:52.400]   people that have work or that still have work, they will go to work as normal as they could
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:58.440]   be. And there were people also that were unemployed and quite a few of them because their business
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.240]   closed down or shut down. And they were not selling things, especially in the agriculture.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:10.800]   There's a lot of agriculture there. And that seemed to be in a very slow, in this very
[00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.320]   slow recommend.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:21.120]   But in general, they tried to live a normal life in Lviv, in spite of the fact that the
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:28.400]   sirens kept going off constantly. And at least when I was there, we suffered three missile
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.920]   attacks.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:35.720]   How did you prepare for the physical danger yourself, the risk of a missile? Did you sleep
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:37.600]   in the basement? What did you do?
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:48.400]   No, no, I slept in a normal apartment building. There's no, there's only one that I visited,
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:54.840]   only one bomb shelter in the whole city, I think. And it was far away. So when the sirens
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:01.000]   came, you just hope that you didn't get strike by a missile. But they came close though,
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:08.760]   because I live very, very close by a very strategic place that I thought this is, I
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:14.440]   was almost certain that it was going to be attacked, but never, never attacked. What
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.240]   was attacked was a place where I used to go shopping for supplies every day. Every day
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:25.560]   I would go there, either in the morning or in the afternoon to buy my supplies for building
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:32.640]   with stoves or the things that I was doing. And one afternoon, the missile hit it, like
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:39.600]   within 50, 100 meters from where I used to go shopping.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:45.920]   It's my understanding that although many people feared significant shortages in Ukraine,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:52.900]   that the supply lines were actually working pretty well. What did you notice was widely
[00:31:52.900 --> 00:32:00.800]   available and what did you notice was in short supply?
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:06.600]   I noticed that supermarkets were, at the beginning, were quite packed with everything you needed.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.880]   And slowly, slowly you start seeing things disappearing from the shelves. But there was
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:18.560]   no panic shopping, not at all. It surprised me because I've been in the United States
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.720]   and every time the tragedy is about to happen, people just running, don't buy everything
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:33.640]   including whatever they can buy. But there, they were calm and there was no panic shopping
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:44.400]   whatsoever. And I was, interestingly, I asked a lady and I asked her why she was not stocking
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:53.440]   up and then she said, "No, no, of course not. Other people may need it." So, it surprised
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:33:01.280]   me their solidarity because, you know, if you're here in North America, if you see like
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:08.960]   20 gallons of water, glass water in Walmart, somebody will come in a truck and put it in
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:13.600]   this pickup truck without thinking of the rest of the people. But they were like very,
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.200]   even in that, there was a lot of solidarity.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:23.960]   That's really beautiful. Was there anything that was in short supply that really surprised
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:29.680]   you?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:36.400]   They rely a lot on bottled water and I noticed that at the end, the bottled water was starting
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:43.920]   to disappear. And then that's why I put a lot of emphasis on water filters. And I think
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:50.560]   when I left, they started to listen to my emergency preparedness speech of making water
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:58.440]   filters or getting water filters. But they were, I think they have an excess of confidence,
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:06.920]   especially in Lviv. But when I went back to Lviv on my last days, I noticed that they
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:13.560]   were starting to think that things were going to be rougher than expected.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:20.160]   After spending time in basically an active war zone, or at least on the periphery of
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:27.320]   an active war zone, what lessons did you personally learn? What changes, what decisions did you
[00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:33.680]   make or what changed for you personally based on what you learned there?
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:39.360]   Nothing really changed as far as me. I think it's just everything was, I feel reaffirmed
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:51.160]   that on how well I was prepared, because practically everything that I had with me was used. And
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:35:02.240]   I kept it like, you know, you train all your life for this. And I was, so I'll say I was
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:08.040]   well prepared. And I didn't know how well prepared I was until I was in a situation
[00:35:08.040 --> 00:35:14.480]   in which I needed to be well prepared. My quick run bag had everything I needed. And
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   when I needed it, my backpack with camping gear and emergency supplies were ready. My
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:30.760]   medical supplies were ready. So I think, as you know, as you know me, I have been prepared
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:39.320]   for this for a long time. So I was able to see, to experience that I've done all these
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:44.460]   preparations have, at least in Ukraine, paid off.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:51.060]   Did you, so that was your experience, but the normal person, right, the average person
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:56.060]   isn't, doesn't think about preparedness in the way that you, someone who's involved in
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:36:04.340]   disaster relief does. So were people that you observed, were they facing hardship because
[00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:09.500]   they weren't prepared and they were facing genuine hardship or genuine shortages, or
[00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:14.260]   did you just feel better because you were prepared?
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:25.660]   I think both of them, they were just not prepared. Like for example, some of my students that
[00:36:25.660 --> 00:36:34.500]   I taught survival skills and medical skills, none of them taught, have like any idea that
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:42.340]   they will be in that situation. So there was not, there was lack of insight on their part
[00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:47.100]   that one day they would face a situation like they were facing and suddenly they had to,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:58.460]   they were put into that situation. So I think, I think the big difference is that they were
[00:36:58.460 --> 00:37:04.380]   too confident. Some people were too confident that the situation in Ukraine will not get
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:11.340]   the way it got. Excessive confidence. And that's usually what happens in the lack of
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:17.780]   emergency preparedness. People just think nothing, nothing will happen to them. That
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:22.260]   they're not in harm's way.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:29.300]   I think that's a good place to pivot to the next part of our discussion, which has a few
[00:37:29.300 --> 00:37:36.600]   unexpected surprises. You had a long planned vacation/adventure trip in North America.
[00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.580]   So you left Ukraine and then what happened?
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:45.580]   Well I had bought a bike in Canada.
[00:37:45.580 --> 00:37:48.580]   And by bike you mean motorcycle?
[00:37:48.580 --> 00:37:54.740]   Motorcycle, yes. And my plan was to, my commitment actually was to come and pick it up in September,
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:03.380]   in May, because I had made that commitment. So the main reason why I had to return was
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:08.740]   because I had made a commitment to pick up my bike, my motorcycle, and I would take it
[00:38:08.740 --> 00:38:15.180]   down to Houston and eventually to Venezuela. So I took three weeks off Ukraine and I came
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:27.580]   to pick up my bike so I was able to ride my bike from Alberta, Canada to Houston. But
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:32.060]   I also did some bike riding near the Alaskan border.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:37.300]   So you spent some time motorcycling near Alaska and then you rode down through the United
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:45.940]   States. Last week you happened to be passing through Texas. So tell us that story.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:59.940]   Well I was coming and I rode through several states. It was cold in Colorado and Utah,
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:06.220]   I think, and snowing. So I had to ride my bike under snowy conditions. And then suddenly
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:12.380]   I started driving south and south, south, it started to get warmer and warmer. Now it's
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:21.020]   heating, temperatures here down in Texas, very, very hot. But on my last week I decided
[00:39:21.020 --> 00:39:28.100]   to slow down because I estimated that I was going to come down during this long weekend.
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:36.100]   So I was not riding as many hours per day. So one day when I made it to El Paso, Texas,
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:44.740]   I decided to instead of taking the main highway, I would take the south route. So it would
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:51.860]   take me one day longer to make it to Houston, but I thought it would be nice to be in a
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:40:00.660]   – I didn't have to rush. So I was coming through the south to the – I'm mostly
[00:40:00.660 --> 00:40:10.660]   on the roads along the El Paso border, the Texas border. And then one day I was planning
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:19.780]   to – and my second day I was planning to sleep in the city of Uvalde. I even had found
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:25.900]   a couple of motels where I was thinking that I would stay. But because I was going very
[00:40:25.900 --> 00:40:35.860]   slow, one day I wasted four, five, six hours here and there. So I didn't make it to Uvalde.
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:44.620]   I was like four or five hours away from it. And that day when the tragedy of the massacre
[00:40:44.620 --> 00:40:52.620]   of Uvalde happened, I was not that far, although I was far away, probably five, six, seven
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:41:03.660]   hours away from Uvalde. And then I started – so one day, one morning, I think it was
[00:41:03.660 --> 00:41:11.100]   a mid-afternoon or morning, I saw a lot of cars rushing by. What got my attention was
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:18.460]   that there were two school buses rushing. Like the buses were going at least 75 miles
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:24.060]   per hour. And then you never see a bus, a school bus, riding at 75 miles per hour. And
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:28.380]   I thought that's odd. And two school buses, like they looked like – almost like they
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:34.620]   were racing. And I thought that's very strange. And then after that, I saw a couple of police
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:43.740]   cars and a couple of border patrol cars rushing. And then a couple of ambulances, a fire truck,
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:54.940]   and people and a bunch of different cars just rushing by me. And so I thought, "Oops,
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:42:01.180]   America is under attack." That's what I thought. No, seriously, because it's so
[00:42:01.180 --> 00:42:06.860]   unusual. There was hardly any cars there. And suddenly, you see all these people rushing
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:13.020]   and even an helicopter rushing, flying, and I thought, "No." Because it felt like
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:17.660]   I was in the Ukraine again. Maybe President Putin decided to push the button and send
[00:42:17.660 --> 00:42:22.380]   the missiles this way. Yeah, exactly. That's exactly what I thought.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:27.660]   You probably didn't have any cell phone signal out there. You probably couldn't.
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:34.380]   No, no, no, nothing. So I was like, "For sure, for certain, America has been attacked."
[00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:43.100]   I was absolutely certain that that had happened. Because what are the odds of an empty highway,
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:49.740]   suddenly seeing school buses? It was funny because one guy was driving his car. I don't
[00:42:49.740 --> 00:42:55.260]   know what happened to his car, but he was a very well-dressed guy. And he was in the middle of the
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:01.820]   highway waiting to get a ride. Of course, I didn't stop because I thought, "You don't pick
[00:43:01.820 --> 00:43:07.900]   up somebody in the middle of the desert." The police picked him up, though. I saw that the car
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:17.100]   behind me came and gave him a ride. But I thought it was odd to see somebody asking for help in the
[00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:25.580]   middle of the desert. And he was not an immigrant. You think this person just crossed into Mexico
[00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:31.660]   or the United States. He was somebody that was well-dressed. And I kept thinking, "No, this is
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:37.340]   not right." It didn't feel right at all, seeing so many cars passing by me, rushing by me.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:44.940]   But I'm taking some emergency supplies to my team in Ukraine. So I'm thinking, "Maybe I have to stay
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:53.260]   here in the United States for a long time and camp here." So I was even thinking, "Well, I have this."
[00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:58.220]   And then I started to identify places where I could camp. There's a lot of abandoned houses
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:44:04.460]   in the desert, or campings. And I said, "Well, I could have a shelter here." So I was actually
[00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:10.700]   planning to stay for a long time, just in case the United States had been attacked.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:17.740]   When I got the internet, I realized then that the city that I was supposed to go to the next day
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:25.100]   had suffered the massacre. >> When did you arrive then in Uvalde?
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:35.340]   >> I arrived the day and a half after the massacre. >> What was it like? What did you experience there?
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:45.180]   >> Well, I decided that I was going to go and just hang around and talk to people and be supportive
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:55.340]   to people. And so I intentionally drove there to stop in the city of Uvalde. I did. There was
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:02.140]   no organized counseling. You could just go to the main... They had two main shrines for people
[00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:08.220]   mourning. So just hanging around there, you always... The whole day, day and a half, almost
[00:45:08.220 --> 00:45:13.180]   two days I was there, you always find somebody, because it's a small community. So there was
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:20.940]   always somebody hurting. So I would come and talk to them and just share. But what was interesting
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:27.500]   was that for me, was that I would share with them that I was coming from Ukraine, servicing in the
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:32.940]   Ukraine. And they immediately connected with me. There was an immediate connection with all the
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:40.940]   people that I was talking to about their tragedy and what I had gone through. So I guess my
[00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:52.380]   background, my recent background helped a lot. And if I can share experience with it, that I had
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:57.420]   on my blog the last day that I'm sharing on my blog, the last day I was sitting,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:09.500]   just in the afternoon, that was... Wow. That was two days ago. Yeah, two days, two afternoons ago,
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:15.340]   I was sitting in the...
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:28.540]   get guidance. And so that's where I was the last day. And so I was sitting there having my lunch.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:36.140]   I didn't want to talk. I was so tired. And I went as far as I could from people. So I sat by myself
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:47.820]   on a table. And then a man came in and sat by me. And I had my Ukrainian hat, Ukrainian shirt. So he
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:55.260]   said he was interested. And I said, and he asked me, "Why did you come? Why did you choose to come?
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.220]   You know, from here, why did..." And then I said, "Well, I decided to come and be supportive."
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:08.140]   And then I started talking to him about Ukraine. And then I started talking to him about the
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:14.700]   massacre of Bucha. But, you know, I haven't cried. I really haven't cried, remembering what I saw in
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:22.940]   Bucha. And then suddenly, when I... I don't know, just as I was talking, I broke down in tears. I
[00:47:22.940 --> 00:47:32.540]   mean, I was crying when I remember about what I had seen in Bucha, but also Chernobyl and Irpin.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:41.180]   I really hadn't had time to process what I've seen in the Ukraine. And so the guy was very nice to me.
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:52.300]   He was very supportive. He started, like, talking to me. And it felt really good when I was talking
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.900]   to him. So, but I hadn't asked him who he was. And...
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:48:08.620]   Me, and I share my story. And because I share my story, I start crying. I guess I haven't
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:13.740]   processed everything what I've seen in Ukraine. And so, but he was very supportive. He was...
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:20.860]   He had... We share with... We share our same principles and Christian faith.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:26.620]   So he was incredibly supportive. And then at the end, I said, when I was starting to feel much
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:32.220]   better, I asked him, "Who are you? What are you... And what are you doing here?" So I turned things
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:41.660]   around, asking him. And then he told me that he was the former school principal of the school where
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:47.980]   the massacre had taken place. He had gone out of that school for another school, like, just recently.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:55.740]   And he said that the two teachers were very close to him, very close friends. Every student that
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:02.220]   was there. So, and he was almost crying. And, but you know something, it's amazing. This guy, I thought,
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:09.660]   with so much grief and so much pain, is sharing with me, is encouraging me. And I guess God,
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:17.740]   God is the way God uses people. He was using a broken man to help another broken man.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:24.700]   That's how God operates, I thought. And so we said goodbye. We both were at the end,
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.180]   of course, we both had tears in our eyes.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:37.500]   Wow. What a story. In the midst of tremendous evil and suffering, it brings into great relief
[00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:45.740]   and highlights good and kindness of strangers, the solidarity of a community. And it's always
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:55.020]   such that painful combination of the grief of horror and of evil, mixed with neighbors,
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.740]   loving neighbors, people encouraging one another. And so even in the midst of
[00:49:59.740 --> 00:50:03.580]   great evil, you see good, right? You see love expressed in the middle of it.
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:16.140]   Yeah, definitely. I saw a lot of, it's interesting, but there is commonality between Ukraine and
[00:50:16.140 --> 00:50:34.540]   Texas. It was that I saw humanity. I saw people with faith supporting each other. I saw people
[00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:46.380]   just solidarity, tremendous amount of solidarity. And then I felt almost like if I was in Ukraine,
[00:50:46.380 --> 00:50:52.220]   when I see a lot of evil, where I saw a lot of evil, lots of it, but at the same time,
[00:50:52.220 --> 00:51:00.780]   a lot of human kindness, lots of it. So you could see good and evil. I saw good and evil in two
[00:51:00.780 --> 00:51:10.140]   places within the period of a month. And that gives me absolute confidence that God does care,
[00:51:10.140 --> 00:51:16.140]   because even when there is evil, there is abundance of grace and love.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:23.500]   Amen. So now you are, you're shipping your motorcycle and you're going to be heading back
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:31.500]   to Ukraine. So as you go forward, going back to Ukraine, does your mission look similar to
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:42.460]   what it did before? Well, I'm not sure where my team is right now or where they've been deployed.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:51.100]   I know they work because originally they were working north of Kiev,
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:52:00.060]   but now that the activities have taken place in the east, I don't really, I know they were,
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:06.380]   when I left, they were starting to plan, doing the planning for getting involved in the occupied
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:12.460]   territories in the west. But I don't have much contact with them. They know, I told them I'm
[00:52:12.460 --> 00:52:18.060]   coming back and I told them I will be coming and help with training on preparedness and
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:26.300]   emergency survival. So, but I haven't, I really don't know where I'm going to be deployed,
[00:52:26.300 --> 00:52:33.900]   depending where the team is. It could be Krakiv, it could be many people, but no, not on the cities.
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:40.700]   No, no, we, we, they usually go near, near where the action is taking place and they make themselves
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:47.420]   available for refugees or people in need of assistance. So they are behind the, they're,
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:54.060]   they don't, they, sometimes I hear that they have gone behind the lines to rescue people. So
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:58.140]   they're very protective of me, so they wouldn't let me go behind the lines.
[00:52:58.140 --> 00:53:05.980]   I had intended to draw out one more story from you and it has to do with the
[00:53:05.980 --> 00:53:14.540]   interaction between two areas, both in crisis zones. So while you have been in Ukraine,
[00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:21.740]   you've continued to be working and involved in Christian ministry in prisons all across
[00:53:21.740 --> 00:53:30.620]   Venezuela. I think we can talk about that now. And so there's been this amazing juxtaposition
[00:53:30.620 --> 00:53:36.620]   where, and again, if I, if I share any details that we shouldn't share, then of course, just let
[00:53:36.620 --> 00:53:41.180]   me know. But over the last couple of years, one of the things that has happened remarkably with
[00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:47.660]   some of your work and, and the things that we've been involved in is that opportunities for
[00:53:47.660 --> 00:53:53.980]   Christian ministry have opened up again in many Venezuelan prisons. And so you've been involved
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:54:02.860]   in coordinating and organizing a more formalized ministry effort in, in these prisons. And so
[00:54:03.740 --> 00:54:12.300]   I've seen pictures of prisoners in Venezuela gathering together to pray for those in Ukraine,
[00:54:12.300 --> 00:54:18.300]   and you've shared with Ukrainians and they're turning around and seeking to be an encouragement
[00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:24.060]   and pray for those in Venezuela. And I just think that's a remarkable story. Share a little bit
[00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:34.140]   about that, please. Well, we have definitely been blessed our ministry in Venezuela.
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:46.460]   We have access to six, seven penitentiaries now, and the churches that we have encountered us are
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:54.300]   completely alive. Like one church has 3,400 members. Another one has 2,000, over 2,000.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:59.580]   There is 38 churches that we now support indirectly. And also we're doing the gardening
[00:54:59.580 --> 00:55:08.700]   projects there. So we have, we have a lot of input and a lot of presence in different prisons now. So
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:18.780]   we are now currently serving to almost 12,000 inmates. And we have, we intend to, we go there
[00:55:18.780 --> 00:55:25.340]   every three, two to three months, visiting all the prisons, supervising our garden projects.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:32.060]   We provide employment to probably at least 300, 400 inmates in our gardens. So the ministry has
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:39.500]   grown considerably now. I hope it to go back when I, when I came back from Ukraine in August,
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:47.580]   and just continue supporting the ministry, the prison ministry. One of the things that happened
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:52.300]   was they said, when I told them, because we had a board of directors that I would call.
[00:55:52.300 --> 00:56:01.500]   So the inmates had vigils and they took my cost as their cost. And so they were like,
[00:56:01.980 --> 00:56:08.380]   outpouring of hundreds, thousands of people praying for me. And they would send me pictures
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:14.380]   of their prayer meetings. And literally you see five, 700, a thousand inmates
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:21.820]   gathering in, in, in soccer fields, baseball fields, basketball courts, and saying, "Neri,
[00:56:21.820 --> 00:56:25.180]   Pastor Neri." They call me Pastor Neri. "Pastor Neri, we're praying for you every day."
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:33.500]   So it was basically this, my, my mission brought a lot of unity in, in, in the prison ministry
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:39.420]   and the cost. So they, they're very supportive of what I'm doing in Ukraine. And of course,
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:45.500]   when I show pictures of the, of the inmates in, in Ukraine and all of them praying for me,
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:47.340]   people are really, really encouraging.
[00:56:47.340 --> 00:56:51.420]   - Wonderful. I thank you for coming on and sharing your stories. And it's my hope that
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:59.180]   we can take the lessons and be prepared for ourselves for some of these horrific disaster
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:03.900]   scenarios that you've described. And most importantly, so that we can be on a solid
[00:57:03.900 --> 00:57:08.300]   foundation to be able to help others who may not be prepared when, when this happens. Whether we
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:15.660]   face the disaster of the loss of a child or the loss of a friend in a, in a horrific massacre,
[00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:22.860]   or whether we face a war zone or an economic collapse, we want to be prepared to be positioned
[00:57:22.860 --> 00:57:27.980]   so that we can help our community and be in solidarity with those around us.
[00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:33.900]   - Yes. Thank you very much for having me. I appreciate that, Josh.
[00:57:33.900 --> 00:57:39.580]   - My pleasure. Thank you for coming on. And that brings us to the end of today's interview. If you
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:44.780]   are interested in more of the adventures of today's guest, you can find more information at
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:53.420]   creativephilanthropy.blog. Creativephilanthropy.blog. It's been a great, you can keep up with,
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:58.700]   keep up with his writings there, with his travels there, et cetera. Thank you so much. Thank you so
[00:57:58.700 --> 00:58:04.060]   much for listening. Thank you so much for, for contributing. By the way, you'll notice,
[00:58:04.060 --> 00:58:08.700]   a long time listeners of the show know that from time to time I've done various fundraising things.
[00:58:08.700 --> 00:58:12.700]   I've reported on some of the stuff happening in Venezuela. I've often taken some of the old
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:19.100]   episodes off of the feed and been somewhat cagey with details and whatnot, simply because of the
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:25.900]   sensitivity of it. But this audience has single handedly done a tremendous amount of work.
[00:58:25.900 --> 00:58:31.980]   Last year, or I guess two years ago, I raised a significant amount of money. We've purchased a
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:41.660]   truck and a truck and some other equipment for some of the, the relief workers and missionaries
[00:58:41.660 --> 00:58:46.380]   and relief workers working on the border. We've taken in significant amounts of food into
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:53.180]   Venezuela. Also started, you heard him allude to the garden projects, have a significant number
[00:58:53.180 --> 00:58:58.780]   of garden projects. And I've actually, it's opened up to be able to have a platform to do far more
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:03.580]   than we thought in the past. So at this point in time, we can actually do some of the work there
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:08.540]   in the prisons, can meet officially with permission of some of the officials, et cetera. So it's been
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:13.100]   a great, a very productive time. And I want to thank you for all of your involvement in that.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:19.580]   Thankfully, I think most of us don't live in these disaster zones. I think thankfully,
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:25.420]   it's not a deep impact to on a daily basis to most of our lives, but we still need to learn
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:31.020]   from those who are going through them. And may our hearts be touched and may we have opportunities
[00:59:31.020 --> 00:59:36.300]   to minister to those who are in need, open our wallets when possible, et cetera. Thank you for
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:52.860]   listening and I'll be back with you soon. [Music]
