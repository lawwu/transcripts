[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   My name is Paul. I'm an investor in Houston, Texas. I've been a ministry partner with Desiring God for 18 years.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.080]   You are listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast with John Piper.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.840]   That is my friend Paul and I want you to meet him in just a moment.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.420]   But today we field a question from a listener named Mark who lives in Midlothian, Virginia. Mark writes this, "Pastor John,
[00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.600]   I am eternally thankful for your life in ministry. My question is why Paul refuses to use the phrase 'follow
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:39.100]   Jesus' when speaking about saving faith or in his imperatives to the church. Jesus spoke this way a lot. In Matthew 4, 19,
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.260]   he said to his disciples, "Follow me and I will make you fishers of men."
[00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.640]   Jesus's command to follow seems significant in all four Gospels. In Matthew 8, 22,
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.740]   he says, "Follow me and leave the dead to bury their own dead." In Mark 10, 21,
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.840]   he says, "You lack one thing. Go, sell all that you have and give to the poor and you will have treasure in heaven and
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.080]   come follow me." In Luke 9, 23, he says, "If anyone would come after me,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.760]   let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.360]   follow me." And in John 10, 27, he says, "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me."
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.920]   Ketex, all of them. The Greek word for follow appears 89 times in the New Testament,
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.080]   but only once in Paul, in 1 Corinthians 10, 4. Basically, Paul avoids the language of following Jesus.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:31.020]   Why? And was this terminology more appropriate for those who could literally follow Christ during his ministry on earth?
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.020]   I think that last sentence,
[00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.680]   namely that while Jesus was here, in his bodily presence,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:46.880]   the words "follow me" had a very distinct and particular meaning with reference to Jesus' actual
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.920]   movements, physical movements and behavior on the ground.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.740]   That's very, very significant. When he said to the fishermen,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.280]   "Follow me," they left their nets and walked behind him. When he said to Levi, "Follow me,"
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:10.600]   he left his money table and he walked behind him. The words "follow me" were used not only because
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.640]   what he taught was what they should do,
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.880]   but also because he was an itinerant preacher who would
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.860]   show them in his deeds as they walked around with him
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:30.480]   how to live and how to minister. So I think Mark puts his finger on the issue
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.260]   with that last sentence that the words "follow me" had a special physical meaning in the presence of Jesus'
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.700]   physical body when he was here.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.960]   Let's make a few other observations that I think take us deeper into
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.680]   why
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.800]   none of the apostles made a practice of describing Christians as
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.320]   Jesus' followers, which is what a lot of people are doing today.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   I would just wave a little yellow flag that it might not be a good idea to make a
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:09.200]   dominant practice
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.120]   today out of something that is almost
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.920]   non-existent among the apostles in the New Testament.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.520]   After the resurrection, none of them called Christians
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   followers of Jesus. So here's a few observations. Number one, in John 13 36,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:35.240]   Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, where are you going?" Jesus answered him, "Where I am going, you cannot
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:38.260]   follow me now, but you will
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.160]   follow afterward." And Peter said, "Lord,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:49.760]   why cannot I follow you now? I lay down my life for you." And Jesus, in essence, said, "No, you can't, and you won't."
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.240]   So what did Jesus mean
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:56.520]   when he said, "You cannot follow me now,
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.000]   but you will afterwards"?
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.480]   Well, he meant, first of all, that I'm about to die on the cross, and you're not ready to follow me there.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.320]   You're going to deny me tonight, or, you know, three times. He says that in the next verse.
[00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.360]   But what did he mean when he said, "Later, you will follow me"? As if to say, "Later,
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.720]   you'll have the courage to die with me." Well,
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.440]   interestingly, in John 21
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.800]   17 to 19, after the resurrection of Jesus,
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.360]   he says to Peter,
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.000]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk where you wanted,
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.360]   but when you are old,
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:45.680]   you will stretch out your hands," and I think he's referring to the fact that Peter was crucified,
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.840]   "you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.040]   carry you where you do not want to go."
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.520]   This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God,
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.920]   namely to be crucified like Jesus. And after saying this, he said to him,
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.360]   "Follow me,"
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.320]   which I think is the answer to the question what Jesus meant back in chapter 13 when he said,
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.600]   "Afterwards, you will follow me." Right now, I'm going to die. You're not ready. You're going to deny me tonight.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.000]   "Afterward, you will follow me into death."
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.640]   So on the one hand, Jesus declares, "We have come to a point in my
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.520]   life here now where you can't follow me anymore. Not in the ordinary sense.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.920]   I'm going to die and leave, but if you want to think in those terms,
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:43.120]   the way to think is that you will follow me into death. You will die with me." And Paul was
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.760]   indeed willing to think that way in Romans 8, 17, where he said when he spoke of
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.960]   suffering with Jesus in this life and dying with
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.520]   Christ, the Christian life begins by dying with Jesus, Paul said.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:05.440]   His second observation, "With the departure of Jesus and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit,
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   the dominant way of thinking about the relationship between Jesus and his people is not
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   that we walk around behind him, but that he dwells in
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:23.360]   them, and they in him, and they enjoy union with him."
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.480]   Union with Christ,
[00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.480]   by the Spirit,
[00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:31.840]   replaces the relation to Christ by physical following.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:40.560]   Jesus said in John 14, 16, "I will ask the Father, and he will give you another helper to be with you forever,
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.920]   even the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.680]   You know him because he dwells with you and
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.480]   will be in you." Now, I think that's an indirect way of
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.920]   saying that Jesus is with them now, and they can follow around behind him, and
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:03.880]   later, by his Spirit, he will be in them.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:10.040]   Third observation, "With Jesus' departure into heaven, his earthly life is
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.360]   conceived of as an example that we look
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.880]   back on to follow,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:22.960]   rather than looking at the front of us as something to be
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:24.760]   followed."
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:32.240]   We imitate by looking backward at Jesus. For example, 1 Peter 2, 21, "Christ suffered
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:35.160]   for you, leaving you an example
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.400]   so that you might follow
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.080]   in his steps.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.560]   He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth."
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:48.120]   So, there has been a clear historical
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:51.720]   reversal of the way we orient to Jesus.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.840]   He's not physically out there in front of us,
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:00.920]   walking for us to follow. His life and teaching are fixed in
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:07.760]   history as an event and a pattern in the past that we now look back on and,
[00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:11.800]   in that sense, can follow an example.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:17.960]   But the word has a very different meaning when we use it that way than the way it was used by
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.520]   Jesus. Fourth observation,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:25.400]   "Jesus intended that his early followers, the apostles in particular,
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:32.080]   would complete the writing of a body of teaching that would be more complete
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.160]   than
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.120]   everything he said and did during his lifetime, because it would include a full
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:48.080]   documentation by his authoritative spokesman of his death and resurrection and the way the church should live in the light of it."
[00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:54.040]   That body of teaching, the New Testament, is now a fuller witness
[00:08:54.040 --> 00:09:02.120]   to be followed than the life and teachings of Jesus considered by themselves. So, Jesus himself would consider it a
[00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:10.600]   retrograde action, going backward in redemptive history to isolate the earthly life and teachings of Jesus
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:15.560]   for our following. But instead, the totality of the New Testament,
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.680]   informed by the Old, is the charter for the church's
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:27.080]   life. It is what we follow, and in doing so, in that sense,
[00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:34.840]   follow Jesus, since he's behind it. Last observation I would make is that the more profound
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:43.680]   summons of the New Testament is not that Jesus is a teacher to be followed, but he is a living, personal
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.520]   identity to be put on,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.320]   like a garment or a new self.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:56.040]   Galatians 3:27, "As many as were baptized into Christ have put on
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:00.280]   Christ." Romans 13, 14, "Put on
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:05.960]   the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires."
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:14.280]   Ephesians 4, 24, "Put on the new self." So, Christ is our new
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:20.860]   identity. So, the new identity of discipleship is something far more profound
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:27.640]   than the impression you get with the words, "Follow Jesus." I think the apostles considered those words
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:30.540]   inadequate to capture the mystery of
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:36.060]   Christ in you, the hope of glory, as Paul calls it in
[00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:38.580]   Colossians 1:27.
[00:10:38.580 --> 00:10:42.700]   Very good. Thank you, Pastor John. And Mark, thank you for the wonderful question today.
[00:10:42.700 --> 00:10:49.540]   Well, at the start of this episode, you heard from Paul, a precious friend of mine into the ministry, a household name to us at DG.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:54.520]   Paul joins us right now over the phone from Houston. Paul, thank you for your time. Give us some reasons why.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:10:58.940]   Why do you support the ministry of Desiring God?
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:05.300]   I financially support the ministry because it cost-effectively reaches millions of people with biblically faithful
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:13.740]   content covering a broad spectrum of issues. For me, the APJ podcast has provided practical pastoral help for daily living and
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:19.920]   application of theological issues to life. I regularly use the podcast and ministry to others.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.160]   I know you do, and it's an encouragement to hear how you use this podcast to serve others. Paul,
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:26.820]   you're a numbers guy.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:31.980]   Give us some numbers for why you would encourage listeners to consider becoming a ministry partner with Desiring God.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.600]   What catches your attention with regard to DG?
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:42.660]   200 billion DG resources were accessed in the 12 months ended June 2020. That's on track to grow again this year.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:48.740]   We've all experienced accelerated use of technology to accomplish ministry over the past six months.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:53.060]   Desiring God is well positioned on several content distribution
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:58.500]   platforms to minister around the world to millions of people who need to hear the gospel.
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   We'd love to see you join the team.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:07.220]   You can give with confidence because Desiring God is a careful steward of donor contributions. Paul, thank you.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:14.060]   We so appreciate what you do for the ministry. You've served DG in so many different capacities and are a key ministry partner.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.560]   We are really grateful to God for you. My pleasure. I love doing it.
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:19.860]   Hope to see you again soon.
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:21.660]   Amen. Yeah, see you soon, brother.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:27.320]   And if you want to join Paul in becoming a ministry partner so we can make even more DG resources and spread those resources even
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:32.540]   more aggressively around the world, you can join us right now. Go to DesiringGod.org/donate.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:39.740]   That's DesiringGod.org/donate. We appreciate it. I'm Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on Wednesday. Thanks for listening.
