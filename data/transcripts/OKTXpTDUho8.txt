[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   Building good habits takes time, but it's absolutely worth it.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:06.600]   And one of the most important habits I built last year was waking up early.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.160]   I've never really been a morning person.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.280]   I've always been a little bit more of a stay up late and get stuff done.
[00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.880]   And I was able to create this uninterrupted time in my schedule,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.200]   anywhere from one to two hours, depending on when I woke up, when the kids woke up.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.240]   And I've used that time for exercise, for work, for cold plunges and a lot more.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.760]   And it feels easy now.
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.440]   And the trick for me was that it wasn't about when I woke up.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.600]   It was about when I went to bed.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.280]   And so I made my habit at night.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:33.000]   So start small, focus on keystone habits because they create a ripple effect in your life.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.880]   And let's try to commit all of us to building some better habits in the year ahead.
