[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   What is your opinion of neo-reactionaries?
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.960]   I guess they're not in favor of 10% less democracy.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.180]   They're more in favor of a hundred percent less democracy, but.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.220]   Yeah, I think they're like too much LARPing, too much
[00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.120]   romanticizing about the Rohirrim.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.540]   I don't know.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.620]   What are the Rohirrim?
[00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.980]   Yeah, all of the, these guys and the Lord of the Rings.
[00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.180]   Romanticizing monarchy is a mistake.
[00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.300]   It's worth noting that as my colleague, Gordon Tolick pointed
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.940]   out, as well as many others, in equilibrium, kings are almost
[00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.500]   always king and council.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.620]   So it's worth thinking through why king and council is the equilibrium.
[00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.020]   Something more like a corporate board and less either the libertarian
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.860]   ideal of the entrepreneur who owns the firm or the monarch who has the long-term
[00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.740]   interest in being a stationary bandit.
[00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.140]   In real life, there's this sort of muddled thing in between that works
[00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.700]   out as the equilibrium, even in the successful monarchies.
[00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.180]   So it's worth thinking through why it is that the successful monarchies
[00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.740]   aren't really monarchies, right?
[00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:56.820]   They're really oligarchies.
