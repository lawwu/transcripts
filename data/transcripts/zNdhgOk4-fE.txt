[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   The following is a conversation with Silvio Micali,
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.800]   a computer scientist at MIT, winner of the Turing Award,
[00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.300]   and one of the leading minds in the fields of cryptography,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.760]   information security, game theory,
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.060]   and most recently, cryptocurrency
[00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.260]   and the theoretical foundations of a fully decentralized,
[00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.980]   secure, and scalable blockchain and Algorand,
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.360]   a company of cryptographers, engineers, and mathematicians
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.400]   that he founded in 2017.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.160]   Quick mention of our sponsors,

[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.600]   As a side note, let me say that I will be having
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440]   many conversations this year on the topic of cryptocurrency.
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.440]   I'm reading and thinking a lot on this topic.
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.900]   I just recently finished reading "The Bitcoin Standard,"
[00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.020]   a book I highly recommend.
[00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.740]   As always with this podcast,
[00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.860]   I'm approaching it with an open mind,
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.900]   with compassion, with as little ego as possible,
[00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.240]   and yes, with love.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.500]   I hope you go along with me on this journey
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.500]   and don't judge me too harshly on any likely missteps.
[00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.120]   As usual, I will play devil's advocate.
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.000]   I will, on purpose, sometimes, ask simple,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.800]   even dumb questions, all to try and explore
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.880]   the space of ideas here with as much grace as I can muster.
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.760]   I have no financial interests here.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.380]   I only have a simple curiosity and a love for knowledge,
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.800]   especially about a set of technologies
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.840]   that may very well transform
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.560]   the fabric of human civilization.

[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.300]   And now, here's my conversation with Silvio Macaulay.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.180]   Let's start with the big and the basic question.
[00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.680]   What is a blockchain, and why is it interesting,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.100]   why is it fascinating, why is it powerful?
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.560]   - All right, so a blockchain, think of it,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.080]   is really a common database distributed.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.600]   Think about it as a ledger
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.840]   in which everybody can write an entry in a page.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.900]   You can write, I can write,
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.980]   and everybody can read,
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.560]   and you have a guarantee that everybody
[00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.980]   has the same copy of the ledger that is in front of you.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.060]   So whatever you see on page seven,
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.900]   anyone else sees on page seven.
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.580]   So what is extraordinary about this
[00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.620]   is this common knowledge thing
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.000]   that I think is a really a first for humanity.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.960]   I mean, if you look at communication,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.100]   like right now, you can communicate very quickly
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.440]   images of photos, but do you have the certainty
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.280]   that whatever you have received
[00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.440]   has been received by everybody else?
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.480]   Not really.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.860]   And so there's a commonality of knowledge
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.620]   and the certainty that everybody can write,
[00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.620]   nobody has been prevented from writing whatever they want,
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.380]   nobody can erase, nobody can tear a page of a ledger,
[00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.840]   nobody can swap page, nobody can change anything,
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.840]   and that is immutable common record is extremely powerful.
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.540]   - And there's something fundamental
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.020]   that is decentralized about it,
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.920]   so at least in spirit, some degree,
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.220]   or against maybe a resistance to centralization.
[00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.060]   - Absolutely.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.900]   If it is not decentralized,
[00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:40.040]   how can it be common knowledge?
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.520]   If only one person or a few people have a ledger,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.500]   the only, you don't have a ledger,
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.780]   you have to ask, you know, what is on page seven,
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.400]   and how do you know that whatever they tell you
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.060]   is on page seven, they tell the same thing to everybody else.
[00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.060]   And so this commonality is extremely powerful.
[00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.100]   Just to give you an example,
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.420]   assume that you do an auction, okay?
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.960]   You have worked very hard, you build a building,
[00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.960]   and now you want to auction off.
[00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.980]   Makes sense because you want to auction worldwide,
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.100]   better yet, you want to tokenize the building
[00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.040]   and sell it in parcels.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.860]   Now, everybody sees the bids,
[00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.620]   and you know that everybody sees the bids.
[00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.380]   You and I see the same bid, and so does everybody else.
[00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.820]   So you know that a fair price has reached,
[00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.340]   and you know who owns what and who has paid how much.
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.140]   And if you do it instead of a wise,
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.580]   you know, in a centralized system,
[00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.820]   I put a bid, say, "Oh, congratulations, Alex, you won,
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.060]   "and your price is $12,570."
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.940]   How do you know? (laughs)
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.460]   So if instead of a set,
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   common knowledge is a very powerful tool for humanity.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.300]   - So we return to it from a bunch of different perspectives,
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.020]   including like a technical perspective,
[00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:04.980]   but you often talk about blockchain
[00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.180]   and some of these concepts of decentralization,
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.540]   scalability, security, all those kinds of things,
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:17.540]   but one of the most maybe impactful, exciting things
[00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.860]   that leverage the blockchain,
[00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.100]   this kind of ledger idea of common knowledge,
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.900]   is cryptocurrency in the financial space.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.540]   So is there, can you say in the same kind of basic way,
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:33.980]   what is cryptocurrency in the context of this
[00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.100]   common knowledge and in the context of the blockchain?
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.060]   - Great.
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.100]   Cryptocurrency, that is a currency that is on such a ledger.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.220]   So imagine that on the ledger, right,
[00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.220]   initially, you know that somehow, say,
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.620]   you and I are the only owner of each one.
[00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.700]   Let's give it ourselves a billion each
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.500]   or whatever this unit.
[00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.220]   Then I start writing on the ledger.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.860]   I give 100 of these units to my sister.
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.580]   I give this much to my aunt,
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:09.820]   and then now, because it's written on the ledger
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.620]   and everybody can see, my sister can give 57 of these units
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.100]   that she received from me to somebody else.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.300]   And so, and that is money.
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.740]   And that is money because you can see
[00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:24.580]   that somebody who tenders your payment
[00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.620]   has really the money there, right?
[00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.100]   You don't have any more of a doubt
[00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.860]   when you want to sell an item.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:32.380]   If I write you a check, is the check covered?
[00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.820]   If I write, or do I have the money
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.540]   at the moment of a transaction?
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:40.460]   You really see, because the ledger is always updated,
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:41.980]   what you see is what I see,
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:45.180]   and what the merchant sees, you know that the money.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.140]   So it's the most powerful money system there is
[00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.140]   because it is totally transparent,
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:54.820]   and so you know that you have been paid,
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.060]   and you know that the money is there.
[00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.860]   You have not to second-guess anything else.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.180]   - So the common knowledge applied there
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:04.460]   is you're basically mimicking the same kind of thing
[00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.060]   you would get in the physical space,
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.220]   which is if you give 100 bucks,
[00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:11.660]   or 100 of that thing, whatever,
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:14.340]   of that cryptocurrency to your sister,
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.140]   the actual transfer is as real
[00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.140]   as you giving a basket of apples to your sister.
[00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:27.680]   Because, so in the case in the physical space,
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.060]   the common knowledge is in the physics.
[00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:32.900]   - Right. - Of the atoms.
[00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:34.420]   And in its digital space,
[00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:36.900]   the common knowledge is in this ledger.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:41.900]   And so that transfer holds the same kind of power,
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.200]   but now it's operating in the digital space.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.040]   - Correct.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.420]   - Again, I apologize for a set of ridiculous questions,
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.300]   but you mentioned cryptocurrencies and money.
[00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:57.980]   What is money?
[00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.300]   Why do we have money?
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:01.020]   Do you think about this
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:05.300]   kind of from this high philosophical level at times
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:09.340]   of this tool, this idea that we humans
[00:08:09.340 --> 00:08:11.100]   have all kind of came up with
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:13.920]   and seem to be using effectively to do stuff?
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:20.060]   - Money is a social construct, okay, in my opinion.
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:22.300]   And this has been somehow,
[00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.860]   people always felt that somehow money
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:28.620]   is a way to allow us to transact,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.700]   even though we want different things.
[00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:35.300]   So I have two sheep,
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:37.580]   and then you have one cow,
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.900]   and I want the cow,
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.780]   but you are looking for blankets instead.
[00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:44.780]   So to have money, it really simplifies this.
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:47.820]   But at the end of, and that's why a bit was invented,
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.260]   and you start with gold,
[00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:51.220]   you start with corniage,
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.780]   then you start with check.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:54.340]   But at the end of the day,
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:57.260]   money is essentially a social construct
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:59.980]   because you know that what you receive,
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:02.460]   you can actually spend it with somebody else.
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:04.820]   And so there is a kind of a social pact
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.980]   and social belief that you have.
[00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.700]   At the end of the day,
[00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:13.460]   even a barter requires
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.020]   this beliefs that other people are going to accept
[00:09:18.020 --> 00:09:21.100]   the quote unquote currency you offer them.
[00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:22.900]   Because if I'm a mason,
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:27.740]   and you ask me to build a wall in your field,
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.820]   and I did, and you, in exchange,
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:32.700]   you give me a thousand sheep,
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:34.300]   what am I going to do, eat them all?
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.340]   No, I have to feed them.
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.580]   And if I don't feed them, they die,
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:39.180]   and my value is zero.
[00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:42.260]   So in receiving this livestock,
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.100]   I must believe that somebody else
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.780]   will accept them in return for something else.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.820]   So money is this social belief,
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:56.500]   social shared belief system that makes people transact.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:57.340]   - That's fascinating.
[00:09:57.340 --> 00:09:59.100]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.540]   That you're actually,
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:04.980]   you have a deep network of beliefs
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.860]   about how society operates.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.500]   So the value is assigned even to sheep,
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:12.100]   based on that everyone will continue operating
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:14.500]   how they were previously operating.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.940]   Somebody will feed the sheep.
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:17.500]   (laughing)
[00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:19.260]   I didn't even think about that.
[00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.380]   That's fascinating.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:25.380]   So that directly transfers to the space of money,
[00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:27.820]   and then to the space of digital money, cryptocurrency.
[00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:32.340]   Okay, does it bother you, sort of intellectually,
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:34.820]   when this money that is a social construct
[00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:38.620]   is not directly tied to physical goods,
[00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.420]   like gold, for example?
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.820]   - Not at all, because after all,
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.620]   gold has some industrial value,
[00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.020]   nobody delights, it's a metal,
[00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:53.380]   it doesn't oxidate, it has some good things about it.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:57.100]   But does this industrial value really represent
[00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.780]   the value to which it now is traded?
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:10:59.620]   No.
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:02.700]   So gold is another way to express our belief.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.260]   I give you an ounce of gold,
[00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:07.380]   you treat it like, oh, somebody else will want this
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:09.580]   for doing something else.
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:12.540]   So it is really this notion of this,
[00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:14.660]   money is a mental construct,
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:18.620]   is really, and is a shared, is a social construct,
[00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.060]   I really believe.
[00:11:20.060 --> 00:11:22.060]   And so some people feel that it's physical,
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.100]   so therefore gold exists.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.940]   But then, as you know now,
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:31.900]   countries, most sophisticated countries right now,
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.620]   they print their own money,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.300]   and you believe that they are not going to exaggerate it
[00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:38.820]   with inflation, not everybody believes it,
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:41.380]   but I'm saying there is at least,
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:44.900]   they are not going to exaggerate it blatantly,
[00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.980]   and therefore you receive it,
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:50.540]   because you know that somebody else will accept it,
[00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.060]   will have faith in the currency, and so on and so forth.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:55.860]   But whether it's gold, whether it's livestock,
[00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.780]   whatever it is, money is really a shared belief.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:01.700]   - So there is something,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.300]   and I've been reading more and more
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.220]   about different cryptocurrencies,
[00:12:05.220 --> 00:12:12.020]   there is a kind of belief that the scarcity
[00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:14.380]   of a particular resource, like Bitcoin,
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.620]   has a limited amount,
[00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:21.540]   and it's tied to physical, to proof of work,
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:24.100]   so it's tied to physical reality
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.180]   in terms of how much you can mine effectively, and so on,
[00:12:28.180 --> 00:12:30.980]   that that's an important feature of money.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:32.820]   Do you think that's an important feature
[00:12:32.820 --> 00:12:35.780]   to be part of whatever the money is?
[00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.380]   - That is certainly a very useful part.
[00:12:38.380 --> 00:12:40.940]   So at some point in time,
[00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:44.220]   assume that money is something that all of a sudden
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:46.860]   we say this is our money, our currency.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:50.220]   Then I offer you 10 daisies in payment
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:53.420]   of whatever goods and services you want to provide,
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:55.260]   but at the end of the day,
[00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:57.700]   if you know that you can cultivate it
[00:12:57.700 --> 00:13:00.380]   and generate them at will,
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:04.380]   then perhaps you should not accept my payment.
[00:13:04.380 --> 00:13:08.460]   Here is a bouquet of daisies.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:10.660]   So you need some kind of a scarcity,
[00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.660]   the inability to create it suddenly out of nothing
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.620]   is unimportant.
[00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:21.620]   And it's not an intrinsic necessity,
[00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:24.740]   but it's much easier to accept
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.540]   once you know that there is a fixed number of units
[00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:29.540]   of whatever currency there is,
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.900]   and therefore you can mentally understand
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.500]   I'm getting this much of this piece of pie,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:39.020]   and therefore I consider myself paid.
[00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.460]   I understand what I'm receiving.
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:43.860]   - You described the goals of a blockchain.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:45.420]   You have a nice presentation on this.
[00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.820]   As scalability, security, and decentralization.
[00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:53.020]   And you challenged the blockchain trilemma
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:55.660]   that claims you can only have two of the three.
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:58.140]   So let's talk about each.
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:00.500]   What is scalability in the context
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.140]   of blockchain and cryptocurrency?
[00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.780]   What does scalability mean?
[00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:08.780]   - So remember, we said that the blockchain is a ledger,
[00:14:08.780 --> 00:14:12.460]   and each page receives, gets some transaction,
[00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:16.060]   and everybody can write in these pages of a ledger.
[00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:17.540]   Nobody can be stopped from writing,
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:18.740]   and everybody can read them.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:22.340]   Okay, scalability means how fast can you write?
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.180]   Just imagine that you can write an entry
[00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:29.300]   in this special shared ledger once every hour.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.020]   Well, what are you going to do
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:33.580]   if you have one transaction per hour?
[00:14:33.580 --> 00:14:35.220]   The world doesn't go around.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.180]   So you need to have scalability means here
[00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:42.860]   that you can somehow write a lot of transaction,
[00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:45.100]   and then you can read them,
[00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:47.100]   and everybody can validate them.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.300]   And that is the speed,
[00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:53.180]   and the number of transactions per second,
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:54.940]   and the fact that they are shared.
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.540]   So you want to have this speed,
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:00.860]   not only in writing, but in sharing,
[00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:04.620]   and in inspection for validity.
[00:15:04.620 --> 00:15:05.940]   This is scalability.
[00:15:05.940 --> 00:15:07.620]   The world is big.
[00:15:07.620 --> 00:15:09.300]   The world wants to interact.
[00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:11.220]   The people want to interact with each other,
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:13.700]   and you better be prepared to have a ledger
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.460]   in which you can write lots and lots and lots of transactions
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:18.900]   in this special way very, very, very quickly.
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:21.660]   - So maybe from a more mathematical perspective,
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:26.620]   or can we say something about how much scalability is needed
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:28.980]   for a world that is big?
[00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:32.220]   - Well, it really depends how many transactions you want,
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:36.500]   but remember that I think right now
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:39.540]   you have to go into at least thousands of transactions
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:46.020]   per second, even if you look at credit cards, right?
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:49.540]   We are going to go from an average of 1,600
[00:15:49.540 --> 00:15:54.540]   to peaks of 20,000, 40,000, something like this.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:57.900]   But remember, it's not only a question
[00:15:57.900 --> 00:15:59.700]   of the transaction per se,
[00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:02.220]   but the value is that the transaction
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.900]   is actually being shared and visible to everybody,
[00:16:06.900 --> 00:16:09.340]   and the certainty that that is the case.
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.900]   I can print on my own printer way more transactions,
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.700]   but nobody has the time to see or to inspect,
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.220]   and that doesn't count, right?
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:22.540]   So you want scalability at this common knowledge level,
[00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:24.100]   and that is the challenge.
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:25.700]   - I also meant from a perspective
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:28.340]   of like a complexity analysis.
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:30.540]   So does it, you know,
[00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:33.020]   when you get more and more people involved,
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.620]   doesn't it just scale in some kind of way that,
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.380]   do you like to see certain kind of properties
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:42.740]   in order to say something is scalable?
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:43.700]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.380]   I took a little bit implicitly
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:49.260]   that the people transacting are actually very different.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.660]   So if there is two people who can do
[00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:54.460]   thousands of transactions per second with each other,
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.020]   this is not so interesting.
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.820]   What we really need is to say there are billions of people
[00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:00.420]   at any point in time, you know,
[00:17:00.420 --> 00:17:02.020]   thousands and thousands of them
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.340]   want to transact with each other,
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:06.460]   and you want to support that.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:09.860]   - So Algorand, it solves,
[00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:14.100]   so that's the company, the team of cryptographers,
[00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:16.140]   and mathematicians, engineers, and so on,
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:18.180]   that challenged the blockchain trilemma.
[00:17:18.180 --> 00:17:23.540]   So let's break it down in terms of achieving scalability.
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.900]   How do we achieve scalability in the space of blockchain,
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.860]   in the space of cryptocurrency?
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.900]   - Okay, so scalability, security,
[00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.940]   remember, and decentralization, right?
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.540]   So that's what you want.
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.620]   - What's the best way to approach?
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:37.660]   Can we break it down?
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.060]   Let's start with scalability
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:41.140]   and think about how do we achieve it.
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.140]   - Well, to achieve it one at a time is perhaps an easy,
[00:17:46.140 --> 00:17:50.140]   even security, if nobody transacts, nobody loses money.
[00:17:50.140 --> 00:17:53.860]   So that is secure, but it's not scalable.
[00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.300]   So let me tell you, I'm a cryptographer,
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:59.420]   so I try to fight the bad guys,
[00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:03.060]   and what you want is that a vessel ledger,
[00:18:03.060 --> 00:18:07.140]   that we discussed before, cannot be tampered with.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:10.140]   So you must think of it as a special ink
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.900]   that nobody can erase.
[00:18:11.900 --> 00:18:16.900]   Then it has to be, everybody should be able to read,
[00:18:16.900 --> 00:18:22.540]   and not to alter the pages or the content of the pages.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.700]   That's okay.
[00:18:23.700 --> 00:18:27.860]   But you know what, that is actually easy cryptographically.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:30.740]   Easy cryptographically means you can use tools
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.060]   invented 50 years ago,
[00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:35.340]   which in cryptographic time is prehistory, okay?
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.060]   We are cavemen working around
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.660]   and solve our problem in cryptography land.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:43.420]   But there is really a fundamental problem,
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.020]   which is really almost a social,
[00:18:45.020 --> 00:18:47.140]   it seems a political problem, is to say,
[00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:53.100]   who the hell chooses or publishes
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:54.940]   the next page on the ledger?
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:58.300]   I mean, that is really the challenge.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:00.780]   This ledger, you can always add a page,
[00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:03.820]   'cause more and more transactions have to be written on there
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:07.180]   and somebody has to assemble this transaction,
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:10.260]   put them on a page, and add the next page.
[00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.300]   Who is the somebody who chooses the page and adds it on?
[00:19:13.300 --> 00:19:14.740]   - Who can be trusted to do it.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.900]   - Exactly.
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:17.860]   Assume it is me, for the time being,
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:19.660]   not that I want to volunteer for the job,
[00:19:19.660 --> 00:19:21.980]   but then I would have more power
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:24.620]   than any absolute monarch in history,
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.180]   because I would have tremendous power to say,
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:31.660]   these are the transactions that the entire world should see,
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:33.460]   and whatever I don't write,
[00:19:33.460 --> 00:19:36.540]   this transaction will never see the light of day.
[00:19:36.540 --> 00:19:39.820]   I mean, no one had any such power in history.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:43.420]   So it's very important to do that.
[00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:47.340]   And that is the quintessential problem in a blockchain,
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.700]   and people have thought about it to say,
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:50.860]   it's not me, it's not you,
[00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:54.420]   but for instance, in proof of work,
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.580]   what people say is they say,
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:19:58.140]   okay, it's not me, it's not you, you know what it is?
[00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:00.820]   We make a very difficult,
[00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:04.540]   we invent a cryptographic puzzle, very hard to solve.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:07.300]   The first one to solve it has the right
[00:20:07.300 --> 00:20:11.180]   to add one page to the ledger on behalf of everybody else.
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:17.300]   That's now seems okay, because sometimes I solve a puzzle,
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.020]   before you do, sometimes you solve it before I do,
[00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:22.740]   or before somebody else, somebody else solves it, it's okay.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:26.180]   - And presumably the effort you put in
[00:20:26.180 --> 00:20:28.660]   is somehow correlated with how much trust
[00:20:28.660 --> 00:20:33.580]   you should be given to add to the ledger.
[00:20:33.580 --> 00:20:36.020]   - Yeah, so somehow you want to make sure that,
[00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.500]   you need to work because you want to prevent,
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.100]   you want to make sure that you get one solution
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.380]   every 10 minutes, say,
[00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:47.780]   like in particular example of Bitcoin.
[00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:50.660]   So that is very rare that two pages are added
[00:20:50.660 --> 00:20:53.740]   at the same time, because if I solve a puzzle
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:57.540]   at the same time you do, it could happen that,
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:00.020]   if it happens once or twice, we can survive it.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:04.500]   But if it happens, every other page is a double page,
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:06.940]   then which of the two is the real page,
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:08.380]   it becomes a problem.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:11.940]   So that's why in Bitcoin, it is important
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:14.020]   to have a substantial amount of work
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:17.300]   so that no many, how many people try on earth
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:20.780]   to solve a puzzle, you have one solution
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.620]   out of how many people are trying every 10 minutes.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.980]   So that you have, you distanciate these pages
[00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:28.780]   and you have the time to propagate
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.660]   for the network a solution and the page attached to it.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.340]   And therefore there is one page at a time that is added.
[00:21:36.340 --> 00:21:38.780]   And you say, well, why don't we do it?
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.940]   We have a solution.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:44.580]   Well, first of all, a page every 10 minutes
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.940]   is not fast enough.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.900]   It's a question of scalability.
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:50.980]   And second of all, to ensure that no matter
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:55.820]   how many people try, you get one page every 10 minutes,
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.780]   one solution to the riddle every 10 minutes.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:03.100]   This means that the riddle becomes very, very hard.
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:07.740]   And to have a chance to solve it within 10 minutes,
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.380]   you must have such an expensive apparatus
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:13.620]   in terms of specialized computers,
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:16.140]   not one, not two, but 1,000 and 1,000 of them.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:18.100]   And they produce tons of heat, okay?
[00:22:18.100 --> 00:22:20.220]   These dissipate heat like a maniac.
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:22.380]   And then you have to refrigerate them too.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:25.980]   And so then now you have air conditioning galore
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:26.980]   to add to the thing.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:31.780]   It becomes so expensive that fewer and fewer people
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:35.700]   can actually compete in order to add to the page.
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:40.700]   And the problem becomes so crucial
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:46.140]   that in Bitcoin, depending on which day of the week
[00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.980]   you look at it, you are going to have
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.100]   two or three mining pools are really the ones
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:56.060]   capable of controlling the chain.
[00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:59.540]   - So you're saying that's almost like
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.740]   leads to centralization.
[00:23:01.740 --> 00:23:04.460]   - Right, it started being decentralized.
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:08.700]   And but the expenses become higher and higher and higher.
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:11.020]   When the cost becomes higher and higher,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.860]   fewer and fewer people can afford them.
[00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:17.100]   And then it becomes de facto centralized, right?
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:18.380]   - Yeah.
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:22.820]   - And the different type of approach is instead,
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:25.500]   for instance, a delegated proof of stake,
[00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:29.220]   which is also very easy to explain.
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:31.220]   Essentially boils down to say,
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:35.300]   well, look at these 21 people say, okay?
[00:23:35.300 --> 00:23:36.820]   Don't they look honest?
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:37.820]   Yes, they do.
[00:23:37.820 --> 00:23:41.180]   In fact, I believe that they're going to remain honest
[00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:42.540]   for the foreseeable future.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:44.580]   So why don't we do ourselves a favor?
[00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.860]   Let's entrust them to add the page
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.820]   on behalf of all of us to the ledger, okay?
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:55.140]   Okay, but now we are going to say,
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.260]   is this centralized or decentralized?
[00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:01.140]   Well, 21 is better than one, I have to say, is very little.
[00:24:01.140 --> 00:24:05.140]   So if you look at when people rebelled to centralized power,
[00:24:05.140 --> 00:24:07.260]   I don't know, the French revolutions, okay?
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:09.100]   There was a monarch and the nobles.
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:09.940]   - Yes.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:11.660]   - Were there 21 nobles?
[00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:13.660]   No, there were thousands of them,
[00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:15.500]   but there were millions and millions
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.900]   of disempowered citizens.
[00:24:17.900 --> 00:24:22.180]   So one is centralized, 21 is also centralized, right?
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:24.100]   - So that's delegated proof of stake.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:24.940]   - Delegated proof of stake.
[00:24:24.940 --> 00:24:27.180]   - Kind of like representative democracy, I guess.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:29.740]   - Yes, which is good.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:30.740]   - It's working great, right?
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.620]   - It's working great.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.060]   Well, it's better than--
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.660]   - It's better than a monarch, right?
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:37.980]   And, but--
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.460]   - There's problems.
[00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:41.940]   - There are problems.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.940]   And so we were looking for a different,
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:50.980]   when thinking about Algorand, for a different approach.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.980]   And so we have an approach in that,
[00:24:54.980 --> 00:24:56.820]   it's really, really decentralized
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.820]   because essentially it works as follows.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.900]   You have a bunch of tokens, right?
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:07.100]   These are the tokens that have equal power.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.860]   And you have, say, 10 billions of tokens
[00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:13.100]   distributed to the entire world.
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   And the owners, each token has a chance to add the ledger,
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.860]   equal probability to everybody else.
[00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:26.900]   In fact, actually, if you want, here is how it works.
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.580]   So think about, by some magic cryptographic process,
[00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:33.220]   which is not magic, it's mathematics,
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:34.860]   but think of it as magic.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.580]   Assume that you select 1,000 tokens,
[00:25:38.580 --> 00:25:42.820]   and so sometimes at random, okay?
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:45.340]   And you have a guarantee that the random selected.
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:49.500]   And then the owners of these 1,000 tokens
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.860]   somehow agree on the next page, they all sign it,
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:56.780]   and that is the next page, okay?
[00:25:56.780 --> 00:25:59.940]   So it is clear that nobody has the power,
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:04.940]   but once in a while, one of your tokens is selected
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:09.020]   and you are in charge of this committee
[00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:10.540]   to select the next page.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:13.820]   But this goes around very quickly.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:15.420]   So and if you look at this,
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:19.500]   the question really is that it's not really centralized,
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.940]   and because for agreeing on the same page,
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:27.180]   it is important that the 1,000 tokens
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:30.540]   that you randomly selected are in honest hands,
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:32.300]   the majority of them.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:36.140]   So which, if the majority of the tokens are in honest hands,
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.820]   that is essentially true,
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.500]   because if the majority of the tokens are in honest hands,
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:44.980]   if you select, say, 90% of the people are,
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:48.460]   90% of the tokens are in honest hands,
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:51.220]   so can you randomly select 1,000,
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:56.220]   and in this 1,000, you find the 501 tokens in bad hands.
[00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:58.540]   Very, very improbable.
[00:26:58.540 --> 00:27:03.100]   - So basically, when a large fraction of people are honest,
[00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.100]   then you can use randomness as a powerful tool
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:08.460]   to get decentralization.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.300]   - Correct.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.580]   - So what does honesty mean,
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.820]   and now we're into the social side of things,
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:19.820]   which is how do we know that,
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:23.780]   like, a large fraction of people
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.180]   or participating parties are honest?
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.020]   - That is an excellent question.
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:30.620]   So by the way, first of all, we should realize
[00:27:30.620 --> 00:27:33.700]   that the same thing is for every other system.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:35.260]   When you look at proof of work,
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:39.660]   you rely that the majority of the mining power
[00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:41.180]   is in honest hands.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:44.180]   When you look at delegated proof of stake,
[00:27:44.180 --> 00:27:48.420]   you rely that the majority of these 21 people are honest.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:49.700]   What is the difference?
[00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.940]   The difference is that in these other systems,
[00:27:53.940 --> 00:27:57.420]   you should say the whole economy is secure
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:02.420]   if the majority of this small piece of economy are honest.
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.260]   And that is a big question.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:09.220]   But instead, in Algorand, in our approach, we say,
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:12.020]   the whole economy is secure
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.580]   if the majority of the economy is honest.
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.980]   In other words, who can subvert Algorand?
[00:28:16.980 --> 00:28:19.380]   It's not a majority of a small group,
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:21.580]   but it is a majority of the token holders
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:23.300]   have to conspire with each other
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:25.380]   in order to sink the very economy
[00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:28.020]   for which they own the majority of.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:29.780]   That I think it is a bit harder to--
[00:28:29.780 --> 00:28:32.540]   - Like a self-destructive majority, essentially.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.780]   And you're also making me realize that basically,
[00:28:36.780 --> 00:28:39.900]   every system that we have in the world today
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:44.900]   assumes that the majority of participants is honest.
[00:28:44.900 --> 00:28:48.180]   - Yes, the only difference is the majority of whom.
[00:28:48.180 --> 00:28:51.140]   And in some cases, the majority of a club,
[00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:53.660]   and in our case, it's the majority of the whole system.
[00:28:53.660 --> 00:28:54.900]   - The whole system.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:59.900]   Okay, so that's, so through that kind of random sampling,
[00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.380]   you can achieve decentralization.
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:10.140]   You can achieve, so the scalability, I understand.
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:14.060]   And then the security that you're referring to,
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.980]   basically, the security comes from the fact
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:20.980]   that the sample selected would likely include honest people.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.980]   So it's very difficult to, so by the way,
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:26.260]   the security, as you mentioned,
[00:29:26.260 --> 00:29:29.220]   that you're referring to is basically
[00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:32.460]   security against dishonesty, right?
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:33.740]   Or manipulation or whatever.
[00:29:33.740 --> 00:29:35.100]   - Yes, yes.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.620]   So essentially, what you're going to do
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.860]   is to the following, say,
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:41.500]   "Well, Silvio, I understood what you're saying,
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:43.980]   "but somebody has to randomly select these tokens,
[00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:47.380]   "and I believe you, so then who does this random selection?"
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:52.380]   And in our ground, we do something a little bit unorthodox.
[00:29:52.380 --> 00:29:57.900]   Essentially, it's the token choose themselves at random.
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.620]   And you say, "If you think about it,
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.660]   "that seems to be a terrible idea."
[00:30:02.660 --> 00:30:05.300]   Because if you want to say, "Choose yourself at random,
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.500]   "and whoever chooses himself is a 1,000 people committee,
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.340]   "you choose the page for the rest of us."
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.820]   And because if I'm a bad person,
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:16.460]   I'm going to select myself over and over again
[00:30:16.460 --> 00:30:18.020]   because I want to be part of the committee
[00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:19.700]   every single time.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:21.180]   But not so fast.
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:23.580]   So what do we do in our ground?
[00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:25.260]   What does it mean that I select myself?
[00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.180]   That each one of us,
[00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.460]   in the privacy of our own computer, actually a laptop,
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:35.460]   what you do is that you execute your own individual lottery.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:40.460]   And think about it, that you pull a lever
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:41.820]   of a slot machine.
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.340]   You can only pull the lever once,
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.820]   until you win, not enough times until you win.
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:48.940]   And when you pull the lever, case one,
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.940]   either you win, in such a case you have a winning ticket,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.980]   or you lose, you don't get any winning ticket.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.860]   So if you don't have a winning ticket,
[00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:01.460]   you can say anything you want about the next page
[00:31:01.460 --> 00:31:04.020]   in the ledger, nobody pays attention.
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:07.140]   But if you have a winning ticket,
[00:31:07.140 --> 00:31:10.340]   people say, "Oh, wow, he's one of the 1,000 winning tickets,
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.380]   "we better pay attention to what he or she says."
[00:31:13.380 --> 00:31:14.900]   And that's how it works.
[00:31:14.900 --> 00:31:18.940]   And the lottery is a cryptographic lottery,
[00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:22.740]   which means that even if I am an entire nation,
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:26.300]   extremely powerful, with incredible computing powers,
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.220]   I don't have the ability to improve even minimally
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.500]   my probability of one of my token winning the lottery.
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.940]   And that's how it happens.
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:37.660]   So everybody pulls the lever,
[00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:40.580]   the 1,000 random winners say,
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.740]   "Oh, here is my winning ticket,
[00:31:42.740 --> 00:31:45.980]   "and here is my opinion up or down about the block."
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:47.500]   These are the ones that count.
[00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:52.020]   And if you think about it, while this is distributed,
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.900]   because there is, in the case of Algon,
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:55.780]   there is 10 billion tokens,
[00:31:55.780 --> 00:31:57.700]   and you select 1,000 of them,
[00:31:57.700 --> 00:32:00.820]   more distributed than this, you cannot get.
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.020]   And then why is this scalable?
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:05.620]   Because what do you have to do?
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.300]   Okay, you have to do the lottery.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:09.420]   How long the lottery takes?
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.420]   It takes actually one microsecond.
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:14.660]   Whether you have one token or two tokens
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:18.140]   or a billion tokens is always one microsecond of computation,
[00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:20.060]   which is very fast.
[00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:24.100]   We don't hit the planet with a microsecond of computation.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.140]   And finally, why is this secure?
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:31.540]   Because even if I were a very evil
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:34.340]   and very, very powerful individual,
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:37.500]   I'm so powerful that I can corrupt anybody I want
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.140]   instantaneously in the world.
[00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:42.500]   Who would I want to corrupt?
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:43.980]   The people in the committee,
[00:32:43.980 --> 00:32:46.780]   so that I can choose the page of the ledger.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.740]   But I do have a problem.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:52.100]   I do not know whom I should corrupt.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.460]   Should I corrupt this lady in Shanghai,
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.500]   this other guy in Paris?
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:57.980]   Because I don't know.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:32:59.380]   The winners are random,
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:01.420]   so I don't know whom I should corrupt.
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.180]   But once the winner come forward and say,
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.620]   "Here is my winning ticket,"
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:09.060]   and you propagate your winning ticket across the network
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.860]   together with your opinion about the bloc,
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   now I know who they are.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:15.940]   For sure, I can corrupt all thousand of them
[00:33:15.940 --> 00:33:18.500]   given to my incredible powers.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:19.340]   But so what?
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.820]   Whatever they said, they already said,
[00:33:22.820 --> 00:33:25.060]   and their winning tickets and their opinions
[00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:28.020]   are violently propagated across the network.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.020]   And I do not have the power,
[00:33:30.020 --> 00:33:31.740]   no more than the US government
[00:33:31.740 --> 00:33:33.300]   or any government has the power
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:36.620]   to put back in the bottle a message
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:38.780]   violently propagated by Wikileaks.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.340]   - So everything you've just described
[00:33:42.340 --> 00:33:45.860]   is fascinating set of ideas.
[00:33:45.860 --> 00:33:48.900]   And online I've been reading quite a bit,
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.300]   and people are really excited about those set of ideas.
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:56.300]   Nevertheless, it is not the dominating technology today.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:00.580]   So Bitcoin in terms of cryptocurrency
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.180]   is the most popular cryptocurrency
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:06.060]   and then Ethereum and so on.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:08.020]   So it's useful to kind of comment.
[00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:10.540]   We already talked about proof of work a little bit,
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.580]   but what in your sense does Bitcoin get right,
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:16.700]   and where is it lacking?
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:19.820]   - Okay, so the first thing that Bitcoin got right
[00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:22.980]   is to understand that there was the need
[00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.500]   of a cryptocurrency.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.180]   And that, in my opinion,
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.100]   Trumps, they deserve all the success
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:31.940]   because they say that the time is right for this idea.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.180]   Because very often it's not enough to be right,
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.100]   you have to be right at the right time,
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:38.420]   and somebody got it right there.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.460]   So hat off to Bitcoin for that.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.260]   And so what they got right
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:51.020]   is it is hard to subvert and change the ledger,
[00:34:51.020 --> 00:34:53.460]   to cancel a transaction.
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:56.340]   It's not impossible, but it is very hard.
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:35:00.060]   What they did not get right is somehow
[00:35:00.060 --> 00:35:03.900]   that is a great store of value, currency-wise,
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:07.860]   but money is not only a question that you store it
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.460]   and you put under the mattress.
[00:35:09.460 --> 00:35:11.340]   Money wants to be transacted.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:14.540]   And the transaction in Bitcoins are very little.
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:16.420]   So if you want to store value,
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.780]   everybody needs to store value,
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.140]   might as well use a Bitcoin.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:21.300]   I mean, it's the plan,
[00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:26.300]   but if you don't look at that for a moment,
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:28.940]   at least it's a great store of value,
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:30.580]   and everybody needs a store of value.
[00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:32.540]   But most of the time we want to transact,
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.380]   we want to interact.
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.300]   We don't put the money under the mattress, right?
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:38.700]   So we want to, and that, they didn't get it right.
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:41.740]   That is too slow to transact.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.940]   Too few transactions.
[00:35:42.940 --> 00:35:44.020]   - There's a scalability.
[00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:45.700]   - The scalability issue.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.820]   - Is it possible to build stuff on top of Bitcoin
[00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:52.620]   that sort of fixes the scalability?
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.660]   I mean, this is the thing,
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.660]   you look at, there's a bunch of technologies
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:36:00.660]   that kind of hit the right need at the right time,
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:03.980]   and they have flaws,
[00:36:03.980 --> 00:36:07.260]   but we kind of build infrastructures on top of them
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:09.300]   over time to fix it,
[00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:12.620]   as opposed to getting it right from the beginning.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.980]   Or is it difficult to do?
[00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:16.660]   - Well, that is difficult to do.
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:18.340]   So you are talking to somebody
[00:36:18.340 --> 00:36:22.860]   that when I decided to throw my hat in the arena,
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.500]   and I decided, first of all, as I said before,
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.740]   I very much admire my predecessors.
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:29.780]   I mean, they got it right a lot of things,
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:33.820]   and I really admire for that.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.420]   But I had a choice to make.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:39.580]   Either I patch something that has holes all over the place,
[00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:40.820]   or I start from scratch.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.180]   I decided to start from scratch,
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:43.620]   because sometimes there's a better way.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:47.580]   - So what about Ethereum, which looks at proof of stake,
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:50.180]   and a lot of different innovative ideas
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:53.380]   that kind of improve, or seek to improve,
[00:36:53.380 --> 00:36:55.220]   on some of the flaws of Bitcoin?
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:56.820]   - Ethereum had another great idea.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:01.420]   So they figured out that money and payments
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:03.060]   are important as they are.
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:07.140]   They are only the first level, the first stepping stone.
[00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:10.340]   The next level are smart contracts.
[00:37:10.340 --> 00:37:12.540]   And they were at the vision to say,
[00:37:12.540 --> 00:37:15.660]   the people will need smart contracts,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:20.300]   which allow me and you to somehow to transact securely
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:23.180]   without being shopper owned by a trusted third party,
[00:37:23.180 --> 00:37:24.500]   by a mediator.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.660]   By the way, because mediators are hard to find,
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:30.140]   and in fact, maybe even impossible to find.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:33.500]   If you live in Thailand, and I live in New Zealand,
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:36.780]   maybe we don't have a common person that we know and trust.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:39.980]   And even if we find them, guess what?
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:41.140]   They want to be paid.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:45.620]   So much so that 6% of the world GDP
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:48.660]   goes into financial friction,
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:50.420]   which is essentially third party.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.140]   So the head of the right of the world needed that.
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:58.940]   But again, the scalability is not there.
[00:37:58.940 --> 00:38:03.500]   And the system of smart contracts in Ethereum
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:06.300]   is slow and expensive.
[00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:11.300]   And I believe that is not enough to satisfy the appetite
[00:38:11.300 --> 00:38:14.540]   and the need that we have for smart contracts.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.620]   - Well, what do you make of,
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:19.140]   just as a small sort of aside in human history,
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.660]   perhaps it's a big one, is NFT, the non-fungible tokens.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.780]   Do you find those interesting technically,
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:28.180]   or is it more interesting on the social side of things?
[00:38:28.180 --> 00:38:29.580]   - Well, both.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:33.600]   I think it's, NFTs are actually great, right?
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.020]   So you have this, you're an artist to create a song,
[00:38:38.020 --> 00:38:43.020]   or it could be a piece of art.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:49.500]   He has many unique representation of unique piece,
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:54.500]   whether it's an artifact or something dreamed up by you,
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:57.900]   and as unique representation, but now you can trade.
[00:38:57.900 --> 00:39:02.060]   And allow, and the important part is that now you have this,
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:04.660]   not only the NFTs themselves,
[00:39:04.660 --> 00:39:09.660]   but the ability to trade them quickly, fast, securely,
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.220]   knowing who owns which rights.
[00:39:13.220 --> 00:39:16.940]   And that gives a totally new opportunity
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:19.220]   for content creators to be remunerated
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.900]   for what they do.
[00:39:20.900 --> 00:39:23.420]   - So, but ultimately you still have to have
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:28.420]   that scalability, security, and decentralization
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:33.500]   to make it work for bigger and bigger applications.
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:35.060]   - Correct, yeah.
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:37.140]   - Yeah, I still wonder what kind of applications
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:41.540]   are yet to be enabled by it, because so much,
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.740]   the interesting thing about NFTs,
[00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:49.980]   if you look outside of art, is just like money,
[00:39:49.980 --> 00:39:54.420]   you can start playing with different social constructs.
[00:39:54.420 --> 00:39:57.940]   Is you can start playing with the ideas.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:02.940]   You can start playing with even like investing,
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:07.220]   somebody was talking about almost creating an economy
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:12.220]   out of like creative people or influencers.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.900]   Like if you start a YouTube channel or something like that,
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:18.020]   you can invest in that person
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.860]   and you can start trading their creations.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:24.540]   And then almost like create a market out of people's ideas,
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:29.060]   out of people's creations, out of the people themselves
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:31.460]   that generate those creations.
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:33.260]   And there's a lot of interesting possibilities
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.260]   of what you can do with that.
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.500]   I mean, it seems ridiculous,
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   but you're basically creating a hierarchy of value,
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:44.260]   maybe artificial in the digital world
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:46.060]   and they're trading that.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.940]   But in so doing are inspiring people to create.
[00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:54.940]   So maybe as a sort of our economy gets better
[00:40:54.940 --> 00:40:55.780]   and better and better,
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.580]   where actual work in the physical space
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.180]   becomes less and less in terms of its importance,
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.900]   maybe we'll completely be operating in a digital space
[00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.900]   where these kinds of economies have more and more power.
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.700]   And then you have to have this kind of blockchains
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:17.660]   to the scalability, security and decentralization.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:21.060]   And then decentralization is of course the tricky one
[00:41:21.060 --> 00:41:25.140]   because people in power start to get nervous.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:26.140]   - Absolutely.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:29.500]   Once in power, you're always nervous
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:31.580]   that you'll be supplanted by somebody else.
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.020]   But this is your job.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:35.700]   So you've got relations, you've got a job, a top job,
[00:41:35.700 --> 00:41:37.500]   but now everybody wants it.
[00:41:37.500 --> 00:41:41.020]   Well, what is your sense about our time
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:46.020]   and the future hope about the decentralization of power?
[00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:49.660]   Do you think that's something that we can actually achieve
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.740]   given that power corrupts
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:55.660]   and absolute power corrupts absolutely
[00:41:55.660 --> 00:41:59.020]   and it's so wonderful to be absolutely powerful?
[00:41:59.020 --> 00:42:01.100]   - Well, good question.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:04.500]   So first of all, I believe by the way,
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:07.860]   there is a complex questions, Lex,
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:12.380]   like all the rest of your questions.
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:14.180]   (laughing)
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.540]   - I'm so very sorry.
[00:42:15.540 --> 00:42:18.820]   - It's okay, I am enjoying it.
[00:42:18.820 --> 00:42:21.220]   So there are two things.
[00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:24.860]   First of all, power has been centralized
[00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.260]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:29.460]   When you want to get it, it's easier for somebody,
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:32.540]   even a single person to grab power.
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:35.620]   But there is also some kind of a technology,
[00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:40.460]   lack thereof, that justified having power
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:43.820]   because in a way, in a society in which even communication,
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.540]   nevermind blockchain, which is common knowledge,
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:50.580]   but even simple unilateral communication is hard,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:54.540]   it is much easier to say, you do as I say,
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.380]   because the alternative is.
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:59.860]   But as, so there is a little bit of a technology barrier,
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:00.700]   but I think of it,
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:03.180]   and now to get to this common knowledge,
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.820]   it is a totally different story.
[00:43:04.820 --> 00:43:07.380]   Now we have finally the technology for doing this.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:09.100]   So that is one part.
[00:43:09.100 --> 00:43:12.780]   But I really believe that by having a distributed system,
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:14.060]   not only you don't have,
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:19.980]   you have to actually much more stable and durable system,
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.780]   because not only for corruption,
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:23.540]   but even for things that go astray,
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.220]   and you give it a long enough time
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:29.020]   by strange version of Murphy's law,
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:31.980]   whatever goes wrong, goes wrong.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.340]   And so, and if the power is diffused,
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:37.600]   you actually are much more stable.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.780]   If you look at any living,
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:45.140]   complex living being is distributed.
[00:43:45.140 --> 00:43:47.940]   I mean, I don't have somebody is,
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.700]   okay, tell Sylvia now it's time to eat.
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.780]   - You have millions of cells in your body,
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.340]   you have billions of bacteria.
[00:43:54.340 --> 00:43:56.220]   - Exactly, help me in the guts,
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:59.180]   but I think we are in a soup of it somehow.
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:00.180]   It keeps us alive.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:01.020]   - It's a fear mess.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.140]   - It is, and so strange enough,
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.980]   however, when we design systems,
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.620]   we design them centralized.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.540]   We ourselves are distributed beings,
[00:44:11.540 --> 00:44:12.980]   and when we plan to say,
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.900]   okay, I want to create an architecture,
[00:44:15.900 --> 00:44:18.540]   how about I make a pyramid,
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:21.020]   I put this on the top,
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:22.980]   and the power flows down.
[00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:25.860]   And so again, it's a little bit perhaps
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.780]   of a technology problem,
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:29.380]   but now the technology is there,
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:31.900]   so it is a big challenge to rethink
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:35.980]   how we want to organize power in very large system,
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.620]   and distributed system, in my opinion,
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.500]   are much more resilient.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:42.580]   Let's put it this way.
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:43.860]   There was a mine,
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:47.700]   or my Italian compatriots, right,
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.700]   you know, Machiavelli,
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.580]   who looked at the time,
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:51.860]   there was a big,
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.820]   there was a bunch of small state,
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:55.620]   Democratic Republic of Florence,
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:57.260]   of Venice, and the other thing,
[00:44:57.260 --> 00:44:58.740]   and there was the Ottoman Empire,
[00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:00.300]   but at the time, it was an empire,
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:02.460]   and a certain was very centralized,
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:05.900]   and he made a political observation
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:07.380]   that goes roughly to say,
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:08.980]   whenever you have such a centralized thing,
[00:45:08.980 --> 00:45:11.860]   it's very hard to overtake
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.700]   that former government is centralized,
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.100]   but if you get it,
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:19.220]   it's so easy to keep the population.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:21.860]   When instead, with other things,
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:25.700]   much more resilient,
[00:45:25.700 --> 00:45:27.540]   when the power is distributed,
[00:45:27.540 --> 00:45:30.900]   it's going to be lasting for much longer time.
[00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:33.340]   - And ultimately, maybe the human spirit
[00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:34.740]   wants that kind of resilience,
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:36.020]   wants that kind of distribution.
[00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.780]   It's just that we didn't have technology
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:38.860]   throughout history.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:41.020]   Machiavelli didn't have the computer,
[00:45:41.020 --> 00:45:42.100]   the internet, and--
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.220]   (laughing)
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.300]   - That is certainly part of the reason, yes.
[00:45:46.300 --> 00:45:48.580]   - You've written an interesting blog post,
[00:45:48.580 --> 00:45:53.340]   if we take a step out of the realm of bits
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:56.100]   and into the realm of governance.
[00:45:56.100 --> 00:45:57.420]   You wrote a blog post
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.180]   about making Algorand governance decentralized.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:02.620]   Can you explain what that means,
[00:46:02.620 --> 00:46:04.620]   the philosophy behind that?
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:08.340]   How you decentralized basically all aspects
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.700]   of this kind of system?
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.820]   - Well, the philosophy,
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:14.860]   and how, let's start with the philosophy.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:16.340]   So I really believe
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:21.260]   that nothing fixed lasts very long.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:24.300]   And so I really believe that life
[00:46:24.300 --> 00:46:27.300]   is about intelligent adaptation.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:28.540]   Things change,
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.060]   and we have to be nimble
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:32.980]   and adjust to change.
[00:46:32.980 --> 00:46:37.060]   And when I see a lot of
[00:46:37.060 --> 00:46:41.020]   a crypto project,
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.780]   actually very proud to say it's fixed in stone,
[00:46:45.820 --> 00:46:47.980]   right, code is law, law is code,
[00:46:47.980 --> 00:46:50.020]   I verify the code, it will never change.
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:52.900]   You go, wow, when I'm saying this is a recipe to me
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:55.740]   of disaster, not immediately, but soon.
[00:46:55.740 --> 00:46:58.180]   Just imagine you take a notion liner,
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.900]   and you want to go, I don't know,
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:04.380]   from Lisbon to New York,
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.580]   and you set a course,
[00:47:06.580 --> 00:47:08.660]   iceberg, no iceberg,
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.300]   tempest, no tempest,
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:11.660]   and it doesn't matter.
[00:47:11.660 --> 00:47:13.500]   That is not the way.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:14.820]   You need a till,
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:15.940]   you need to correct,
[00:47:15.940 --> 00:47:18.340]   you need to adjust.
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:21.380]   And so, by the way,
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.460]   we design an algorithm with the idea
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:28.460]   that the code was evolving as the needs.
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:30.580]   And of course, the way there is a system
[00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:32.980]   in which every time there is an adjustment,
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.820]   you must have essentially a vote
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:38.220]   that right now is orchestrated
[00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.700]   with 90% of the stake.
[00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:41.020]   They say, okay, we are ready,
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.980]   we agree on the next version,
[00:47:42.980 --> 00:47:44.940]   and we pick up this version,
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.300]   so we are able to evolve
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:49.460]   without losing too many components left and right.
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:51.100]   But I think without evolving,
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:53.660]   any system essentially become masophistic,
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:57.260]   and is going to shrivel and die sooner or later.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.180]   And so that is needed.
[00:48:00.180 --> 00:48:03.180]   And what you want to do on the blockchain,
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:05.700]   you have a perfect platform
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:09.380]   in which you can log your wishes,
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.740]   your votes, your things,
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.060]   so that you have a guarantee
[00:48:12.060 --> 00:48:14.180]   that whatever vote you express
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.980]   is actually seen by everybody else.
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:19.100]   So everybody sees really the outcome,
[00:48:19.100 --> 00:48:21.820]   call it a referendum, of a change,
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:24.980]   and that is, in my opinion,
[00:48:24.980 --> 00:48:27.620]   a system that wants to live long has to adapt.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:30.740]   - There's an interesting question about leaders.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:32.820]   I've talked to Vitalik Buterin,
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.700]   I'll probably talk to him again soon.
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:38.140]   He's one of the leaders,
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:40.940]   maybe one of the faces of the Ethereum project.
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.820]   And it's interesting,
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:44.500]   you have Satoshi Nakamoto,
[00:48:44.500 --> 00:48:47.460]   who's the face of Bitcoin, I guess,
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:48.820]   but he's faceless.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.540]   He, she, they.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:54.700]   It does seem like in our,
[00:48:54.700 --> 00:48:57.540]   whatever it is, maybe it's 20th century,
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.740]   maybe it's Machiavellian thinking,
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:01.860]   but we seek leaders.
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.060]   Leaders have value.
[00:49:03.060 --> 00:49:08.060]   Linus Torvald, the leader of Linux,
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:10.260]   the open source development a lot.
[00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:12.460]   I mean, there's no, it's not,
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.700]   it's not that the leadership is sort of dogmatic,
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:17.420]   but it's inspiring.
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:22.260]   And it's also powerful in that,
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:25.300]   through leaders, we propagate the vision.
[00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:28.460]   Like the vision of the project is more stable.
[00:49:28.460 --> 00:49:30.780]   Maybe not the details, but the vision.
[00:49:30.780 --> 00:49:33.820]   And so do you think there's value to,
[00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:36.740]   'cause there's a tension between decentralization
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.380]   and leadership, like, and visionary.
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.740]   - Yes.
[00:49:40.740 --> 00:49:42.580]   - What do you make of that tension?
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.380]   - Okay, so I really believe that,
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.860]   that's another great question.
[00:49:45.860 --> 00:49:47.860]   I think of it, you know,
[00:49:47.860 --> 00:49:49.940]   I really believe in the power of emotions.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:52.660]   I think that emotion are of a creative impulse
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:53.980]   of everybody else.
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:56.980]   And therefore, it's very easy for a leader
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.820]   to be a physical person, a real being,
[00:50:00.820 --> 00:50:04.180]   and that interprets our emotions.
[00:50:04.180 --> 00:50:07.260]   And by the way, this emotion has to resonate.
[00:50:07.260 --> 00:50:10.700]   And what is good is that the more intimate
[00:50:10.700 --> 00:50:13.300]   our emotions are, the more universal they are,
[00:50:13.300 --> 00:50:14.500]   paradoxically.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:17.980]   The more personal, the more everybody else
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.060]   somehow magically agrees and feels a bit of the same.
[00:50:21.060 --> 00:50:24.620]   And so, and it's very important to have a leader
[00:50:24.620 --> 00:50:27.900]   in the initial phase that generates out of nothing
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.340]   something, that is important leadership.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.780]   But then the true test of leadership
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:35.940]   is to disappear after you led the community.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.340]   So in my opinion, the quintessential leader,
[00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:45.660]   according to my vision, is George Washington.
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.980]   He served for one term, he served for another term,
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:51.060]   and then all of a sudden, he retired
[00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:53.020]   and became a private citizen.
[00:50:53.020 --> 00:50:57.460]   And 200 and change years later, we still are,
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.820]   with some defects, but we have done a lot of things right.
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:02.220]   And we have been able to evolve.
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.500]   That, to me, is success in leadership.
[00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:07.940]   But instead, you contrast our experiment
[00:51:07.940 --> 00:51:08.980]   with a lot of experiment.
[00:51:08.980 --> 00:51:12.660]   I've done so much, so well, that I want another four years.
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:16.780]   And why should I be only a four, and I have another eight?
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:18.020]   Why should be another eight?
[00:51:18.020 --> 00:51:20.460]   Give me 16, I will fix all your problem.
[00:51:20.460 --> 00:51:22.820]   And now, then is the type, in my opinion,
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:24.620]   of failed leadership.
[00:51:24.620 --> 00:51:29.420]   Leadership ought to be really lead, ignite, and disappear.
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:32.060]   And if you don't disappear, the system is going to die
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:35.780]   with you, and it's not a good idea for everybody else.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:37.500]   - Is there, so we've been talking a little bit
[00:51:37.500 --> 00:51:40.020]   about cryptocurrency, but is there spaces
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:44.300]   where this kind of blockchain ideas that you're describing,
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:47.980]   which I find fascinating, do you think they can
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:51.180]   revolutionize some other aspects of our world?
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.340]   That's not just money?
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.220]   - A lot of things that are going to be revolutionized
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.340]   is independent of finance.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:04.340]   By the way, I really believe that finance
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.100]   is an incredible form of freedom.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:09.500]   I mean, if I'm free to do anything I want,
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:11.060]   but I don't have the means to do anything,
[00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:11.900]   that's a bad idea.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.420]   So I really think financial freedom is very, very important.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:20.260]   But just again, say that against censorship,
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.780]   you write something on the chain,
[00:52:21.780 --> 00:52:24.340]   and now nobody can take it out.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.260]   That is a very important way to express
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:30.460]   our view.
[00:52:30.460 --> 00:52:35.220]   And then the transparency that you give,
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:37.940]   because everybody can see what's happening
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:39.100]   on the blockchain.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.580]   So transparency is not money, but I believe
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:47.020]   that transparency actually is a very important ingredient
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:48.940]   also of finance.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.980]   Let's put it this way, as much as I'm enthusiastic
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.540]   about blockchain and decentralized finance,
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:52:59.540]   and we have actually, our expression,
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.940]   we're creating this future five,
[00:53:01.940 --> 00:53:04.740]   as much as we want to do, we must agree
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:09.220]   that the first guarantee of financial growth
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:14.220]   and prosperity are really the legal system, the courts.
[00:53:14.220 --> 00:53:16.260]   Because we may not think about them and say,
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:19.500]   oh, the courts are a bunch of boring lawyers,
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:22.220]   but without them, I'm saying, there is no certainty.
[00:53:22.220 --> 00:53:25.780]   There is no notion of equality.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.900]   There is no notion that you can resolve your disputes.
[00:53:28.900 --> 00:53:31.580]   Think, that's what drives commerce and things.
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.260]   And so what I really believe, that the blockchain
[00:53:34.260 --> 00:53:37.820]   actually makes a lot of this trust essentially automatic,
[00:53:37.820 --> 00:53:41.420]   but make it impossible to cheat in very way.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:43.700]   You don't even need to go to court
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:46.140]   if nobody can change the ledger.
[00:53:46.140 --> 00:53:49.340]   So it essentially is a way of,
[00:53:51.020 --> 00:53:52.860]   you cannot solve an illegal system
[00:53:52.860 --> 00:53:54.300]   that reduces to a blockchain,
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.540]   but what I'm saying, a big chunk of it
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:54:00.060]   can actually be guaranteed, and there is no reason
[00:54:00.060 --> 00:54:02.260]   why technology should be antagonistic
[00:54:02.260 --> 00:54:05.260]   to legal scholarship.
[00:54:05.260 --> 00:54:07.020]   It could be actually coexisting,
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:10.180]   and one should start to doing the interesting things
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:12.140]   that the technology alone cannot do,
[00:54:12.140 --> 00:54:13.500]   and then you go from there.
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:17.380]   But I think that is essentially is,
[00:54:19.140 --> 00:54:24.140]   blockchain can affect all kinds of our behavior.
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:26.620]   - Yes, in some sense, the transparency,
[00:54:26.620 --> 00:54:30.500]   the required transparency ensures honesty,
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.340]   prevents corruption.
[00:54:31.340 --> 00:54:33.220]   So there's a lot of systems that could use that,
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:35.060]   and the legal system is one of them.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:37.340]   There is a little bit of a tension
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.740]   that I wonder if you can speak to
[00:54:39.740 --> 00:54:42.560]   where this kind of transparency,
[00:54:42.560 --> 00:54:45.020]   there's a tension with privacy.
[00:54:45.020 --> 00:54:48.660]   Is it possible to achieve privacy
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.980]   if wanted on a blockchain?
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:55.180]   Do you have ideas about different technologies
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:54:56.020]   that can do that?
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.220]   People have been playing with different ideas.
[00:54:58.220 --> 00:54:59.220]   - So absolutely.
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.380]   The answer is yes,
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:05.020]   and by the way, I'm a cryptographer.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:06.020]   - Right.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:08.020]   - So I really believe in privacy,
[00:55:08.020 --> 00:55:11.540]   and I believe in, and I have devoted
[00:55:11.540 --> 00:55:16.300]   a big chunk of my life to guarantee privacy,
[00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:19.180]   even when it seems almost impossible to have it.
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:23.140]   And it is possible to have it also in the blockchain too.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:27.700]   And however, I believe in timing as well.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:30.500]   And I believe that the people have the right
[00:55:30.500 --> 00:55:36.940]   to understand their system they live in.
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:42.540]   And right now, people can understand the blockchain
[00:55:42.540 --> 00:55:47.540]   to be something that cannot be altered,
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:51.460]   and is transparent, and that is good enough.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.420]   And right now, any way to add,
[00:55:53.420 --> 00:55:56.820]   and there is a pseudo privacy for the fact that
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.660]   who knows if this key belongs,
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.220]   public key belongs to me or to you, right?
[00:56:01.220 --> 00:56:03.420]   And I can, when I want to change my money
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:06.180]   from one public key, I split it to other public keys,
[00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:07.980]   go and figure out which one is Silvio,
[00:56:07.980 --> 00:56:10.380]   are all of them of Silvio, or only one of Silvio?
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.220]   Who knows?
[00:56:11.220 --> 00:56:14.980]   That's some vanilla privacy, not the one I could talk.
[00:56:14.980 --> 00:56:16.780]   And I think it's good enough because,
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:20.420]   and it's important for now that we absorb this stage.
[00:56:20.420 --> 00:56:23.980]   Because the next stage, we must understand the privacy tool
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.580]   rather than taking on faith.
[00:56:25.580 --> 00:56:27.140]   When the public starts saying,
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:29.740]   I believe in the scientists, and whatever they say,
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.220]   I swear by them, and therefore,
[00:56:31.220 --> 00:56:33.020]   if they tell me it's private, it's private,
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:34.620]   and nobody understands it very well,
[00:56:34.620 --> 00:56:39.620]   we need a much more educated about the tools we are using.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:44.580]   And so I look forward to deploying more and more privacy
[00:56:44.580 --> 00:56:48.580]   on the blockchain, but we are not,
[00:56:48.580 --> 00:56:52.900]   I will not rush to it until the people understand
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:55.120]   and are behind whatever we have right now.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:59.620]   - So you build privacy on top of the power of the blockchain,
[00:56:59.620 --> 00:57:02.380]   you have to first understand the power of the blockchain.
[00:57:02.380 --> 00:57:03.220]   - Yes.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:06.460]   - Yes, so Algorand is like one of the most exciting,
[00:57:06.460 --> 00:57:09.580]   technically at least, from my perspective,
[00:57:09.580 --> 00:57:12.380]   technologies, ideas in this whole space.
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:15.220]   What's the future of Algorand look like?
[00:57:15.220 --> 00:57:18.020]   Is it possible for it to dominate the world?
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:23.020]   - Let's put it this way, I certainly working very hard
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.580]   with a great team to give the best blockchain
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:31.260]   that one can demand and enjoy.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:35.940]   And that said, I really believe that there is going to be,
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:37.540]   it's not a winner takes them all,
[00:57:37.540 --> 00:57:40.540]   so it's going to be a few blockchains,
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:44.940]   and each one is going to have its own brand,
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.820]   and it's going to be great at something.
[00:57:47.820 --> 00:57:51.780]   And sometimes it's scalability, sometimes it's your views,
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.620]   sometimes it's a thing.
[00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:56.940]   And it's important to have a dialogue between these things.
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:00.100]   And I'm sure, and I'm working very hard to make sure
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:01.620]   that Algorand is one of them.
[00:58:01.620 --> 00:58:05.660]   But I don't believe that it is even desirable
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:08.860]   to have a winner takes all,
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:12.820]   because we need to express different things,
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:14.900]   but the important thing is going to have
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:17.740]   enough interoperability with various systems
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:21.220]   so that you can transfer your assets
[00:58:21.220 --> 00:58:23.900]   where you have the best tool to service them,
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:25.820]   whatever your needs are at the time.
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.300]   - So there's an idea, I don't know,
[00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.460]   they call themselves Bitcoin maximalists,
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:34.460]   which is essentially the bet that,
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:39.460]   the philosophy that Bitcoin will eat the world.
[00:58:39.460 --> 00:58:42.740]   So you're talking about it's good to have variety.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:45.340]   Their claim is it's good to have
[00:58:45.340 --> 00:58:50.340]   the best technology dominate the medium of exchange,
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:54.100]   the medium of store value, the money,
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:58.100]   the digital currency space.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:01.020]   What's your sense of the positives
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.320]   and the negatives of that?
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:06.300]   - So I feel people are smart,
[00:59:06.300 --> 00:59:09.340]   and it's going to be very hard for anybody
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:12.060]   and Bitcoin to win,
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.140]   and because people want more and more things.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:18.700]   There is an Italian saying that goes,
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.900]   translates well, I think.
[00:59:20.900 --> 00:59:23.700]   It goes, "The appetite grows while eating."
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:24.540]   Okay?
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:26.580]   I think you understand what I mean.
[00:59:26.580 --> 00:59:27.940]   So I say, "I'm not hungry."
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:30.700]   "Oh, okay, food, let me try this."
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:32.700]   So we want more and more and more.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.460]   And when you find something like a Bitcoin,
[00:59:35.460 --> 00:59:37.980]   which I already had very good things to say,
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:39.900]   but it does something very well,
[00:59:39.900 --> 00:59:41.900]   but it's static.
[00:59:41.900 --> 00:59:46.900]   I mean, store of value, yes, I think is a great,
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:49.940]   for the rest, it would be a sad world
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:52.580]   if the world in which we are so anchoring down,
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:55.740]   so defensive, that we want to store value
[00:59:55.740 --> 00:59:57.100]   and hide it under the mattress.
[00:59:57.100 --> 01:00:00.020]   I long for a world in which it is open,
[01:00:00.020 --> 01:00:02.900]   people want to transact and interact with each other.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.500]   And therefore, when you want to store value,
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.220]   one, perhaps one chain,
[01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:11.740]   where you want to have to transact, maybe is another.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:15.820]   I'm not saying that one chain cannot be store of value
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:18.020]   or another thing, but I really believe that,
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:21.140]   I believe in the ingenuity of people
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:25.220]   and in the innovation that is intrinsic to the human nature.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:26.820]   We want always different things.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.020]   So how can it be something invented,
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.820]   whatever it is, decades ago,
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:33.620]   is going to fulfill the needs of our future generations.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.340]   I'm not going to fulfill my needs,
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.620]   let alone my kids or their kids.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:44.180]   We are going to have a different world
[01:00:44.180 --> 01:00:46.740]   and things will evolve.
[01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:49.540]   - So you believe, yeah, so you believe that life,
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.100]   intelligent life is ultimately about adaptability
[01:00:53.100 --> 01:00:55.580]   and evolving, so static is,
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:58.940]   static loses in the end.
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:00:59.780]   - Yes.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:04.980]   - Let me ask the, well, first the ridiculous question.
[01:01:04.980 --> 01:01:08.300]   Do you have any clue who Satoshi Nakamoto is?
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:11.260]   Is that even an interesting question?
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:16.340]   - Well, like your questions are very interesting.
[01:01:16.340 --> 01:01:18.580]   So, and I think that I,
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:21.100]   so I would say, first of all, it's not me.
[01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:23.660]   And I can prove it because, you know,
[01:01:23.660 --> 01:01:25.260]   if I were Satoshi Nakamoto,
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.900]   I would have not found an algorithm
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.660]   which also takes totally different principle
[01:01:29.660 --> 01:01:31.820]   to approach to the system.
[01:01:31.820 --> 01:01:33.980]   But the other thing, with Satoshi Nakamoto,
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.060]   you know what the right answer is?
[01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:39.420]   It's not him or her or them.
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:42.620]   Satoshi Nakamoto is Bitcoin.
[01:01:42.620 --> 01:01:46.620]   Because to me, he's such a coherent proof of work
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:48.980]   that at the end, the creator
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.300]   and the creation identify themselves.
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.780]   So, you say, okay, I understand Michelangelo,
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:56.740]   okay, he did the Sistine Chapel, fine.
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.820]   He did the St. Peter's dome, fine.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:03.420]   He did the Moses of the Pietra statue, fine.
[01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:05.660]   But besides this, who was Michelangelo?
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:07.420]   That's the wrong question.
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:10.260]   It's his own work that is Michelangelo.
[01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:13.820]   So I think that when you look at the Bitcoin,
[01:02:13.820 --> 01:02:18.340]   is a piece of work that, as it affects,
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:19.820]   yes, like anything human,
[01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:23.340]   but it was captivated the imaginations
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:25.140]   of millions of people
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:28.180]   as subverted by status quo.
[01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:32.980]   And I'm saying, whoever this person or people are,
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:35.700]   he's living in this piece of work.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.340]   I mean, it is Bitcoin.
[01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:38.780]   That's my--
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.780]   - The idea of the work is bigger.
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:43.500]   We forget that sometimes.
[01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.940]   It's something about our biology,
[01:02:44.940 --> 01:02:46.900]   once likes to see a face
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:48.780]   and attach a face to the idea,
[01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:51.020]   when really the idea is the thing we love.
[01:02:51.020 --> 01:02:53.340]   The idea is the thing that impact ideas,
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.380]   the thing that ultimately,
[01:02:55.380 --> 01:02:56.820]   Steve Jobs or somebody like that,
[01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.180]   we associate with the Mac, with the iPhone,
[01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:02.500]   with just everything he did at Apple.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:05.380]   Apple, actually, the company, is Steve Jobs.
[01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:06.700]   Steve Jobs, the man,
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:10.980]   is a pales in comparison to the creations of the man.
[01:03:10.980 --> 01:03:13.100]   - Correct, and the sense of aesthetics
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:15.300]   that has brought to the daily lives.
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:20.300]   And very often, aesthetic wins in the long game.
[01:03:20.500 --> 01:03:24.620]   And these are very elegant design product.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.140]   And when you say, oh, elegance,
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.500]   a very few people care about it.
[01:03:27.500 --> 01:03:31.540]   Apparently, millions and millions and millions
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:32.540]   and millions of people do,
[01:03:32.540 --> 01:03:34.380]   because we are attracted by beauty.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:37.140]   And these are beautifully designed products.
[01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:44.580]   And they've, in addition to the technological aspect
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:47.260]   of everything, and I think, yes, that is--
[01:03:47.260 --> 01:03:49.780]   - Yeah, as Dostoevsky said,
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.020]   beauty will save the world.
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:52.780]   So I'm with you on that one.
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.620]   - Great.
[01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:58.820]   - It currently seems like cryptocurrency,
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:01.300]   all these different technologies,
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:05.060]   are gathering a lot of excitement.
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.180]   Not just in our discourse,
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:11.100]   but in their scale of financial impact.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:14.700]   A lot of companies are starting to invest in Bitcoin.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:18.100]   Do you think that the main method
[01:04:18.100 --> 01:04:22.860]   of store of value and exchange of value,
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:25.820]   basically money, will soon,
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:27.380]   or at some point in the century,
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:28.900]   will become cryptocurrency?
[01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:31.020]   - Yes.
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.420]   So mind you, as I said,
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:34.620]   that the notion of cryptocurrency,
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:37.220]   like any other fundamental human notion,
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:39.580]   has to evolve, but yes.
[01:04:39.580 --> 01:04:44.580]   So I think that it has a lot of momentum behind it.
[01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:50.300]   It's not only static, as this programmable money,
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:51.780]   as I think--
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.620]   - Smart contracts, all the--
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:57.340]   - Smart contracts, it allows peer-to-peer interaction
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:05:00.700]   among people who don't even know each other, right?
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:02.060]   And they don't even, therefore,
[01:05:02.060 --> 01:05:03.580]   cannot even trust each other,
[01:05:03.580 --> 01:05:06.420]   just because they never saw each other.
[01:05:06.420 --> 01:05:11.060]   So I think it's so powerful that it's going to do.
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:15.580]   That said, again, a particular cryptocurrency
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:19.220]   should develop, and cryptocurrency will all develop,
[01:05:19.220 --> 01:05:23.540]   but the answer is yes, we are going towards a much more,
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.660]   unless we have a society, a sudden crisis
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:30.460]   for different reasons, which nobody hopes.
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:31.820]   - There's always an asteroid,
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.460]   there's always something, a nuclear war,
[01:05:35.460 --> 01:05:38.700]   and all the existential crisis that we kind of think about,
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.220]   including artificial intelligence.
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:44.340]   Okay, it's funny you mention that
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:49.300]   Michelangelo and Steve Jobs' set of ideas
[01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.540]   represents the person's work.
[01:05:50.540 --> 01:05:52.100]   So we talked about Algorand,
[01:05:52.100 --> 01:05:55.340]   which is a super interesting set of technologies,
[01:05:55.340 --> 01:06:00.180]   but he did also win the Turing Award.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:06.420]   You have a bunch of ideas that are seminal ideas.
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:11.660]   So can we talk about cryptography for a little bit?
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.620]   What is the most beautiful idea in cryptography,
[01:06:14.620 --> 01:06:17.980]   or computer science, or mathematics in general?
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.040]   Asking somebody who has explored the depths of all.
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:27.020]   - Well, there are a few contenders.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:29.680]   (both laughing)
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.300]   - Either your work or other work.
[01:06:34.300 --> 01:06:37.220]   - Let's leave my work aside.
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:42.900]   But one powerful idea,
[01:06:42.900 --> 01:06:46.860]   and is both an old idea in some sense,
[01:06:46.860 --> 01:06:49.260]   and a very, very modern one,
[01:06:49.260 --> 01:06:52.180]   and in my opinion, is this idea of a one-way function.
[01:06:52.180 --> 01:06:57.580]   So a function that easy to evaluate,
[01:06:57.580 --> 01:07:00.680]   so given x, you can compute f of x easily,
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:05.980]   but given f of x, it's very hard to go back to x.
[01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:07.380]   Okay, think like,
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:13.380]   breaking a glass, easy, reconstruct the glass harder.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:16.860]   Frying an egg, easy,
[01:07:16.860 --> 01:07:20.420]   from the fried egg to go back to the original egg, harder.
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:24.740]   If you want to be extreme, killing a living being,
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:29.180]   unfortunately easy, the other way around, very hard.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:32.060]   And so the fact that the notion of a function,
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:34.740]   which you have a recipe that is in front of your eyes
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:37.660]   to transform an x into f of x,
[01:07:37.660 --> 01:07:39.460]   and then from f of x,
[01:07:39.460 --> 01:07:41.660]   even though you see the recipe to transform it,
[01:07:41.660 --> 01:07:43.780]   you cannot go back to x,
[01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.860]   that in my opinion is one of the most elegant
[01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:52.700]   and momentous notions that there are.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.860]   And it's a computational notion
[01:07:54.860 --> 01:07:58.140]   because of the difficulties in a computational sense,
[01:07:58.140 --> 01:07:59.540]   and it's a mathematical notion
[01:07:59.540 --> 01:08:02.020]   because we are talking about function,
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.380]   and it's so fruitful
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.220]   because that is actually the foundation
[01:08:06.220 --> 01:08:07.380]   of all cryptography.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:10.620]   And let me tell you, it's an old notion,
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:16.700]   because very often in any mythology that we think of,
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:19.260]   the most powerful gods or goddesses
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:22.860]   are the ones of x and the opposite of x,
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:25.300]   the gods of love and death.
[01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:28.140]   And when you take opposite,
[01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.780]   they don't just erase one another,
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:33.140]   you create something way more powerful.
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:37.500]   And this one-way function is extremely powerful
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:41.580]   because essentially becomes something that is easy
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:46.580]   for the good guys and hard for the bad guys.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:50.340]   So for instance, in pseudo-random number generation,
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:52.580]   the easy part of the function corresponds,
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.180]   you want to generate bits very quickly,
[01:08:55.180 --> 01:08:58.740]   and hard is predicting what the next bit is.
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:00.900]   This doesn't look the same.
[01:09:00.900 --> 01:09:03.700]   One is xf of x going from x of x to xr,
[01:09:03.700 --> 01:09:06.060]   what does it do predicting bits?
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:10.500]   By a magic of reductions and mathematical apparatus,
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:15.420]   this simple function morphs itself
[01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:17.300]   into pseudo-random number generation.
[01:09:17.300 --> 01:09:19.140]   This simple function morphs itself
[01:09:19.140 --> 01:09:21.060]   in digital signature scheme,
[01:09:21.060 --> 01:09:24.020]   in which digitally signing should be easy
[01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.620]   and forging should be hard.
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:29.860]   Again, a digital signature is not going from x to f of x,
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:33.020]   but the magic and the richness of this notion is met
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:36.820]   that it is so powerful that it morphs
[01:09:36.820 --> 01:09:39.980]   in all kinds of incredible constructs.
[01:09:39.980 --> 01:09:43.860]   And in both, these two opposites coexist,
[01:09:43.860 --> 01:09:44.860]   the easy and the hard,
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:48.900]   and in my opinion, it is a very, very elegant notion.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:52.980]   - That simple notion ties together cryptography,
[01:09:52.980 --> 01:09:56.220]   and like you said, pseudo-random number generation.
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.220]   You have work on pseudo-random functions.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.340]   What are those?
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:06.980]   What's the difference between those and the generators,
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.140]   pseudo-random number generators?
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.420]   - Okay, let's-- - How do they work?
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.500]   - Let's go back to pseudo-random number generation.
[01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:15.660]   - Yes.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:16.500]   - First of all, people think
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.980]   that the pseudo-random number generation
[01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:19.220]   generates random number.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:21.540]   Not true, because I don't believe
[01:10:21.540 --> 01:10:26.540]   that from nothing you can get something.
[01:10:26.540 --> 01:10:28.620]   So nothing from nothing.
[01:10:28.620 --> 01:10:33.260]   But randomness, you cannot create it out of nothing,
[01:10:33.260 --> 01:10:37.700]   but what you could do is that it can be expanded.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:41.980]   So in other words, if you give me somehow 300 random bits,
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:45.660]   truly random bits, then I can give you 300,000,
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.700]   300 million, 300 trillions, 300 quadrillions,
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:51.340]   as many as you want, random bits,
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.380]   so that even though I tell you the recipe
[01:10:54.380 --> 01:10:56.900]   by which I produce these bits,
[01:10:56.900 --> 01:11:00.100]   but I don't tell you the initial 300 random numbers,
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:01.620]   I keep them secret,
[01:11:01.620 --> 01:11:05.180]   and you see all the bits I produce so far,
[01:11:05.180 --> 01:11:09.300]   if you were to bet, given all the bits produced so far,
[01:11:09.300 --> 01:11:11.500]   what is the next bit in my sequence?
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:13.540]   Better than 50/50.
[01:11:13.540 --> 01:11:15.900]   Of course, 50/50, anybody can guess, right?
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:19.220]   But to be inferring something, you have to be a bit better.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:24.220]   Then the effort to do this extra bit is so enormous
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.740]   that it's de facto random.
[01:11:26.740 --> 01:11:28.660]   So that is a pseudo-random generator,
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:33.220]   are these expanders of secret randomness,
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:36.000]   which goes extremely fast.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.500]   Okay, this said, what is--
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.220]   - Expanders of secret randomness, beautifully put.
[01:11:40.220 --> 01:11:44.300]   Okay, so every time somebody, if you're a programmer,
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:47.820]   is using a function that's not called pseudo-random,
[01:11:47.820 --> 01:11:50.700]   it's called random usually in all these programming languages
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:52.300]   and is generating different,
[01:11:52.300 --> 01:11:57.340]   that's essentially expanding the secret randomness.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.660]   - But they should.
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:00.620]   In the past, actually, most of library,
[01:12:00.620 --> 01:12:05.620]   they used something pre-modern cryptography, unfortunately.
[01:12:05.620 --> 01:12:11.900]   Will be better served to take a 300 real seed random number,
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.340]   and then expand them properly, as we know now.
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:22.460]   But that has been a very old idea.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:25.900]   In fact, one of the best philosophers have debated
[01:12:25.900 --> 01:12:30.620]   whether the world was deterministic or probabilistic.
[01:12:30.620 --> 01:12:32.380]   Very big questions, right?
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:33.580]   - Does God play dice?
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:36.940]   - Exactly, Einstein says it does, he doesn't.
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:40.260]   But in fact, now we have a language of it,
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:43.260]   even at Albert time, it was not around,
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:44.700]   but it was this complexity theory,
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.020]   modern complexity-based cryptography.
[01:12:47.020 --> 01:12:52.020]   And now we know that if the universe has 300 random bits,
[01:12:52.020 --> 01:12:57.100]   whether it is random or probabilistic or deterministic,
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:59.500]   it doesn't matter, because you can expand
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:02.460]   this initial seed of randomness forever,
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.220]   in which all the experiments you could do,
[01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:06.820]   all the inferences you could do,
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:08.340]   all the things you could do,
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:11.900]   you will not be able to distinguish them from truly random.
[01:13:11.900 --> 01:13:15.700]   So if you are not able to distinguish truly random
[01:13:15.700 --> 01:13:18.620]   from this super-duper pseudo-randomness,
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:21.500]   are they really different things?
[01:13:21.500 --> 01:13:22.620]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:24.460]   So I'm ready to become a real philosopher.
[01:13:24.460 --> 01:13:26.380]   So for things to be different,
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.300]   but I don't have in my lifetime,
[01:13:28.300 --> 01:13:29.780]   in the lifetime of the universe,
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:32.620]   any method to set them aside,
[01:13:32.620 --> 01:13:35.100]   well, I should be intellectually honest, say,
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:39.140]   well, pseudo-random in this special function
[01:13:39.140 --> 01:13:41.180]   is as good as random.
[01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:45.860]   - Do you think true randomness is possible?
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.060]   And what does that mean?
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:51.620]   So practically speaking, exactly as you said,
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:53.020]   if you're being honest,
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:57.620]   the pseudo-randomness approaches true randomness
[01:13:57.620 --> 01:13:58.520]   pretty quickly.
[01:13:58.520 --> 01:14:02.860]   But is it, maybe this is a philosophical question.
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:04.900]   Is there such a thing as true randomness?
[01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:08.660]   - Well, the answer is actually maybe,
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:13.660]   but if it exists, most probably it's expensive to get.
[01:14:13.660 --> 01:14:19.960]   And in any case, if I give you one of mine,
[01:14:19.960 --> 01:14:23.780]   random string, you'll never tell them apart.
[01:14:23.780 --> 01:14:26.660]   By any other shape, no matter how much you work on it.
[01:14:26.660 --> 01:14:29.340]   So in some sense, if it exists or not,
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.380]   it really is a quote philosophical sense
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.820]   in the colloquial way to say that
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:38.340]   we cannot somehow pin it down.
[01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.380]   - Do you ever, again, just to stay on philosophical
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:43.580]   for a bit, for a brief moment,
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:46.020]   do you ever think about free will
[01:14:46.020 --> 01:14:48.540]   and whether that exists?
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:53.540]   Because ultimately, free will is this experience
[01:14:53.540 --> 01:14:57.340]   that we have, like we're making choices,
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.300]   even though it appears that the world
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:03.580]   is deterministic at the core.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.620]   I mean, that's against the debate,
[01:15:05.620 --> 01:15:07.980]   but if it is in fact deterministic
[01:15:07.980 --> 01:15:12.900]   at the lowest possible level, at the physics level,
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:17.100]   how do you make, if it is deterministic,
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.820]   how do you make sense of the difference
[01:15:19.820 --> 01:15:21.940]   between the experience of us feeling
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.100]   like we're making a choice
[01:15:23.100 --> 01:15:25.340]   and the whole thing being deterministic?
[01:15:25.340 --> 01:15:27.860]   - So first of all, let me give you a gut reaction
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:28.940]   to my question.
[01:15:28.940 --> 01:15:33.940]   And a gut reaction is that it is important
[01:15:34.660 --> 01:15:38.060]   that we believe that there exists free will.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:43.060]   And second of all, almost by weird logic,
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:46.860]   if we believe it exists, then it does exist, okay?
[01:15:46.860 --> 01:15:47.700]   - Yeah.
[01:15:47.700 --> 01:15:50.660]   - So it's very important for our social apparatus,
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.180]   for our sense of the day of ourselves,
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:54.180]   that it exists.
[01:15:54.180 --> 01:15:57.340]   And the moment in which we so want it,
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:16:00.100]   we almost, we conjure it up in existence.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:04.180]   But again, I really feel that if you look at some point,
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:07.300]   the space of free will seems to shrink.
[01:16:07.300 --> 01:16:13.620]   We realize how much of our, say, genetic apparatus
[01:16:13.620 --> 01:16:17.580]   dictates who we are, why we prefer certain things
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:18.660]   than others, right?
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:22.260]   And why we react to noises of music,
[01:16:22.260 --> 01:16:24.140]   we prefer poetry, and everything else.
[01:16:24.140 --> 01:16:26.500]   We may explain even all this.
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:29.220]   But at the end of the day,
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:32.540]   whether it exists in a philosophical sense or not,
[01:16:32.540 --> 01:16:33.660]   it's like randomness.
[01:16:33.660 --> 01:16:37.940]   If you can, if pseudo-random is as good as random,
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:41.100]   vis-a-vis lifetime of the universe, our experience,
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:42.580]   then it doesn't really matter.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:43.580]   - Yeah.
[01:16:43.580 --> 01:16:47.300]   So, we're talking about randomness.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.700]   I wonder if I can weave in quantum mechanics
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:52.220]   for a brief moment.
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:57.220]   There's a lot of advancements on the quantum computing side.
[01:16:57.220 --> 01:17:01.580]   So leveraging quantum mechanics
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.460]   to perform a new kind of computation,
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:06.700]   and there's concern of that being a threat
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:08.660]   to a lot of the basic assumptions
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.180]   that underlie cryptography.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.620]   What do you think?
[01:17:12.620 --> 01:17:15.500]   Do you think quantum computing will challenge
[01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.740]   a lot of cryptography?
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:20.100]   Will cryptography be able to defend?
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:22.140]   All those kinds of things.
[01:17:22.140 --> 01:17:23.020]   - Okay, great.
[01:17:23.020 --> 01:17:25.020]   So first of all, for the record,
[01:17:25.020 --> 01:17:26.460]   because I think it matters,
[01:17:26.460 --> 01:17:27.980]   but it's important to set the record,
[01:17:27.980 --> 01:17:30.780]   there are people who continue to contend
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:33.740]   that quantum mechanics exists,
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:35.020]   but it has nothing to do with computing,
[01:17:35.020 --> 01:17:36.620]   it's not going to accelerate it,
[01:17:36.620 --> 01:17:42.260]   at least in a very basic,
[01:17:42.260 --> 01:17:44.660]   kind of, hard computation.
[01:17:44.660 --> 01:17:48.660]   That is a belief that you cannot take it out.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:52.060]   I'm a little bit more agnostic about it,
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:54.540]   but I really believe, going back to whatever I said
[01:17:54.540 --> 01:17:56.660]   about the one-way function.
[01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:59.700]   So one-way function, what is it?
[01:17:59.700 --> 01:18:01.100]   That is a cryptography.
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:03.700]   So does quantum computing challenge--
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:04.740]   - The one-way function.
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:06.820]   - Essentially, you can boil it down to,
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:08.700]   does quantum computing follow one-way function?
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:09.860]   What is one-way function?
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:12.940]   Easy in one direction, harder than the other.
[01:18:12.940 --> 01:18:15.740]   Okay, but if quantum computing exists,
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:17.940]   when you define what it is easy,
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:21.260]   it's not easy by a classical computer
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.100]   and hard by a classical computer,
[01:18:23.100 --> 01:18:26.300]   but easy for a quantum computer, that's a bad idea.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:29.380]   But once easy means it should be easy
[01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.620]   for a quantum and hard for also quantum.
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:36.820]   Then you can see that you are, yes, it's a challenge,
[01:18:36.820 --> 01:18:39.220]   but you have hope because you can absorb,
[01:18:39.220 --> 01:18:41.220]   if quantum computing really realizes
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:46.140]   and becomes available according to the promises,
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:49.260]   then you can use them also for the easy part.
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:51.460]   And once you use it for the easy part,
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:54.340]   the choices that you have a one-way function,
[01:18:54.340 --> 01:18:55.180]   they multiply.
[01:18:55.180 --> 01:18:58.420]   So, okay, so they particularly candidates
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:03.420]   of one-way function, they not be one way anymore,
[01:19:03.420 --> 01:19:07.860]   but quantum one-way function may continue to exist.
[01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.860]   And so I really believe that for life
[01:19:10.860 --> 01:19:20.340]   to be meaningful with one-way function had to exist
[01:19:20.340 --> 01:19:23.060]   because just imagine that anything
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:27.580]   that becomes easy to do.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:29.460]   I mean, what kind of life is it?
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:33.500]   I mean, so you need, and if something is hard,
[01:19:33.500 --> 01:19:35.260]   but it's so hard to generate,
[01:19:35.260 --> 01:19:38.100]   you'll never find something which is hard for you.
[01:19:38.100 --> 01:19:40.060]   You want that there is abundance,
[01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:42.780]   that it is easy to produce hard problem.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:45.100]   That's my opinion is why life is interesting
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:49.420]   because hard problem pop up at a really relative speed.
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.860]   So in some sense, I almost think
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:54.300]   that I do hope they exist.
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:57.860]   If they don't exist, somehow life is way less interesting
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.580]   than it actually is.
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:00.940]   - Yeah, it does.
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:01.780]   That's funny.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:03.500]   It does seem like the one-way function
[01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:06.140]   is fundamental to all of life,
[01:20:06.140 --> 01:20:09.460]   which is the emergence of the complexity
[01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:12.940]   that we see around us seem to require the one-way function.
[01:20:12.940 --> 01:20:17.020]   I don't know if you play with cellular automata.
[01:20:17.020 --> 01:20:19.220]   That's just another formulation of--
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:21.020]   - I know, but yes, that is--
[01:20:21.020 --> 01:20:22.140]   - It's a very simple,
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:24.700]   it's almost a very simple illustration
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:29.460]   of starting out with simple rules in one way,
[01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:33.020]   being able to generate incredible amounts of complexity,
[01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.640]   but then you ask the question, can I reverse that?
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:40.340]   And it's just surprising
[01:20:40.340 --> 01:20:42.460]   how difficult it is to reverse that.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:47.020]   It's surprising even in constrained situations,
[01:20:47.020 --> 01:20:49.180]   it's very difficult to prove anything.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:53.940]   That it almost, I mean, the sad thing about it,
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:57.220]   well, I don't know if it's sad,
[01:20:57.220 --> 01:21:00.920]   but it seems like we don't even have the mathematical tools
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:03.100]   to reverse engineer stuff.
[01:21:03.100 --> 01:21:05.200]   I don't know if they exist or not,
[01:21:05.200 --> 01:21:06.780]   but in the space of cellular automata,
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:08.300]   where you start with something simple
[01:21:08.300 --> 01:21:10.940]   and you create something incredibly complex,
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:14.100]   can you take a small picture of that complex
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.940]   and reverse engineer?
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:18.500]   That's kind of what we're doing as scientists.
[01:21:18.500 --> 01:21:20.580]   You're seeing the result of the complexity
[01:21:20.580 --> 01:21:23.300]   and you're trying to come up with some universal law
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:25.060]   that generate all of this.
[01:21:25.060 --> 01:21:27.380]   What is the theory of everything?
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.020]   What are the basic physics laws
[01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:30.780]   that generate this whole thing?
[01:21:30.780 --> 01:21:33.280]   And there's a hope that you should be able to do that,
[01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:35.820]   but it's difficult.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.540]   - Yeah, but there is also some poetry
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:39.140]   on the fact that it's difficult,
[01:21:39.140 --> 01:21:43.300]   because it gives us some mystery to life,
[01:21:43.300 --> 01:21:46.260]   without which, I mean, it's not so fun.
[01:21:47.340 --> 01:21:48.700]   Life would be less fun.
[01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:51.220]   - Can we talk about interactive proofs a little bit,
[01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.700]   and zero-knowledge proofs?
[01:21:52.700 --> 01:21:54.020]   What are those?
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:55.180]   - Okay. - How do they work?
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:58.260]   - So interactive proof, actually,
[01:21:58.260 --> 01:22:05.340]   is a modern realization and conceptualization
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:08.340]   of something that we knew was true,
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:11.340]   that it's easy to go to lecture.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.920]   In fact, that's my motivation.
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:15.020]   We invented schools to go to lecture.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.940]   We don't say, "Oh, I'm the minister of education.
[01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:19.140]   "I publish this book, you read it.
[01:22:19.140 --> 01:22:22.420]   "This is book for this year, this book for this year."
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:27.420]   We spend a lot of our treasury in educating our kids,
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:31.020]   and in person, educating, go to class,
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.020]   interact with the teacher,
[01:22:32.020 --> 01:22:34.700]   on the blackboard and chalk up my time.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.100]   Now we can have a whiteboard,
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:38.980]   and presumably, you're going to have, actually,
[01:22:38.980 --> 01:22:42.460]   these magic pens and a display instead.
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:46.300]   But the idea is that, interactively,
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:49.940]   you can convey truth much more efficiently.
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:52.820]   And we knew this psychologically.
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:54.380]   It's better to hear an explanation
[01:22:54.380 --> 01:22:57.700]   than just to belabor some paper, right?
[01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:58.540]   Same thing.
[01:22:58.540 --> 01:23:02.300]   So interactive proofs is a way to do the following.
[01:23:02.300 --> 01:23:05.780]   Rather than doing some complicated, very long papers,
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:07.660]   and possibly infinitely long proofs,
[01:23:07.660 --> 01:23:11.340]   exponentially long proofs, you say the following.
[01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.900]   If this theorem is true,
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.540]   there is a game that is associated to the theorem.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:19.020]   And if the theorem is true, this game,
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:23.980]   I have a winning strategy that I can win half of the time.
[01:23:23.980 --> 01:23:26.500]   No matter what you do.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:28.420]   Okay, so then you say, "Well, is the theorem true?
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.020]   "You believe me, why should I believe you?"
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:31.420]   So, okay, let's play.
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:35.500]   So, and if I prove that I have a strategy,
[01:23:35.500 --> 01:23:38.260]   and I win the first time, and I win the second time,
[01:23:38.260 --> 01:23:40.100]   then I lose a third time, but I win,
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:43.740]   more than half of the time,
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:46.620]   or I win, say, all the time if the theorem is true,
[01:23:46.620 --> 01:23:48.500]   and at least, at most, half of the time
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:52.500]   if the theorem is false, you statistically get convinced.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:54.900]   You can verify this quickly.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:23:58.580]   And therefore, is much, when the game,
[01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:01.900]   the game typically is extremely fast,
[01:24:01.900 --> 01:24:04.700]   so you generate a miniature game
[01:24:04.700 --> 01:24:07.380]   in which if the theorem is true, I win all the time,
[01:24:07.380 --> 01:24:11.540]   and the theorem is false, I can win at most half of the time.
[01:24:11.540 --> 01:24:13.620]   And if I win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win,
[01:24:13.620 --> 01:24:15.540]   you can deduce either the theorem is true,
[01:24:15.540 --> 01:24:17.900]   which most probably is the case, so to speak,
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.820]   or I've been very, very unlucky
[01:24:21.820 --> 01:24:25.660]   because it's like if I had 100 coin tosses,
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:29.220]   and I got 100 heads, very improbable.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:32.060]   So that is a way, and so this transformation
[01:24:32.060 --> 01:24:35.900]   from the formal statement of a proof
[01:24:35.900 --> 01:24:40.060]   into a game that can be quickly played,
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:42.860]   and you can draw statistics on many times you win,
[01:24:42.860 --> 01:24:47.860]   is one of a big conquest of modern complexity theory,
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:52.620]   and in fact, actually has highlighted
[01:24:52.620 --> 01:24:56.620]   the notion of a proof as a really give us a new insight
[01:24:56.620 --> 01:24:59.860]   of what to be true means, and what truth is,
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.180]   and what proofs are.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.260]   - So these are legitimately proofs.
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:04.100]   - Yes.
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:10.420]   - What kind of mysteries can it allow us to unlock
[01:25:10.420 --> 01:25:12.180]   and prove?
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:17.180]   You said truth, so what does it allow us,
[01:25:17.180 --> 01:25:20.420]   what kind of truth does it allow us to arrive at?
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:24.300]   - So it enlarges the real moment is provable
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:28.740]   because in some sense of the classical way of proving things
[01:25:28.740 --> 01:25:33.740]   was extremely inefficient from the very fire point of view.
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:35.020]   - Yes.
[01:25:35.020 --> 01:25:38.660]   - Okay, and so therefore, there is so much proof
[01:25:38.660 --> 01:25:41.780]   that you can take, but in this way,
[01:25:41.780 --> 01:25:45.020]   you can actually very quickly, minutes,
[01:25:45.020 --> 01:25:50.020]   verify something that is the correctness of an assertion,
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:52.740]   that otherwise would have taken a lifetime
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:56.420]   to belabor and check all the passages
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:25:58.340]   of a very, very, very long proof,
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:26:00.420]   and you better check all of them
[01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:02.740]   because if you don't check one line,
[01:26:02.740 --> 01:26:04.540]   an error can be in that line,
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:07.700]   and so you have to go linearly through all the stuff
[01:26:07.700 --> 01:26:09.100]   rather than bypass this.
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:13.180]   So you enlarge a tremendous amount what the proof is,
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:17.740]   and in addition, once you have the idea
[01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:19.980]   that essentially a proof system is something
[01:26:19.980 --> 01:26:24.980]   that allows me to convince you of a true statement
[01:26:24.980 --> 01:26:29.660]   but does not allow me to convince you of a false statement,
[01:26:29.660 --> 01:26:33.140]   and that advances the rest of proof.
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:36.100]   Proof can be beautiful, should be, should be elegant,
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:38.740]   but advances is true or false
[01:26:38.740 --> 01:26:40.540]   if you want to be able to differentiate.
[01:26:40.540 --> 01:26:42.300]   It is possible to prove the truth,
[01:26:42.300 --> 01:26:44.940]   and it should be impossible or statistically
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:48.060]   extremely hard to prove something false,
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:50.380]   and if you do this, you can prove way, way more
[01:26:50.380 --> 01:26:54.260]   once you understand this, and on top of it,
[01:26:54.260 --> 01:26:57.820]   we got some insight, like in Visit Zero Knowledge Proofs,
[01:26:57.820 --> 01:27:01.620]   that is something which you took for granted
[01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:05.540]   were the same, knowledge and verification
[01:27:05.540 --> 01:27:08.660]   are actually separate concepts.
[01:27:08.660 --> 01:27:12.820]   So you can verify that an assertion is correct
[01:27:12.820 --> 01:27:16.140]   without having any idea why this is so,
[01:27:16.140 --> 01:27:18.060]   and so people failed to say,
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:21.060]   if you want to verify something, you have to have the proof.
[01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:23.060]   Once you have the proof, you know why it's true,
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:25.260]   you have the proof itself,
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:30.260]   and so somehow you can totally differentiate knowledge
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:34.540]   and verification, validity.
[01:27:34.540 --> 01:27:36.900]   So totally, you can decide if something is true
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:37.740]   and still have no idea why.
[01:27:37.740 --> 01:27:40.540]   - Is there a good example in your mind?
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:43.780]   - Oh, actually, you know, at the very beginning,
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:46.700]   we labored to find the first knowledge,
[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:48.820]   Zero Knowledge Proof, then we found a second,
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:52.540]   then we found a third, and then a few years later,
[01:27:52.540 --> 01:27:55.940]   actually we proved a theorem which essentially says
[01:27:55.940 --> 01:27:59.020]   every theorem, no matter what about,
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:02.700]   can be explained in a zero knowledge way.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.740]   - Wow. - Okay.
[01:28:04.740 --> 01:28:08.380]   So it's not a class of theorem, but all theorems,
[01:28:08.380 --> 01:28:10.340]   and is a very powerful thing.
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:13.300]   So we were really, for thousands of years,
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:18.140]   both this identity between knowledge and verification
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:19.780]   had to be hand in hand together,
[01:28:19.780 --> 01:28:22.260]   and for no reason at all.
[01:28:22.260 --> 01:28:24.820]   I mean, we had to develop a way of technology.
[01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:26.580]   As you know, I'm very big in technology
[01:28:26.580 --> 01:28:28.940]   because it makes us more human
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:33.140]   and make us understand more things than before,
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:37.860]   and I think that's a good thing.
[01:28:37.860 --> 01:28:40.620]   - So this interactive proof process,
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:43.900]   there's power in games. - Yes.
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.340]   - And you've recently gotten into,
[01:28:46.340 --> 01:28:48.380]   recently, I'm not sure you can correct me,
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.500]   mechanism design. - Yeah.
[01:28:50.500 --> 01:28:53.580]   - I mean, first of all, maybe you can explain
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:54.980]   what mechanism design is,
[01:28:54.980 --> 01:28:59.980]   and the fascinating space of playing with games
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:03.340]   and designing games.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:08.340]   - Mechanism design is that you want a certain behavior
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:09.620]   to arise, right?
[01:29:09.620 --> 01:29:13.700]   If you want to organize a societal structure or something,
[01:29:13.700 --> 01:29:17.060]   you want to have some orderly behavior to arise, right?
[01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:20.380]   Because it is important for your goals.
[01:29:22.820 --> 01:29:26.420]   But you know that people, they don't care what my goals are.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:29.620]   They cares about maximizing their utility.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:32.180]   So put it crassly, making money.
[01:29:32.180 --> 01:29:34.300]   The more money, the better, so to speak.
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.380]   I'm exaggerating.
[01:29:36.380 --> 01:29:38.660]   - Self-interest in whatever-- - Self-interest.
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:41.540]   - In whatever way that-- - So what you want to do is,
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:47.820]   ideally, what you want to do is to design a game
[01:29:47.820 --> 01:29:51.940]   so that while people play it
[01:29:51.940 --> 01:29:55.100]   so to maximize their self-interest,
[01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:59.140]   they achieve the social goal and behavior that I want.
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:02.500]   That is really the best type of thing.
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:04.180]   And it is a very
[01:30:04.180 --> 01:30:11.360]   hard science and art to design these games.
[01:30:11.360 --> 01:30:14.100]   And it challenges us to
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:19.740]   actually come up with solution concepts
[01:30:19.740 --> 01:30:24.620]   for a way to analyze the games that need to be broader.
[01:30:24.620 --> 01:30:27.940]   And I think game theory has developed
[01:30:27.940 --> 01:30:29.580]   a bunch of very compelling
[01:30:29.580 --> 01:30:32.500]   way to analyze the game.
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:34.940]   But if the game has a best property,
[01:30:34.940 --> 01:30:37.500]   you can have a pretty good guarantee
[01:30:37.500 --> 01:30:39.940]   that it's going to be played in a given way.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:42.460]   But as it turns out, and not surprisingly,
[01:30:42.460 --> 01:30:46.980]   these tools have a range of action like anything else.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:50.260]   All these so-called technical solution concepts,
[01:30:50.260 --> 01:30:51.580]   the way to analyze the game,
[01:30:51.580 --> 01:30:53.940]   like dominant strategy equilibrium,
[01:30:53.940 --> 01:30:56.760]   if something comes to mind, would be very meaningful.
[01:30:56.760 --> 01:31:01.140]   But as a limited power, in some sense,
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:03.740]   the games that can be,
[01:31:03.740 --> 01:31:05.780]   admit such a way to be analyzed--
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:07.460]   - Is a very specific kind of games,
[01:31:07.460 --> 01:31:10.100]   and the rules are set, the constraints are set,
[01:31:10.100 --> 01:31:12.380]   the utilities are all set. - Yes, yes.
[01:31:12.380 --> 01:31:14.020]   So if you want to reason,
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:17.340]   if there is a way, say, that you can analyze
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:20.980]   a restricted class of games this way.
[01:31:20.980 --> 01:31:24.940]   But most games don't fall into this restricted class.
[01:31:24.940 --> 01:31:26.340]   Then what do I do?
[01:31:26.340 --> 01:31:29.900]   Then you need to enlarge a way
[01:31:29.900 --> 01:31:32.660]   what a rational player can do.
[01:31:32.660 --> 01:31:35.500]   So for instance, in my opinion,
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:38.020]   at least in some of my,
[01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:40.320]   I played with this for a few years,
[01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:45.000]   and I was doing some exoteric things, I'm sure,
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:49.080]   in the space that were not exactly mainstream.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:52.320]   And then I changed my interest and blockchain.
[01:31:52.320 --> 01:31:55.320]   But what I'm saying, for a while I was doing,
[01:31:55.320 --> 01:31:58.160]   so for instance, to me, is a way in which
[01:31:58.160 --> 01:32:00.100]   I design the game,
[01:32:00.100 --> 01:32:03.160]   and you don't have the best move for you.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.400]   The best move is the move that is best for you,
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:07.280]   no matter what the other players are doing.
[01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:09.120]   Sometimes a game doesn't have that, okay?
[01:32:09.120 --> 01:32:10.760]   It's too much to ask.
[01:32:10.760 --> 01:32:13.960]   But I can design the game such that,
[01:32:13.960 --> 01:32:15.640]   given the option in front of you, say,
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:18.480]   oh, these are really stupid for me, take them aside.
[01:32:18.480 --> 01:32:21.320]   But these, these are not stupid.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:25.640]   So if you design the game so that in any combination
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:28.920]   of non-stupid things that the player can do,
[01:32:28.920 --> 01:32:31.640]   I achieve what I want, I'm done.
[01:32:31.640 --> 01:32:35.760]   I don't care to find the very unique equilibrium.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.520]   I don't give a damn.
[01:32:37.520 --> 01:32:40.480]   I want to say, well, as long as you don't do stupid things
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:42.760]   and nobody else does stupid things,
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:45.600]   good social things outcome arise,
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.400]   I should be equally happy.
[01:32:47.400 --> 01:32:52.400]   And so I really believe that this type of analysis
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:58.160]   is possible and has a bigger radius,
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:02.960]   so it reaches more games, more classes of games.
[01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:05.840]   And after that, we have to enlarge it again.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:08.960]   And it's going to be, we are going to have fun
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:13.440]   because human behavior can be conceptualized in many ways.
[01:33:13.440 --> 01:33:15.720]   And it's a long game.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:17.120]   - Do you have, it's a long game.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:19.440]   Do you have favorite games that you're looking at now?
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:21.920]   I mean, I suppose your work with blockchain
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:24.600]   and Algorand is the kind of game that you're,
[01:33:24.600 --> 01:33:27.360]   you basically, mechanism design,
[01:33:27.360 --> 01:33:31.080]   design the game such that it's scalable,
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.520]   secure, and decentralized, right?
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.480]   - Yes, yes.
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:35.760]   And very often you have to say,
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:39.800]   and you must also design so that the incentives are,
[01:33:39.800 --> 01:33:46.160]   and then the truth, whatever little I learned
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:49.720]   from my venture in mechanism design
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:53.280]   is that incentives are very hard to design
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.240]   because people are very complex creatures.
[01:33:56.240 --> 01:33:59.640]   And so somehow the way we design Algorand
[01:33:59.640 --> 01:34:01.560]   is a totally different way,
[01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:04.160]   essentially with no incentives, essentially.
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:09.720]   But technically speaking, there is a notion
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:13.320]   that is actually believable, right?
[01:34:13.320 --> 01:34:18.000]   So that to say, people want to maximize their utility.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:19.640]   Yes, up to a point.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:20.800]   Let me tell you.
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.800]   Assume that if you are honest, you make 100 bucks.
[01:34:25.800 --> 01:34:30.840]   But if you are dishonest, no matter how dishonest you are,
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:33.720]   you can only make 100 bucks and one cent.
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:35.480]   What are you going to be?
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:36.800]   I'm saying, you know what?
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:40.480]   Technically speaking, even that one cent,
[01:34:40.480 --> 01:34:42.120]   nobody bothers and say,
[01:34:42.120 --> 01:34:44.080]   how much am I going to make by being honest 100?
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:46.760]   If I am devious and if I'm a criminal,
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.120]   100 bucks and one cent.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:50.040]   You know, I might as well be honest, okay?
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:55.040]   So that essentially is called epsilon utility, equilibrium,
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.360]   but I think it's good.
[01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:00.280]   And that's what we design.
[01:35:00.280 --> 01:35:05.280]   Essentially means that having no incentives
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:08.680]   is actually a good thing because it prevent people
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:11.960]   from reasoning how else I'm going to gain the system.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:15.640]   But why can we achieve in Algorand to have no incentives?
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:18.440]   And in Bitcoin instead, you have to pay the miners
[01:35:18.440 --> 01:35:20.040]   because they do tremendous amount of work.
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:24.720]   Because if you have to do a lot of work,
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:27.440]   then you demand to be paid accordingly.
[01:35:27.440 --> 01:35:29.920]   But if I'm going to say,
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.960]   you have to add two and two equal to four,
[01:35:31.960 --> 01:35:33.600]   how much you want me to pay for this?
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:36.040]   If you don't give me this, I don't add the two and two.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:39.040]   I would say, you can add two and two in your sleep.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:40.720]   You don't need to be paid to add the two and two.
[01:35:40.720 --> 01:35:44.400]   So the idea is that if we make the system so efficient
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:49.120]   so that generating the next block is so damn simple,
[01:35:49.120 --> 01:35:52.120]   it doesn't hit the universe, let alone my computer,
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:54.840]   let alone take some microsecond of computation,
[01:35:54.840 --> 01:35:58.360]   I might as well not being received incentives
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.600]   for doing that and try to incentivize
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.280]   some other part of the system,
[01:36:02.280 --> 01:36:04.840]   but not the main consensus, which is a mechanism
[01:36:04.840 --> 01:36:07.120]   for generating and adding block to the chain.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:11.700]   - Since you're Italian, Sicilian,
[01:36:11.700 --> 01:36:16.440]   I also heard rumors that you are a connoisseur of food.
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:18.600]   (laughing)
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:22.600]   What, you know, if I said today's the last day
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.400]   you get to be alive, I'm rushing.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:25.760]   You shouldn't have trusted me.
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:26.600]   (laughing)
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.440]   You never know with a Russian
[01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.080]   whether you're gonna make it out or not.
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:31.880]   Well, if you had one last meal,
[01:36:31.880 --> 01:36:34.040]   you can travel somewhere in the world.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:36.960]   Either you make it or somebody else makes it,
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.360]   what's that gonna look like?
[01:36:38.360 --> 01:36:41.200]   - All right, if it's one last meal,
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:45.120]   I must say, in this era of COVID,
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.680]   I've not been able to see my mom.
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:54.480]   My mom was a fantastic chef, okay?
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:57.720]   And had this very traditional food.
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.480]   And as you know, the very traditional food
[01:36:59.480 --> 01:37:03.080]   are great for a reason, 'cause they survived
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:05.440]   hundreds of years of culinary innovation.
[01:37:05.440 --> 01:37:08.680]   So, and there is one very laborious thing,
[01:37:08.680 --> 01:37:13.680]   which is, you heard the name, which is this parmigiana.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:17.040]   But to do it is a piece of art.
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:19.800]   It requires so many hours that only my mom could do it.
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:23.080]   If we have one last meal, I want a parmigiana, okay?
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:26.440]   - What is, what's the laborious process?
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:28.200]   Is it the ingredients?
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.720]   Is it the actual process?
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:35.000]   Is it the atmosphere and the humans involved?
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.600]   - The latter.
[01:37:37.600 --> 01:37:40.280]   The ingredient, like in any other,
[01:37:40.280 --> 01:37:45.280]   in Italian cuisine, believes in very few ingredients.
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:50.680]   If you take, say quintessential Italian recipe
[01:37:50.680 --> 01:37:53.600]   that everybody knows, spaghetti pesto, okay?
[01:37:53.600 --> 01:37:58.160]   Pesto is olive oil, very good, extra virgin olive oil,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:06.080]   basil, pine nuts, pepper, a clove of garlic,
[01:38:06.080 --> 01:38:08.160]   not too much, otherwise you--
[01:38:08.160 --> 01:38:10.400]   - Overpower everything.
[01:38:10.400 --> 01:38:14.040]   - And then you have to do either two schools of thought,
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:17.400]   parmesan or pecorino or a mix of the two.
[01:38:17.400 --> 01:38:19.080]   I mentioned six ingredients.
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.640]   That is typical Italian.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:23.280]   That is, I understand that there are other cuisines,
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:24.760]   for instance, a French cuisine,
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:27.120]   which is extremely sophisticated,
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:30.440]   and extremely combinatorial, or some Chinese cuisine,
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:34.240]   which has a lot of, many more ingredients than this.
[01:38:34.240 --> 01:38:38.320]   And yet, the art is to put them together, a lot of things.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:41.080]   In Italy, it's really striving for simplicity.
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.360]   You have to find few ingredients,
[01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.120]   but the right ingredients to create something.
[01:38:46.120 --> 01:38:48.480]   So in parmigiana, the ingredients are eggplants,
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:51.000]   there are tomatoes, there are basil,
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:55.400]   but how to put them together, and the process,
[01:38:55.400 --> 01:39:00.040]   is an act of love, okay, of labor and love.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:04.760]   Is that you can spend the entire day,
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:07.640]   I'm not exaggerating, but the entire morning, for sure,
[01:39:07.640 --> 01:39:10.080]   to do it properly.
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:11.720]   - Yeah, as a Japanese cuisine, too,
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:14.640]   there's a mastery to the simplicity with the sushi.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:16.480]   I don't know if you've seen "Jiro Dreams of Sushi,"
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:17.880]   but there's a mastery to that
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:20.080]   that's propagated through the generations.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:21.800]   It's fascinating. - It's fascinating.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:25.040]   - You know, people love it when I ask about books.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:29.280]   I don't know if books, whether fiction, nonfiction,
[01:39:29.280 --> 01:39:32.080]   technical, or completely non-technical,
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:34.000]   had an impact in your life throughout,
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.960]   if there's anything you would recommend,
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:39.400]   or even just mention as something that gave you an insight,
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:41.640]   or moved you in some way.
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:43.600]   - So, okay. (Lex laughing)
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:45.000]   So I don't know if I recommend,
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.600]   because in some sense, you almost,
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.560]   to be Italian, or to be such a scholar,
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:54.480]   but being Italian, one thing that really
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:39:57.840]   impressed me tremendously is the "Divine Comedy."
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:00.960]   It is a medieval poem, a very long poem,
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:05.960]   divided in three parts, hell, purgatory, and paradise, okay?
[01:40:05.960 --> 01:40:09.200]   And that is the non-trivial story
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:14.200]   of a middleman man gets into a crisis,
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:20.040]   personal crisis, and then out of this crisis,
[01:40:20.040 --> 01:40:23.360]   he purifies, makes a catastrophe,
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.280]   purifies himself more and more and more
[01:40:25.280 --> 01:40:30.280]   until he's become capable of actually meeting God, okay?
[01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:34.640]   And that is actually a complex story.
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:38.280]   So you have to get some very sophisticated language,
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:39.960]   maybe Latin at that point,
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.320]   we're talking about 1200s Italy, right?
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:47.000]   And in Florence.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:50.600]   This guy instead, he chose his own dialect,
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:53.840]   not spoken outside his own immediate circle, right?
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:55.640]   Florentine dialect.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:59.360]   And actually, Dante really made Italian Italian.
[01:40:59.360 --> 01:41:01.080]   He was, and so I said,
[01:41:01.080 --> 01:41:03.680]   how can you express such a sophisticated things?
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:08.080]   And so it's, and then the point is that these words
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:10.360]   that nobody actually knew
[01:41:10.360 --> 01:41:12.240]   because they were essentially dialect,
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:15.720]   and plus a bunch of very intricate rhymes
[01:41:15.720 --> 01:41:18.280]   in which you had to rhyme the things,
[01:41:18.280 --> 01:41:21.960]   and turns out that by getting meaning
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:23.520]   from the things that you rhyme,
[01:41:23.520 --> 01:41:27.080]   you essentially guess what the word means,
[01:41:27.080 --> 01:41:28.720]   and you invent Italian,
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:32.400]   and you communicate by almost osmosis what you want.
[01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.520]   It's a miracle of communication.
[01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:36.480]   In a dialect, a very poor language,
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.240]   very unsophisticated to express
[01:41:38.240 --> 01:41:40.520]   very sophisticated situation.
[01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:42.960]   I love it.
[01:41:42.960 --> 01:41:46.920]   People love it, and Italians are not Italian,
[01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:50.840]   but what I got of it is that very often,
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:55.000]   limitations are our strength.
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:58.040]   'Cause if you limit yourself at a very poor language,
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:00.360]   somehow you get out of it,
[01:42:00.360 --> 01:42:03.080]   and you achieve even better form of communication
[01:42:03.080 --> 01:42:04.920]   into using a hyper sophisticated,
[01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:07.120]   literary language of lots of resonance
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.440]   from the prior books that you can actually
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:10.920]   instantaneously quote.
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:11.880]   He couldn't quote anything
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:14.320]   because nothing was written in Italian before him.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:19.320]   So I really felt that limitations are our strength,
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:22.520]   and I think that rather than complaining
[01:42:22.520 --> 01:42:25.640]   about the limitations, we should embrace them
[01:42:25.640 --> 01:42:29.600]   because if we embrace our limitation,
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:33.120]   limited as we are, we find very creative solutions
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:36.600]   that people with less limitation we have,
[01:42:36.600 --> 01:42:38.560]   we will not even think about it.
[01:42:38.560 --> 01:42:40.880]   - Wow, so limitation's a kind of superpower
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:42.880]   if you choose to see it that way.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.400]   Is there, since you speak both languages,
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:49.440]   is there something that's lost in translation to you?
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:51.520]   Is there something you can express in Italian
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:55.080]   that you can't in English, and vice versa maybe?
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.680]   Is there something you could say
[01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:58.560]   to the musicality of the language?
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.680]   I mean, I've been to Italy a few times,
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:04.360]   and I'm not sure if it's the actual words,
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:07.740]   but the people are certainly very,
[01:43:07.740 --> 01:43:10.200]   there's body language too.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.560]   There's just, the whole being is language.
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:16.800]   So I don't know if you miss some of that
[01:43:16.800 --> 01:43:18.960]   when you're speaking English in this country.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:21.820]   - Yes, in fact, actually,
[01:43:21.820 --> 01:43:27.880]   certainly I miss it, and somehow it was a sacrifice
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:32.280]   that I made consciously by the time I arrived.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:35.880]   I knew that this I was not going to express myself
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:40.440]   at that level, and it was actually a sacrifice
[01:43:40.440 --> 01:43:45.040]   because given to you also your mother tongue is Russian,
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:47.440]   so you know that you can be very expressive
[01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:50.160]   in your mother tongue and not very expressive
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:52.640]   in your new tongue, in your language.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.960]   And then what people think of you in your language,
[01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:58.200]   because when the precise of expression of things,
[01:43:58.200 --> 01:44:02.080]   it generates, it shows elegance,
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:06.960]   or it shows knowledge, or it shows us our senses,
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:10.400]   or it shows us our caste, or education, whatever it is.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.600]   So all of a sudden I found myself on the bottom.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.840]   (laughing)
[01:44:13.840 --> 01:44:14.680]   - Yeah, there is--
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:17.320]   - So I had to fight all my way up, back up.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:19.440]   And but I'm not saying, I go back to--
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:21.240]   - Yeah, that's fascinating, right?
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:23.400]   - Their limitations are actually our strength.
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:28.400]   In fact, it's a trick to limit yourself to exceed, right?
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.720]   And there are examples in history.
[01:44:30.720 --> 01:44:34.600]   If you think about Hernan Cortes, right?
[01:44:34.600 --> 01:44:36.640]   Goes to invade Mexico.
[01:44:36.640 --> 01:44:40.120]   He has what, a few hundred people with him?
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:44.120]   And he has 100,000 people in arms on the other side.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:47.400]   First thing he does, he limits himself.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:49.360]   He sinks his own ship.
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.720]   There is no return.
[01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.200]   (laughing)
[01:44:52.200 --> 01:44:54.240]   - And I met Borenti, actually, manager.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.720]   - That's really profound.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:59.320]   I actually, first of all, that's inspiring to me.
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:00.280]   (laughing)
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:02.320]   I feel like I have quite a few limitations,
[01:45:02.320 --> 01:45:05.300]   but more practically on the Russian side,
[01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:08.600]   I'm going to try to do a couple of really big
[01:45:08.600 --> 01:45:11.480]   and really tough interviews in Russian.
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:15.040]   Once COVID lifts a little bit, I'm traveling to Russia.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:18.800]   And I'll keep your advice in mind
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.400]   that the limitations is a kind of superpower.
[01:45:21.400 --> 01:45:23.160]   We should use it to our advantage.
[01:45:23.160 --> 01:45:26.800]   Because you do feel less,
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:30.040]   like you're not able to convey your wisdom
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:31.560]   in the Russian language.
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:33.920]   'Cause I moved here when I was 13.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:37.440]   So you don't, you know, the parts of life you live
[01:45:37.440 --> 01:45:40.240]   under a certain language are the parts of life
[01:45:40.240 --> 01:45:41.360]   you're able to communicate.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:45.040]   You know, I became a thoughtful,
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:48.560]   deeply thoughtful human in English.
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:53.600]   But the pain from World War II,
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.120]   the music of the people,
[01:45:56.120 --> 01:45:58.520]   that was instilled with me in Russian.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:45:59.960]   So I can carry both of those.
[01:45:59.960 --> 01:46:01.440]   And there's limitations in both.
[01:46:01.440 --> 01:46:05.600]   I can't say philosophically profound stuff in Russian,
[01:46:05.600 --> 01:46:10.240]   but I can't in English express like that melancholy feeling
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.680]   of like the people.
[01:46:11.680 --> 01:46:13.760]   And so combining those two, I'll somehow--
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:14.600]   - Oh, beautifully said.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:15.440]   (laughing)
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:16.260]   Thanks for sharing.
[01:46:16.260 --> 01:46:17.100]   This is great.
[01:46:17.100 --> 01:46:18.200]   Yes, I totally understand you.
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.040]   Yes.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:21.720]   You've accomplished some incredible things
[01:46:21.720 --> 01:46:26.720]   in the space of science, in the space of technology,
[01:46:26.720 --> 01:46:30.560]   the space of theory and engineering.
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:33.300]   Do you have advice for somebody young,
[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:36.240]   an undergraduate student, somebody in high school,
[01:46:36.240 --> 01:46:38.080]   or anyone who just feels young?
[01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:39.440]   (laughing)
[01:46:39.440 --> 01:46:41.800]   About life or about career,
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:44.080]   about making their way in this world?
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:47.080]   - So I was thinking before that I believe in emotion.
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:52.080]   And my thing is to be true to your own emotion.
[01:46:52.080 --> 01:46:56.080]   And that I think that if you do that,
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:46:59.360]   you're doing well because it's a life well spent.
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:02.860]   And you are going never tired
[01:47:02.860 --> 01:47:05.480]   because you want to solve all these emotional knots
[01:47:05.480 --> 01:47:07.960]   that always intrigued you from the beginning.
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:12.960]   And I really believe that to live meaningfully,
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:17.760]   creatively, and yet to live your emotional life.
[01:47:17.760 --> 01:47:20.520]   So I really believe that whether you're a scientist
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:22.080]   or an artist even more,
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:24.680]   but a scientist, I think of them as artists as well.
[01:47:24.680 --> 01:47:25.880]   If you are a human being,
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:28.960]   so you are really to live fully your emotions
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:31.460]   and to the extent possible.
[01:47:31.460 --> 01:47:33.840]   Sometimes emotions can be overbearing.
[01:47:33.840 --> 01:47:38.160]   And my advice is try to express them
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:39.640]   with more and more confidence.
[01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:40.760]   Sometimes it's hard,
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:43.600]   but you are going to be much more fulfilled
[01:47:43.600 --> 01:47:46.120]   than by suppressing them.
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:47.140]   - What about love?
[01:47:47.140 --> 01:47:48.280]   One of the big ones.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:49.560]   What role does that play?
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:53.240]   - That's the bigger part of emotions.
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:55.800]   That is a scary thing, right?
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:00.480]   It's a lot of vulnerability that comes with love.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:05.480]   But there is also so much energy and power
[01:48:05.920 --> 01:48:09.320]   and love in all senses,
[01:48:09.320 --> 01:48:11.080]   and in the traditional sense,
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:16.080]   but also in the sense of a broader sense for humanity,
[01:48:16.080 --> 01:48:21.000]   this feeling, this compassion that makes us one
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.080]   with other people and the suffering of other people.
[01:48:24.080 --> 01:48:28.640]   I mean, all of this is a very scary stuff,
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:33.080]   but it's really the fabric of life.
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:38.080]   - Well, the sad thing is it really hurts to lose it.
[01:48:38.080 --> 01:48:41.600]   - Yes, that's why the vulnerability that comes with it.
[01:48:41.600 --> 01:48:45.400]   - That's the thing about emotion is the up and the down,
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:48.800]   and the down seems to come always with the up,
[01:48:48.800 --> 01:48:52.000]   but the up only comes with the down.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:57.320]   Let me ask you about the ultimate down,
[01:48:57.320 --> 01:49:02.320]   which is unfortunately we humans are mortal,
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:05.320]   or appear to be for the most part.
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:07.880]   Do you think about your own mortality?
[01:49:07.880 --> 01:49:11.360]   Do you fear death?
[01:49:11.360 --> 01:49:13.960]   - I hope so, and I do,
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:16.720]   because without death there is no life,
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.960]   so at least there is no meaningful life.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:23.280]   Death is actually in some sense our ultimate motivator
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:25.800]   to live a beautiful and meaningful life.
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:30.800]   I myself felt as a young man that unless I got
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.400]   something that I wanted to do,
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:35.640]   I don't know why I got the idea of something to say,
[01:49:35.640 --> 01:49:37.640]   if I'm not able to say, I would suicide.
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:40.640]   So maybe it was a way to motivate myself,
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:42.000]   but you don't need to motivate it,
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:45.120]   because in some sense, fortunately, death is there.
[01:49:45.120 --> 01:49:49.120]   So you better get up and do your thing,
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:54.120]   and because that is the best motivation to live fully.
[01:49:54.120 --> 01:49:59.440]   - Well, what do you think, what do you hope your legacy is?
[01:49:59.440 --> 01:50:01.600]   (sighing)
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:05.280]   - You know, my--
[01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:07.280]   - You mentioned you have two kids.
[01:50:07.280 --> 01:50:12.560]   - Yes, and so I really feel that there is,
[01:50:12.560 --> 01:50:17.720]   on one side is my biological legacy,
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.120]   and that is my two kids, right,
[01:50:21.120 --> 01:50:26.000]   and their kids, hopefully, and that is one fine.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.000]   And the other thing is this common enterprise,
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.240]   which is society, and I really feel that my legacy
[01:50:36.240 --> 01:50:41.240]   would be better by providing security and privacy.
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:45.920]   Actually, for me, are metaphorical to say,
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:48.360]   I want to give you the ability to interact more
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:52.880]   and take more risks, and reach out more for more people,
[01:50:52.880 --> 01:50:55.400]   as difficult and dangerous as it may seem.
[01:50:55.400 --> 01:51:00.240]   But my all scientific work is about to guarantee privacy
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:03.840]   and give you the security of interaction.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:06.360]   And not only in a transaction,
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.320]   like it would be a blockchain transaction,
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.360]   but that is really one of the hard core
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:14.680]   of my emotional problems,
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:18.680]   and I think that these are the problems I want to tackle.
[01:51:18.680 --> 01:51:23.480]   - Yeah, and ultimately, privacy and security is freedom.
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:24.520]   - Yes.
[01:51:24.520 --> 01:51:26.560]   - Freedom is at the core of this.
[01:51:26.560 --> 01:51:28.920]   It's dangerous, just it's like the emotion thing.
[01:51:28.920 --> 01:51:30.600]   - The emotion thing, yeah.
[01:51:30.600 --> 01:51:32.120]   - But ultimately, that's how we create
[01:51:32.120 --> 01:51:33.640]   all the beautiful things around us.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:36.120]   Do you think there's meaning to it all,
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:40.920]   this life, except the urgency that death provides,
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:45.920]   and us anxious beings create cool stuff along the way?
[01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:49.120]   Is there a deeper meaning, and if it is, what is it?
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:51.760]   - Well, meaning of life,
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.800]   actually, there are three meanings of life.
[01:51:53.800 --> 01:51:54.640]   - Great.
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:55.480]   - That is great.
[01:51:55.480 --> 01:51:57.680]   One, to seek.
[01:51:57.680 --> 01:51:59.280]   Two, to seek.
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:01.200]   And three, to seek.
[01:52:01.200 --> 01:52:02.120]   - To seek what?
[01:52:02.120 --> 01:52:04.840]   Or is there no answer to that?
[01:52:04.840 --> 01:52:06.200]   - There's no answer to that.
[01:52:06.200 --> 01:52:09.520]   I really think that the journey is more and more important
[01:52:09.520 --> 01:52:12.400]   than the destination, whatever that be.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:16.000]   And I think that is a journey,
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.080]   and is, in my opinion, at the end of the day,
[01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:22.800]   I must admit, meaningful in itself.
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:27.800]   And we must admit that maybe whatever your destination
[01:52:27.800 --> 01:52:32.280]   might be, I'd be hanging, you know,
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:36.240]   we may never get there, but hell was a great ride.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:38.040]   (laughing)
[01:52:38.040 --> 01:52:40.160]   - Well, I don't think there's a better way to end this.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:44.520]   Silvio, thank you for wasting your extremely valuable time
[01:52:44.520 --> 01:52:47.360]   with me today, joining on this journey
[01:52:47.360 --> 01:52:49.840]   of seeking something together.
[01:52:49.840 --> 01:52:53.400]   We found nothing, but it was very fun.
[01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:54.240]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:55.080]   Thank you so much for coming.
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:55.920]   - Thank you, Alex.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:59.520]   It was really special for me to be interviewed by you.
