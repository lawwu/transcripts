[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   There's this really good YouTube video about Photoshop when it was first released.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.960]   I would think about the early 90s.
[00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.600]   It's kind of like a late night show and they're discussing the ethical implications of manipulating
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:13.760]   images in magazines.
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.840]   And they're like, "Should we allow to manipulate images and put them in magazines?"
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.400]   And half of the panel was like, "No, we shouldn't."
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.920]   Just like it breaks the essence of what photography is, right?
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.760]   And 20 years after that, it makes no sense to think about not doing something like that.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.120]   So there's always an adaptation process, I would say, where people need to collectively ask,
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.880]   "Hey, how is it going to be used?"
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:43.840]   But I think ultimately you understand what the limitations are and you also fine-tune
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.720]   your eyes and your understanding of the world to make sense of that thing.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.560]   And now everyone knows that Photoshop is a verb that you can use to describe something
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:53.440]   that's manipulated.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.760]   Right?
