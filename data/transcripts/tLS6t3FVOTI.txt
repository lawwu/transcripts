[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.260]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.260]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.140]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.940]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.700]   Today, we're discussing supplements.
[00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.620]   We're more specifically a rational guide to supplementation.
[00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:22.380]   Now, to be forthright,
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.420]   I want to tell you that I am not a fan of the word
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.620]   supplements because it stems from this idea
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.140]   that all supplements are somehow food supplements
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.900]   or designed to compensate
[00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.860]   for what one could otherwise get from food.
[00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.700]   And that's simply not the case.
[00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.720]   Many supplements are compounds
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.740]   that are extremely efficacious,
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.920]   for instance, for enhancing sleep
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.580]   or for enhancing hormone function or for enhancing focus.
[00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.980]   And many of those compounds are simply not found in food
[00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.660]   or are not found in enough abundance in food
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.660]   to have the desired effect.
[00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.900]   Now, that raises the issue as to whether or not
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.700]   these compounds are good to take, safe to take,
[00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.260]   and whether or not they are actually beneficial for us.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.940]   And the short answer is that like everything else,
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.340]   supplements can either be good for us or dangerous for us,
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.700]   depending on dosage, sourcing, et cetera.
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.340]   But more importantly, we need to think about supplements
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.660]   and a rational guide to supplementation
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.940]   as taking into account a number of different factors.
[00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.340]   And we need to set aside the idea
[00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.140]   that all non-prescription compounds
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.620]   that fall under this umbrella term supplements
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.980]   are simply things that could be extracted from food,
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.560]   but most people don't either ingest enough of those foods
[00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.820]   or pay enough attention to their diet
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.240]   in order to obtain them.
[00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.820]   In fact, during today's episode,
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.340]   I'm going to give you a number of different,
[00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.980]   very specific questions that you can answer
[00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.340]   in order to decide whether or not you should be taking
[00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.960]   any so-called supplements or not,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.340]   and whether or not you should be taking
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.360]   one type of supplement or another type of supplement
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.940]   more or less than the other.
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.460]   I'm also going to discuss safety, of course,
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.620]   and I will discuss cost because obviously,
[00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.420]   monetary cost is a serious consideration for most,
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.020]   if not everybody, considering the use of supplements.
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.700]   During today's episode, I will also discuss
[00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.660]   which specific supplements are optimal
[00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.540]   for achieving specific endpoints,
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.360]   such as improved sleep, such as improved focus,
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.360]   and such as improved hormone function, among other things.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.780]   I plan to cover the full range
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.420]   of what are referred to as supplements,
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.820]   including so-called foundational supplements
[00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.900]   that are designed to act as a sort of insurance policy
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.740]   against any deficiencies that might exist within your diet,
[00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.800]   all the way up to very targeted outcome
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.860]   supplements and compounds.
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.980]   That is, compounds that are non-prescription
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.540]   that are designed to achieve very specific endpoints,
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.700]   such as enhanced focus over the next four to six hours
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.020]   of physical work or mental work, so on and so forth.
[00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.280]   I plan to cover everything in between that as well,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.380]   and I promise to cover how supplements interact
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.120]   with other things, such as behavioral tools,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.920]   prescription drugs, when supplements might be
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.620]   a good alternative to prescription drugs,
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.220]   when they might not be a good alternative
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.020]   to prescription drugs, when supplements can serve
[00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.380]   as an augment to already excellent nutrition
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.620]   and prescription protocols, and every feature of supplements
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.880]   as it relates to mental health,
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.380]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.020]   By the end of today's episode,
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.180]   you should be armed with a number of different questions,
[00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.060]   as I mentioned before, that will allow you
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.700]   to develop the most biologically effective
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.180]   and cost-effective supplement regimen for you.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.360]   And of course, I want to acknowledge that for some people,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.340]   the total amount or dosages of a given supplement
[00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.280]   or supplements that you might need to take could be zero,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.640]   there are such individuals, but that many people
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.220]   can in fact arrive tremendous benefit from supplements
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.300]   in a way that can be more cost-effective
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.180]   than trying to obtain the same non-prescription nutrients
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.180]   from food.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.660]   As we head into today's conversation,
[00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.220]   I want to emphasize something very important,
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.800]   not just as it relates to supplements,
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.220]   but as it relates to all aspects of mental health,
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.660]   physical health, and performance.
[00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:51.380]   And that is, I take the stance that behavioral tools,
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.740]   that is specific actions that we take
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:57.580]   and specific actions that we avoid form the foundation
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.060]   of mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.760]   So things like viewing morning sunlight
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.040]   and exercise are behavioral tools,
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.500]   they don't require the ingestion of anything.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.940]   Within the realm of behavioral tools,
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.660]   there are also some don'ts or do nots
[00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.640]   that can greatly enhance our mental health,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.060]   physical health, and performance,
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.740]   such as avoiding bright light exposure to your eyes
[00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.060]   between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM,
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.180]   or avoiding caffeine too late in the afternoon,
[00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.820]   because even if you can fall asleep
[00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.100]   after ingesting caffeine in the late afternoon,
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.980]   we know it disrupts the architecture of your sleep
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.380]   in ways that greatly diminish your mental health,
[00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.560]   physical health, and performance the following day,
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.400]   for instance.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.880]   So behavioral tools form the foundational layer
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.580]   of all tools for mental health,
[00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.120]   physical health, and performance.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.420]   Second to that, I would say the next layer
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.460]   is in fact nutrition.
[00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:47.460]   No amount of supplementation or non-prescription compounds
[00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:49.540]   or prescription compounds for that matter
[00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.020]   can ever compensate for poor nutrition,
[00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.820]   at least not for very long.
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:55.100]   Okay, so this is a key point,
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.900]   even though many supplements are not simply food supplements
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.140]   because they are not designed to compensate
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:03.980]   for anything that you could otherwise get from food,
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.780]   that is not to say that you can live on supplements.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.840]   You know, I suppose you could live on whey protein
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.120]   and fish oil capsules and vitamin capsules or tablets
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.360]   for a short while,
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.140]   but before long, you'd either suffer from boredom
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.640]   to the extent that you'd want to go back to food
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.780]   or some other deficiency would show up.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.940]   I think it's the rare individual that tries to survive
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.960]   entirely on food supplements and things of that sort.
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.460]   Most everybody, and I would hope everybody,
[00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.060]   is paying attention to their nutrition.
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.160]   So I would place behavioral tools, do's and do nots,
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.260]   as layer one, the deepest layer,
[00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.260]   the bedrock of all mental health,
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.140]   physical health, and performance.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.080]   On top of that, I would place nutrition.
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.560]   And of course, that's going to mean different things
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.840]   to different people with the understanding
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.140]   that there's a huge array of different food choices
[00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:52.340]   and nutritional programs.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:55.660]   Nutrition is fundamentally important for macronutrients,
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.960]   for storage of energy in the form of glycogen fats
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.300]   and phosphor creatine stores and so forth,
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.940]   but also for obtaining basic nutrients,
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.020]   vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients, okay?
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.180]   So we've got behavioral tools, nutritional tools,
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.580]   then on top of that,
[00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.560]   I would place what is typically called supplementation,
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.260]   although today I'm trying to expand that word to include
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.460]   not just things that compensate for food deficiencies
[00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.740]   or that are layered on top of food
[00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.900]   as a way to enhance the amount of nutrients
[00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:25.900]   that you could get from food, but as I mentioned before,
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.020]   compounds that are non-prescription
[00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.980]   that can be for a variety of different purposes
[00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.940]   and many of which are not available in food.
[00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.460]   So I would place supplementation right on top of nutrition.
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.540]   Then past that, I would say prescription drugs,
[00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:43.700]   obviously prescribed from a board-certified MD,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.800]   can serve a very vital purpose in the treatment
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.200]   or augmentation of mental health,
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.600]   physical health, and performance goals.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.360]   So some people do in fact need prescription antidepressants,
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.200]   other people do not.
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.080]   Some people do in fact need prescription drugs
[00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.380]   for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.160]   or sleep-related disorders, so on and so forth.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:03.280]   The whole issue of whether or not
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:07.800]   there is an over-prescription epidemic or not
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:10.280]   is a separate conversation for a separate podcast.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.100]   I would argue that many prescription drugs
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.920]   do in fact save lives.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:16.300]   This includes the category of prescription drugs
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.520]   related to statins and cardiovascular health,
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.920]   related to any number of different things,
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.140]   even sleep disorders and insomnia, narcolepsy, and so forth.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:28.520]   That said, there are many instances
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.200]   in which people can either reduce their dosages
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.240]   of prescription compounds
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.400]   or can replace those prescription compounds
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.480]   with quality behavioral tools,
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.740]   nutrition, and supplementation.
[00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.640]   But there are many instances in which prescription drugs
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:47.560]   are the only route by which people can achieve
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.960]   the mental health, physical health, and performance goals
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:51.280]   that they wish to achieve.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.680]   So I would place that as the fourth layer
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.320]   in this stack of layers directed towards mental health,
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.680]   physical health, and performance.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:59.160]   So just to list off again,
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:02.640]   I fundamentally believe that behaviors, dos and do nots
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.480]   form the foundation
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:05.360]   of mental health, physical health, performance.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:08.160]   Next in line would be nutrition,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.280]   that is the specific foods we eat,
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.520]   the amount that we eat,
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.120]   the combinations of foods that we eat in a given sitting,
[00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:17.600]   and the timing in which we eat our food.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.680]   Then on top of that, I would place supplementation,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.540]   the topic of today's episode,
[00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:23.520]   and finally prescription drugs.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.760]   And of course, all of these things interact
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.600]   in important and interesting ways,
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.880]   many of which interactions we will discuss
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.200]   during today's podcast,
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.900]   as we drill into the topic of supplementation,
[00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.640]   developing a rational supplementation protocol,
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:39.560]   and one that is most biologically and cost-effective.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.520]   Before moving further into today's episode,
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:43.520]   I want to emphasize a very important point,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:46.400]   which is that I am not a physician,
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:47.920]   that is, I'm not a clinician,
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.680]   so I do not prescribe anything,
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.200]   nor am I going to do that today.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.600]   I'm a professor, I review the research literature,
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.240]   I describe tools gleaned from the research literature
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:59.640]   and developed from the research literature.
[00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.800]   So I profess many things,
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:02.280]   but I do not prescribe anything,
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:04.700]   and I think it's vitally important
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.100]   that anytime you are thinking of adding or subtracting
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:10.980]   any behavioral protocols, nutritional protocols,
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:12.700]   supplementation-based protocols,
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:15.320]   and certainly prescription drug-based protocols,
[00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.260]   for whatever purpose,
[00:09:17.260 --> 00:09:21.300]   that you consult a trusted, board-certified physician.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.600]   That's absolutely essential.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.760]   I don't say that merely to protect me,
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.620]   I mainly say that to protect you.
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:29.640]   The most important aspect of today's episode
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:31.720]   is not going to be that you discover
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.140]   one particular supplement or category of supplements
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:37.040]   or blend of supplements that is going to transform
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.600]   your mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.720]   No, the purpose of today's episode
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:45.080]   is for you to understand where you have needs
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.760]   that can be met by supplementation
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.560]   better than any other approach,
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:51.520]   and most importantly, how to think about supplementation.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:53.920]   That is, how to think about the different categories
[00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.680]   of supplements that are out there
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.320]   and how those interact with your nutrition
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:01.840]   and your behaviors so that you can maximize
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:04.440]   your immediate and long-term health.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.740]   What I mean by this is that we have this word,
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.340]   supplements or supplementation,
[00:10:09.340 --> 00:10:11.340]   but that means many, many different things.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.000]   It means vitamins, it means minerals, it means adaptogens.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.240]   Most people probably don't even know
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.960]   what an adaptogen really is,
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:20.220]   and in fact, many people talking about adaptogens
[00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:22.800]   never actually define what an adaptogen is
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:24.260]   or it's designed for,
[00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:25.960]   or the fact that many adaptogens
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.960]   are also used for other purposes.
[00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:30.280]   So today's discussion is really about
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.780]   you learning how to think about supplementation
[00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.520]   the same way you would learn to think about nutrition
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:39.040]   or exercise or anything related to brain and body health
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.680]   for that matter, in a way that lets you navigate
[00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:44.440]   this vast space that we call supplementation
[00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:47.360]   and develop protocols that are optimal for you.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.520]   And indeed, it may be the case that the ideal dosage
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.920]   of a given supplement for you is zero milligrams.
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:58.520]   For instance, if I ask you, are you sleeping deeply
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.760]   and enough each night?
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.040]   Do you feel rested throughout the day?
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.440]   Maybe you need a short nap and that's it,
[00:11:02.440 --> 00:11:03.640]   or maybe you don't.
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.240]   And you say, yes, I feel great, I sleep great,
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.280]   I wake up feeling great.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:09.320]   I only need a short nap or no nap during the day
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:10.980]   to feel rested throughout the day.
[00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:12.640]   Well, then there's really no discussion
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.520]   about sleep supplementation to be had between you and me.
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:18.400]   However, if you are not sleeping well,
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:21.120]   then a big discussion opens up as to what the reasons are.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.280]   Is it related to nutrition or when you're exercising
[00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:24.960]   or ingesting caffeine?
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   In other words, no discussion about supplementation
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:29.060]   can be had in a vacuum.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:31.200]   Rather, discussions about supplementation
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:33.200]   need to be considered in a larger context.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:35.160]   So today you're going to learn how to place the discussion
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:37.800]   in thinking about supplementation in a larger context
[00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.560]   and think about how specific supplements,
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:44.380]   that is specific ingredients and combinations of ingredients
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:47.280]   can indeed be used to buffer and support
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:51.200]   your overall health and lead you to specific health
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.320]   and performance outcomes. Before we begin,
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:55.620]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast is separate
[00:11:55.620 --> 00:11:57.840]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.060]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:02.620]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:05.240]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.560]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.280]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:11.360]   Our first sponsor is Momentus.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:14.600]   Momentus makes supplements of the absolute highest quality.
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:17.660]   The Huberman Lab podcast has decided to partner with Momentus
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:19.240]   because of the extremely high quality
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.680]   of Momentus supplements and because they have
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.740]   single ingredient formulations.
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.380]   As we'll discuss more on today's episode,
[00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:27.640]   single ingredient formulations are essential
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.960]   for most all aspects of developing a rational,
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.360]   highly efficacious supplement regimen.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.700]   And that's because the ideal supplement regimen
[00:12:35.700 --> 00:12:39.160]   allows you to adjust the dosages of individual ingredients
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.160]   as well as alternate days in which specific ingredients
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.240]   are consumed.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.520]   It also allows you for instance,
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:47.360]   to assess whether or not one given ingredient works for you
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.120]   and another ingredient does not.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.880]   And it also allows you to assess whether or not
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:54.280]   any side effects originate from a specific component
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.920]   of your supplement protocol.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.640]   Another advantage of Momentus supplements
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:59.220]   is that they ship anywhere in the world
[00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.060]   because we realize that many of you reside
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.520]   outside of the United States.
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.480]   If you'd like to try any of the supplements mentioned
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.120]   in today's or other episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.320]   So for instance, things related to sleep augmentation,
[00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.480]   hormone augmentation, enhancing focus,
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.260]   metabolic health or otherwise,
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.680]   you can go to Live Momentus spelled O-U-S.
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:17.960]   So livemomentus.com/huberman
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.800]   and you'll get 20% off any of their products.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.320]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Element.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:24.900]   Element is an electrolyte drink
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:27.260]   that has everything you need and nothing you don't.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:30.140]   That means plenty of sodium, magnesium and potassium,
[00:13:30.140 --> 00:13:33.140]   the so-called electrolytes and no sugar.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:35.280]   Getting sufficient hydration and electrolytes
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.720]   is key to brain health and body health.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:39.860]   And that's because every cell in your brain and body
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.620]   relies on having enough electrolytes available
[00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:43.500]   in order to function.
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:45.520]   This is especially true of the so-called neurons
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:47.160]   or nerve cells in your brain.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.720]   They actually require sufficient amounts of sodium
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.500]   and potassium and magnesium,
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:54.360]   but especially sodium and potassium available to them
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:56.720]   in order to fire what are called action potentials
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.640]   or electrical signals.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.460]   That's what allows you to think, to feel, to move,
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.320]   what gives you energy, so on and so forth.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.720]   So when you are dehydrated,
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:06.080]   oftentimes you will need to get electrolytes.
[00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.840]   And that's true if you're exercising a lot
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.680]   or if you sweat a lot, but for many people,
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:11.840]   it's just true because they're not consuming enough water
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.240]   and electrolytes in the form of liquids and foods
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:15.160]   throughout the day.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.320]   Element contains a science-backed electrolyte ratio
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.480]   of 1000 milligrams of sodium, 200 milligrams of potassium,
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.680]   and 60 milligrams of magnesium.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.040]   If you'd like to try Element, you can go to Drink Element,
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.760]   that's lmnt.com/huberman
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.160]   to claim a free Element sample pack with your purchase.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:33.960]   Again, that's drinkelementlmnt.com/huberman

[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.720]   Today's episode is brought to us by Helix Sleep.
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.000]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:41.560]   that are absolutely phenomenal.
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.200]   I've been sleeping on a Helix mattress
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.600]   for close to two years now,
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:47.020]   and it's the best sleep that I've ever had.
[00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:50.580]   One of the reasons is the mattress is customized to you.
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.400]   So you simply go to the Helix site,
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:54.260]   you take a brief two-minute quiz,
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.100]   it asks you questions like,
[00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:57.220]   do you tend to sleep on your back, your side, or your stomach
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.360]   or maybe all of those across the night,
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:00.440]   or maybe you don't know,
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:01.720]   do you tend to run hot during the night
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:03.440]   or cold during the night, or maybe you don't know,
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:06.200]   and they match you to the ideal mattress for you.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.680]   For me, it was the Dusk DUSK mattress
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.880]   that allowed me to achieve the best sleep of my life.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.500]   If you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.800]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.500]   take their brief two-minute sleep quiz,
[00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:19.400]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:20.300]   for your sleep needs,
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:23.160]   and you'll get up to $200 off all mattress orders
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:24.660]   and two free pillows.
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.640]   They have a 10-year warranty on their mattresses,
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.320]   and you get to try it out for a hundred nights risk-free.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.260]   They'll even pick it up for you
[00:15:30.260 --> 00:15:31.640]   if you don't love the mattress,
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.320]   although I think you absolutely will.
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.500]   Again, if you're interested,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:36.620]   you can go to helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.320]   to get up to $200 off and two free pillows.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.340]   Let's talk about supplements and supplementation
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.060]   and how to develop a rational supplementation regimen.
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:46.700]   One of the things that's really emerged
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.800]   over the last 20 years is that supplements,
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.280]   and there I'm referring to non-prescription compounds
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:55.620]   designed to augment nutrition, prescription drugs,
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:57.120]   and behavioral protocols,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.720]   have emerged as a mainstay within the health and wellness,
[00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:05.020]   but also the medical communities
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:07.040]   that are focused on developing mental health,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.680]   physical health, and performance for their patients
[00:16:09.680 --> 00:16:10.940]   and their athletes.
[00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.600]   And for the everyday person.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.360]   Essentially what I'm saying is that 20 years ago,
[00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:18.160]   a discussion about supplements would mainly take place
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:20.680]   within the niche communities of health food stores
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.560]   or of particular athletes.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:25.240]   But nowadays, I think almost everyone is familiar
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:26.800]   with the fact that yes, indeed,
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.680]   there are standard vitamin supplements,
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.800]   but that there are also supplements such as vitamin D3,
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.040]   which are designed to make sure that people have
[00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:37.340]   certain amounts of hormones in their bloodstream
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:39.160]   because they might not be getting enough sunshine.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.940]   Although I'll be very clear over and over
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.000]   throughout this episode
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:44.720]   that there is no pill replacement for sunshine,
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.540]   nor is there a pill replacement
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.000]   or food replacement for that matter for exercise
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.760]   or for social connection or for sleep
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.000]   or for simply getting smarter.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.600]   Again, there is no pill that's going to replace
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.940]   excellent behavioral protocols.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.260]   In fact, a physician friend of mine has a great saying
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:02.820]   that I think everybody should keep in mind
[00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:04.700]   as we wade into this conversation,
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:07.340]   which is that better living through chemistry
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.740]   still requires better living.
[00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:12.320]   And I think that's a very important phrase to keep in mind
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.420]   when thinking about the optimal supplementation
[00:17:14.420 --> 00:17:17.080]   or prescription drug protocol for you.
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:19.660]   So what is an ideal supplementation protocol?
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:22.620]   Well, I think what we need to do is to take a step back
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.700]   and ask what are different supplements designed to do?
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.600]   For instance, there are foundational supplements.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:31.420]   These are supplements that are designed
[00:17:31.420 --> 00:17:34.620]   to establish a foundation or provide insurance
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:37.160]   along with your nutritional intake
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:40.180]   to ensure that you're getting all the things that you need
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:43.220]   in order to have a basic level of mental health,
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.740]   physical health, and opportunity for optimal performance.
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:49.940]   Now, this is the one category of supplements
[00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:54.940]   for which I think it's appropriate and in fact advantageous
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:58.180]   to have multiple ingredients in a given supplement.
[00:17:58.180 --> 00:17:59.620]   Throughout the rest of today's discussion,
[00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:03.120]   I'm going to talk about the advantage of mainly focusing
[00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.580]   on taking single ingredient formulations
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.300]   for a variety of reasons.
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.000]   But when it comes to foundational supplements,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.220]   what we're mainly talking about are supplements
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.240]   that contain vitamins and minerals
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.560]   that are designed to compensate for any deficiencies
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:21.580]   you might have from diet or from lack of adequate diet.
[00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:26.000]   How would such a lack of vitamin and mineral intake arise?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:26.840]   Well, for instance,
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:29.060]   if you're somebody that practices intermittent fasting
[00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:30.980]   or other components of fasting,
[00:18:30.980 --> 00:18:34.860]   or if you're somebody who does not get enough vitamins
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:39.860]   and minerals from vegetables and fruits and grains and meats,
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:44.800]   well, then taking a supplement that can act
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:47.420]   as an insurance policy against any vitamin
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.260]   and mineral deficiencies in many ways can be advantageous.
[00:18:50.260 --> 00:18:53.560]   Although I will talk about some of the safety concerns
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:54.780]   in just a few minutes.
[00:18:54.780 --> 00:18:56.540]   Now, I want to acknowledge that as soon as we talk
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:59.100]   about vitamin mineral supplements,
[00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:01.420]   the skeptics immediately raise their hands and say,
[00:19:01.420 --> 00:19:03.680]   well, all that vitamin and mineral supplements do
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.220]   is give you very expensive urine.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.900]   And there, the skeptics are referring to the fact,
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.800]   the reality that when you ingest high levels
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:12.300]   of water soluble vitamins,
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:14.700]   so think vitamin C and some of the other vitamins,
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:17.580]   that indeed you will excrete them in your urine.
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:22.020]   However, it's also the case that many people
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:24.820]   are not getting enough of the water soluble vitamins
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:25.860]   from their foods.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:28.280]   And it's also the case that many people are.
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:30.820]   And it's also the case that ingesting higher
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:34.360]   than needed amounts of most water soluble vitamins,
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.640]   provided those levels aren't exceedingly high is,
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.160]   or at least we should say can be safe.
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:43.900]   And again, this is provided that the levels
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:46.020]   that they're ingesting are not exceedingly high.
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:47.640]   So the typical vitamin mineral supplement
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:50.460]   is indeed going to cover any gaps or deficiencies
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:52.660]   that might arise in the water soluble vitamins
[00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:53.960]   from your food intake.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.900]   But the reality is that most people are getting enough
[00:19:56.900 --> 00:19:59.100]   of the water soluble vitamins from their food.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:02.540]   If they are paying attention to a couple of things.
[00:20:02.540 --> 00:20:04.720]   And those things are very simple to lay out,
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:06.980]   regardless of whether or not you're a vegan,
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:10.060]   a vegetarian, a more traditional omnivore,
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:13.260]   eating from both animal-based and plant-based sources,
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:14.400]   grains, et cetera.
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:18.220]   Or even if you're in the pure carnivore or strict,
[00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:19.580]   I guess it's called the lion diet
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:21.500]   where it's just meat and salt.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:24.180]   Regardless of what type of nutrition you follow,
[00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:26.240]   you will get vitamins and minerals,
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.060]   but you'll get more or fewer of them
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.300]   depending on the nutritional program you follow.
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:33.540]   And of course, depending on how often and how much you eat.
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:34.980]   That's just sort of obvious.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:39.500]   Most people who take a vitamin mineral supplement
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.300]   will indeed excrete a lot of the water soluble vitamins.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:46.420]   They will retain the fat soluble vitamins.
[00:20:46.420 --> 00:20:48.540]   And there again, the skeptics will raise their hands
[00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:51.340]   and say, you do not want to take high levels
[00:20:51.340 --> 00:20:52.500]   of fat soluble vitamins
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.240]   because they will be stored in your system,
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.300]   potentially to levels that are dangerous.
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.660]   Again, provided that vitamin mineral supplements
[00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:00.580]   are not taken in excess,
[00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:03.480]   it's unlikely that you're going to have such a buildup
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.300]   of the fat soluble vitamins in your system
[00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:07.000]   that they're going to be a problem.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.060]   So that raises a very specific question that you need to ask.
[00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:12.020]   Do you want to take a vitamin mineral supplement?
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:13.900]   Well, the answer to that will be highly individual,
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:15.580]   but you really just need to address two things.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:19.060]   First of all, is the cost within the range
[00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.420]   that you can afford and want to pay, right?
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:24.140]   Oftentimes these vitamin mineral supplements
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.860]   can be quite inexpensive,
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.780]   but some of them can be quite expensive.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.620]   And you can see the full range of ones
[00:21:30.620 --> 00:21:32.460]   that are pennies per day,
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:35.920]   all the way up to many dollars or tens of dollars per day
[00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:38.620]   because of what are reported to be variations
[00:21:38.620 --> 00:21:40.840]   in quality and sourcing and so forth.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.760]   I'm not aware of any real differences
[00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.980]   between the quality of the water soluble
[00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:48.220]   and fat soluble vitamins found in the less expensive
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.100]   versus the more expensive vitamin mineral supplements.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.920]   More typically the cost scales with the dosages
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:57.100]   of these different vitamins and minerals.
[00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.160]   And as could probably be expected,
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:05.160]   the more expensive to obtain and source vitamins and minerals
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:08.420]   tend to be in lower quantities
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.020]   in the less expensive versions
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.160]   of vitamin mineral supplements.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.000]   That's just kind of obvious.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.540]   So you need to ask yourself, can you afford it financially?
[00:22:14.540 --> 00:22:16.040]   And then you need to ask yourself,
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:19.320]   are you able to regularly ingest enough foods
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.100]   with enough variety to cover your vitamin mineral needs
[00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.500]   just from food?
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.900]   And for some people,
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:28.860]   the answer is going to be an immediate yes.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.020]   They are careful to get enough of the foods
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:34.740]   that allow them to obtain their vitamin and mineral quota.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.060]   And for other individuals, the answer will be no.
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:39.460]   I would say for people that are extremely physically
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.180]   and or mentally active,
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:43.820]   and for people that perhaps are following
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.300]   a intermittent fasting schedule
[00:22:45.300 --> 00:22:48.760]   so they are not ingesting a lot of food in general
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:51.760]   or restricting their food intake to specific times of day,
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.460]   well then a vitamin mineral supplement
[00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:54.860]   likely makes sense for them.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:56.580]   However, it's going to be very important
[00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:59.920]   to ingest that vitamin mineral supplement with food
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.580]   and ideally early in the day.
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:03.120]   So that can set up a little bit of a challenge
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:04.260]   for the intermittent fasteners
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:06.240]   who are restricting their feeding window to late in the day.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:07.340]   Why do I say this?
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:09.100]   Well, many of the water soluble vitamins,
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.620]   in particular the B vitamins need to be ingested with food
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:15.180]   because otherwise they can cause some stomach upset.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.340]   And again, there's a range there.
[00:23:16.340 --> 00:23:18.220]   Some people like myself can take B vitamins
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.820]   on an empty stomach and feel fine.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.420]   Other people feel really lousy when they take B vitamins.
[00:23:22.420 --> 00:23:24.760]   There are a few other things that we'll talk about later,
[00:23:24.760 --> 00:23:27.700]   namely zinc and coenzyme Q10
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:29.880]   that really should also be taken with food.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:32.580]   But the best time to take a vitamin mineral supplement
[00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:33.880]   is with food.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:35.760]   And I believe that if you're going to take
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.160]   a vitamin mineral supplement,
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.940]   that you want to take it with food
[00:23:39.940 --> 00:23:42.620]   and you don't want to take dosages of vitamins and minerals
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:45.340]   from supplements that are exceedingly high
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:46.640]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.820]   One is the buildup of fat soluble vitamins
[00:23:48.820 --> 00:23:50.000]   that we talked about before.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.180]   The other reason is that when people tend to take
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.500]   very high levels of vitamins and minerals from supplements,
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.820]   they tend to spend less time and focus
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.100]   on making sure that they're optimizing their nutrition
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.020]   or at least trying to get their nutrition right.
[00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:05.780]   What do I mean by getting their nutrition right?
[00:24:05.780 --> 00:24:07.980]   Well, I think regardless of whether or not
[00:24:07.980 --> 00:24:12.160]   your keto, omnivore, carnivore, vegan,
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.660]   or any other nutritional plan,
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.780]   the key thing is to get most,
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.900]   that is about 75 to 80% of your foods or more
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.640]   from non-processed or minimally processed sources.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.700]   I think there is agreement across the board
[00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:30.920]   that most people should avoid highly processed foods.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.980]   Highly processed foods are going to be foods
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:35.260]   with very long ingredient lists
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:36.860]   that have very long shelf lives.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:39.340]   So this often includes snack foods.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:42.380]   It does include snack foods like chips, et cetera,
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.060]   pastries that could sit on the shelf a long time.
[00:24:45.060 --> 00:24:47.100]   But it also includes things like canned soups
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.020]   and number of different other foods
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.980]   that have many, many ingredients preservatives.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:53.300]   Most people would do well to avoid those kinds of foods
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.300]   and focus most of their intake
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.380]   on things that are non-processed.
[00:24:57.380 --> 00:24:59.260]   So these would be things like fruits and vegetables.
[00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:00.620]   You'll notice that the non-processed foods
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.920]   will tend to have very short shelf life
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:05.040]   or require refrigeration in some cases,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.360]   such as meat, eggs, et cetera,
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.200]   or minimally processed foods,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.100]   such as rice and oatmeal and pastas,
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:13.660]   beans and things of that sort.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.960]   Beans oftentimes can be completely unprocessed as well,
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:16.800]   of course.
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:17.700]   This is two general categories,
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:19.500]   unprocessed and minimally processed
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:22.600]   that should make up about 80% or more of your food intake
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.100]   if your goal is health and obtaining adequate amounts
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:26.380]   of vitamins and minerals.
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:27.900]   The so-called foundational supplements
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:30.780]   include of course, vitamin and mineral supplements,
[00:25:30.780 --> 00:25:34.060]   but has expanded over the last decade or more
[00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.820]   to also include supplements that have vitamins and minerals,
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.380]   but also things like digestive enzymes.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:43.280]   And again, here we have an example where indeed
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:46.500]   you can get digestive enzymes from foods.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.580]   For instance, eating a bit of papaya
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:51.860]   or even a little bit of pineapple can assist
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.460]   in the digestion of certain aspects of macronutrients
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.100]   because these are naturally occurring enzymes
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:25:59.780]   that help digest things like carbohydrates, fats,
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:01.320]   and proteins.
[00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.500]   And there are other food-based sources of enzymes.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.340]   You're welcome to look those up online
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:07.380]   if you just put food-based sources of enzymes
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:08.680]   and you'll find those.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:11.920]   But nowadays, a lot of the foundational supplements
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   will include papain or they will include different lipases
[00:26:17.060 --> 00:26:19.460]   or anytime you hear the word ACE, by the way,
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:21.460]   it means an enzyme.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.060]   An enzyme is designed to break down
[00:26:23.060 --> 00:26:25.660]   or to catalyze some sort of reaction
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.900]   in biology and in nutrition in particular.
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.200]   So you can find foundational supplements
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:32.660]   that include vitamins and minerals and digestive enzymes.
[00:26:32.660 --> 00:26:34.940]   And nowadays more and more,
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.500]   the quality foundational supplements
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.180]   are also including things like adaptogens.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.220]   And here the name adaptogens is sort of vague
[00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:46.600]   and it indeed has no specific operational definition.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   This is something really important to understand
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:52.460]   about supplementation is that companies and indeed podcasts
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:54.820]   can talk about adaptogens without actually defining
[00:26:54.820 --> 00:26:58.080]   what an adaptogen is in an operational way.
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.640]   When we say operational, what we mean is a definition
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.400]   that everyone in a given arena or space,
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.540]   research for instance, can agree on
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:09.160]   so that when we talk about the adaptogenic effects
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.300]   of a given compound, we're all talking about the same things.
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:14.260]   Well, foundational supplements nowadays include vitamins,
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:17.260]   minerals, digestive enzymes, and the so-called adaptogens.
[00:27:17.260 --> 00:27:20.120]   And the adaptogens broadly speaking
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:23.420]   are thought to improve the body and brain's ability
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:25.720]   to buffer against various stressors.
[00:27:25.720 --> 00:27:28.380]   So these could be things like herbs, like ashwagandha
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:30.660]   that are designed to reduce cortisol levels.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.300]   In that sense, ashwagandha is an adaptogen,
[00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:34.820]   but ashwagandha has other effects
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:36.940]   related to hormone augmentation
[00:27:36.940 --> 00:27:38.680]   in both the testosterone and estrogen
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:40.060]   and maybe even the thyroid pathways.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.120]   We'll talk about this a little bit later
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.560]   when we talk about supplements for hormone augmentation.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.240]   So foundational supplements has really expanded
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.340]   to include a lot of different categories
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.260]   of nutrients and micronutrients,
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.860]   vitamins and minerals, digestive enzymes,
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.040]   designed to achieve a broad spectrum of effects.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:58.920]   Again, this is the one category of supplementation
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.680]   where I think it makes sense
[00:28:00.680 --> 00:28:04.360]   to explore multi-ingredient formulations.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.700]   And the other thing that's often included
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.480]   in these so-called foundational supplements
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.120]   are probiotics or prebiotics,
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.580]   which are designed to augment
[00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:17.240]   and support the so-called gut microbiome.
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:19.280]   The gut microbiome is the collection
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:21.280]   of trillions of little micro bacteria
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:22.980]   that exist in all of us.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:27.040]   They mainly exist in the mucus membrane
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.860]   lined tissues of the body.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.120]   So that would be your nasal passages, your mouth,
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:35.520]   the vagina, the urethra, and the gut,
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:37.120]   the whole way from your mouth
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.440]   all the way out the other end.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:39.960]   So not just your stomach.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.860]   Trillions of bacteria live there.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.640]   Trillions of micro bacteria also live on your skin.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:47.040]   In fact, every time you shake someone's hand,
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.320]   you are exchanging micro bacteria.
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.260]   These micro bacteria often are healthy for us, good for us.
[00:28:53.260 --> 00:28:56.640]   They support a huge number of positive biological functions,
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.120]   but there are other micro bacteria that live in our gut
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.820]   and elsewhere on those mucus line tissues
[00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:04.160]   that can be disadvantageous for us,
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.960]   that can harm our health.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.280]   A growing idea these days
[00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.680]   based on a number of different laboratories work,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.580]   including the laboratory of my upstairs neighbor at Stanford,
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:16.300]   Dr. Justin Sonnenberg, who's been a guest on this podcast,
[00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.260]   is that having a great diversity, a range of microbiota,
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.540]   as they're called, microbiome, microbiota,
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:25.260]   and these micro bacteria
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.720]   are all essentially referring to the same thing.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.160]   The microbiome is the whole collection
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:30.400]   of these micro bacteria,
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:32.620]   but having a lot of different so-called species
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:35.860]   of these micro bacteria is known to be advantageous
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.740]   for immune system function, hormone function.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.620]   It supports the so-called gut-brain axis
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.500]   that's important for a number of things,
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:44.980]   including mood and motivation.
[00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:47.360]   It actually supports the production of neurotransmitters
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.880]   in the brain and body that can help keep you motivated,
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:53.880]   elevated mood, support the general function of neurons.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:55.960]   Well, not surprisingly,
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:58.920]   there are ways to support the gut microbiome
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.600]   and there are ways to harm the gut microbiome.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.460]   I'll refer to the podcast episode we did
[00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.960]   with Justin Sonnenberg.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.400]   You can find that at HubermanLab.com
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.620]   if you want to learn all the different ways
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:09.440]   that you can support your gut microbiome,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:11.080]   but for sake of today's discussion,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.560]   I want to emphasize that some of those methods
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:15.320]   of supporting the gut microbiome
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.360]   are through the direct consumption of particular foods.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.580]   And there are two categories of foods
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.540]   that if you're getting enough of them,
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.700]   it's likely that your gut microbiome is diverse
[00:30:26.700 --> 00:30:28.800]   and is going to support all those important functions
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:31.640]   I just listed off and other functions as well.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:35.420]   The two sources of gut microbiota supporting foods
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:37.360]   are low sugar fermented foods.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:39.420]   So these would be things like sauerkraut,
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:44.020]   kimchi, Greek yogurt, again, low sugar, Greek yogurt,
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:50.560]   kombucha in particular as a drink, things like kefir.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:54.220]   There are a bunch of other varieties of fermented foods,
[00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.960]   different cultures have different fermented foods.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:31:00.720]   So the Japanese natto is another source of ferment
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.200]   that is very good for the gut microbiome
[00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:05.540]   and work from Justin Sonnenberg's lab
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.200]   and close by labs at Stanford School of Medicine
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:13.140]   have shown that if people ingest four servings a day
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.780]   of these low sugar fermented foods,
[00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.440]   it greatly improves the function of the gut microbiome
[00:31:18.440 --> 00:31:20.880]   and in particular enhances the function
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.060]   of the immune system and it reduces
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:24.400]   the so-called inflammatome.
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.320]   It reduces inflammation in the brain and body
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:30.320]   in the ways that are helpful and effective for brain and body
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.240]   that is mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.480]   So there are ways to support your gut microbiome
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:38.240]   strictly from food, but it should come as no surprise
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:41.840]   that most people are not ingesting four servings a day
[00:31:41.840 --> 00:31:44.200]   of fermented foods.
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:46.880]   Hopefully they're getting enough fiber,
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.520]   especially prebiotic fiber,
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.200]   which is one other way to support the gut microbiome.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:53.460]   Although the studies from Justin Sonnenberg's lab
[00:31:53.460 --> 00:31:56.960]   point to the fact that fiber intake itself
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:31:59.640]   was not directly supportive of the gut microbiome
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:01.940]   in everybody, it was in some individuals,
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:04.240]   but not in others and some had no effect
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.000]   and in other individuals, it actually made the category
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.720]   or I should say the array of inflammatome markers worse.
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:14.440]   It actually led to more inflammation.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.240]   So that is not to say that fiber is bad.
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:19.480]   In fact, in the episode that we did with Dr. Lane Norton,
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.120]   he discussed the many benefits of getting enough fiber.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.080]   There are a lot of reasons why people should get enough fiber
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.300]   in their diet, but at least for supporting
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:30.700]   the gut microbiome, four servings a day
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.080]   of low sugar fermented foods seems to be the best way
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.080]   to support the gut microbiome
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   through the intake of nutrition.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.940]   Again, most people are not achieving that
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:42.360]   and therefore these foundational supplements
[00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.660]   that can be just vitamin and mineral supplements
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:47.200]   or it could be vitamin and mineral supplements
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:50.560]   plus digestive enzymes or both of those things
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.880]   plus adaptogens now also tend to include prebiotics
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.960]   and probiotics that are designed to support
[00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:02.280]   the proliferation and maintenance of enough gut microbiota
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.840]   in order to support the gut microbiome
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.380]   and the gut brain axis.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:08.360]   Now, because of the importance of the gut microbiome
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:10.720]   and because most people are not getting enough support
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.520]   for the gut microbiome in the form
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:14.040]   of low sugar fermented foods
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:17.040]   and prebiotic fiber from their diet,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.400]   I think perhaps one of the most essential
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.880]   foundational supplements irrespective of whether or not
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:26.840]   it includes vitamins and minerals, adaptogens
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:29.000]   and digestive enzymes is some way
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.420]   to support the gut microbiome.
[00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:35.260]   Now, this gets into a whole dimension of categories
[00:33:35.260 --> 00:33:37.520]   of prebiotic and probiotic capsules
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.260]   and one needs to be very careful there.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:42.140]   I do want to say that most of the prebiotic
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.200]   and probiotic capsules that you can buy,
[00:33:44.200 --> 00:33:46.060]   first of all, are very expensive.
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:48.900]   The best ones are going to be refrigerated
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:52.800]   or require refrigeration just as do any good
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:54.920]   low sugar fermented foods, by the way.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:57.280]   So for instance, pickles are a low sugar fermented food
[00:33:57.280 --> 00:33:58.780]   that can support the gut microbiome.
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:00.360]   But if you're buying pickles from the section
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.260]   of the grocery store where the pickles
[00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:05.860]   are not refrigerated, well, then you're not going
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:08.360]   to get the gut microbiome supporting effects
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.560]   from those pickles.
[00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.260]   It's sort of funny we're even having this conversation
[00:34:11.260 --> 00:34:12.600]   talking about pickles, but the reality
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:16.100]   is they can greatly enhance the microbiota
[00:34:16.100 --> 00:34:19.120]   if you are getting the pickles that are
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:21.600]   and require refrigeration and include the brine,
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:23.780]   which is the liquid around them.
[00:34:23.780 --> 00:34:25.080]   The same is true for sauerkraut.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.480]   Non-refrigerated sauerkraut is not going
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.980]   to support your gut microbiome.
[00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:31.420]   It will supply some other things perhaps,
[00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:32.980]   but it's not going to support your gut microbiome.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:34.500]   It has to be the refrigerated versions.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:36.500]   For the reason that most people are not getting enough
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.820]   food-based support for the gut microbiome
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.940]   and because of the importance of the gut microbiome,
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.480]   one of the key categories of foundational supplements
[00:34:43.480 --> 00:34:47.080]   are supplements that create support for the microbiome
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.180]   through prebiotics or probiotics.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.760]   Again, they tend to be the refrigerated varieties
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:53.220]   are the ones that are actually going to work.
[00:34:53.220 --> 00:34:56.360]   Those also tend to be very expensive.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.680]   And there are some evidence that taking excessive amounts
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.360]   of prebiotics and probiotics that is typical
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:06.820]   of these capsule forms of prebiotics and probiotics,
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:09.440]   if they're taken ongoing, not for short periods of time,
[00:35:09.440 --> 00:35:10.800]   but if they're taken ongoing,
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:13.200]   can lead to some issues like brain fog.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.880]   There's a nice literature on this
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:16.680]   and a growing one at that.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.960]   So my suggestion is that if people are going to take
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:22.260]   supplements to support the microbiome,
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:26.160]   that those supplements include low enough levels.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.880]   That is small enough amounts of prebiotics and probiotics
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.660]   that you don't start to venture into the realm of brain fog
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:35.760]   and some of the other issues that could be associated
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.560]   with taking too much prebiotic and probiotic
[00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:39.920]   in the form of supplements.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.560]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.680]   and thank our sponsor, InsideTracker.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.140]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.660]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:51.300]   to help you better understand your body
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.140]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:35:53.140 --> 00:35:55.800]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:58.220]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:00.240]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.820]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:04.880]   The problem with a lot of blood and DNA tests out there,
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.440]   however, is that you get data back about metabolic factors,
[00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:09.960]   lipids and hormones and so forth,
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:11.720]   but you don't know what to do with those data.
[00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:13.480]   InsideTracker solves that problem
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.820]   and makes it very easy for you to understand
[00:36:15.820 --> 00:36:18.840]   what sorts of nutritional, behavioral,
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.680]   maybe even supplementation-based interventions
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.280]   you might want to take on in order to adjust the numbers
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:26.400]   of those metabolic factors, hormones, lipids,
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.080]   and other things that impact your immediate
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.400]   and long-term health to bring those numbers
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.200]   into the ranges that are appropriate
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:34.060]   and indeed optimal for you.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:35.440]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:38.000]   you can visit insidetracker.com/huberman

[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.320]   The other category of foundational supplements
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:48.840]   are those adaptogens that we mentioned earlier.
[00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.760]   Adaptogens, again, being a very poorly defined category,
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:57.760]   but these are typically micronutrients, herbs.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:36:59.760]   Sometimes they go into the mushroom category.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.580]   Again, these are non psychedelic mushrooms
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.740]   that provide either some buffering to the stress system
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.260]   by reducing cortisol typically,
[00:37:08.260 --> 00:37:12.220]   or that are thought to or known to based on research studies
[00:37:12.220 --> 00:37:14.560]   to enhance things like blood flow to the brain
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.940]   or to enhance some aspect of cognitive function
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:19.720]   by way of enhancing neurotransmitter function.
[00:37:19.720 --> 00:37:22.040]   This category of so-called adaptogens
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:22.960]   is an important one.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.740]   We'll get back to this a little bit later.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.320]   The reason I mention it now is that it is indeed hard
[00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:31.280]   to get the so-called adaptogens in sufficient concentrations
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:33.720]   from food-based sources.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.400]   I have to assume that most people aren't out there
[00:37:35.400 --> 00:37:38.080]   collecting chaga mushroom or the ashwagandha herbs
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.960]   and then combining them with their salads or their foods.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.800]   And so that's why this adaptogen category
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.400]   fits into foundational.
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:47.920]   Now, this opens up the category of foundational supplements
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.160]   that are broad spectrum.
[00:37:49.160 --> 00:37:51.520]   That is that include vitamins and minerals
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.400]   that have digestive enzymes that have adaptogens
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.060]   and that also have prebiotics and probiotics
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:37:58.840]   at the appropriate dosages.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.140]   This is one reason why I'm a big fan of supplements
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:04.000]   like Athletic Greens, which is, as many of you know,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.460]   a sponsor of this podcast and does really nicely cover
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.000]   all of these categories of foundational nutrition.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.780]   But I do want to emphasize that this is not a way
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:15.400]   to focus on Athletic Greens specifically.
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:18.000]   There are other categories and brands
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.860]   of excellent foundational nutritional supplements
[00:38:20.860 --> 00:38:23.900]   that cover these categories of vitamins and minerals,
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:28.160]   probiotics, prebiotics, digestive enzymes, and adaptogens.
[00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.940]   It just so happens that Athletic Greens is the one
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:32.660]   that I discovered and that works best for me
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:35.180]   and that many people find works really well for them.
[00:38:35.180 --> 00:38:38.420]   So this is why when people approach me and they ask me,
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.740]   as they often do, very, very often do, I should say,
[00:38:41.740 --> 00:38:43.260]   if I'm only going to take one supplement,
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.840]   what supplement should I take?
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.420]   Rather than just give them one specific answer,
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.260]   I actually ask them three questions.
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:51.060]   First question I ask them is,
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.700]   how well are you sleeping at night?
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.620]   Are you getting enough sleep?
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:55.340]   Are you waking up feeling rested?
[00:38:55.340 --> 00:38:56.820]   Because if they're not,
[00:38:56.820 --> 00:38:59.980]   that opens up a whole different set of interactions
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:01.700]   that we need to have and discussions around
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.980]   what sorts of things they need to do and possibly take
[00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:06.180]   in order to get their sleep right,
[00:39:06.180 --> 00:39:08.060]   because sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:09.540]   physical health, and performance.
[00:39:09.540 --> 00:39:11.340]   We will have that discussion a little bit later
[00:39:11.340 --> 00:39:13.020]   in this episode.
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:17.020]   The second question I ask them is, how's your nutrition?
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.140]   That is, are you eating regularly?
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:23.220]   Have you found the combination of macronutrients
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:25.020]   or which diet is right for you?
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:27.000]   Do you think you're getting enough vitamins and minerals?
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.260]   How's your digestion?
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:29.860]   We have that conversation.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:31.780]   And then the third thing that I ask,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:36.020]   which is extremely important, is what's your budget?
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:38.540]   Because if somebody has $10 a month total
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.340]   to spend on supplements versus $1,000 a month
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:43.100]   to spend on supplements total,
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:45.900]   well, then there's a different set of conversations
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.220]   to be had as to which supplements they should take.
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.860]   Now, once those three questions have been answered,
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:56.260]   assuming that somebody is able to spend about $100
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:59.140]   or more on supplements per month,
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.180]   then my recommendation is that they not focus
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:04.860]   on any specific supplements directed towards sleep
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.100]   or toward focus or hormone augmentation,
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:09.260]   but rather that they focus on buffering
[00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:13.060]   and enhancing their foundational nutrition, adaptogens,
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:16.220]   probiotics, prebiotics, and digestive enzymes,
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:18.580]   because of the simple fact that if they do that,
[00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:22.100]   they're going to raise the tide on all the biological
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:23.480]   and organ systems that are going to lead
[00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:25.060]   to enhanced mental health, physical health,
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:27.140]   and performance, including sleep.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.900]   So this is one reason why if people say,
[00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.220]   well, if I can only take one supplement, what should I take?
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:33.660]   I say, well, what's your budget?
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:36.820]   If they say they can meet that $100 threshold per month,
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:38.940]   then my recommendation would be athletic greens
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:40.740]   or something like it,
[00:40:40.740 --> 00:40:43.300]   or that they invest the time and energy to go find
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.820]   the various combinations of vitamins and minerals
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:50.040]   and probiotics and prebiotics and adaptogens and so forth
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:54.180]   in individual components that they can then take
[00:40:54.180 --> 00:40:57.040]   in combination in order to meet their foundational needs.
[00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:59.740]   But most people are not interested in doing all that homework
[00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:02.860]   and legwork to figure out exactly what those dosages are.
[00:41:02.860 --> 00:41:05.740]   That's one reason why indeed I have taken athletic greens
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:07.900]   since 2012, I like it, it makes me feel better,
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.240]   I have more energy, I sleep better,
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.520]   my digestion is certainly better,
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:11.780]   and it supports the gut microbiome.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:14.400]   I do that for that reason, but again,
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.100]   I want to emphasize that there are other great sources
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:20.860]   of all the relevant things within those foundational formulas
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:22.240]   that athletic greens contains.
[00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:24.120]   So it's certainly not the only route
[00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.300]   to covering your foundational health needs.
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:28.780]   There are other ways to do that.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.660]   Now, if somebody has a budget lower than $100 per month
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.260]   to spend on foundational supplementation,
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.440]   well then there are a couple of discussions to be had.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:39.420]   Now, if the amount of money that they have to devote
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.380]   to foundational supplementation is zero,
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:43.620]   of course, respect that,
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.340]   and then it becomes a discussion about what sorts of foods
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:50.380]   and patterns of food intake are going to best support
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.960]   their mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.060]   Now, if somebody has somewhere between $0 and $50
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.560]   to spend on supplementation for sake of this thing
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:02.860]   we're calling foundational health per month,
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.920]   well then a different category of supplement discussion
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.740]   arises and we'll have that in a moment.
[00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:09.700]   But to sort of close the conversation
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:12.300]   on foundational supplementation,
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.660]   again, that means many different things.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:15.960]   It's vitamins and minerals.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.640]   Sometimes that's one vitamin and mineral supplement.
[00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:21.020]   It means digestive enzymes.
[00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:22.480]   That could be its own supplement
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:24.300]   or in combination with vitamins and minerals.
[00:42:24.300 --> 00:42:27.720]   It means often not always adaptogens,
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:28.860]   things like ashwagandha,
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:32.560]   different plant-based and mushroom-based formulations
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.800]   that can buffer stress
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:36.540]   and provide other brain and body support.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.320]   And it often, although not always,
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:43.020]   but should I believe include the probiotics and prebiotics
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:45.960]   or anything that supports healthy gut microbiome.
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:49.840]   Once again, I think a broad spectrum supplement
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:52.480]   that has many, many ingredients of high quality
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.140]   that covers all these bases is going to be the best route
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:59.500]   to ensuring foundational supplementation is covered.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:02.860]   And I do think that should be the starting place
[00:43:02.860 --> 00:43:06.740]   for any and all supplementation regimens.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:07.580]   I'll say that once again,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:10.660]   I think covering your foundational needs
[00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:12.900]   in the realm of vitamins, minerals, probiotics,
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:16.700]   digestive enzymes, and adaptogens
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:20.820]   is going to give you the most benefit by cost
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:22.980]   and the most benefit across the board
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:24.580]   in terms of brain and body systems
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:27.100]   that's going to allow you to feel better overall,
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:30.060]   sleep better overall, focus better overall,
[00:43:30.060 --> 00:43:32.280]   and support all the different systems
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:33.300]   in your brain and body
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.660]   that are going to allow you to be at your best
[00:43:35.660 --> 00:43:38.820]   while of course also paying careful attention
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.640]   to your nutrition
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.660]   because you simply cannot abandon nutrition.
[00:43:42.660 --> 00:43:44.300]   Again, better living through chemistry
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:46.040]   still requires better living.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.540]   So now that we've had that discussion
[00:43:47.540 --> 00:43:49.940]   about foundational supplementation,
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:51.180]   and again, highlighting the fact
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.840]   that that's the one category of supplementation
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:58.100]   where multi-ingredient formulations make the most sense,
[00:43:58.100 --> 00:44:00.060]   I'd like to now shift our attention
[00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:02.880]   to single ingredient formulation supplements
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:05.800]   that are designed to achieve specific endpoints.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.780]   And here again,
[00:44:06.780 --> 00:44:10.680]   rather than focus on specific ingredients and supplements
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.400]   to achieve specific endpoints,
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.420]   because we've done that already in episodes
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.200]   related to sleep and focus, et cetera,
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.780]   I'd like to take a step back
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:21.940]   and focus on the larger theme of today's episode,
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:24.920]   which is how to think about supplementation
[00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.780]   in a rational, cost-effective,
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.700]   and biologically effective way
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:30.520]   for each of these categories.
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.700]   And the three categories that I'm going to cover
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.100]   are sleep, hormone support,
[00:44:36.100 --> 00:44:38.340]   and cognitive enhancement and focus,
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:39.460]   cognitive enhancement and focus
[00:44:39.460 --> 00:44:41.420]   being the final third category.
[00:44:41.420 --> 00:44:45.380]   Let's talk about sleep and the rational approach
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:47.680]   to thinking about supplementation for sleep.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:49.560]   As I mentioned earlier in this episode
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:52.580]   and on many previous episodes of this podcast,
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.140]   sleep is the foundation of mental health,
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:44:56.920]   physical health, and performance.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:59.980]   You might be somebody who can do an all-nighter
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:03.140]   and feel okay the next day, or maybe even great,
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:07.380]   but most everybody, once they start to have minimal sleep
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:10.520]   for one or two nights in the form of broken sleep,
[00:45:10.520 --> 00:45:12.020]   poor sleep, not enough sleep,
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:13.900]   or sleeping at the wrong time of night,
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:15.820]   there is such a thing, or day,
[00:45:15.820 --> 00:45:18.420]   they start to suffer.
[00:45:18.420 --> 00:45:19.980]   Their mood starts to suffer,
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:23.640]   their cognitive clarity and performance starts to suffer,
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.340]   their mental health can suffer severely,
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:27.300]   and physical performance definitely suffers,
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:29.720]   hormones suffer, everything suffers.
[00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:33.780]   Conversely, when people are sleeping well,
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.980]   that is deeply and enough,
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:37.780]   80% of the nights of their life,
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.100]   mental health, physical health,
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.600]   and performance all flourish,
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.220]   and I think most people start to be almost amazed
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:48.260]   at how well they're doing in various domains of life
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.400]   that previously they might've struggled with.
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.920]   So sleep is fundamental, that's established.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.940]   When thinking about supplementation for sleep,
[00:45:56.940 --> 00:45:59.580]   we need to ask ourselves a number of important questions.
[00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:02.020]   First of all, you should ask yourself
[00:46:02.020 --> 00:46:03.580]   how well that is, how deeply,
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:05.220]   and how much are you sleeping per night?
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:07.140]   Assuming you're somebody who can fall asleep easily,
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.720]   stay asleep through the night,
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:11.580]   wake up feeling relatively rested, maybe a little groggy,
[00:46:11.580 --> 00:46:13.220]   and then can move about your day
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:14.780]   with plenty of energy and focus,
[00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:16.900]   you're not falling asleep in class or at work
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:18.220]   or behind the wheel,
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:20.800]   whereas a passenger on public transportation,
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:23.780]   well, then you're probably getting enough sleep.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:25.700]   And by the way, it's perfectly normal
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:27.620]   to require anywhere from a 10 minute
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:30.000]   to a 90 minute nap in the afternoon for some people.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.860]   If you're not a napper, no big deal.
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:35.420]   It's known that naps can disrupt nighttime sleep,
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:37.980]   but provided that they're early enough in the day,
[00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:38.920]   if you take a nap
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:41.800]   and you are still able to fall asleep at night,
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.420]   then naps are fine for you.
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:44.940]   If you're somebody who doesn't like naps
[00:46:44.940 --> 00:46:46.820]   'cause you wake up groggy or grumpy,
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:51.440]   which often happens to certain people, then don't nap.
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:52.940]   You certainly do not need to nap.
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:54.920]   But if you're feeling energetic throughout the day,
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.620]   chances are you're getting enough sleep at night.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.660]   But there are people, of course,
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.880]   who are struggling with sleep,
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.380]   either falling asleep, staying asleep,
[00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.100]   or they're not feeling alert enough during the day
[00:47:03.100 --> 00:47:04.380]   or all of the above.
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:06.020]   And then it makes sense to step back
[00:47:06.020 --> 00:47:09.400]   and take a look at what supplementation can provide.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:12.520]   If you are one of those people who is not sleeping enough
[00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:13.620]   or well enough at night
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:16.440]   that you are suffering during the day in whatever way,
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:17.900]   mild to severe,
[00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:19.540]   there are two questions you should ask yourself.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.820]   First of all, are you ingesting caffeine after 2 p.m.?
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:25.320]   If the answer is yes, you want to limit
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:27.600]   or eliminate caffeine after 2 p.m.,
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:30.320]   maybe even push it back to noon or earlier.
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.500]   I know that can be excruciating for some folks,
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:34.800]   but it can really help with your ability
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.280]   to fall and stay asleep at night.
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:38.260]   The second thing is most people would do well
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.500]   to avoid food within the two hours prior to bedtime.
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.680]   But of course, you don't want to be so hungry
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.420]   that you can't fall asleep.
[00:47:46.420 --> 00:47:48.900]   So those are the nutrition and behavioral tools
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.280]   that everyone needs to consider.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:54.860]   If you are not ingesting caffeine 2 p.m. or onwards,
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:57.000]   and you are not eating excessively
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.240]   immediately prior to bedtime
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.040]   or within the two hours prior to bedtime,
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.360]   and you're not hungry when you go to sleep,
[00:48:02.360 --> 00:48:03.680]   well, then there are certain supplements
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:04.860]   that can support your sleep.
[00:48:04.860 --> 00:48:07.620]   And we've talked about these in the perfect sleep episode
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:10.000]   and in the episode with our guest expert,
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   Matt Walker from University of California, Berkeley,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.360]   and in the master of your sleep episode.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.040]   And we have a toolkit for sleep
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.960]   that you can access zero cost by going to herunelab.com
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.360]   and going to the menu, go to the newsletter,
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:20.660]   and you can find that toolkit.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:23.500]   You can sign up for other free toolkits like it.
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:26.700]   But the point here is not to go systematically
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.000]   through each of the supplements that is beneficial
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:30.880]   or has been shown to be beneficial for sleep,
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:33.940]   but rather to address specific aspects of sleep
[00:48:33.940 --> 00:48:37.440]   that can suffer and why and how certain patterns
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.320]   of supplementation can support
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.600]   or alleviate those pain points.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.580]   If, for instance, you're somebody who falls asleep just fine
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.320]   but wakes up in the middle of the night
[00:48:48.320 --> 00:48:50.580]   around two or three a.m. or any time for that matter
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:52.820]   and has trouble falling back asleep,
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.560]   there are two categories of supplements
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:56.400]   that you might want to consider.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.220]   The first is myoinositol,
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.200]   typically taken as 900 milligrams of myoinositol.
[00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:03.400]   Myoinositol can help shorten the amount of time
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.400]   that it takes to fall back asleep
[00:49:05.400 --> 00:49:07.160]   if you wake up in the middle of the night.
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:10.580]   Myoinositol has other beneficial uses as well
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.080]   for mood, et cetera.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.560]   If you'd like to see many of the different effects
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:16.360]   that have been explored in the scientific literature
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:18.660]   for myoinositol, you can go to examine.com.
[00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:21.400]   It's an excellent site, not just for inositol,
[00:49:21.400 --> 00:49:23.640]   but for all supplements for that matter.
[00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:25.680]   It talks about the human effect matrix,
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:27.040]   that is the different effects
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:29.520]   of different supplement compounds on different aspects
[00:49:29.520 --> 00:49:31.520]   of hormone, brain, and body health,
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.880]   where the evidence is strong, where the evidence is weak,
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.300]   has links to studies, and so on.
[00:49:35.300 --> 00:49:37.420]   Again, it's examine.com, amazing website,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.620]   wonderful website, provided such a rich resource for me
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.540]   and for many, many other people.
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.480]   Other people who wake up in the middle of the night
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:49.720]   will wake up because their dreams are very intense,
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:52.380]   or they were having dreams that were so vivid
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:54.720]   that suddenly they were jolted from their dreams.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:58.580]   Those people would do well to avoid certain supplements.
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:01.080]   So in a moment, I'll talk about the value of a supplement
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.720]   called theanine for falling asleep.
[00:50:03.720 --> 00:50:07.240]   But theanine, which typically is taken in dosages
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:10.760]   anywhere from 100 milligrams to 400 milligrams,
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:13.880]   depending on body weight and experience
[00:50:13.880 --> 00:50:16.040]   and what you find to be most effective for you,
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:17.420]   minimally effective for you.
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.360]   Well, theanine can be great for many people,
[00:50:19.360 --> 00:50:23.140]   but for people who have excessively vivid dreams,
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:26.640]   those excessively vivid dreams can lead to immediate waking
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.920]   and sometimes a little bit of anxiety upon waking
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:29.960]   in the middle of the night.
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:32.400]   So some people who wake up in the middle of the night
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.680]   sort of jolted mentally and physically out of sleep
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.140]   because of their intense dreams would do well
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:42.840]   to avoid theanine supplementation.
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.320]   I've talked about this a bit before,
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:47.400]   but it's something that I think a lot of nighttime
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:50.080]   middle of the night wakers might be familiar with
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:52.520]   and would want to take into consideration.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.060]   Now, for those of you that are not waking up
[00:50:54.060 --> 00:50:54.900]   in the middle of the night
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:56.840]   or not having excessively vivid dreams,
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:58.780]   but are having trouble falling asleep,
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.760]   two supplements in particular have been shown to be effective
[00:51:02.760 --> 00:51:04.840]   for shortening the transition time to sleep
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:08.360]   and allowing people to ease into sleep more readily.
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.640]   And those are magnesium threonate,
[00:51:10.640 --> 00:51:15.040]   which is interchangeable with magnesium bisglycinate.
[00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:17.640]   Magnesium bisglycinate and magnesium threonate
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.400]   both have transporter systems
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.800]   that allow them to readily cross the blood-brain barrier,
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.320]   and they lead to a mild form of drowsiness,
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:27.400]   mild in the sense that it's not going to prevent you
[00:51:27.400 --> 00:51:28.880]   from operating a motor vehicle
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:31.960]   or kind of any conditions under emergency
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:33.560]   that might arise in the middle of the night,
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:34.900]   or if they did arise during the middle of the night,
[00:51:34.900 --> 00:51:35.960]   you'd still be able to function,
[00:51:35.960 --> 00:51:37.560]   so it's not like a sleeping pill,
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.820]   but people who take those often find
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:42.300]   that their transition time into sleep is much faster
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:43.740]   and their sleep is also much deeper.
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:47.960]   Incidentally, those supplements are also thought to be useful
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:51.460]   for cognitive support and neuroprotection,
[00:51:51.460 --> 00:51:53.800]   although there's less data on that.
[00:51:53.800 --> 00:51:54.880]   Okay, so that's for falling asleep.
[00:51:54.880 --> 00:51:58.360]   That's one category, either magnesium threonate
[00:51:58.360 --> 00:52:00.320]   or bisglycinate would be interchangeable
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:02.600]   for assisting the transition time into sleep.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.260]   And then the other supplement is apigenin,
[00:52:05.260 --> 00:52:07.480]   A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin,
[00:52:07.480 --> 00:52:08.880]   which is a derivative chamomile.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:11.180]   I've talked about this in various podcasts before.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:15.620]   Also acts as a bit of a anxiety-lowering compound,
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:17.180]   which is essential prior to sleep
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:19.960]   for people to essentially turn off their thinking
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:21.920]   or to be able to reduce the amount of ruminating
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.960]   and problem solving and future anticipation
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:24.800]   that they're doing,
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:26.720]   which is a requirement for falling asleep.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.160]   So what's the rational approach to supplementing
[00:52:30.160 --> 00:52:33.120]   in a way that allows you to fall asleep more quickly
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:33.960]   and stay asleep?
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.240]   Well, would you immediately take magnesium threonate
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:38.520]   and apigenin together?
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.360]   Well, that depends.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.180]   If you have the budget
[00:52:40.180 --> 00:52:42.080]   and you just simply want to fall asleep quicker
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.800]   and you don't care which of those two ingredients
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:45.440]   is going to be more effective for you,
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.080]   well, then you could try one,
[00:52:47.080 --> 00:52:48.820]   for instance, magnesium threonate,
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.160]   and try it for perhaps a week
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.520]   and see how that affects your latency to sleep time.
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:55.040]   That is how quickly you fall asleep.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:56.960]   Or you could try apigenin in the first week,
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:52:58.480]   or you could combine them both,
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.160]   or you could try magnesium threonate for a week,
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:03.920]   then switch to only apigenin for a week
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:06.440]   and evaluate which one works better for you.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.440]   If neither works for you,
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.880]   I do recommend trying the combination together.
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:10.920]   Again, this is just the way
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:13.560]   that any scientist would design an experiment
[00:53:13.560 --> 00:53:15.960]   to try and understand which variables,
[00:53:15.960 --> 00:53:19.640]   that is, which ingredients are most effective
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:21.160]   for the result that you want,
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:23.800]   as opposed to just lumping them together and taking them.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:27.800]   That said, a lot of people want excellent sleep so badly
[00:53:27.800 --> 00:53:28.640]   that they just say,
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.200]   "Okay, I'm just going to take magnesium threonate,
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.300]   I'm going to take apigenin, I'm going to take theanine.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.400]   If my dreams are too vivid
[00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:34.880]   or I'm waking up in the middle of the night
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:37.800]   from excessively vivid dreams, I'll drop the theanine."
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:40.020]   And many people actually derive great benefit
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:41.080]   from that approach.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.360]   But because today we're talking about
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.760]   the most rational, cost-effective,
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:46.600]   and biologically effective approach to supplementation,
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:49.700]   if you're not sleeping as well as you would like to,
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.800]   or if you want to explore
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:54.080]   what sleeping even more deeply might do
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.760]   for your mental health, physical health, and performance,
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.480]   well, then it makes sense to think about
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.880]   the various supplements for falling asleep
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.480]   versus remaining asleep,
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:05.340]   what to include, what not to include,
[00:54:05.340 --> 00:54:06.680]   and to do that systematically.
[00:54:06.680 --> 00:54:09.560]   And again, I think one week's time of taking something,
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:14.000]   provided it doesn't induce any negative effects, right?
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.800]   If something induces a negative effect,
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.200]   I recommend ceasing taking it immediately.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.720]   But if something does not produce any negative effects,
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.480]   then I think you want to try a single ingredient formulation
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.560]   for about a week while not varying anything else,
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.260]   not changing anything else in your overall protocols
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:32.360]   of nutrition or supplementation.
[00:54:32.360 --> 00:54:34.900]   I mean, it's impossible to clamp everything perfectly
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:35.740]   from week to week,
[00:54:35.740 --> 00:54:37.900]   but don't change anything else dramatically
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.620]   and just add that supplement for a given week,
[00:54:40.620 --> 00:54:42.640]   see how it benefits your sleep,
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:45.120]   maybe add in a second supplement if you like,
[00:54:45.120 --> 00:54:48.720]   or rather swap and try a different supplement for a week
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.360]   and then see what works best
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:52.680]   and see if the combination works even better.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:54.480]   Now, I acknowledge that what I just described
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:56.160]   is exceedingly basic,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:59.320]   but it's something that I don't think most people do.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:02.120]   Most people either decide they have the budget
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:03.720]   and the interest in just improving their sleep
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.860]   across the board and they don't care what ingredient
[00:55:05.860 --> 00:55:07.920]   is providing the maximum benefit,
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.220]   or they simply try something and decide,
[00:55:11.220 --> 00:55:12.380]   oh, well, it didn't work for me
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:13.960]   and so I'm not going to try anything else.
[00:55:13.960 --> 00:55:15.120]   Supplements don't work for me
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.480]   or magnesium doesn't work for me,
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.560]   or I woke up in the middle of the night from vivid dreams.
[00:55:19.560 --> 00:55:21.840]   And that's because they're taking more of a shotgun approach
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:24.280]   without teasing out the different variables.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.700]   In fact, if there's an overriding theme
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.800]   of today's conversation,
[00:55:26.800 --> 00:55:30.280]   it's really about learning how to isolate variables
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.020]   in the realm of supplementation,
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:33.840]   because once you do that,
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:36.720]   and once you start to develop that intuition
[00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:38.780]   or sensitivity of sorts
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:42.060]   to how different ingredients impact you,
[00:55:42.060 --> 00:55:44.840]   it is an enormously powerful stance to have
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:47.480]   because you're going to keep your costs limited.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.100]   You're also going to find the things
[00:55:49.100 --> 00:55:51.440]   that work particularly poorly for you.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.680]   And more importantly,
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:54.840]   the things that work particularly well for you
[00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.920]   toward your goals.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:58.540]   Any discussion about supplementation for sleep,
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.920]   I feel has to include a discussion about melatonin.
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.560]   I've talked about melatonin before on numerous podcasts,
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:05.920]   mine and others.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:07.540]   And I will say once again,
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:10.120]   I am not a fan of melatonin for a couple of reasons.
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.600]   Melatonin is a hormone known to induce sleepiness,
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:14.880]   but not keep us asleep.
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:16.440]   So oftentimes people will take melatonin,
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.120]   fall deeply asleep and then wake up
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:20.240]   and have trouble falling back asleep.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:22.760]   The other reason is that melatonin supplements
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.760]   almost always include levels of melatonin
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:27.980]   or amounts of melatonin that far, far exceed
[00:56:27.980 --> 00:56:30.700]   the normal biological levels
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:32.800]   or so-called endogenous levels of melatonin
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:33.920]   that we would normally produce.
[00:56:33.920 --> 00:56:35.800]   And yes, it's true that as we age,
[00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:37.900]   we produce less melatonin,
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.960]   but melatonin as a hormone also impacts
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.440]   other hormone systems,
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.280]   particularly the reproductive hormone access
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.160]   to testosterone, estrogen, et cetera,
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:47.920]   which is not to say that if you've been taking melatonin
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:49.400]   for some period of time,
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:53.380]   that you've disrupted your fertility or those hormone axes,
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:56.160]   but it's possible that you've disrupted them somewhat.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:59.160]   And it's very clear that melatonin can impact
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:02.240]   not just sleep, but other systems in the brain and body.
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:05.800]   It can be useful for jet lag and for occasional use,
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.420]   but there also, I want to voice a message of caution.
[00:57:09.420 --> 00:57:14.320]   There have been studies exploring the dosages of melatonin
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.960]   contained in various supplements
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:19.160]   and whether or not what's listed on the bottle matches
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:22.040]   what's actually contained in those formulations.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.500]   And despite those formulations coming from quite reliable,
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:28.500]   quote unquote, or thought to be reliable sources,
[00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:30.620]   it was found that these supplements contain
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:35.140]   anywhere from 15% of what's thought to be
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.500]   or is told to be in those supplements
[00:57:37.500 --> 00:57:42.300]   or many times more melatonin than is listed on the bottle.
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:44.420]   So the dosaging does not seem to be consistent
[00:57:44.420 --> 00:57:46.020]   with what's often listed on the bottle.
[00:57:46.020 --> 00:57:47.060]   And this is even true within
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.980]   some of the more reputable brands.
[00:57:48.980 --> 00:57:50.760]   So that's of real concern.
[00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:52.500]   So we need to highlight melatonin
[00:57:52.500 --> 00:57:55.500]   as perhaps something that's only used occasionally.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:58.340]   If you want to talk about dosages for melatonin,
[00:57:58.340 --> 00:58:01.920]   use for jet lag, et cetera, go to examine.com.
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:05.080]   There's some excellent references to studies there.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.940]   Just put melatonin into the search function.
[00:58:06.940 --> 00:58:09.300]   It'll tell you everything you need to know about melatonin.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.440]   But now you know my stance on melatonin.
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:13.920]   One question I often get about supplementation for sleep
[00:58:13.920 --> 00:58:16.220]   is does it create a dependency?
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:18.720]   That's an excellent question to ask.
[00:58:18.720 --> 00:58:22.820]   I think most people worry about even fear
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.420]   relying on something so heavily
[00:58:24.420 --> 00:58:26.620]   that if they did not have it for whatever reason
[00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:28.420]   that they couldn't sleep.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:30.180]   In my experience,
[00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:34.080]   there is no problem falling and staying asleep
[00:58:34.080 --> 00:58:37.300]   in the absence of a supplement for sleep.
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:40.100]   Even if you've been taking that supplement for sleep
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:42.320]   consistently, seven days a week for months and months,
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.020]   maybe even years on end.
[00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:47.460]   I confess that I occasionally fall asleep
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:51.120]   having not taken my pre-sleep supplements.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:54.140]   And I happen to take magnesium threonine and apigenin.
[00:58:54.140 --> 00:58:55.940]   I also take inositol.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:57.580]   It greatly enhances my sleep.
[00:58:57.580 --> 00:58:59.160]   And there've been nights when I've fallen asleep
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:02.300]   not having taken any of those things and I've slept fine.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:06.060]   That said, if I were to explore multiple nights
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:08.180]   of trying to sleep without that supplementation,
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:10.120]   I find that my sleep is not as good.
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:12.060]   I'm still able to fall asleep,
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:15.220]   but the depth of my sleep and the duration of my sleep
[00:59:15.220 --> 00:59:17.380]   is not as good as when I'm supplementing.
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.680]   So I think that's refreshing news, at least to me,
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.300]   that there isn't a dependence on these supplements
[00:59:23.300 --> 00:59:25.120]   in order to be able to fall asleep.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.760]   It's not the same sort of dependence that people experience
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.580]   from things like sleeping pills.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:33.900]   That said, any compound, any compound
[00:59:33.900 --> 00:59:36.540]   can create a placebo type effect
[00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.500]   where we think we need something
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:40.540]   in order to achieve a certain effect.
[00:59:40.540 --> 00:59:43.980]   We had a guest on this podcast some time ago,
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.060]   Dr. Ali Krom, who's a professor at Stanford
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:49.200]   and works on these mindset effects, belief effects,
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.280]   and placebo effects.
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:53.980]   And placebo effects can be very real.
[00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:57.460]   And in some sense, dovetail with any conversation
[00:59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.120]   about dependency, meaning if you are somebody
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:03.720]   who loves your sleep supplements and sleeps great with them,
[01:00:03.720 --> 01:00:06.240]   and one night you discover you don't have them
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:08.720]   or you can't access them for whatever reason,
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:11.280]   that can create a little bit of an anxiety
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.960]   around the idea that, oh, in their absence,
[01:00:13.960 --> 01:00:15.440]   you're not going to be able to sleep.
[01:00:15.440 --> 01:00:17.940]   And that's a sort of a placebo effect in reverse,
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:20.860]   if you will, because what it suggests is that
[01:00:20.860 --> 01:00:24.200]   there's a emotional or a cognitive association
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:26.880]   with taking these things that allows you to sleep well.
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:30.000]   I would highly recommend that people explore
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.500]   this issue of dependency and placebo effects
[01:00:32.500 --> 01:00:35.200]   for sleep supplements on their own and under conditions
[01:00:35.200 --> 01:00:37.340]   in which there's nothing pressing the next day.
[01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:40.120]   That is, you don't have a big presentation, et cetera.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.740]   So what I recommend is that every two weeks or so,
[01:00:43.740 --> 01:00:47.400]   maybe every month or so, take one night off completely
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:48.940]   from all your sleep supplements
[01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.960]   or leave out one sleep supplement.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.320]   Try to understand to what extent
[01:00:52.320 --> 01:00:54.960]   you might've established a dependency,
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:59.000]   either real or placebo-based on these sleep supplements.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.960]   And again, I suggest doing this on perhaps a Friday night
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:03.840]   so that it's a weekend the next day
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.800]   so you don't have to work if perhaps you don't sleep well.
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:09.520]   I think what you'll find is what most people find,
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:13.900]   and that's in the absence of taking your supplement stack
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:17.900]   for sleep one night, you're still going to sleep just fine.
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.480]   Now, does that mean that these supplements
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:22.720]   are not actually working under normal conditions
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:23.900]   where you're taking them each night?
[01:01:23.900 --> 01:01:27.320]   No, what this means is that many of these things,
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:31.720]   magnesiums in particular, can build up in the body and brain
[01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:33.160]   in a way that can be beneficial.
[01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:36.960]   And what probably explains the fact that you can still sleep
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.600]   if you miss a night of taking them
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:41.240]   is that the neural circuits that are involved
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:44.160]   in turning off thinking or in not thinking
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.480]   and in falling asleep,
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:48.020]   those neural circuits undergo what's called plasticity.
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:49.680]   In other words, if you get better at falling
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.020]   and staying asleep over time,
[01:01:51.020 --> 01:01:54.060]   even if you got better at that through the assistance
[01:01:54.060 --> 01:01:55.840]   or with the assistance of some supplement
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:01:57.580]   or combination of supplements,
[01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:59.760]   well, then those circuits are still going to function
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.120]   just fine even in the absence
[01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.660]   of not taking those supplements just once.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.180]   We'll get back into this conversation a little bit later
[01:02:07.180 --> 01:02:10.480]   when we talk about cognitive enhancement and focus.
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:13.940]   It's the same story there where indeed there are things
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.380]   that people can take in stimulant form
[01:02:16.380 --> 01:02:17.720]   and non-stimulant form
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:20.380]   that can enhance cognitive ability and focus,
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:23.800]   but that does not mean that you become so dependent on those
[01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:26.220]   that you can't focus unless you take them.
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.260]   This has been shown multiple times over.
[01:02:28.260 --> 01:02:30.140]   So again, to answer the question,
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.980]   is there a dependency established
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.100]   by taking supplements for sleep?
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:36.220]   The short answer is no with the caveat
[01:02:36.220 --> 01:02:38.460]   that placebo effects and belief effects
[01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.140]   are always going to be at play
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:41.580]   whether or not you're talking about supplementation,
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.760]   prescription drugs, or even behavioral protocols,
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:44.660]   for that matter.
[01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.060]   I'd like to take a brief break
[01:02:46.060 --> 01:02:48.860]   and acknowledge our sponsor, Athletic Greens.
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:50.440]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.260]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:55.520]   that also contains digestive enzymes and adaptogens.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:58.620]   I started taking Athletic Greens way back in 2012.
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:00.740]   So that's 10 years now of taking Athletic Greens
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:01.860]   every single day.
[01:03:01.860 --> 01:03:04.220]   So I'm delighted that they're sponsoring this podcast.
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:06.020]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:08.180]   and the reason I still take Athletic Greens
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.180]   is that it covers all of my foundational nutritional needs.
[01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:13.800]   So whether or not I'm eating well or enough or not,
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:15.540]   I'm sure that I'm covering all of my needs
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.540]   for vitamins, minerals, probiotics,
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.500]   adaptogens to combat stress,
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.100]   and the digestive enzymes really help my digestion.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.700]   I just feel much better when I'm drinking Athletic Greens.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:26.100]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.900]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:41.500]   metabolic function, hormone health,
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.900]   but also calcium regulation and heart health.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:46.860]   Again, that's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[01:03:46.860 --> 01:03:49.100]   to claim their special offer in the month of January
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:50.420]   of 10 free travel packs
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.360]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3, K2.
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:54.960]   The next category of supplementation
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:58.140]   that I'd like to talk about is hormone support.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:01.540]   Improving or so-called optimizing your hormones
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.920]   is a critical aspect of mental health,
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.740]   physical health, and performance.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:08.140]   We've done multiple episodes about hormones,
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.900]   including testosterone and estrogen
[01:04:10.900 --> 01:04:13.440]   for both men and women and for people of different ages.
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:15.840]   We've also had episodes on thyroid hormone,
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:17.800]   growth hormone, and so on.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:19.640]   You can find all those at hubermanlab.com.
[01:04:19.640 --> 01:04:22.360]   In fact, you can go to the hubermanlab.com website.
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.300]   There's a search function
[01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.560]   where you can just put in a keyword
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.260]   and it will take you to all the episodes
[01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:28.000]   and specific time points
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:30.040]   where that topic happens to be covered.
[01:04:30.040 --> 01:04:33.060]   Now, hormone health is such an important topic to discuss
[01:04:33.060 --> 01:04:35.120]   in the context of supplementation
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:38.520]   because indeed there are compounds
[01:04:38.520 --> 01:04:41.700]   that are non-prescription-based so-called supplements
[01:04:41.700 --> 01:04:44.540]   that can improve hormone function.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:47.300]   Again, anytime we are discussing a particular aspect
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.900]   of mental health, physical health, or performance,
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.540]   we need to start with a mention of the few behavioral tools
[01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.100]   and nutrition-based tools,
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:58.140]   or at least some top contour coverage of those
[01:04:58.140 --> 01:04:59.720]   in a way that frames up the discussion
[01:04:59.720 --> 01:05:02.180]   about supplementation appropriately.
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.620]   So in the context of hormone support and augmentation
[01:05:05.620 --> 01:05:06.740]   and optimization,
[01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:11.080]   if you are not getting adequate calories
[01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:13.380]   from high quality sources,
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:16.760]   hormones like testosterone and estrogen will suffer.
[01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:17.820]   This is one of the reasons
[01:05:17.820 --> 01:05:21.280]   why women will stop having their periods
[01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:23.200]   if they're not ingesting enough calories.
[01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:26.400]   This is one of the reasons why testosterone levels will drop
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.540]   if people are not ingesting enough calories.
[01:05:28.540 --> 01:05:31.120]   In fact, on the episode with expert guest
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.360]   and medical doctor Peter Attia,
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.260]   he described how sex hormone binding globulin,
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:39.340]   this is a protein that's present in males and females
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:42.360]   that binds to testosterone and other hormones
[01:05:42.360 --> 01:05:44.680]   and prevents it from being in its free form,
[01:05:44.680 --> 01:05:46.800]   which is the more active form.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.720]   Well, insulin, which of course is going to increase
[01:05:49.720 --> 01:05:52.560]   after the ingestion of carbohydrates in particular,
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:54.420]   insulin actually inhibits
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.960]   or reduces sex hormone binding globulin.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:59.340]   What this means is that for you intermittent fasters
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.520]   or people that are ingesting very few carbohydrates
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:03.520]   who have very low blood glucose,
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.040]   or perhaps are taking things like metformin or berberine,
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.740]   which is a supplement based approach
[01:06:09.740 --> 01:06:11.380]   to reducing blood glucose,
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.420]   well, your sex hormone binding globulin
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:16.120]   is going to increase dramatically.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.920]   Conversely, if you are eating enough calories
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:21.980]   in the form of foods that allow your insulin
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.800]   to be a bit higher, not excessively high, we hope,
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.840]   but a bit higher,
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.960]   well then sex hormone binding globulin will go down
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.740]   and free testosterone will go up.
[01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:33.140]   So the discussion about hormone support and augmentation
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:35.540]   has to include some nod toward
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:37.840]   or understanding of the fact that nutrition
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:40.080]   and the way that nutrition impacts hormones
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:41.720]   and the way that hormones such as insulin
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:44.600]   impact other hormones, such as free testosterone,
[01:06:44.600 --> 01:06:46.060]   that all has to be acknowledged.
[01:06:46.060 --> 01:06:47.740]   That is not the topic of today's discussion,
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.140]   but it's important that I remind everybody
[01:06:50.140 --> 01:06:55.020]   that nutrition matters for general hormone status.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:58.220]   It's also important to remember that behaviors matter
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:06:59.980]   for hormone status.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:02.780]   Getting morning sunlight increases cortisol levels.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:05.600]   Cortisol levels are very important
[01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:08.400]   to have elevated early in the day for focus and alertness
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.020]   and for immune function,
[01:07:10.020 --> 01:07:13.160]   and to make sure that cortisol levels are low at night
[01:07:13.160 --> 01:07:16.800]   and thereby levels of growth hormone and testosterone,
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.880]   which is secreted mainly in the early morning,
[01:07:18.880 --> 01:07:22.020]   can be elevated at night and in the early morning.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:23.620]   So getting morning sunlight,
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:24.900]   getting strenuous exercise
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:26.760]   in the form of both cardiovascular exercise,
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:29.140]   but also relatively short,
[01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:34.140]   meaning an hour or less bouts of intense resistance training
[01:07:34.140 --> 01:07:35.620]   a few times per week
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.180]   can also dramatically alter hormone profiles.
[01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:41.500]   In fact, in the episode that we did with Dr. Duncan French,
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:43.420]   again, you find that episode at hubermanlab.com,
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:48.340]   he described a very strenuous, but still brief,
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.180]   two day a week protocol of using resistance training
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:54.140]   specifically to increase testosterone and free testosterone
[01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:56.220]   and growth hormone and so on.
[01:07:56.220 --> 01:07:59.220]   So nutrition matters, exercise matters
[01:07:59.220 --> 01:08:01.260]   when it comes to increasing,
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:03.140]   supporting or augmenting different hormones.
[01:08:03.140 --> 01:08:05.500]   And that's just the discussion about testosterone,
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.380]   free testosterone and estrogen.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:08.780]   There's also the vast discussion
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.060]   about thyroid hormone, et cetera.
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:13.060]   Again, we've covered all those topics in previous episodes,
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:17.280]   but once those behavioral tools are in place,
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:18.620]   once you're doing the right things
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:21.020]   and you're avoiding the wrong things,
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:22.860]   doing the right things to support your hormones
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:25.820]   and avoiding the things that diminish hormones
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.720]   in the ways that can be detrimental,
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:32.260]   once your nutrition is in place to support your hormones,
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:35.420]   then it makes sense to turn and consider
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:37.920]   what supplements can support hormones.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.280]   But I do believe that you want to get your behaviors
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:41.460]   and your nutrition correct
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:44.140]   before you start thinking about supplementation for hormones.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:44.980]   Again, I'll repeat that,
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.340]   get your nutrition and your behaviors correct
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:51.120]   for sake of hormones and for other health purposes
[01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:54.260]   before you start thinking about supplementation for hormones
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:55.360]   and certainly before you start thinking
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:58.260]   about prescription-based approaches to improving hormones.
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:09:03.540]   Once all of those other elements are in place,
[01:09:03.540 --> 01:09:05.920]   the supplements that make sense
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:08.660]   in terms of augmenting hormones come in two forms.
[01:09:08.660 --> 01:09:13.420]   One are broadband support for multiple hormones
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:16.220]   and then the others are supplements
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.180]   that are designed to increase
[01:09:18.180 --> 01:09:20.820]   or in some cases decrease specific hormones
[01:09:20.820 --> 01:09:21.660]   or hormone pathways.
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:25.040]   So let's consider each of those in tandem.
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:26.520]   There are certain supplements,
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:28.580]   things like Shila G, for instance,
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.020]   something from Ayurvedic medicine,
[01:09:30.020 --> 01:09:34.200]   which may mainly has the active ingredient fulvic acid,
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.620]   which is known to, for instance,
[01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.100]   increase things like FSH, follicle stimulating hormone,
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.640]   which in women is going to increase certain aspects
[01:09:42.640 --> 01:09:47.640]   of egg growth, hence the name follicle stimulating hormone.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:50.640]   It's going to stimulate certain aspects of fertility.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:53.940]   It's pro-fertile and in males can make
[01:09:53.940 --> 01:09:57.700]   for more sperm production or more motile sperm.
[01:09:57.700 --> 01:09:59.780]   FSH is also going to indirectly
[01:09:59.780 --> 01:10:01.260]   increase testosterone in males.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:04.300]   It's known to increase libido in both males and females.
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.580]   So things like Shila G can indeed augment multiple hormones
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.200]   and support multiple hormone systems,
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:13.180]   generally in the direction of pro-fertility,
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:18.180]   pro-libido and increasing estrogen and testosterone.
[01:10:18.180 --> 01:10:21.800]   Now, there are other supplements such as Ashwagandha
[01:10:21.800 --> 01:10:23.580]   that also fall into this category
[01:10:23.580 --> 01:10:25.380]   of affecting multiple hormones.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.980]   Ashwagandha is a very potent supplement
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:31.540]   in terms of reducing cortisol levels.
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:35.340]   It has also been shown to increase testosterone levels,
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.740]   but probably indirectly.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:39.100]   And that's because cortisol and testosterone
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.420]   sort of exist on a seesaw in terms of pathways.
[01:10:42.420 --> 01:10:43.580]   They're on separate pathways,
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.500]   but those pathways interact enough
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:47.740]   that when cortisol is lowered in general,
[01:10:47.740 --> 01:10:49.560]   testosterone tends to increase.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:51.500]   Now, it is important that with certain hormones
[01:10:51.500 --> 01:10:53.380]   like Ashwagandha that you don't take them
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:55.560]   for more than two weeks at a time at high dosages.
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.900]   If you want to know more of the specifics around Ashwagandha
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:11:01.000]   and how long to take it, how to cycle it, et cetera,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.100]   please see our episode on master stress.
[01:11:03.100 --> 01:11:06.060]   Please also see the examine.com website
[01:11:06.060 --> 01:11:07.460]   and put in Ashwagandha.
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:09.860]   It will get into some of that description.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:14.360]   But Shilajee, Ashwagandha, and things for instance,
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:17.500]   like L-carnitine, a supplement that we often discuss
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:19.880]   in terms of fertility because it can indeed
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.680]   improve sperm motility and quality and egg quality.
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:26.220]   So it's a pro-fertile compound,
[01:11:26.220 --> 01:11:29.020]   but it also impacts various mitochondrial pathways.
[01:11:29.020 --> 01:11:32.220]   So it's having a more indirect effect on hormones.
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:35.520]   There are many other compounds present
[01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:37.820]   and available supplements that are purported
[01:11:37.820 --> 01:11:40.940]   to be pro-hormone support in particular
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:44.300]   for testosterone, estrogen, fertility, and libido.
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:45.840]   There is a description, for instance,
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:47.720]   of things like maca root.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.900]   Maca root can increase libido.
[01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.980]   It's found to be particularly effective in women,
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.460]   but in men as well.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:57.900]   And in all people who are suffering from lowered libido
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:01.060]   due to intake of SSRIs,
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:04.020]   selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for whatever reason.
[01:12:04.020 --> 01:12:05.640]   SSRIs are used to treat OCD,
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:06.800]   they're used to treat depression,
[01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:08.360]   any number of different things.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:10.600]   Maca root can be, in many instances,
[01:12:10.600 --> 01:12:12.740]   effective in increasing libido.
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:14.040]   It does that, however,
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:17.060]   through augmentation of dopamine-related pathways
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:18.760]   and some of the hormone pathways
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:21.180]   upstream of testosterone and estrogen.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:23.800]   The reports that maca increases testosterone
[01:12:23.800 --> 01:12:28.420]   are somewhat scant and a little bit weak, to be honest.
[01:12:28.420 --> 01:12:30.200]   So it's having these indirect effects
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:32.500]   that may impact testosterone downstream.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:35.180]   So again, I'd put maca alongside ashwagandha,
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.940]   alongside Shilajee,
[01:12:36.940 --> 01:12:40.820]   as supplements that are impacting multiple hormone pathways
[01:12:40.820 --> 01:12:43.380]   toward increased libido, increased fertility,
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:46.160]   increased testosterone or estrogen,
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:48.780]   likely through indirect pathways.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.380]   Okay, now with all that said,
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:53.880]   like to provide some examples of supplements
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:57.000]   that work more directly on specific hormone pathways
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.520]   aimed at achieving more specific goals,
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.960]   such as elevated testosterone or elevated free testosterone
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.460]   or elevated growth hormone, for that matter,
[01:13:06.460 --> 01:13:08.680]   and elevated thyroid hormone.
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:10.700]   I'd like to talk about growth hormone first
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:13.120]   because it's actually a pretty short discussion.
[01:13:13.120 --> 01:13:15.860]   First of all, the best way to augment growth hormone
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:17.420]   is to get quality deep sleep,
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.940]   especially the sleep that occurs
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:20.580]   in the first three or four hours of the night
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:22.780]   is when growth hormone is released.
[01:13:22.780 --> 01:13:25.900]   And it's going to be beneficial to avoid caloric intake
[01:13:25.900 --> 01:13:27.800]   in the two hours preceding sleep.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:30.060]   Again, don't go to bed so hungry
[01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:32.380]   that you wake up an hour or an hour and a half later
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.100]   or you have trouble falling asleep,
[01:13:34.100 --> 01:13:36.660]   but avoiding food intake in the two hours prior to sleep
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.520]   and certainly avoiding alcohol and cannabis
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:42.420]   is going to facilitate growth hormone release
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:44.400]   in the first hours of sleep.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.360]   Many people use intermittent fasting
[01:13:46.360 --> 01:13:47.700]   or even longer periods of fasting
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:49.660]   to increase growth hormone.
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.440]   One of the interesting things I learned
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:53.160]   from an expert guest, Dr. Kyle Gillette,
[01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:57.720]   who's a medical doctor on this podcast is that indeed,
[01:13:57.720 --> 01:14:00.560]   while lengthier fast or intermittent fasting
[01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.220]   can increase growth hormone levels very substantially,
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:07.720]   it has indirect effects on the genetic pathways
[01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:09.860]   and the receptors for growth hormone
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:11.840]   that actually are detrimental
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:13.160]   for the function of growth hormone.
[01:14:13.160 --> 01:14:15.720]   So avoiding food for the two hours prior to bedtime
[01:14:15.720 --> 01:14:16.560]   is a good idea.
[01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.080]   If you avoid food for longer,
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.500]   that's just going to assist even more,
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.960]   certainly isn't going to hurt
[01:14:21.960 --> 01:14:23.840]   in terms of growth hormone release,
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.180]   but extended fast specifically
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:28.820]   for the purpose of increasing growth hormone
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:33.020]   are not really logical when you look at the broader effects
[01:14:33.020 --> 01:14:34.120]   of extended fast.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:36.080]   That is not to say that extended fasting
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:37.460]   is not appropriate for some people,
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:39.540]   it can be in certain instances
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:40.760]   or that intermittent fasted,
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.000]   so-called time-restricted feeding
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.640]   is not beneficial for some people, it can be.
[01:14:44.640 --> 01:14:47.560]   Here I'm only referring to the effects or in this case,
[01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:50.160]   the lack of effects of intermittent fasting,
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:53.200]   time-restricted feeding on growth hormone specifically.
[01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:56.600]   Now, in terms of supplements to increase growth hormone,
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:58.560]   there are very few supplements
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:15:00.580]   that have been shown to augment this pathway.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:03.800]   There is some idea that arginine supplementation
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:07.320]   prior to bedtime can further elevate levels
[01:15:07.320 --> 01:15:09.800]   of growth hormone, especially when fasted.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:11.680]   That literature is rather weak, to be honest,
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:13.320]   I encourage you to go to examine.com
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.440]   if you want to peruse those particular studies.
[01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.220]   Really the things that increase growth hormone
[01:15:19.220 --> 01:15:22.880]   very potently fall outside the realm of supplementation.
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:24.600]   They include exercise,
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:26.720]   again, look at the Duncan French episode
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:29.160]   or in the Kyle Gillette episode
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.380]   on optimizing hormones in males in particular,
[01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:32.960]   but this also pertains to females
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:35.440]   that avoiding food two hours prior to bedtime
[01:15:35.440 --> 01:15:39.120]   really can boost growth hormone significantly in sleep
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.640]   beyond what it would be otherwise,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.760]   but it's really only once you get
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:44.120]   into the realm of prescription compounds,
[01:15:44.120 --> 01:15:46.480]   things like peptides, like sarmorelin,
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:48.800]   which increase IGF-1 and growth hormone,
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:51.760]   things like growth hormone itself by prescription
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:54.620]   if and only if it's prescribed by a doctor, of course,
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:55.640]   and is safe for you,
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:57.200]   that's when you start getting into
[01:15:57.200 --> 01:15:59.920]   really significant increases in growth hormone.
[01:15:59.920 --> 01:16:01.880]   Not a lot of supplements out there
[01:16:01.880 --> 01:16:03.960]   to increase growth hormone potently.
[01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:06.880]   Now, it's a different story when you start thinking about
[01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:10.040]   and talking about testosterone and free testosterone
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.360]   and luteinizing hormone.
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:14.380]   Luteinizing hormone is released from the pituitary,
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:17.800]   which is this gland not far from the roof of your mouth
[01:16:17.800 --> 01:16:19.640]   and its nearby neighbor.
[01:16:19.640 --> 01:16:21.920]   The hypothalamus is a collection of neurons
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.440]   that sits above the roof of your mouth
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.640]   and talks to the pituitary, talks to it
[01:16:25.640 --> 01:16:28.820]   through neural connections and hormone-based connections.
[01:16:28.820 --> 01:16:30.780]   There is a hormone called GnRH,
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:32.680]   gonadotropin-releasing hormone,
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.120]   that is released from the hypothalamus into the pituitary.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:39.180]   It stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone, or LH,
[01:16:39.180 --> 01:16:41.180]   which then travels in the bloodstream
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:42.960]   to impact multiple tissues in the body,
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:45.680]   but mainly the ovary in females and the testes in males
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:49.820]   to stimulate estrogen production and testosterone production.
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:54.180]   There are supplements that can potently increase GnRH
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:56.000]   and or luteinizing hormone
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:58.900]   and then indirectly increase testosterone and estrogen.
[01:16:58.900 --> 01:17:01.720]   And I always like to remind people testosterone and estrogen
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.500]   are present in both males and females, okay?
[01:17:04.500 --> 01:17:07.460]   And both are important for things like libido,
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:09.640]   muscle growth, and so on.
[01:17:09.640 --> 01:17:11.540]   A lot of people think that, oh, in males, you know,
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:13.860]   having very high testosterone and low estrogen
[01:17:13.860 --> 01:17:14.780]   is actually ideal.
[01:17:14.780 --> 01:17:17.500]   It's actually not ideal if you want to keep your libido.
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.960]   Anything that lowers your estrogen too far
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:21.860]   is going to reduce your libido.
[01:17:21.860 --> 01:17:22.980]   You don't want estrogen too high,
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:25.560]   but you also do not want it too low.
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.040]   So supplements that can tickle this pathway
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:32.220]   or actually can act as a bit more of a directed hammer
[01:17:32.220 --> 01:17:33.980]   on this luteinizing hormone pathway
[01:17:33.980 --> 01:17:38.980]   may also impact GnRH are things like Fidogia aggrestus.
[01:17:38.980 --> 01:17:43.580]   This is an herb that I've talked about before on the podcast
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:48.080]   that when taken at dosages of 600 milligrams per day,
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:51.980]   many people, not all, report elevated levels of libido,
[01:17:51.980 --> 01:17:56.280]   elevated sperm production, elevated testosterone,
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:57.940]   in some cases, elevated estrogen,
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:00.760]   a bunch of hormones downstream of luteinizing hormone.
[01:18:00.760 --> 01:18:04.580]   Now, are you going to be a Fidogia aggrestus responder
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:05.980]   or a non-responder?
[01:18:05.980 --> 01:18:09.180]   There's simply no way to know except by trying it.
[01:18:09.180 --> 01:18:11.820]   If you are going to go down this route,
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:13.620]   there are two very important considerations.
[01:18:13.620 --> 01:18:16.420]   First of all, there's a fairly extensive literature
[01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.120]   on the fact that Fidogia aggrestus can be toxic
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:22.540]   to testicular cells and perhaps other cells
[01:18:22.540 --> 01:18:24.320]   when taken at very high dosages.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:27.760]   So obeying the particular dosages of Fidogia aggrestus
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:31.060]   that are recommended on various product labels
[01:18:31.060 --> 01:18:34.820]   and cycling Fidogia aggrestus can be important.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:38.620]   Some people need to cycle it eight weeks on, two weeks off.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:41.940]   Other people opt for 12 weeks on, a month off.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:44.100]   I know a few people who have taken it continuously
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:47.980]   with no issues, but I do want to suggest caution
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:49.980]   when taking Fidogia aggrestus.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:53.020]   The cautionary notes are stay within
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:54.500]   the recommended dosage ranges.
[01:18:54.500 --> 01:18:56.820]   You can go lower, but certainly don't go higher.
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.160]   And I think it is wise to cycle every eight weeks or so
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:04.020]   to come off it for two weeks and then going back on,
[01:19:04.020 --> 01:19:07.260]   if that's your choice, if you feel it benefited you.
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:09.620]   Or taking it for 12 week periods of time
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.300]   and then cycling off for a full month
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.540]   before repeating again.
[01:19:12.540 --> 01:19:17.100]   The best way to know whether or not Fidogia
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:18.460]   or any of these other supplements
[01:19:18.460 --> 01:19:19.820]   is impacting your hormone levels
[01:19:19.820 --> 01:19:20.900]   in the direction that you want
[01:19:20.900 --> 01:19:22.620]   and not impacting your hormone levels
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.020]   or other aspects of your biology
[01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.480]   in ways that you don't want is from a blood test.
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:29.700]   There is simply no better tool to evaluate
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.220]   whether or not these supplements are working
[01:19:32.220 --> 01:19:34.460]   to support your hormones in the ways that you want
[01:19:34.460 --> 01:19:37.780]   and not causing issues, except to take a blood test.
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:41.220]   This podcast has Inside Tracker as a sponsor
[01:19:41.220 --> 01:19:44.220]   that can do in-home blood tests and give you blood panels.
[01:19:44.220 --> 01:19:46.620]   There are other sources of blood tests
[01:19:46.620 --> 01:19:48.660]   that are quite good as well, of course.
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:51.220]   And in the first episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.280]   that I did with Dr. Kyle Gillette,
[01:19:53.280 --> 01:19:55.780]   again, a medical doctor, expert in hormones,
[01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:58.540]   diabetes, and various other aspects of medicine,
[01:19:58.540 --> 01:20:01.300]   he described, and it is timestamped,
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.900]   how to stand the best probability of getting your insurance
[01:20:03.900 --> 01:20:05.260]   to cover a blood test,
[01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:07.740]   how to talk to your doctor about getting a hormone panel,
[01:20:07.740 --> 01:20:08.580]   and so on.
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:10.240]   So I'll refer you to that episode for that.
[01:20:10.240 --> 01:20:12.780]   But blood tests are going to be very important.
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:16.460]   I recommend taking them before adding in any supplement
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.920]   to increase hormones of any kind
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.820]   or decrease hormones of any kind for that matter.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:24.700]   And then again, after about four to eight weeks
[01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.380]   of taking that particular supplement
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.660]   in order to evaluate whether or not it worked
[01:20:28.660 --> 01:20:31.300]   and whether or not it had any negative effects
[01:20:31.300 --> 01:20:33.140]   that you would like to avoid.
[01:20:33.140 --> 01:20:36.300]   I also want to remind people of the dosage conversation
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:37.300]   that we had earlier,
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:38.800]   just because there's a recommended dosage
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.060]   of Fidogia agrestis of say 600 milligrams per day.
[01:20:42.060 --> 01:20:44.980]   First of all, that is not an invitation
[01:20:44.980 --> 01:20:47.540]   to take twice as much and expect twice the positive effects.
[01:20:47.540 --> 01:20:49.160]   That is not a good approach,
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:51.680]   especially with something like Fidogia agrestis,
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:56.400]   which can at high dosages be toxic.
[01:20:56.400 --> 01:20:58.300]   But it's also important to perhaps consider
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:20:59.820]   taking a lower dosage and seeing
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.980]   how that affects your hormones.
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:03.640]   That approach requires a bit more patience.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.480]   I know most people are thinking,
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:06.460]   I want the effect and I want it now,
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:09.180]   but I think it's very important when thinking about exercise
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:12.380]   or nutrition or supplementation to really play the long game,
[01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:15.020]   to think about what's going to work for you
[01:21:15.020 --> 01:21:16.940]   in the immediate end in the long-term
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.640]   and to ease into any kind of supplement regimen.
[01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.660]   For instance, by taking one thing at a time,
[01:21:21.660 --> 01:21:24.620]   varying one supplement out and one supplement in,
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:26.380]   starting at minimal effective dose
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:30.180]   and build up your protocols over a year or several years,
[01:21:30.180 --> 01:21:31.620]   it really can be beneficial.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.480]   I can say for myself,
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:35.060]   I started exploring the supplement space
[01:21:35.060 --> 01:21:38.180]   and taking different supplements in different combination
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.460]   and alone evaluating which ones worked
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:41.620]   and did not work for me.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:43.860]   Some were absolutely dreadful for me.
[01:21:43.860 --> 01:21:45.860]   I have tons of stories about supplement fails,
[01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:47.740]   some of which were just kind of innocuous,
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:50.320]   meaning they were a waste of money, which isn't innocuous,
[01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:52.520]   but at least it wasn't detrimental to my health.
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:53.360]   Other supplements,
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:56.180]   which fortunately don't exist on the market anymore,
[01:21:56.180 --> 01:21:58.540]   I think actually were quite dangerous
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:01.060]   and I feel lucky that I did not experience
[01:22:01.060 --> 01:22:02.820]   even greater negative effects from them.
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:05.700]   Other supplements have been tremendously useful for me
[01:22:05.700 --> 01:22:07.720]   and for other people for things like sleep
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:10.060]   and hormone support focus and so on.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:13.820]   So Fidogia aggressis is a good example of a supplement
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.920]   that is known to have potent effects,
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.020]   but you need to approach it with the appropriate,
[01:22:20.020 --> 01:22:22.420]   I would say respect for the fact that the dosage ranges
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:26.280]   in which it works have to be kept pretty narrow
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:27.620]   without causing issues.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.500]   It does increase luteinizing hormone
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:34.120]   and thereby testosterone and estrogen.
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:36.580]   So if you're somebody who's already excessively high
[01:22:36.580 --> 01:22:37.560]   in one or the other,
[01:22:37.560 --> 01:22:40.180]   it's going to be very hard to just direct it
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:42.580]   to only testosterone or only estrogen.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:44.540]   Now, the topic of today's episode
[01:22:44.540 --> 01:22:47.300]   is not about Fidogia aggressis per se.
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.600]   I highlight it because it is one of the more potent
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.860]   supplements for sake of hormone augmentation,
[01:22:52.860 --> 01:22:54.740]   but it's still fairly broadband.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.020]   It's a little more specific than something like Shilajee,
[01:22:58.020 --> 01:22:59.940]   but it's still fairly broadband
[01:22:59.940 --> 01:23:02.860]   in terms of hitting multiple end point hormones,
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:04.120]   testosterone and estrogen,
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:06.740]   and maybe some other hormones as well.
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:10.460]   There are other supplements in particular, Tongat Ali,
[01:23:10.460 --> 01:23:13.980]   which is known to, for instance, increase libido,
[01:23:13.980 --> 01:23:16.580]   whether or not it does that by way of augmenting
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:19.540]   dopamine related pathways or testosterone pathways
[01:23:19.540 --> 01:23:20.540]   still isn't clear.
[01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:24.460]   It is known to increase free testosterone
[01:23:24.460 --> 01:23:28.320]   by reducing sex hormone binding globulin.
[01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:34.220]   Tongat Ali can be beneficial both for men and for women
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:36.480]   in dosages anywhere from 200 milligrams
[01:23:36.480 --> 01:23:38.480]   to 600 milligrams per day.
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.260]   So there, I would say scale according to body size,
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.760]   although start with the minimum amount
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.900]   and find the minimal effective dose for you.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:47.380]   Again, blood work is going to be the most effective way
[01:23:47.380 --> 01:23:49.520]   to determine what's working or not working
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.660]   at the level of objective numbers,
[01:23:51.660 --> 01:23:53.860]   but subjective experience matters too.
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:56.620]   You know, if you take it at 400 milligrams for four weeks
[01:23:56.620 --> 01:23:58.080]   and you don't notice any effect,
[01:23:58.080 --> 01:24:01.460]   you might try it at 600 milligrams, but not higher.
[01:24:01.460 --> 01:24:03.780]   And if you still don't see an effect,
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:06.020]   well then it doesn't appear to have worked for you.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.880]   Other people experience dramatic effects
[01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:09.780]   from things like Fidoja and Tongat Ali.
[01:24:09.780 --> 01:24:10.940]   Why would that be the case?
[01:24:10.940 --> 01:24:13.060]   Well, if you look to the scientific literature,
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:15.940]   what you find is that the studies
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:18.540]   that report the biggest effects of any supplement
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:20.540]   usually start with a population
[01:24:20.540 --> 01:24:22.980]   that somehow diminished or back on its heels
[01:24:22.980 --> 01:24:24.340]   in one particular dimension.
[01:24:24.340 --> 01:24:27.500]   So for instance, people that are hypogonadal,
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:30.140]   that are not making enough testosterone or free testosterone,
[01:24:30.140 --> 01:24:32.220]   in fact, their levels are very, very low.
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.900]   They're subclinical, off range in terms of the charts,
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.220]   below the normal.
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:41.060]   Well, those people, when they take supplements
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:43.860]   like Tongat Ali, Fidoja, tend to experience greater effects
[01:24:43.860 --> 01:24:45.660]   because they're starting from a lower level
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:48.500]   than people who perhaps are close to the optimal levels
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:51.620]   achieved through either age, genetics, exercise, nutrition,
[01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.260]   or some combination of those.
[01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.620]   So that's an important thing to think about.
[01:24:54.620 --> 01:24:57.580]   These are called floor effects and ceiling effects.
[01:24:57.580 --> 01:24:59.520]   Ceiling effects are, for instance,
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.860]   if an individual already has very high testosterone
[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:04.300]   and free testosterone and they take a supplement
[01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.660]   to increase it further, they might not see any increase.
[01:25:06.660 --> 01:25:08.940]   Whereas somebody who sits more in the middle to low range
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:12.520]   stands to experience a much greater increase.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:16.120]   In fact, one individual I know who took Tongat Ali,
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:18.180]   admittedly on my recommendation,
[01:25:18.180 --> 01:25:20.820]   his testosterone was initially very low
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.860]   and he was having a number of different symptoms.
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:24.700]   He did blood work.
[01:25:24.700 --> 01:25:26.060]   That's how he knew it was low.
[01:25:26.060 --> 01:25:30.480]   And he then took Tongat Ali and Fidoja in combination
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:32.780]   'cause he decided he just wanted results.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:35.460]   He didn't care which thing was going to give him the results
[01:25:35.460 --> 01:25:38.340]   and he experienced big increases in testosterone.
[01:25:38.340 --> 01:25:40.980]   This would be not free, but total testosterone.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.500]   He experienced as much as 600 nanograms per deciliter
[01:25:43.500 --> 01:25:46.100]   increase from where he was before, which is very dramatic.
[01:25:46.100 --> 01:25:49.280]   It was a near tripling of where his testosterone
[01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:51.320]   had started off to where he ended up.
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.740]   I don't know if he's ever done the experiment
[01:25:52.740 --> 01:25:55.420]   of removing Fidoja or Tongat to find out which one it was.
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.520]   And this is why many people just take them in combination.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:25:59.040]   And if you have the budget for it
[01:25:59.040 --> 01:26:01.980]   and you are interested in just finding what works,
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:04.360]   but not isolating what works
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:05.900]   at the level of single ingredients,
[01:26:05.900 --> 01:26:08.060]   that would be the approach I recommend.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:10.560]   However, again, I think most people would do well
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:12.140]   to figure out which specific ingredients
[01:26:12.140 --> 01:26:13.540]   are going to work best for them
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:15.700]   by isolating the variables the way I've described
[01:26:15.700 --> 01:26:17.240]   repeatedly throughout this episode.
[01:26:17.240 --> 01:26:19.620]   To my knowledge, Tonga Ali does not need to be cycled,
[01:26:19.620 --> 01:26:22.520]   meaning you don't have to take periods of time off from it.
[01:26:22.520 --> 01:26:24.620]   I should note that the effects of Tonga Ali
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:27.300]   can take a little bit longer to experience.
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.980]   So perhaps blood work should be done eight to 12 weeks
[01:26:29.980 --> 01:26:34.380]   after initiating the Tonga Ali protocol as opposed to earlier
[01:26:34.380 --> 01:26:38.040]   and it does seem to have sort of cumulative effects
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:41.620]   on libido and that points to the likelihood
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:43.960]   that it's having some impact on neural pathways
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:45.280]   as opposed to hormone pathways.
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:48.100]   Hormone pathways can be slow, but in general,
[01:26:48.100 --> 01:26:50.840]   neural pathways are the ones that are going to explain
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.980]   slow rising shifts in any kind of physical or mental aspect
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:57.300]   that then remain stable over time.
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:00.740]   So the exact effects of Tonga Ali and where,
[01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:03.840]   meaning where they arise in the brain and body aren't known.
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.100]   I will provide a link to a really beautiful review article
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.060]   that covers the literature on Tonga Ali.
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:10.580]   This came out fairly recently
[01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:14.200]   and that I've reviewed with a number of other MDs
[01:27:14.200 --> 01:27:17.900]   and medical or medicine related podcasters.
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.020]   It's a really nice review.
[01:27:19.020 --> 01:27:20.240]   I'll provide a link to that.
[01:27:20.240 --> 01:27:22.740]   It gives a survey of Tonga Ali, what people are discovering,
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:24.960]   what they're finding, what they're not finding and so forth.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.720]   As a final note on supplements for hormone augmentation
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:30.200]   and supplementation, I want to make a brief mention
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:33.260]   of something specifically related to female health,
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.720]   which is of course the menstrual cycle
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:35.800]   and across the menstrual cycle,
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.540]   different hormones are present at different levels.
[01:27:37.540 --> 01:27:39.740]   Follicle stimulating hormone is very high
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:41.820]   during the so-called follicular phase, right?
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:44.080]   And then you have your luteal phase.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.520]   We have an entire episode coming up
[01:27:45.520 --> 01:27:47.380]   about female hormones and hormone health
[01:27:47.380 --> 01:27:48.380]   that will cover this.
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:50.040]   We also have covered a little bit of this
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:54.000]   in the other episodes on testosterone and estrogen.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:56.960]   But the point I'd like to make now is that for women,
[01:27:56.960 --> 01:28:00.080]   they should fully expect that certain supplements,
[01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.780]   not all, but certain supplements,
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:04.880]   because of the way they impact different hormones
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:07.900]   would have different effects, maybe even opposite effects
[01:28:07.900 --> 01:28:09.760]   at different phases of the menstrual cycle.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:13.640]   And for that reason, I believe it is especially important
[01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:18.240]   to have tight control over dosage and individual ingredients
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:19.420]   in your supplement regimen.
[01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:22.000]   So for instance, if you're somebody who takes Shilajean,
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:25.680]   I know many women who take Shilajean or Tonga Ali,
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:27.420]   for instance, or Maca,
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:29.880]   and you find that it really serves you well,
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:32.080]   that is it provides the mental and physical benefits
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.480]   that you want and enjoy
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.380]   at certain phases of your menstrual cycle,
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.200]   but at other phases of your menstrual cycle,
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.360]   it feels like too much,
[01:28:39.360 --> 01:28:40.600]   or it actually can start to give you
[01:28:40.600 --> 01:28:42.480]   negative mental or physical effects,
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.120]   well then obviously having control
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.800]   over those specific ingredients
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:48.340]   is going to be extremely important
[01:28:48.340 --> 01:28:50.420]   so that you can titrate the dosage
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:52.440]   or increase the dosage as the case may be,
[01:28:52.440 --> 01:28:54.940]   or cease taking those things entirely
[01:28:54.940 --> 01:28:57.520]   at certain phases of your menstrual cycle.
[01:28:57.520 --> 01:29:00.120]   That's not to say that some women can't just continuously
[01:29:00.120 --> 01:29:01.780]   take these supplements throughout their menstrual cycle.
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:04.540]   Some can, but some find that
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:06.200]   that makes them very uncomfortable
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:09.440]   or that they would do well to alter different ingredients
[01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:10.760]   at different phases of their cycle.
[01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:13.320]   So again, this speaks to the critical importance
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:16.280]   of single ingredient control, dosage control,
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.320]   and the ability to cease taking
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:20.400]   individual or multiple ingredients
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:22.600]   according to the backdrop of your health generally,
[01:29:22.600 --> 01:29:25.220]   and obviously the menstrual cycle is a profound shift
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:28.480]   in the hormones and thus the entire biological
[01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:31.560]   and psychological milieu that exists in the body.
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:33.480]   And of course, there's the issue of birth control
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:34.520]   and whether or not people are taking
[01:29:34.520 --> 01:29:36.300]   hormone-based birth control.
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:38.980]   Certain forms of hormone-based birth control in women
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:40.720]   involve tonically elevating,
[01:29:40.720 --> 01:29:43.120]   that means consistently elevating estrogen.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:46.560]   That's certainly going to reduce the fluctuations
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.820]   and thus the probability that certain hormones
[01:29:48.820 --> 01:29:50.920]   and hormone pathways will change across the menstrual cycle,
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.840]   but not eliminate it altogether.
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:55.320]   Also, there's the key issue of fertility
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.020]   in both males and females.
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:58.180]   One important note,
[01:29:58.180 --> 01:30:00.520]   even though this is not an episode about fertility,
[01:30:00.520 --> 01:30:01.800]   we're going to have one soon,
[01:30:01.800 --> 01:30:04.160]   but the important point about fertility
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:06.680]   is that there are supplements, not just Shilaji,
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:08.580]   but there are supplements and supplement protocols
[01:30:08.580 --> 01:30:12.720]   such as L-carnitine, in particular injectable L-carnitine,
[01:30:12.720 --> 01:30:14.740]   which does require a prescription, at least in the US,
[01:30:14.740 --> 01:30:17.880]   but also orally ingested L-carnitine
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:20.120]   that can improve sperm health and motility
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.880]   and egg health and motility, I mentioned that earlier.
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:26.140]   But if couples are trying to conceive,
[01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.860]   it is important that if you're going to take something
[01:30:28.860 --> 01:30:31.220]   that is a supplement directed towards sperm
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:32.800]   and or egg health,
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:35.260]   that you also consider how that interfaces
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:38.280]   with some of the other hormone-based compounds
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.060]   that is prescription drugs that you may be taking.
[01:30:40.060 --> 01:30:40.900]   This is true for people
[01:30:40.900 --> 01:30:44.520]   who are doing IVF in vitro fertilization or not.
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.080]   Again, that entire discussion will be handled
[01:30:47.080 --> 01:30:50.200]   in our episode on fertility and on female hormone health,
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.680]   and we already did the episode with Dr. Kyle Gillette
[01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:54.920]   on male hormone health optimization.
[01:30:54.920 --> 01:30:56.540]   The next category of supplementation
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.380]   that I'd like to address
[01:30:57.380 --> 01:31:01.080]   is supplements related to cognitive enhancement and focus.
[01:31:01.080 --> 01:31:03.560]   And here, there are a number of very useful strategies
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.880]   that one could take.
[01:31:04.880 --> 01:31:06.420]   I'd like to divide this conversation
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.940]   into two general categories of supplements
[01:31:08.940 --> 01:31:11.420]   to address cognitive enhancement and focus.
[01:31:11.420 --> 01:31:15.620]   The first category are supplements that increase energy
[01:31:15.620 --> 01:31:18.400]   by way of stimulant properties.
[01:31:18.400 --> 01:31:21.360]   So the most obvious of these is caffeine.
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:23.480]   Caffeine is, of course,
[01:31:23.480 --> 01:31:26.740]   a molecule that can increase levels of alertness.
[01:31:26.740 --> 01:31:28.660]   It also can increase levels of focus
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:32.420]   provided that dosages are in the appropriate range.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.740]   The appropriate range in most cases
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:36.940]   is going to be one to three milligrams per kilogram
[01:31:36.940 --> 01:31:40.740]   of body weight taken 30 minutes or so
[01:31:40.740 --> 01:31:43.740]   before any kind of mental or physical endeavor.
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.380]   We did an entire episode about caffeine
[01:31:45.380 --> 01:31:48.420]   where you can learn lots of facts about caffeine,
[01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:50.020]   how best to utilize caffeine.
[01:31:50.020 --> 01:31:52.100]   And indeed, I'll just give you a few of those now.
[01:31:52.100 --> 01:31:54.800]   It turns out that if you're a regular caffeine user,
[01:31:54.800 --> 01:31:57.880]   you can still derive the cognitive enhancing
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.600]   and focus enhancing effects of caffeine
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.160]   if you ingest caffeine every day.
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:05.860]   But if you were to take two days off
[01:32:05.860 --> 01:32:07.120]   from caffeine completely,
[01:32:07.120 --> 01:32:10.380]   and right now I hear all the caffeine addicts out there
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:12.460]   just kind of cringing at the idea,
[01:32:12.460 --> 01:32:15.300]   and then take caffeine in the 30 minutes
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:18.260]   prior to some especially important event,
[01:32:18.260 --> 01:32:21.060]   physical or mental event where you really need to focus
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.520]   and be able to sustain that focus for long periods of time,
[01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:26.440]   it would have an even greater effect than it normally would.
[01:32:26.440 --> 01:32:28.020]   But since most people are taking caffeine
[01:32:28.020 --> 01:32:30.460]   in a kind of ongoing, regular way,
[01:32:30.460 --> 01:32:33.400]   I just want to emphasize that it still has pro-cognitive
[01:32:33.400 --> 01:32:36.560]   and pro-focus effects, even if it's taken every day
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:38.000]   or even multiple times per day.
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:39.680]   Again, a cautionary note,
[01:32:39.680 --> 01:32:42.440]   don't drink caffeine too late in the day, past 2 p.m.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:45.460]   it can really start to impede your sleep at night.
[01:32:45.460 --> 01:32:46.680]   Even if you can fall asleep at night,
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:48.980]   the architecture of that sleep is not going to be great
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:50.260]   if you're ingesting caffeine
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:53.480]   in the preceding eight to 10 and even 12 hours.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.960]   And that actually raises another tangential,
[01:32:55.960 --> 01:32:56.920]   but still important point.
[01:32:56.920 --> 01:32:59.520]   So I'm going to make it and then get back to supplements,
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:03.420]   which is the best cognitive enhancer that you will ever take
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:07.600]   is a really good night's sleep of sufficient duration.
[01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:10.840]   Okay, so sleep is going to be the bedrock
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:13.700]   of your ability to focus and remember things.
[01:33:13.700 --> 01:33:16.400]   In fact, it's during sleep that neural connections remodel,
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:19.000]   so-called neuroplasticity.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.780]   It's actually not when you trigger learning,
[01:33:20.780 --> 01:33:23.320]   but it's when you consolidate and reinforce learning
[01:33:23.320 --> 01:33:24.460]   and a number of other things
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.920]   that relate to cognitive enhancement and focus.
[01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:27.760]   The other thing, of course,
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.440]   is that you're going to need
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:32.560]   to have sufficient levels of nutrition.
[01:33:32.560 --> 01:33:34.400]   So you don't want to be overly hungry
[01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:35.880]   or it's going to be hard to focus,
[01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:38.640]   nor do you want to be overloaded with calories
[01:33:38.640 --> 01:33:42.140]   or a volume of food or have your blood glucose to be so high
[01:33:42.140 --> 01:33:43.360]   that it's going to make you sleepy.
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.860]   There's a reason why when discussing stress
[01:33:46.860 --> 01:33:48.640]   and the so-called autonomic nervous system
[01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:51.920]   that the phrase rest and digest comes into play.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:55.960]   Rest and digest, as the name implies,
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:58.520]   relates to the fact that when we have
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:02.040]   a lot of food in our gut, it tends to make us sleepy.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:04.320]   In other words, it's hard for us to focus
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:06.480]   and it's hard for us to maintain cognitive attention
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:07.800]   and remember things, et cetera.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:09.840]   So there are a bunch of behavioral tools
[01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.800]   for enhancing focus.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:13.360]   We did an entire episode on enhancing focus.
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.800]   It does touch on supplementation.
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:16.320]   Again, you can find links to that
[01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:18.560]   in all formats at hubermanlab.com.
[01:34:18.560 --> 01:34:20.800]   We also have a newsletter related to this topic
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:24.000]   also at hubermanlab.com at zero cost.
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:26.060]   With all of that said, and in particular,
[01:34:26.060 --> 01:34:27.880]   the highlight about sleep being the best way
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.800]   to enhance your cognitive abilities and focus.
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:32.920]   Anytime we're having a discussion about supplements
[01:34:32.920 --> 01:34:35.300]   for enhancing cognitive ability and focus,
[01:34:35.300 --> 01:34:37.000]   a major category of those supplements
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.080]   is going to fall into the stimulant category.
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:43.080]   And that's going to include most often caffeine,
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.440]   although there are other sources of stimulants.
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:48.240]   I'm not going to touch on those for the moment.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.560]   Just talk about caffeine.
[01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:50.720]   When people hear caffeine, they think,
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:52.040]   well, I can just drink coffee
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:54.080]   and indeed that's a great source of caffeine.
[01:34:54.080 --> 01:34:55.360]   So is yerba mate.
[01:34:55.360 --> 01:34:57.280]   I would caution people to,
[01:34:57.280 --> 01:34:59.680]   if you're going to use yerba mate for whatever purpose,
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:01.260]   caffeine or otherwise,
[01:35:01.260 --> 01:35:04.840]   that you avoid the smoked versions of yerba mate.
[01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:06.160]   They are carcinogenic.
[01:35:06.160 --> 01:35:09.160]   That is the smoked versions are carcinogenic
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:13.980]   and to consume the non-smoked varieties instead.
[01:35:13.980 --> 01:35:17.160]   The important thing to understand about caffeine
[01:35:17.160 --> 01:35:20.040]   is that while it can be ingested in the form of a drink
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:22.400]   or an energy drink, tea or coffee,
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:27.000]   it can also be ingested as a pure supplement.
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:28.880]   That is there are caffeine supplements.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:29.820]   And I know a number of people,
[01:35:29.820 --> 01:35:32.340]   including a very, very prominent podcaster
[01:35:32.340 --> 01:35:33.800]   whose name I won't mention,
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:35.320]   who drinks herbal tea,
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:40.140]   but takes a 100 to 300 milligram tablet of caffeine
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:40.980]   with the herbal tea.
[01:35:40.980 --> 01:35:43.020]   So in that case, it is no longer herbal tea.
[01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:45.560]   It is caffeinated herbal tea.
[01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:48.160]   When you take caffeine in pill form,
[01:35:48.160 --> 01:35:51.880]   it tends to have a much more potent and long lasting effect
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.480]   than when you take caffeine in the form of coffee or tea.
[01:35:56.480 --> 01:36:00.560]   It's actually a world apart in terms of its effects.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.440]   And if you haven't experienced this before,
[01:36:03.440 --> 01:36:05.480]   it might be something that you want to explore.
[01:36:05.480 --> 01:36:07.020]   It might not be something you want to explore.
[01:36:07.020 --> 01:36:09.160]   In particular, if you're somebody who experiences anxiety
[01:36:09.160 --> 01:36:10.580]   or panic attacks, be very careful
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:11.920]   with your intake of caffeine.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:14.720]   Again, see the episode of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:16.900]   All About Caffeine for more on that.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:19.560]   But it is the case
[01:36:19.560 --> 01:36:22.960]   that even 100 milligrams of caffeine in tablet form,
[01:36:22.960 --> 01:36:24.660]   I suppose it could be in capsule form as well,
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:26.260]   but in its pure form,
[01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:31.260]   leads to much greater enhancement of alertness and focus
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:35.240]   than does often the comparable amount
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.880]   or even twice the amount of caffeine
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.200]   contained in coffee or tea.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:39.800]   Now, why would that be?
[01:36:39.800 --> 01:36:41.460]   Has a lot to do with the other things
[01:36:41.460 --> 01:36:43.140]   that are in coffee and tea.
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:47.040]   So here, I'm not encouraging people to become reliant
[01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:50.140]   on caffeine capsules or on caffeine tablets,
[01:36:50.140 --> 01:36:53.560]   but if you want to increase alertness and focus,
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:56.100]   caffeine is a potent way to do that.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:57.440]   It works.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:00.240]   The other category of stimulant that can work
[01:37:00.240 --> 01:37:02.920]   in terms of enhancing alertness and focus
[01:37:02.920 --> 01:37:06.320]   are going to be things that increase adrenaline
[01:37:06.320 --> 01:37:09.080]   in some other way or epinephrine,
[01:37:09.080 --> 01:37:11.600]   as it's also called, adrenaline, epinephrine, same thing,
[01:37:11.600 --> 01:37:15.060]   in some other way that are going to touch into
[01:37:15.060 --> 01:37:19.680]   or augment the so-called adrenergic and adrenaline systems.
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:22.060]   And there are things like yohimbine
[01:37:22.060 --> 01:37:25.440]   and different forms of yohimbine, like alpha-yohimbine.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:27.320]   There are multiple forms of these things.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:29.100]   Now, I would go to examine.com
[01:37:29.100 --> 01:37:31.500]   to explore the different forms of yohimbine.
[01:37:31.500 --> 01:37:32.620]   About 10, 20 years ago,
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:35.200]   yohimbine was marketed primarily as a pro libido
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:37.400]   and pro erectile agent.
[01:37:37.400 --> 01:37:40.740]   Turns out it has very low efficacy for both of those things,
[01:37:40.740 --> 01:37:42.940]   but there are certain forms of yohimbine
[01:37:42.940 --> 01:37:46.900]   that act as stimulants that are effective
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.860]   and are separate from those claims and pathways.
[01:37:49.860 --> 01:37:52.700]   One particular form is called alpha-yohimbine.
[01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:55.740]   It sometimes goes by the name rauwolcine,
[01:37:55.740 --> 01:38:00.700]   and that's spelled R-A-U-W-O-L-S-C-I-N-E.
[01:38:00.700 --> 01:38:02.540]   Again, that's alpha-yohimbine,
[01:38:02.540 --> 01:38:04.260]   and it's used as a stimulant,
[01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:07.380]   often to also promote fat loss and alertness.
[01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:10.900]   I have to say that it's a very potent and somewhat
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:12.860]   precarious supplement.
[01:38:12.860 --> 01:38:15.380]   Some people experience a lot of anxiety on it.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:17.840]   That could also be because they tend to take it
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.820]   on either an empty stomach
[01:38:19.820 --> 01:38:22.780]   or in combination with subcaloric diets.
[01:38:22.780 --> 01:38:24.940]   It's sort of getting out on the edge of things
[01:38:24.940 --> 01:38:27.420]   that for some people can work not so well.
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:29.780]   For other people, they might actually find it
[01:38:29.780 --> 01:38:31.500]   to be a very effective stimulant.
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:34.380]   In general, in terms of supplement-based approaches
[01:38:34.380 --> 01:38:37.900]   to increase cognitive function and focus,
[01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:41.280]   caffeine, either in coffee or tea form
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:43.660]   or in tablet or capsule form,
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:46.740]   but at lower dosages than you would find in coffee and tea,
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:48.420]   I think is actually a reasonable way
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:51.660]   to explore stimulant-based approaches
[01:38:51.660 --> 01:38:55.140]   for enhancing cognitive function and focus.
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:56.500]   I mentioned all that not because I think
[01:38:56.500 --> 01:38:58.560]   that you probably already didn't know
[01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.600]   that caffeine can enhance alertness and focus.
[01:39:00.600 --> 01:39:02.940]   Most people already know that, and I acknowledge that,
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:04.620]   but rather as a contrast point
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:06.840]   for the other supplement-based approach
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:09.760]   for increasing cognitive function and focus,
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:14.000]   which is to increase certain neurotransmitter pathways
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.440]   that are not stimulant-based.
[01:39:16.440 --> 01:39:19.900]   So for instance, alpha-GPC,
[01:39:19.900 --> 01:39:21.920]   which is essentially a choline donor,
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:23.300]   acts in the pathways related
[01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:27.100]   to the neuromodulator acetylcholine and can enhance focus.
[01:39:27.100 --> 01:39:30.860]   So it dosages of anywhere from 300 to 600 milligrams.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:33.620]   People experience heightened levels of focus
[01:39:33.620 --> 01:39:36.740]   for sake of mental work or physical work.
[01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:40.100]   The half-life of alpha-GPC is about four to six hours,
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:41.940]   so it's relatively short lasting,
[01:39:41.940 --> 01:39:43.620]   although you wouldn't necessarily want
[01:39:43.620 --> 01:39:44.700]   to take it right before bed.
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:46.000]   I don't recommend that.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:47.340]   It is not a stimulant.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:50.620]   It tends to enhance focus by augmenting acetylcholine
[01:39:50.620 --> 01:39:53.020]   and acetylcholine pathways specifically.
[01:39:53.020 --> 01:39:54.500]   Now, it does create a little bit
[01:39:54.500 --> 01:39:56.620]   of an increase in alertness.
[01:39:56.620 --> 01:39:59.300]   So some people actually perceive it subjectively
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:03.500]   as an increase in overall stimulation,
[01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:06.200]   but it's different than a caffeine-type stimulant.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:09.460]   So for instance, 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams
[01:40:09.460 --> 01:40:13.340]   of alpha-GPC taken alone will allow people to be more focused
[01:40:13.340 --> 01:40:15.300]   but doesn't tend to make people feel jittery
[01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.520]   or overstimulated.
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:22.100]   Similarly, 500 milligrams to 1,000 milligrams
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:25.380]   or somewhere in between of something like L-tyrosine,
[01:40:25.380 --> 01:40:27.660]   which is an amino acid precursor to dopamine,
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:29.100]   a different neuromodulator,
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:32.580]   taken alone or in conjunction with, again,
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:34.740]   I believe in separating these things out by product,
[01:40:34.740 --> 01:40:36.740]   but I suppose you could take alpha-GPC
[01:40:36.740 --> 01:40:39.100]   and L-tyrosine together if you had already tried them
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:41.440]   separately and decided they worked well for you,
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:43.080]   and then you decided to combine them.
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.280]   What people tend to experience is that the cholinergic
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:50.340]   stimulation from alpha-GPC and the dopaminergic stimulation
[01:40:50.340 --> 01:40:54.380]   from L-tyrosine or simply L-tyrosine alone
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:58.380]   or alpha-GPC alone leads to increased levels of focus
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.500]   without the kind of overall feelings
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:02.400]   of stimulant-based alertness
[01:41:02.400 --> 01:41:04.380]   that one would experience with caffeine.
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:06.640]   And indeed, or I should say, of course,
[01:41:06.640 --> 01:41:09.100]   there are products out there and there are people out there
[01:41:09.100 --> 01:41:11.500]   that combine all three of these things together,
[01:41:11.500 --> 01:41:14.380]   caffeine, alpha-GPC, and L-tyrosine.
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:17.620]   And while I'm not suggesting that's a good or a bad thing,
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:20.740]   I would suggest that anytime you start to explore
[01:41:20.740 --> 01:41:23.640]   the cognitive enhancing effects
[01:41:23.640 --> 01:41:26.100]   and the focus enhancing effects of any supplement
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:28.180]   that you ask, which ones are stimulant?
[01:41:28.180 --> 01:41:30.840]   So for instance, caffeine and alpha-Uhimbine,
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:34.420]   which ones tend to tap more into neuromodulator systems
[01:41:34.420 --> 01:41:37.820]   like alpha-GPC and L-tyrosine,
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.940]   and to separate those out conceptually,
[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:43.540]   because whereas things like alpha-Uhimbine and caffeine
[01:41:43.540 --> 01:41:45.940]   will mostly serve the role of increasing levels
[01:41:45.940 --> 01:41:48.420]   of alertness, but not tightening your focus,
[01:41:48.420 --> 01:41:53.860]   things like alpha-GPC and L-tyrosine tend to serve the role
[01:41:53.860 --> 01:41:56.440]   of less elevation and alertness,
[01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:57.600]   but more tightening of focus.
[01:41:57.600 --> 01:41:59.840]   And this of course is why people often stack these
[01:41:59.840 --> 01:42:01.280]   and take them in combination.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.860]   So I think it's a very important distinction
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:04.440]   that most people aren't aware of.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:06.100]   And I'm not here to tell you
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:07.980]   that the stimulant-based approach
[01:42:07.980 --> 01:42:11.420]   or the neuromodulator-based approach is better or worse.
[01:42:11.420 --> 01:42:13.420]   They are simply different from one another.
[01:42:13.420 --> 01:42:15.800]   Although I will say that I think it is important
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:17.840]   to explore them separately
[01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.060]   if indeed you're going to explore any of them
[01:42:20.060 --> 01:42:23.400]   before you would start to combine them in a single formula.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:26.300]   Again, individual ingredients are going to be the way to go
[01:42:26.300 --> 01:42:28.540]   in terms of figuring out what's best for you.
[01:42:28.540 --> 01:42:30.660]   If anything, some people may find
[01:42:30.660 --> 01:42:32.420]   that even the slightest bit of caffeine
[01:42:32.420 --> 01:42:35.740]   or even the slightest bit of alpha-GPC or L-tyrosine
[01:42:35.740 --> 01:42:39.380]   just places them into a state of mind and or body
[01:42:39.380 --> 01:42:42.700]   that's just uncomfortable and not compatible
[01:42:42.700 --> 01:42:44.760]   with the kind of work that they want to do.
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:47.640]   Whereas other people, such as myself,
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:51.440]   regularly rely on taking 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:54.480]   It turns out more than that kind of doesn't work for me,
[01:42:54.480 --> 01:42:57.180]   or it tends to send my mind down a pathway
[01:42:57.180 --> 01:43:00.520]   that I don't like to be in for sake of cognitive work.
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:03.740]   But I will routinely take 300 milligrams of alpha-GPC
[01:43:03.740 --> 01:43:06.520]   prior to some cognitive work or prior to a workout.
[01:43:06.520 --> 01:43:08.660]   I do often combine that with some caffeine,
[01:43:08.660 --> 01:43:09.860]   not in capsule or pill form,
[01:43:09.860 --> 01:43:12.840]   but rather in the form of a cup of coffee or yerba mate.
[01:43:12.840 --> 01:43:16.440]   And it turns out that for me, just by way of example,
[01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.200]   L-tyrosine is something that works very powerfully
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.160]   to elevate my level of focus,
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:23.760]   but that I tend to crash pretty hard afterward.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:26.040]   And so I tend to err away from L-tyrosine,
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.780]   but some people tolerate it really well
[01:43:27.780 --> 01:43:29.080]   and actually really like it.
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:31.320]   I rely on something else for dopamine augmentation,
[01:43:31.320 --> 01:43:33.580]   which is phenylethylamine,
[01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:35.460]   which is a little bit more short lasting.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:38.000]   Again, I arrived at these protocols for myself
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.940]   by mixing and matching,
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:43.200]   but mostly by trying individual ingredients alone
[01:43:43.200 --> 01:43:46.400]   before combining them into any sort of cocktail
[01:43:46.400 --> 01:43:48.280]   before taking them before a workout
[01:43:48.280 --> 01:43:50.500]   or before a cognitive work bout.
[01:43:50.500 --> 01:43:52.540]   And I suggest that you explore them in the same way
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:54.020]   because that's going to deliver you
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:56.180]   to the best possible protocols for you,
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:58.500]   which only you can determine.
[01:43:58.500 --> 01:44:00.440]   And then of course, there's the category of supplements
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:03.780]   that can support cognitive function and focus,
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:06.300]   but that also touch on other general functions
[01:44:06.300 --> 01:44:08.120]   related to brain and body health,
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.520]   such as metabolic health, mood, et cetera.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.200]   And the one that comes to mind here
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.820]   are the omega-3 fatty acids.
[01:44:13.820 --> 01:44:16.280]   I've talked a lot about omega-3 fatty acids
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:18.500]   that are available in the form of foods.
[01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:20.720]   So for instance, fatty ocean fish,
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:23.500]   and there's certain plant-based sources for these as well,
[01:44:23.500 --> 01:44:25.520]   certain algaes and things of that sort.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.680]   Touched on this in the episodes on depression
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:28.900]   that I've done.
[01:44:28.900 --> 01:44:33.440]   But this topic mainly comes up around the issue of fish oil,
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.900]   fish oil capsules, and liquid.
[01:44:34.900 --> 01:44:38.000]   And this is a discussion I think is worth having.
[01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:39.080]   Early on in the episode,
[01:44:39.080 --> 01:44:40.720]   we talked about foundational nutrition
[01:44:40.720 --> 01:44:42.520]   and supplements that include
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:44.240]   a bunch of different ingredients.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:46.120]   We touched on the idea that some people
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:49.360]   might have the budget to take one such product
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:50.880]   or any number of different products
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.920]   that combine all those ingredients.
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:56.120]   I should say that for those that are interested
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:44:59.660]   in taking a supplement but have a lower budget
[01:44:59.660 --> 01:45:03.360]   than would allow for taking one of those general categories
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:05.120]   of supplements we talked about earlier
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:07.160]   for foundational nutrition that combines everything,
[01:45:07.160 --> 01:45:09.480]   vitamins, minerals, probiotics, prebiotics,
[01:45:09.480 --> 01:45:11.300]   adaptogens, digestive enzymes.
[01:45:11.300 --> 01:45:14.080]   I do think that there's a category of supplements
[01:45:14.080 --> 01:45:16.460]   that can greatly enhance the probability
[01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:18.320]   of offsetting depression
[01:45:18.320 --> 01:45:21.100]   and maybe even improve mood directly or indirectly.
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.220]   There's evidence for what I'm about to tell you
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:24.980]   within the scientific literature.
[01:45:24.980 --> 01:45:27.340]   And/or offset the amount of antidepressant medication
[01:45:27.340 --> 01:45:29.720]   that people need to take, that's also been demonstrated,
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:33.880]   and improve metabolic function, cardiovascular function,
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:37.540]   and also enhance our ability to do focused work.
[01:45:37.540 --> 01:45:39.440]   And here I'm referring to the so-called omega-3
[01:45:39.440 --> 01:45:43.220]   essential fatty acids, in particular the omega-3 form
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:44.580]   of the essential fatty acids.
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:47.640]   There's now a lot of data showing that ingesting
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:52.240]   one to three grams of EPA in particular
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.500]   in the form of either fish oil capsules or liquid
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:59.740]   can be beneficial for a number of different aspects
[01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:01.060]   of brain and body health
[01:46:01.060 --> 01:46:05.520]   and can enhance focus and cognitive ability.
[01:46:05.520 --> 01:46:08.760]   This is especially true in developing brains.
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:11.320]   And there's actually an extensive data out of a laboratory
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:12.920]   at the University of California, Santa Barbara
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.480]   talking about how mothers who supplement omega-3s,
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:17.960]   in particular the EPAs,
[01:46:17.960 --> 01:46:20.500]   although they also need to get the DHAs,
[01:46:20.500 --> 01:46:24.580]   that leads to greater brain weights and health of offspring.
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.220]   This is something we will definitely explore
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.900]   in a future episode, likely with an expert guest
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.820]   who's doing that work in that laboratory
[01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:32.360]   at UC Santa Barbara.
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:37.620]   The point here is that if somebody has a limited budget
[01:46:37.620 --> 01:46:39.740]   to purchase supplements
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:42.340]   and cannot afford a foundational supplement
[01:46:42.340 --> 01:46:43.900]   in the sort that we talked about earlier,
[01:46:43.900 --> 01:46:46.600]   athletic greens are similar, but they do have a budget
[01:46:46.600 --> 01:46:49.100]   that would allow them to purchase a high quality
[01:46:49.100 --> 01:46:52.160]   omega-3 fatty acid fish oil
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:54.840]   and to ingest it in quantity sufficient enough
[01:46:54.840 --> 01:46:58.200]   to get above that one gram of EPA per day.
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:46:59.320]   Again, this is really important.
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:02.120]   If you look at the product labels, you'll often see,
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:07.120]   1500 or 1600 milligrams of essential fatty acids.
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.280]   But the key is you get above that one gram of EPA
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:14.440]   per day threshold and as high as three grams per day.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:17.040]   We had a guest on this podcast, Dr. Rhonda Patrick,
[01:47:17.040 --> 01:47:19.080]   who takes anywhere from I believe three to four,
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.720]   maybe even more grams of EPA per day
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:23.920]   for a variety of reasons,
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.040]   including some of the reasons we're discussing now.
[01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:27.360]   Before we move on to discussing
[01:47:27.360 --> 01:47:28.920]   some of the more global themes related
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:31.920]   to developing a rational supplementation protocol,
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.640]   I do want to touch on this vast category of supplementation
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:39.160]   that includes food-based or food mimic type supplements.
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.420]   So this would be, for instance, whey proteins
[01:47:42.420 --> 01:47:45.600]   or milk proteins or egg proteins or plant proteins.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:48.160]   That's a discussion that in and of itself
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:50.060]   deserves an entire episode.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:53.340]   If you want to understand which types of protein
[01:47:53.340 --> 01:47:55.440]   and source of proteins are going to be
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:47:58.940]   the most bioavailable, the best for protein synthesis,
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:01.440]   for recovery from exercise, building muscle, et cetera,
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:04.600]   I'd like to refer you to a segment within the episode
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:05.960]   that I did with Dr. Lane Norton,
[01:48:05.960 --> 01:48:08.400]   where he talks about total protein needs per day.
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:12.420]   It's about one gram per pound of body weight per day
[01:48:12.420 --> 01:48:14.240]   for most people, although there's some variation
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:16.420]   depending on activity, et cetera.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:20.720]   And the quality of sourcing of those various proteins
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:22.160]   is extremely important.
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.960]   And that of course leads to a discussion
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.240]   about the quality and type of protein
[01:48:25.240 --> 01:48:27.440]   that would be present in a supplement
[01:48:27.440 --> 01:48:29.600]   like a whey protein supplement or casein,
[01:48:29.600 --> 01:48:32.320]   which is a milk protein based supplement.
[01:48:32.320 --> 01:48:36.080]   That discussion is segmented and timestamped
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:37.520]   in the episode that I did with him.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:39.160]   You can find it at hubermanlab.com.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:41.360]   He actually pointed to some interesting data
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:43.960]   on potato protein as perhaps being
[01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.480]   a great plant-based substitute
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.560]   for those that don't want to take whey-based protein.
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:50.680]   But the fact that whey-based proteins can be very useful
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:54.160]   for getting to and above a protein threshold
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.000]   for all sorts of reasons, not just for muscle building,
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:59.360]   although it's great for that,
[01:48:59.360 --> 01:49:01.760]   but for other purposes as well.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:05.600]   And that's but one category of food-based
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:07.680]   or food mimic type supplements.
[01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:10.400]   There are, for instance, branched-chain amino acids.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.920]   There are, for instance, green tea supplements.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:14.880]   There's a huge landscape of this,
[01:49:14.880 --> 01:49:16.480]   far too much for us to get into
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:19.800]   in any kind of reasonable detail.
[01:49:19.800 --> 01:49:23.060]   But I do want to acknowledge that those all exist.
[01:49:23.060 --> 01:49:25.140]   The key thing to understand is that
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:27.160]   while they can serve a great role
[01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:30.780]   in providing replacement for meals
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:33.980]   that you perhaps couldn't have consumed otherwise,
[01:49:33.980 --> 01:49:36.000]   and while they often are very convenient
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.100]   because you can drink as opposed to eat your calories,
[01:49:38.100 --> 01:49:40.200]   I think that most people would agree
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:44.640]   that getting some significant fraction of your nutrition
[01:49:44.640 --> 01:49:47.040]   from whole foods is going to be useful
[01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.060]   for a variety of reasons,
[01:49:48.060 --> 01:49:49.900]   in particular, the fiber that comes along with it,
[01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:53.000]   the bulk of the food that tends to make us feel sated,
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:56.080]   and of course, the fact that a lot of vitamins and minerals
[01:49:56.080 --> 01:49:58.320]   and other things that are contained within foods
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:00.360]   as well as essential fatty acids
[01:50:00.360 --> 01:50:02.180]   in foods like animal-based proteins
[01:50:02.180 --> 01:50:04.520]   are not going to be present in most,
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:07.820]   if not all of those kind of food mimic type powders
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:09.800]   and replacements for food.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.180]   Another point is this question about age-related effects.
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:17.280]   So for instance, should kids be taking supplements?
[01:50:17.280 --> 01:50:19.380]   Well, I mentioned earlier that there's some evidence
[01:50:19.380 --> 01:50:21.160]   that making sure that kids are getting enough
[01:50:21.160 --> 01:50:23.480]   omega-3 fatty acids can be beneficial.
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.320]   They certainly could get those from food-based sources.
[01:50:25.320 --> 01:50:26.960]   Just look up online food-based sources
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:31.040]   of omega-3 fatty acids and EPAs, and you'll see lists there.
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:33.800]   Some people choose to supplement on top of that,
[01:50:33.800 --> 01:50:36.820]   in particular, in kids that are developing very quickly.
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:39.420]   Regardless of whether or not
[01:50:39.420 --> 01:50:42.240]   they're consuming enough EPAs from food,
[01:50:42.240 --> 01:50:44.460]   some parents choose to supplement on top of that.
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:49.220]   I am personally not a fan of children taking melatonin
[01:50:49.220 --> 01:50:50.240]   for the reason that melatonin
[01:50:50.240 --> 01:50:52.220]   is already chronically elevated in kids,
[01:50:52.220 --> 01:50:54.340]   and there's a growing body of literature
[01:50:54.340 --> 01:50:57.040]   that melatonin supplementation in kids
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:59.140]   can be potentially harmful.
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:00.720]   I don't want to create alarm among those
[01:51:00.720 --> 01:51:02.880]   that have already been taking it or giving it to their kids
[01:51:02.880 --> 01:51:04.800]   or that gave it to their kids in the past,
[01:51:04.800 --> 01:51:07.920]   but I do think that melatonin in particular
[01:51:07.920 --> 01:51:09.800]   should be approached with a lot of caution,
[01:51:09.800 --> 01:51:11.840]   especially for kids.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.800]   And then of course, there's the issue
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:15.320]   of whether or not all these other supplements
[01:51:15.320 --> 01:51:16.160]   that we've discussed,
[01:51:16.160 --> 01:51:18.140]   whether or not kids can take them safely.
[01:51:18.140 --> 01:51:19.480]   And again, it's highly individual.
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:22.080]   I would say that for the supplements
[01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:25.920]   that relate to hormone augmentation and support,
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:29.260]   unless your physician, a board-certified MD,
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:30.920]   specifically recommends them,
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:34.720]   I would strongly suggest avoiding intake of those things
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:37.080]   until at least after puberty
[01:51:37.080 --> 01:51:40.520]   and probably into the late teens and early twenties,
[01:51:40.520 --> 01:51:42.600]   because the body and brain are still developing
[01:51:42.600 --> 01:51:44.560]   and hormone systems are still active.
[01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:48.420]   Even though puberty may happen between ages 11 and 14
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:51.360]   or even 15, puberty can be a long lasting event
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:54.280]   with a long taper and tail on it.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:57.840]   So you want to be cautious about augmenting hormones
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:59.920]   in young people through the use of supplementation,
[01:51:59.920 --> 01:52:02.620]   unless a physician is working very closely with you
[01:52:02.620 --> 01:52:04.300]   or rather you with them.
[01:52:04.300 --> 01:52:08.300]   And then in ages of say 22 years old, 24 and older,
[01:52:08.300 --> 01:52:11.580]   I don't see any reason why people who are in their fifties
[01:52:11.580 --> 01:52:13.780]   or sixties would have any different protocols
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:15.840]   than people in their thirties and forties,
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:18.360]   except perhaps in the domain of cognitive enhancement,
[01:52:18.360 --> 01:52:19.840]   where it might make sense,
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:22.160]   again, might provided it can be done safely
[01:52:22.160 --> 01:52:24.580]   and with the consult of a physician,
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:26.840]   it might be beneficial for people
[01:52:26.840 --> 01:52:28.300]   who are approaching their later years
[01:52:28.300 --> 01:52:30.320]   to consider increasing dosages
[01:52:30.320 --> 01:52:32.880]   or the variety of things and approaches that they take
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:34.200]   for cognitive enhancement,
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:37.780]   because age-related cognitive decline is a reality.
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.820]   There is no person that escapes that.
[01:52:39.820 --> 01:52:42.120]   The question is whether or not the slope of that decline
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.120]   is very steep or very shallow.
[01:52:44.120 --> 01:52:46.940]   And of course, this is an opportunity for me to raise
[01:52:46.940 --> 01:52:48.640]   the point that I made much earlier
[01:52:48.640 --> 01:52:50.000]   and that I'll make over and over again,
[01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:52.440]   because it really is the most important point
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:53.360]   to today's discussion,
[01:52:53.360 --> 01:52:58.360]   which is that behaviors, both exercise, sleep,
[01:52:58.360 --> 01:53:00.900]   making sure that your relationship to light,
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:03.280]   getting sufficient sunlight early in the day
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:05.040]   and throughout the day, if you can,
[01:53:05.040 --> 01:53:08.520]   and limiting your viewing of bright artificial light
[01:53:08.520 --> 01:53:09.560]   in the late evening,
[01:53:09.560 --> 01:53:12.080]   and especially between the hours of 10 PM and 4 AM,
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:15.120]   things of that sort, all the dos and don'ts.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:17.000]   And of course, cardiovascular exercise
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:18.360]   and resistance training exercise,
[01:53:18.360 --> 01:53:21.200]   and maybe even flexibility training exercise,
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:23.360]   topics we've covered extensively on this podcast
[01:53:23.360 --> 01:53:26.120]   and for which we will soon have a special series airing
[01:53:26.120 --> 01:53:28.680]   with Dr. Andy Galpin that gets into a lot of detail
[01:53:28.680 --> 01:53:31.840]   and protocol development that you can all employ.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:35.800]   All of that needs to be done at every age,
[01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:37.560]   certainly past puberty,
[01:53:37.560 --> 01:53:40.920]   in order to maximize cognitive function,
[01:53:40.920 --> 01:53:43.200]   in order to maximize cardiovascular function,
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.400]   in order to maximize focus,
[01:53:45.400 --> 01:53:49.120]   and every aspect that we really all stand to
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:52.420]   and want to enhance when we think about supplementation.
[01:53:52.420 --> 01:53:54.160]   So again, get your sleep right,
[01:53:54.160 --> 01:53:56.520]   do that by getting your relationship to light right,
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:53:59.240]   get your exercise right, quality social connection right,
[01:53:59.240 --> 01:54:01.120]   and then of course, there's that landscape of nutrition
[01:54:01.120 --> 01:54:03.120]   that we talked about extensively earlier
[01:54:03.120 --> 01:54:05.760]   and for which we have other episodes that really dive deep,
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:08.520]   including that episode, or I should say in particular,
[01:54:08.520 --> 01:54:10.200]   that episode with Dr. Elaine Norton,
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:12.320]   where we really took a full survey
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:13.820]   of the landscape of nutrition,
[01:54:13.820 --> 01:54:15.040]   everything from protein needs,
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:17.480]   vitamins, minerals, fiber, microbiome,
[01:54:17.480 --> 01:54:19.940]   it's a deep, deep discussion
[01:54:19.940 --> 01:54:21.840]   with a lot of actionable takeaways.
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:23.720]   If you're curious about nutrition,
[01:54:23.720 --> 01:54:27.000]   and in particular, if you're a vegan or vegetarian
[01:54:27.000 --> 01:54:28.460]   or a carnivore based,
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:31.720]   but even for the more common omnivores, such as myself,
[01:54:31.720 --> 01:54:34.700]   I found that to be an incredible learning journey,
[01:54:34.700 --> 01:54:36.120]   thanks to Dr. Elaine Norton,
[01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:39.720]   just so much useful knowledge in that episode,
[01:54:39.720 --> 01:54:41.600]   if you want to learn more about nutrition.
[01:54:41.600 --> 01:54:43.800]   The behavioral tools, the nutritional tools,
[01:54:43.800 --> 01:54:46.240]   are really going to serve as the primary two layers
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:49.280]   upon which your supplementation protocols are going to rest.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:50.440]   And again, I want to emphasize
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:54.120]   that your supplementation protocol may be zero supplements.
[01:54:54.120 --> 01:54:56.280]   It could include no supplements whatsoever,
[01:54:56.280 --> 01:54:57.560]   and that would be perfectly fine,
[01:54:57.560 --> 01:54:59.760]   provided that you're sleeping as well as you want to
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:01.800]   and need to, you're able to focus and work
[01:55:01.800 --> 01:55:02.960]   as well as you want to and need to,
[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.920]   you're able to perform physically
[01:55:04.920 --> 01:55:05.940]   as well as you want to and need to,
[01:55:05.940 --> 01:55:08.680]   and you feel that your hormones and related functions
[01:55:08.680 --> 01:55:10.120]   are where you want them.
[01:55:10.120 --> 01:55:15.040]   However, for most people who are doing most everything right
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:18.900]   they want to explore how they can make things
[01:55:18.900 --> 01:55:20.960]   like their sleep, their focus,
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:22.760]   their hormone function even better,
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:25.200]   and that's where supplementation makes a lot of sense.
[01:55:25.200 --> 01:55:26.320]   And when I say makes a lot of sense,
[01:55:26.320 --> 01:55:27.400]   I mean it makes a lot of sense
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:30.200]   to explore in a rational and regimented way.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.340]   There are a couple of big themes
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:33.800]   that we've talked about a few times during today's podcast
[01:55:33.800 --> 01:55:35.420]   that I'd like to reiterate now,
[01:55:35.420 --> 01:55:36.600]   because they are so crucial
[01:55:36.600 --> 01:55:39.660]   to developing a rational supplementation protocol.
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:41.120]   The most important of which is,
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:44.520]   unless we're talking about foundational nutritional support,
[01:55:44.520 --> 01:55:47.700]   that is coverage of vitamins, minerals, digestive enzymes,
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:50.320]   probiotics, prebiotics, and adaptogens,
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:52.880]   we should really be focusing
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:55.060]   on single ingredient formulations.
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:55:57.400]   Foundational supplements that include all those things
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:01.040]   I just listed off, all combined in one supplement are fine.
[01:56:01.040 --> 01:56:03.800]   I simply don't see any other practical or reasonable way
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.120]   to get each and every one of those things
[01:56:06.120 --> 01:56:08.160]   through single ingredient formulations.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.120]   However, when you want to start thinking about
[01:56:10.120 --> 01:56:12.320]   and actually practically exploring
[01:56:12.320 --> 01:56:13.920]   things like supplementation for sleep
[01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:16.200]   or hormone health or cognitive function,
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:17.580]   the single ingredient formulations
[01:56:17.580 --> 01:56:20.300]   are going to give you the most power and control.
[01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:21.760]   They're going to make sure
[01:56:21.760 --> 01:56:23.560]   that you can find the minimal effective doses,
[01:56:23.560 --> 01:56:27.000]   that you can rule out things that are not effective for you
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:31.520]   or that may be detrimental for you in whatever fashion.
[01:56:31.520 --> 01:56:34.400]   And it's not just about cost-effectiveness,
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.820]   it's also about arriving at small kits
[01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:39.560]   or cocktails of supplements
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:41.840]   that you can really manage and work with,
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:43.280]   that you're not dependent on,
[01:56:43.280 --> 01:56:46.280]   but that you really feel can augment the various aspects
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:48.020]   of your health that are important to you.
[01:56:48.020 --> 01:56:50.160]   So that's really what today's episode is about.
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:52.400]   Even though we had coverage of specific supplements
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.560]   and their functions in these different domains
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.560]   of mental and physical health and performance,
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:56:58.520]   today's episode was really geared
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:01.480]   toward giving you resources and a framework
[01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:03.940]   to think about how to approach supplementation,
[01:57:03.940 --> 01:57:05.720]   how to navigate sticking points
[01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.700]   and pain points in supplementation,
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:11.040]   how to get the most out of your supplementation regimen
[01:57:11.040 --> 01:57:13.100]   without spending an excessive amount of money
[01:57:13.100 --> 01:57:15.580]   and if you don't have finances
[01:57:15.580 --> 01:57:18.320]   to allow for a lot of exploration of supplements,
[01:57:18.320 --> 01:57:20.900]   how to narrow in on the most effective supplements
[01:57:20.900 --> 01:57:24.640]   the most quickly and derive all the benefits
[01:57:24.640 --> 01:57:26.320]   that you can from them.
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:29.080]   And as a final point that is redundant
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:30.720]   with a few of the themes we talked about today,
[01:57:30.720 --> 01:57:34.020]   but that I don't think I ever really explicitly stated
[01:57:34.020 --> 01:57:37.380]   is that while the word supplement makes it sound
[01:57:37.380 --> 01:57:41.740]   like these compounds are something just to add on top of
[01:57:41.740 --> 01:57:44.120]   or compensate for deficiencies in nutrition
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:45.660]   or other areas of your life,
[01:57:45.660 --> 01:57:49.400]   many of them are actually quite potent compounds.
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:53.420]   These are potent non-prescription molecules
[01:57:53.420 --> 01:57:55.320]   that really can move the needle
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:57.680]   in terms of your ability to think more clearly,
[01:57:57.680 --> 01:58:00.720]   sleep better, support your hormone function.
[01:58:00.720 --> 01:58:03.760]   But as always, they are just one element
[01:58:03.760 --> 01:58:06.540]   within an ecosystem of other factors,
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:09.600]   such as your behaviors, which includes do's and don'ts,
[01:58:09.600 --> 01:58:13.200]   such as your nutrition, maybe even such as prescription drugs
[01:58:13.200 --> 01:58:15.080]   that you also might happen to be taking
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:18.620]   or hoping to be taking less of or removing completely.
[01:58:18.620 --> 01:58:21.120]   Again, that has to be done in discussion with physicians
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.760]   if you're going to do it at all.
[01:58:22.760 --> 01:58:26.520]   But the real point here is that what we call supplements
[01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:29.840]   are actually a powerful gear within a larger system
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:33.600]   aimed at each and every one of us customizing tools
[01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:36.320]   for our mental, physical health, and performance.

[01:59:02.320 --> 01:59:04.460]   at the beginning and throughout today's episode.
[01:59:04.460 --> 01:59:07.140]   That's the best way to support this podcast.
[01:59:07.140 --> 01:59:09.560]   During today's podcast and on many previous episodes
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:12.560]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast, we discuss supplements.
[01:59:12.560 --> 01:59:14.680]   Again, while supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[01:59:14.680 --> 01:59:17.600]   many people can derive tremendous benefit from them.
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:19.700]   We've partnered with Momentous Supplements
[01:59:19.700 --> 01:59:22.400]   because Momentous Supplements are of extremely high quality,
[01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:24.200]   they have single ingredient formulations,
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:26.000]   and they ship internationally
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.360]   because we know many of you reside
[01:59:27.360 --> 01:59:28.960]   outside of the United States.
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:30.480]   If you'd like to learn more about the supplements
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:32.480]   discussed on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:34.920]   please go to Live Momentous, spelled O-U-S,

[01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:47.340]   I cover science and science-related tools,
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:49.160]   some of which overlap with the contents
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:50.700]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:52.580]   much of which is distinct, however,
[01:59:52.580 --> 01:59:54.340]   from the contents of the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:57.420]   Again, it's @hubermanlab on all social media platforms.
[01:59:57.420 --> 01:59:59.140]   And if you haven't already subscribed
[01:59:59.140 --> 02:00:00.780]   to our neural network newsletter,
[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:03.420]   it's a zero-cost monthly newsletter.

[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:06.740]   by going to hubermanlab.com.
[02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:09.340]   The newsletter includes summaries of podcast episodes.
[02:00:09.340 --> 02:00:12.360]   We have toolkits for sleep, toolkits for focus,
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:14.460]   toolkits related to deliberate cold exposure,
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:16.160]   heat exposure, and much, much more.
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:17.760]   Again, all zero cost.
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:19.180]   You provide your email to sign up.
[02:00:19.180 --> 02:00:21.140]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:23.240]   There are also sample newsletters there
[02:00:23.240 --> 02:00:24.480]   that you don't even need to sign up for.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:25.700]   You can just download the PDF
[02:00:25.700 --> 02:00:28.460]   or just view them on your computer or phone screen.
[02:00:28.460 --> 02:00:29.820]   So thank you once again for joining me
[02:00:29.820 --> 02:00:32.420]   for today's discussion, all about supplementation,
[02:00:32.420 --> 02:00:35.100]   and more importantly, how to develop a rational
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:38.300]   and especially effective supplementation protocol for you.
[02:00:38.300 --> 02:00:40.820]   And last, but certainly not least,
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:42.460]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:00:42.460 --> 02:00:45.040]   [upbeat music]
[02:00:45.040 --> 02:00:47.620]   (upbeat music)
