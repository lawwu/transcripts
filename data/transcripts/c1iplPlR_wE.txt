[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.880]   Well, isn't a drug user and a God-were joy seeker just two different kinds of junkies
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.120]   both seeking after a new high, a new spike in an experience for which they cannot sustain
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.960]   beyond a fleeting moment?
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.720]   Well, now there's an interesting question and it comes to us from a listener named Brian.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.120]   "Hello Pastor John, I live in Greenville, not far from where you grew up.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.960]   My question is one I've wrestled with for a long time.
[00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.080]   How is there not any difference between 1) returning to substances like drugs, alcohol,
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.640]   and sex once the fulfillment of those things has withered away, and 2) returning to Jesus
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.680]   once His joy has withered away in us?
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.800]   It appears as if both things, substances on one hand and communion with Christ on the
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.400]   other, offer effects that then wear off over time, neither permanently fulfill, both call
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.760]   us back for another dose or hit.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.260]   How would you respond to this apparent parallel?
[00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.720]   Is it right or wrong?"
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.240]   It's wrong.
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.240]   It's wrong.
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.960]   It's wrong in all the ways that ultimately matter.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.760]   Now of course, Brian, there is a surface parallel that you're pointing out.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:20.340]   It's true that the intensity of our pleasure in physical experiences and the intensity
[00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:28.000]   of our pleasure in spiritual experience of fellowship with Jesus both rise and fall.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.540]   There's a parallel.
[00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.740]   Both rise and fall.
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:39.280]   Pleasures go up, pleasures go down in drugs and in relation to Jesus.
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.900]   In this life, while we are still in this body and while indwelling sin remains a reality,
[00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.280]   there will be, till we die, a conflict between flesh and spirit, Satan and God, old man that
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.400]   needs to be reckoned dead, and new man in Christ.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:03.460]   So there is a superficial parallel between the experience of Christ and our experience
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.440]   of physical pleasure.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.320]   They both rise and fall.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:16.140]   But in spite of that superficial parallel, there are at least four profound differences
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.900]   between our communion with Christ and all of his pleasures and our physical high from
[00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.200]   substances.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:33.460]   Number one, Jesus Christ is a living, eternal, supernatural, divine, morally beautiful person.
[00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.460]   We love him.
[00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.620]   He's not a thing.
[00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.620]   He's not a substance.
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.580]   There is an infinite difference between encountering a person and the physical material impersonal
[00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.580]   effect of drugs.
[00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.520]   And there's an infinite difference between encountering a merely human person and encountering
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.040]   a divine person, the Son of God.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:04.300]   When Jesus calls us, he calls us to himself, not to a generic experience that can be duplicated
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.820]   with substances.
[00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:13.740]   He calls us not into a physical reaction to substance, but into a personal relationship
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.140]   with himself.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.060]   Jesus said, "I am the bread of life.
[00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.460]   I am the bread of life.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.860]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.540]   Whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.820]   He is the bread.
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.860]   He is the water.
[00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.720]   We're not comparing substance and substance.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.580]   We are comparing a created substance with the person who created it.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.540]   That's the first difference—massive, infinite.
[00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:51.320]   Number two, the second difference in the parallel is that the experience itself is qualitatively
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:56.700]   different between the physical and psychological effects of a drug on the one hand and the
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.180]   spiritual effects of communion with Christ on the other.
[00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.280]   Paul said, "If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.840]   The old has passed away.
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:15.600]   Behold, the new creation has come."
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   2 Corinthians 5:17.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.780]   When you use drugs, you are not a new creation.
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.640]   You're not born again by using drugs.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.240]   You do not have a new nature by using drugs.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:36.960]   When you are united to Christ by faith, you become a new kind of being forever and ever
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.140]   and ever.
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.080]   And your experiences are qualitatively different.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.760]   You're not yet perfect, but you are being renewed.
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.900]   Ephesians 4:23, "You are being renewed in the spirit of your mind."
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.800]   Your mind is now spiritually, qualitatively doing a different thing.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:06.520]   Number three, the third difference between the experience of a drug and the experience
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:15.900]   of communion with Christ is that the reason we keep returning to Christ is because he
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:25.420]   himself, as a person who loves us, has chosen to make sure that we return.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.980]   We're not being sucked back by addiction.
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.820]   We are being drawn back by a Savior.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:38.580]   He has laid hold of us and made us his own forever.
[00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.540]   He does not bring us back mechanically, but personally.
[00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:47.260]   Listen to this, one of my favorite verses, Philippians 3:12, "Not that I have already
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.500]   obtained this or am already perfect, I press on to make it my own."
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   You could paraphrase that.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.020]   I press into Jesus again and again.
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:05.220]   I press back in again and again because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:08.220]   He has personally owned me, bought me.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.460]   When he sees me drifting away, becoming lukewarm, he draws me back because he's made me his
[00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.460]   own.
[00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:16.920]   And here's number four.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:25.620]   The more we are brought to him by his personally compelling beauty, the more we become like
[00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.240]   what he created us to be.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.020]   We are being transformed from one degree of glory to the next by coming back to Jesus
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:39.140]   and seeing him again and again and again until our fellowship is totally unbroken when he
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:42.380]   comes or when we go.
[00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:53.820]   The more we return to him, the more we fully become whole and rational and free and joyful.
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:00.780]   But the more we return to substances, the more we become broken, irrational, enslaved,
[00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:02.980]   and miserable.
[00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:10.940]   In other words, coming to Jesus makes us more alive, more real, more able to put ourselves
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.180]   resourcefully at the disposal of others for their everlasting good.
[00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:22.220]   John 7, 37, "The water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water,
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.220]   welling up to eternal life."
[00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.180]   Or John—oh, that was John 4, 14.
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.620]   Here's John 7.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:32.700]   "If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.
[00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:37.540]   Whoever believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of
[00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:38.540]   living water."
[00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:47.260]   In other words, drinking from Jesus doesn't draw us into ourselves and make our own private
[00:07:47.260 --> 00:07:49.580]   substance experience.
[00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:59.820]   It fills us with overflowing, spring-like, fountain-like love for others and capacities,
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.380]   new capacities to love others.
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.620]   And then maybe I should add one more fifth difference.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:14.260]   The fact that there is a superficial parallel between the ups and downs of experiencing
[00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:19.820]   Jesus and the ups and downs of experiencing drugs, the fact that there's that superficial
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:27.560]   similarity, parallel, may mean something very different than that the experiences are leading
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:29.620]   to the same outcome.
[00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:31.060]   They aren't.
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:36.700]   Suppose you suddenly experience a spiking fever which fades slightly and then spikes
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:42.140]   again and then fades slightly and then spikes again, and you suddenly realize because of
[00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:46.580]   the epidemic in the town, you've got a fatal disease.
[00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:48.940]   You are going to die.
[00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.980]   That's what happens to everybody.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:55.540]   Spike, fade, spike, fade, spike, fade, die.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.220]   This spiking is a sure sign you're a goner.
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:08.820]   Then the medical team arrives, sent by some merciful Red Cross, and they've got an antibiotic,
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:09.820]   and it works.
[00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:11.940]   It always works.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.740]   And they give it to you.
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:20.420]   And they tell you, "Now, you're going to notice tomorrow that the fever will rise, and then
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.420]   it will fall, and then it will rise again a little less high, then it will fall, and
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:31.100]   then it will rise, and then it will fall, and then it will go away.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.220]   You'll become better.
[00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:39.880]   When it falls, you'll become better, even though the return of the fever tomorrow several
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.300]   times will make you think you're in the same position you were before, and you're not.
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.380]   That's a superficial parallel.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:50.980]   It's not where you're going.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.020]   That's the way antibiotics work.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:55.300]   You're going to be well."
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:03.700]   The same similarity with the spiking and falling of pleasure in drugs and the spiking and falling
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.420]   of pleasure in Christ.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:11.940]   The ups and downs have a totally different meaning.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:15.540]   You're on your way to healing in Christ.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:24.520]   So it is the ups and downs of our experience in Christ that mean we are on the way to an
[00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:27.620]   everlasting, uninterrupted joy.
[00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:28.620]   Amen.
[00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:30.900]   Yes, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:34.980]   And this is our 48th episode on the theme of joy.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.340]   We talk a lot about joy because it's at the very heart of what we do at Desiring God.
[00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:45.300]   You can find all of those past episodes in our archive at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.

[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:15.900]   Well, every penny we own is God's money.
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:19.340]   And that profound reality raises all sorts of questions about stewardship.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.900]   So how do we live as though our money is all his?
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.820]   It's a great question coming up on Monday.
[00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:25.820]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke.
