[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   - Mom? - Yeah?
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.760]   - How much longer? - Ask the car, Ben.
[00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hey Mercedes, what's our ETA?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   - 12 minutes.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Mom? - Mm?
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.760]   - Is it gonna rain? - Ask the car.
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.140]   - Hey Mercedes, what's the forecast?
[00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.300]   - Sunny all day.
[00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.760]   - Mom, can I get a tattoo?
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.760]   - Ask the ca-- Nice try.

[00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.300]   - Welcome to Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.880]   My name is Joshua Sheets, and today on the show,
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.880]   I'd like to give you just a quick personal report
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.640]   on the recently concluded inaugural
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.480]   Radical Personal Finance Family Camp.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.720]   Been about a week and a half now
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.200]   since we wrapped up the inaugural RPF Family Camp
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.060]   in Seymour, Indiana,
[00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.120]   and I wanted just to share with you publicly
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.440]   a little bit about it.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440]   Some of you were able to come,
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.400]   but of course many of you weren't able to come,
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.080]   and I thought I owe you,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.240]   since I talked to you and told you
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.440]   it was gonna be happening,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.560]   I wanted to give you a public report
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.500]   and just share with you a little bit about the event
[00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.940]   and how it went.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.480]   Put simply, I was enormously satisfied with the event.
[00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.560]   Hosting an in-person, what I call a family camp,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.200]   hosting an in-person event in the way that we did it
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.240]   is something that I have wanted to do for a very long time.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.040]   It's my basic working hypothesis
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.440]   that going forward in the coming years,
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.440]   the best and most satisfying relationships
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.620]   are going to be those that exploit all of the wonder
[00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.280]   and goodness and usefulness and convenience
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.200]   and just fantasticness of digital connectivity,
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.060]   as well as all of the wonderful fantasticness
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.680]   of in-person relationships.
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.680]   The trend that I've observed for quite a while
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.680]   is that it's very difficult to run effectively
[00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.820]   an all-virtual company.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.740]   It's possible.
[00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.780]   You may run a department and be leading a team
[00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.380]   of a dozen computer coders and engineers
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.640]   spread out all around the world,
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.080]   and you can do that sort of effectively
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.420]   from many different places,
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.560]   but it's really hard to do that effectively
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.940]   if you're not building in-person relationships,
[00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.980]   real in-person relationships.
[00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.900]   On the other hand, it's difficult sometimes
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.580]   for us to be completely surrounded at all times
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.720]   with the kind of people that we'd like to be together
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.940]   with in physical space at all times.
[00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.300]   We all have different reasons why we live where we live,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.040]   and it can be hard to find like-minded people
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.060]   in a local area.
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.760]   And so I believe that the best possible outcome
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.520]   for us going forward in the future
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.480]   is to try to maximize both of these things.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.400]   And so if you're running a company or a department
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.860]   where you have people spread out around the world,
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.980]   I think your best practice would generally be
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.380]   to at least a couple times a year
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:55.500]   bring your entire team together for several days,
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.900]   enough time to engage in real activities,
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.820]   real business, real productive meetings,
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.600]   but also lots of time just to hang out
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.460]   in a casual unstructured format.
[00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.780]   And that's something that I,
[00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.340]   that's a principle that I think also applies
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.740]   to what I've wanted to do at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.220]   For a long time, I've had a dream and a vision
[00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.340]   of bringing together like-minded people
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.300]   who want to just spend time together,
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.140]   want to build friendships and relationships.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:28.860]   And I think that having something like this show
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.180]   that allows a good form of connectedness
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.460]   is an ideal way to advance ideas,
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.940]   create thought-provoking content,
[00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.260]   teach people effectively about certain things,
[00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.060]   but that we should go the next step forward
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.540]   and bring people together in person.
[00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.220]   Unfortunately, while it's been my dream
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.860]   for a significant amount of time,
[00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.860]   my wife and I have been busy
[00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:53.660]   with a bunch of little babies in our house.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.100]   And due to the demands of taking care of babies,
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.980]   it just wasn't something that I've been able
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.900]   to effectively accomplish.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.420]   If we were to go all the way back to 2017,
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.240]   I started, actually about 2014,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.720]   I started meeting up with people at events
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.980]   that I would go to.
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.420]   Then again, we started to have a few babies
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.700]   and I stopped going to so many events.
[00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.300]   And then after that, we traveled across the country in 2018.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.480]   And one of the dreams that I had of that trip
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.220]   was to host meetups everywhere we went.
[00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:24.900]   I was gonna go from city to city to city.
[00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.620]   We were gonna have our RV and we were gonna host meetups.
[00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.820]   As it turns out, we did it a few times,
[00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.180]   but it was simply too difficult
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.300]   to figure out the logistics of it.
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.820]   And it was also difficult when coming together
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.860]   for a meetup of just say a three or four hour event,
[00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:42.020]   it was difficult for there to be enough time
[00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.820]   for me to interact effectively with the listener,
[00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.860]   with all of you in the way that I really enjoy.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.020]   I want to interact with people,
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.860]   but it's difficult to do it in an environment
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.860]   where let's say I'm there for two or three hours
[00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:59.220]   and there's 20, 30, 40 people.
[00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.000]   That leads to just doing the math,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.940]   a conversation of two or three or four or five minutes each.
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.180]   And I've done that in many cities around the United States
[00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.340]   and just found that I really love meeting people,
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.620]   but it's hard to have the kind of connection
[00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:11.940]   that I would like to have
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.140]   of being able to spend a few days together.
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.100]   And so one of the goals that I've had
[00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.940]   as we've been getting out of Babyville
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:21.980]   and I've been able to get things squared away
[00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:26.980]   to where I can travel again and I can do this kind of thing,
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:28.060]   one of the goals that I've had
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.660]   is to do more in-person events.
[00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.420]   And it started with the event that I did in Panama
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:34.300]   a few months ago with Mikel Thorup.
[00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.660]   That was fantastic.
[00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:38.040]   Really loved getting to know my listeners that came
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.660]   and we were able to hang out together
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.180]   for almost a week on a pretty deep level.
[00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.180]   And just all the time together was great.
[00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.280]   We did all kinds of events and presentations and classes,
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.960]   but more importantly or more fun,
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.140]   we just go for cocktails on the rooftop at Casco Viejo
[00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:54.780]   or go and travel on the bus together.
[00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:57.080]   And it gave us time to talk about anything and everything
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.300]   and really get to know one another.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.880]   And it was a really, a really wonderful experience for me
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.400]   and a really wonderful experience for all of my listeners
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:07.560]   who came to that event.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.240]   And so then I was excited to follow that up
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.040]   with the Radical Personal Finance Family Camp,
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.840]   because one of the challenges simply
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.480]   is that I don't want my business life to be isolated
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.880]   and for me to go away and do my business thing
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:21.560]   and leave my family behind.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:23.840]   One of the reasons I always had for building
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.440]   the kind of business that I run
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:28.320]   is to have something like a family integrated business.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.800]   While I will always do the main work,
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.360]   I want to use my business as a strategic part of my life
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:37.720]   and lifestyle and family.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.720]   I want my wife to be involved with it.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.720]   I want her to be able to have opportunities
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.760]   to express her skills and talents
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.120]   in the context of business.
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.900]   I want my children to be able to be involved
[00:06:47.900 --> 00:06:48.880]   with my business.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.040]   I want my business to be something that gives us a platform
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.400]   for them to learn important skills that are necessary
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.120]   for their long-term growth and their success.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.880]   I, of course, want to use my business
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:01.700]   to pay all of the relevant people
[00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.580]   and enjoy some of the tax benefits that can come
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.800]   from hiring family members, employees,
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:07.920]   and all of that stuff too.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.920]   But more importantly, it's just the training aspects for me.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.080]   I don't think that children should be segregated
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:18.080]   from society and locked away in armed compounds
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.920]   where they're just separated from society.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   I think that the natural place for children
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.960]   and young people is to be integrated into society
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:31.500]   in an age-diffuse way where they're interacting
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:32.680]   with people of their own age
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:35.280]   and also people of varying ages, younger, older.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.400]   I think that's the healthiest environment
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.200]   for human beings to be in.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.320]   And so for me, my business has always formed
[00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.760]   an important part of my plan to do that.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:47.600]   It's just that it's hard to do that with babies.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.240]   You've got to get out of baby stage.
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:52.660]   So Radical Personal Finance Family Camp was, for me,
[00:07:52.660 --> 00:07:56.480]   just an enormously important part of my long-term plan
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.960]   and enormously important part of what I wanted to do.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.360]   It never would have happened, however,
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:05.640]   if it weren't for a long-time listener to the show
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:08.280]   and personal friend of mine
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:11.800]   who basically took away all my excuses.
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.640]   I told the story,
[00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.120]   and I'm not gonna tell the story here publicly
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.320]   'cause I told it at the camp,
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.560]   and we'll leave some things for it.
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.680]   But a friend of mine basically arranged all the details
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.320]   and said, "Joshua, I think we should do a camp,
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:22.920]   "and I've made it easy for you."
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.360]   And he made it so easy for me, I couldn't say no.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:27.600]   What we didn't know, however, going into the camp
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.320]   was exactly what to offer.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.040]   As you might guess and understand,
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.440]   when you're gonna create something,
[00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:36.180]   you have to offer something to the market
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:38.280]   and see what the market says to it.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.920]   And you can do customer research, you can do surveys,
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.960]   you can talk to people, but at the end of the day,
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:47.620]   it's hard to understand exactly what the market wants
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:51.640]   until you offer it and see who buys and see what happens.
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.840]   And even if you can do great customer research
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:57.800]   about what people want,
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:00.320]   in reality, you still have to go through the process
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.000]   of creating something, offering it to the market,
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   and seeing what people actually pay for.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.080]   Because sometimes what people say they want
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.320]   and then what they really want are different,
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:13.800]   and you know that based upon people who click buy
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:16.000]   and send you money.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.460]   I think it was Henry Ford who said,
[00:09:17.460 --> 00:09:18.640]   "If I'd asked the people what they wanted,
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:20.760]   "they would have all said a faster horse."
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.400]   Sometimes we don't know exactly what we want.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.200]   So in creating this camp, what our idea was
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.560]   was to create an event that would focus
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:32.400]   on bringing people together to build relationships,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:35.520]   but then would also provide some justification
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.880]   of excuses for being together in order and structure
[00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.120]   for the events.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.160]   So we came up with the idea
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:45.300]   of basically a four-day, three-night event,
[00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.840]   starting on Thursday, going through till Sunday.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.760]   And we tried to put together a diverse track of activities.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.280]   So I taught some classes on finance,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:59.600]   tried to keep it somewhat general and broad
[00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:01.280]   so that I would have the ability to respond
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.920]   to the questions that were in the room.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:03.800]   Rather than making this,
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.920]   I didn't create a hyper-specialized tax seminars
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.320]   or hyper-specialized asset protection seminar.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.880]   Just tried to keep it broad and inclusive
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.280]   so that I could respond to whatever was in the room
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.920]   and questions that were there.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.320]   Then we put together what we called a lifestyle track.
[00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:21.680]   And what we were imagining is wanting to build
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:23.720]   something that would be appealing to families.
[00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:27.080]   So I was imagining that if your relationships,
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.360]   your relationship with your wife or husband
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:30.640]   is anything like mine,
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:33.060]   I'm interested in finance and my wife, not so much.
[00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:35.440]   And so we thought, well, how could we create something
[00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:37.200]   that would be appealing to couples
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.280]   where one person is interested in one thing
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:41.120]   and the other person interested in something else?
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.880]   And so we created what we called a lifestyle track.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:48.880]   And we tried to come up with a list of seminars and classes
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:52.200]   that would be appealing to different people
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:55.240]   based upon the kinds of things that are appealing to me
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:56.720]   and the kinds of things that I talk about
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.340]   and figuring that you guys are probably something like me
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:02.400]   and interested in similar things.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.000]   Then we tried to create something
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.120]   that would be attractive for people of varying ages.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.600]   So of course, I'm middle-aged
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.560]   and we have some things that were helpful
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.160]   for middle-aged and older people.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:15.040]   Then we tried to create some stuff for younger people.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:17.700]   We wound up having a wonderful teenage entrepreneur
[00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:20.860]   who has created a very successful business.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.440]   Come and make presentations
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.720]   and that was of special interest
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.520]   to our teens and young people.
[00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.960]   And then we created all kinds of camp activities
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.680]   for younger children.
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:34.000]   Because the way that we hosted this particular event
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.040]   was that I rented an entire basically church camp facility.
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   Little bit in the off season, it was springtime.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.400]   So it was kind of a guess
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.240]   of what the weather would turn out to be.
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.640]   But that was when we were able to get the facility.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.640]   So it worked out really well.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:52.840]   And I'm just thankful to you guys.
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:56.440]   The first entire camp that we had rented,
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:58.760]   the first entire thing sold out in less than a week.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.500]   It was six days and I sold the last one,
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.000]   last spot that we had available,
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.880]   which was just amazingly encouraging to me
[00:12:06.880 --> 00:12:08.280]   to see your response,
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.380]   to see that you were willing to come and sign up.
[00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:12.840]   So I went back to the facility
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:16.720]   and I was able to negotiate another about 15 rooms
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:20.520]   and cabins on top of the initial one that I had done.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:24.040]   And then we sold those out in about another week as well.
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:26.400]   So it turns out the total number of attendees
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:28.200]   was just north of 160.
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.680]   I forget if it was 161 or 163, something like that.
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:33.000]   Just a little bit more than 160,
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.880]   which I thought was a great size for this event.
[00:12:36.880 --> 00:12:40.160]   I was able to spend time with just about everybody
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:46.160]   for at least various conversations, which I really loved.
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:50.300]   And it turned out really, really well.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:52.040]   The thing that the first couple of days
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:53.320]   we had cold and rainy weather.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.680]   And so thankfully we had to adapt our schedule a little bit,
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:56.640]   but that all worked out.
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:12:58.360]   Then it turned warm and sunny and beautiful
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:01.180]   in the last couple of days, which was wonderful.
[00:13:01.180 --> 00:13:06.180]   And the feedback from every attendee was really positive.
[00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:12.240]   We issued a survey at the end of the event
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.960]   and about 70%, when we asked people,
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.060]   would you come next time?
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:19.160]   Yes, maybe, and no.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.520]   About 70% of the people said yes.
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.680]   The about remaining 30%, about 28% or whatever it turned out
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.780]   said maybe, depending on where it is in details.
[00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:29.960]   And then we had one no,
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.840]   which the no had a wonderful note that said,
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:32.680]   "I really loved it.
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.500]   "I had a great time.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:34.800]   "It was just too far away."
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.840]   Which was totally, of course, totally wonderful.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:40.120]   And people came from all around the country,
[00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:45.120]   which was just an amazing, what an honor.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:49.440]   And I think everybody had a great time.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.600]   The thing that I found most interesting
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   was how everyone seemed to click really well,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:02.320]   even people of very diverse backgrounds.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   I was so pleased to see that probably due to the filtration
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.520]   of you being willing to listen to me,
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.320]   we just had the nicest group of people
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:19.760]   who were able to come together and engage with one another.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.480]   And so people had many things in common,
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.800]   but even if we didn't have many things in common,
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.720]   other than just simply being connected through this platform
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.560]   through Radical Personal Finance,
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:33.440]   we found commonality in our ability
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.720]   to engage in important things
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:38.280]   and engage in important conversations.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.120]   There was just such an attitude of respect
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.800]   and appreciation for other human beings
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:47.560]   and I found it enormously refreshing.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:51.600]   We talked, we had conversations about all different stuff.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.120]   Obviously some stuff finance, some stuff lifestyle related,
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.440]   plenty of just personal interactions.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:01.280]   And my listeners, you all had just wonderful things
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:03.760]   to say to me, which I really was grateful for.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.260]   But what I really enjoyed was seeing how
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:10.520]   within a very short period of time,
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:13.960]   within a day or two, as I would dip in and out
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.440]   of different conversations and different campfire circles,
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.120]   I found that we were interacting with one another
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:25.480]   on serious things and really getting the benefit
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   of real true diversity.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.320]   And that's something that I feel is so often lacking
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.240]   in our world today.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.080]   I have an annoyance with the way that the word diversity
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:41.640]   has come to be used in our current environment.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:47.880]   In its current usage, the term diversity means basically
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:52.880]   what color is your skin and what is your gender expression.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.520]   That's about the limit of diversity
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.960]   as it's understood today.
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:02.920]   I don't care much myself for that kind of diversity.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:04.840]   I don't think the color of your skin
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.360]   or your gender really matters.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.440]   I think what's much more important is the diversity
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:13.840]   of your thoughts, your ideas, your background,
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.040]   your experiences, those kinds of things
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.440]   are the kind of diversity that I think
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.360]   is genuinely productive.
[00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:23.240]   And it was just such a great expression
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.240]   of people from diverse backgrounds and diverse experiences,
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:33.120]   but yet shared with a very common desire
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.760]   to improve things, improve the world and see things better.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:42.240]   And I was amazed, I mean, put frankly,
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.800]   it's a good thing that I'm grateful
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.560]   that so many of you listen to this show.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.760]   And honestly, I wonder sometimes why you do
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.760]   because so many of my listeners
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.560]   are just incredibly impressive people.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:58.920]   And that came out in the actual event,
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:00.920]   just time over and time over.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.160]   I made several friends there among my listeners
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:07.080]   and attendees that I hope are friends for life.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:11.720]   And I'm just incredibly impressed by you guys.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.880]   You guys are smart, driven people,
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.720]   and it's just an honor to be involved with you.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:21.080]   So it was, if the event could have gone better,
[00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:22.640]   I don't know how.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.680]   We had some various wrinkles and things,
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.280]   but that was all first time learnings.
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:32.080]   I think for the most part, we smoothed,
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.000]   everything worked out.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.680]   The worst thing that was about to happen
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.960]   was I had made a mistake.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.920]   I was the one who'd made all the bedroom assignments
[00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.520]   and cabin assignments.
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:43.040]   And it was a little bit of a puzzle
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:44.720]   to try to figure out how to put people together
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.760]   because I had this two facilities
[00:17:46.760 --> 00:17:51.760]   that were separated by a significant walk.
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:56.200]   And so I was trying to figure out how do I do it?
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.720]   I'm trying to pack everyone together
[00:17:57.720 --> 00:18:00.080]   and trying to put like, and I tried to put,
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:03.320]   I was hoping that we could use the camp environment
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.160]   to facilitate interaction.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.760]   So unlike being in some hotel
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.360]   where everyone goes off to their own room,
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:11.280]   I really liked the idea of a camp environment.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:12.160]   This camp was beautiful.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.000]   It was great.
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.280]   It was modern up to date, but it was still a camp.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.000]   It was a little bit, it was rustic.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.200]   It's a camp, but it's a recently built camp
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.440]   and perfectly adequate facilities.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.640]   So no one was really suffering.
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.040]   So I worked really hard to try to put people together
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.760]   where it would be easy for them to use communal areas
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.520]   and hopefully make friends with people around them
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:34.480]   and all of that.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:37.680]   Then at check-in, everything's going really well.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.400]   Everyone's getting all settled in
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:43.080]   and I had worked out the rooms to just perfectly.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.200]   I sold the exact maximum number of tickets that I could.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.080]   And then I get there and a family arrives
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   that I don't have a cabin for.
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:53.480]   And I just didn't even have them on my list.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:56.720]   It was a moment of potential disaster,
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.960]   but thankfully I was able to avert it
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.320]   and made one quick change,
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:03.840]   two quick changes of room assignments
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.280]   and everything worked out.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:06.840]   So there were growing pains
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.840]   and there were other issues that came up,
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.880]   but on the whole, it worked out really, really beautifully.
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.840]   And I was enormously encouraged by that.
[00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.600]   So I just share that as a report.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.960]   I'm not publishing videos or audios
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.080]   or anything from the event.
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.280]   I really want to, I have the privilege
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.880]   of being able to speak to you with a microphone
[00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:29.640]   whenever I want and I can turn on a camera whenever I want.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:33.160]   And I really think that in many cases,
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:38.160]   electronic eyes around us mess up real human connection.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:41.040]   And so I don't wanna, I'm not trying to create something
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:43.120]   that this particular event was not designed
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.200]   to be anything that was live streamed.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.600]   I'm not sharing any of the audio publicly.
[00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:50.800]   It was a real interactions with people who were there.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.200]   So what does the future hold?
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.800]   Well, I would say this was certainly the inaugural event
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.800]   and I will certainly repeat this event in the future.
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:02.760]   I'm trying to figure out exactly how to do that
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:05.240]   in balancing future events.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.960]   There's basically three things that I'm trying to juggle.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.360]   The first one is simply what the actual offering is.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.040]   So we, this one that I'm referring to here
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.120]   was the Radical Personal Finance Family Camp.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.400]   I made it very friendly to families
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.480]   and it provided the kind of environment
[00:20:22.480 --> 00:20:23.680]   that I was excited about.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:25.720]   Not only was it you and your families,
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.200]   but I was able to bring my wife, my children, my parents,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:32.480]   various members of my nuclear and extended family.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:36.000]   And so that interaction of my family with your family
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.160]   was something that I thought
[00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:39.880]   was just a wonderful aspect of it.
[00:20:39.880 --> 00:20:42.840]   Then the previous one in Panama was not friendly to families
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:45.040]   and that was purely an adult's trip,
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:48.280]   which was also really great in a totally different way.
[00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:50.960]   So there's a balance between a family camp
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.640]   versus an adult's event.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:54.800]   There's a balance between an event
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:58.280]   that is at a camp facility where it's a little bit rustic,
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:01.200]   very basic versus something that's higher end.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:03.960]   So there's a difference between
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.280]   what I tried to do with this event,
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.000]   which was talk a little bit, but not too much,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.600]   and teach a little bit, not too much
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.080]   versus something that's very content focused,
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:16.320]   oriented on a specific transformational event of content
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.780]   of come here and in two days,
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:20.720]   we're gonna accomplish this specific outcome
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.040]   or teach this body of material
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.120]   that's very applicable to people.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:28.800]   So that's one thing is the exact just offering.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.760]   The second thing is balancing a location.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   So this location was in Indiana,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.440]   which in some cases is centrally located,
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.040]   but it wasn't the easiest thing to get to.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:40.520]   It was easy in terms of airports.
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:43.440]   We had, it was equidistant from Indianapolis,
[00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.000]   Louisville and Cincinnati,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.200]   but it wasn't the easiest thing to get to
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:49.440]   in terms of people.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:53.560]   And so there's a much higher population density
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:54.840]   in other parts of the United States.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.720]   So should I do events in other parts of the United States?
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:02.360]   I still really appreciate the international aspect of life,
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.000]   but I understand that that's not something
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:07.920]   that resonates with everyone in the show.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.600]   So kind of balancing that coming where you are
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.740]   versus trying to pull you outside of the United States
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:17.360]   and do enjoy things outside of the United States,
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:19.160]   and then balancing just frequency
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   and figuring out what I can do in terms of frequency
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:27.540]   versus what's too much, what's not enough.
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.120]   Certainly I will make the,
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.520]   certainly I intend to make
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:34.960]   the Radical Personal Finance Camp an annual event.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.080]   Beyond that, I don't wanna make any public commitments.
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.440]   Hosting an event is a pretty big disruption
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:44.440]   in terms of the work associated with it.
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.640]   It's enormous.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:49.000]   I found it to be an enormously profitable event
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.960]   that didn't make any money.
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:54.080]   So the profit was all non-financial.
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.820]   And so finding that balance between financial profit
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.400]   as compared to other forms of profit
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.800]   is a balance as well, and figuring those things out.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.360]   So bear with me as we go through the growing pains.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.760]   We'll work out some of these things over time.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.760]   But at its core, for me, the event was very, very important
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:17.960]   to build a connection with you in person
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:21.200]   and then go from there.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.320]   We've created, in the wake of the in-person event,
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.060]   with those personal relationships,
[00:23:28.060 --> 00:23:30.340]   we've created a really great group
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:32.360]   with lots of digital interaction
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:34.540]   where those of us who attended the event
[00:23:34.540 --> 00:23:36.140]   are continuing our interactions.
[00:23:36.140 --> 00:23:39.140]   And I'm finding that to be really, really productive
[00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:40.580]   and helpful as well.
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:43.540]   Because once you've met someone,
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:44.700]   once you've spent a couple nights
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.420]   around a campfire with someone,
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:48.060]   once you've shared a few drinks with someone
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.860]   and a few laughs and a tear or two in private,
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:53.760]   then it gives you then the ability to go on
[00:23:53.760 --> 00:23:55.540]   and feel much more confident,
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:57.820]   especially in a closed electronic setting,
[00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.220]   sharing your questions, sharing your concerns in a real way
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.540]   that with your friends,
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.020]   rather than random people on the internet,
[00:24:06.020 --> 00:24:10.180]   which is, I think, what we're all looking for.
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.340]   So I just wanna say thank you.
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:15.100]   Thank you to those of you who came and who worked with it.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.820]   Thank you especially to Andy who helped me organize it.
[00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:21.300]   Thank you to every one of you who came.
[00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:23.740]   It was an honor to interact with you.
[00:24:23.740 --> 00:24:26.660]   And I'm thrilled for the friendships that we have begun.
[00:24:26.660 --> 00:24:28.860]   And thank you to every one of you who listens.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.740]   I hope that I can offer you something in the future
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:33.540]   that will be appealing to you.
[00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:37.100]   And regardless of whether you are able to come
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.840]   to one of my events or not,
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:42.260]   I would just encourage you to do everything you can
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:45.660]   to expand your social contacts, build friendships,
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.700]   build community in your local area.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:48.940]   We need it right now.
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.700]   All of us need friends.
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:53.220]   We need people who will walk with us and encourage us,
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.420]   who can teach us, who can inspire us.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:58.380]   And they're right around you.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.360]   It's just a matter of you reaching out to them
[00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.940]   and looking for them.
[00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:04.260]   I really believe that every person
[00:25:04.260 --> 00:25:07.740]   is my superior in some way.
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.380]   You are my superior in some way.
[00:25:10.380 --> 00:25:12.700]   And I'm your superior in some way.
[00:25:12.700 --> 00:25:17.420]   And a healthy, productive relationship can be built
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:22.420]   upon you and my looking for that interaction.
[00:25:22.980 --> 00:25:24.660]   And searching it out.
[00:25:24.660 --> 00:25:29.300]   And we can walk together in a very productive relationship
[00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.780]   as long as we take the effort to initiate them.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:32.660]   So thank you very much.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.340]   That's my report on Radical Personal Finance Family Camp
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.340]   on the inaugural one.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.840]   And I look forward to seeing you at a future event.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:43.180]   - That's not just the sound of that first sip
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.220]   of morning joe.
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.860]   It's the sound of someone shopping for a car on Carvana
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.060]   from the comfort of home.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.220]   - That's a good blend.
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:50.660]   - It's time to take it easy.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:52.200]   Like answering some easy questions
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:54.700]   to get pre-qualified for a car in minutes.
