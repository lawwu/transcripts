[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.220]   there's been a ton of progress.
[00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.580]   Things have been pretty good.
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.580]   In 1900, 6% of teenagers graduated high school in the US.
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.320]   Now, that doesn't mean that 94% didn't have an education
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.080]   that we would regard as a high school education,
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.160]   but it like kind of means that, it roughly means that.
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.600]   It's also the case that a high school education
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.680]   meant something lesser than.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.920]   A substantial fraction of high schoolers
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.520]   now study AP courses and complete them in high school.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:28.640]   That's at the high end.
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   On the low end, illiteracy was a very live situation
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.240]   a hundred years ago in the US
[00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.360]   and is emphatically not now.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.000]   Now, it is the case that something like 10 to 15% of adults,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.880]   depending on which polls you use,
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:46.960]   would struggle to perform like simple kinds
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.460]   of number manipulation or reading or writing kind of tasks.
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.400]   But our bar is basically moved.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.720]   It used to be like, can you read it all?
