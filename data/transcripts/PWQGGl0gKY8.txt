[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400]   I think my chance of identifying great novelists is very low.
[00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.400]   And it's one reason why it's not something I try to do.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.300]   —Interesting. Why is that?
[00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.500]   —When I look at biographies, there seem to be so many instances
[00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.000]   of people who don't show obvious signs of promise early on.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.400]   —Interesting. And what do you think makes novelists so hard to predict?
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.000]   —They can blossom much later, and very often they do.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.900]   A very high percentage of them are women whose earlier lives are interrupted,
[00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.100]   often by children, but not only.
[00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.200]   That gets back to the late bloomers thing.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.400]   And there's something quite discreet about a novel,
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:41.000]   that until a person has done it, it's hard to tell how good they are.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.800]   Or say a great nonfiction book, you know, "Taleb" or "Pinker" or whoever.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.000]   Like, you could read their earlier blog posts and just see, flat-out see,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.700]   "Oh, they're really smart. Maybe they could write a great book."
[00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.600]   Joseph Conrad, like, was I going to get that?
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.300]   Herman Melville. I don't think so.
