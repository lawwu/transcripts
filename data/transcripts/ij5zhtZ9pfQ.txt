[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440]   Well, if we read our Bibles, why do we need sermons?
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.680]   It's a question from a listener to the podcast named Lucia.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.240]   "Hello Pastor John and Tony.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.680]   I am a high school student and have been blessed by many of your sermons and podcasts.
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.680]   I have a question.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.200]   I know there was an old episode titled, 'If I listen to sermons, why do I need to read
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.200]   my Bible?'
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.360]   That was episode 435 back in 2014.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.360]   I want to ask the reverse question.
[00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:32.960]   If I read the Bible, why do I need to listen to sermons?
[00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.920]   I feel like many people emphasize reading the Bible, saying it's our direct way to
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.160]   have a relationship with God.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.880]   Whereas when you listen to sermons, you may be listening to someone else's relationship
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.880]   with God.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.360]   Also, I know that powerful sermons can make you feel emotional, but I hear that our faith
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.040]   shouldn't be based on emotions.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.000]   What I mean by getting emotional, it's hard to explain, but the inspiring feeling where
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.280]   I feel God's love, how great He is, and feel motivated to change.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.600]   But once those emotions in me die down, I'm not sure where to go next.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.840]   Do I read the Bible more or do I listen to more sermons to help me feel something again?
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.240]   But I digress.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.680]   My main question is this.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.440]   Why listen to sermons if we all have the Bible to read on our own?"
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.800]   Let me try to answer this question in two stages.
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:31.400]   First, I'll try to show from the New Testament that it is God's plan and design that besides
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:39.400]   the infallible Word of God in the Bible, the church is to be led underneath that infallible
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:48.100]   Word by fallible elders, sometimes called pastors or overseers or teachers, who are
[00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.920]   gifted to lead and to teach the flock.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.980]   And then second, we ask the question, "Why?
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.520]   Why did God set it up that way so that the ordinary members of the church who have in
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:10.000]   their hand an infallible Bible should listen to and respect and esteem and follow and rejoice
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.480]   in the ministry of the Word through fallible preaching?"
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.880]   So step one, God's plan.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:29.220]   Just this week, I was preparing a "Look at the Book" session on 1 Thessalonians 5, 12-14.
[00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:36.680]   And I was compelled to address this very question before I knew that this question would be
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.680]   asked.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680]   And here's what it says.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.560]   "We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:56.120]   and who admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work."
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.680]   So here's a group in the church that leads and teaches.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.840]   And then I think verse 14, the next verse, turns to address those very teachers like
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.480]   this, verse 14.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:18.920]   "And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the faint-hearted, help the weak,
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.240]   be patient with them all."
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:31.500]   So I drew out from that text the obvious point, namely, here's the infallible apostle writing
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:40.480]   to the Thessalonians and handing off a large measure of responsibility for the ministry
[00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.520]   of the Word in the church.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.400]   He's handing it off to fallible people.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.200]   He's telling the teachers how to minister the Word.
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.580]   And he's telling the members how to receive the Word and how to respect the teachers.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.480]   Then consider 2 Timothy 4, 1 and 2.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:07.600]   This has been huge in my life as a pastor preacher, where Paul says to Timothy, young
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.800]   Timothy, whom Paul had left behind as a pastor in Ephesus, he says, "I charge you in the
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:22.120]   presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead and by his
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.040]   appearing in his kingdom, preach the Word."
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.360]   It's just a clear command to Timothy, "Preach, herald the Word."
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:38.680]   In other words, the question is not whether the believers in Ephesus think they need to
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.840]   listen to Timothy when he preaches, since they have access to the infallible letter
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.540]   of the Ephesians.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:54.640]   The question is whether God, and in his perfect will, is telling them to listen to Timothy,
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   preach the Word.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.200]   He's saying, "Timothy, preach the Word."
[00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:06.120]   And God intends for people to hear the Word preached if he commands his pastors to preach
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   the Word.
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.240]   Here's just one more passage, Ephesians 4, 11.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:17.040]   "Christ gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors and teachers
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.800]   to equip the saints for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ."
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:29.980]   So what's clear in this passage is that the risen Christ intends for churches to have
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:38.400]   pastors and teachers that, through their preaching and teaching, equip the saints to do the work
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.080]   of the ministry and build themselves up in love and faith.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:46.480]   That's the divine plan.
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:51.700]   Now, the second step of my answer is why.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.160]   Why does God do it this way?
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   Why does he plan for there to be fallible—I'm talking about myself there, John Piper—fallible
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   human teachers and preachers in the church who teach and preach to the people on the
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:16.520]   basis of God's infallible Word, when the people have that infallible Word right there
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.540]   in their hands?
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:22.520]   And here are five reasons that I see in the Bible.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:29.320]   Number one, preachers and teachers, according to 1 Timothy 3:2, are to be gifted or apt
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:37.960]   or able to teach, which means that they should have the time, the inclination, the skill,
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:44.840]   and the spiritual discernment to see things in God's infallible Word, which many ordinary
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:48.920]   folks just don't see.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:58.360]   Second, in their teaching and preaching, pastors demonstrate for the people and model for the
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:04.600]   people how to see those very things in reading the Bible, which they don't ordinarily see
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.240]   for themselves.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:14.800]   Preaching is based on the Word of God, and good preaching shows from the very text of
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:20.040]   the Word of God where the teaching is coming from so that the people who are listening
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.760]   can see it for themselves.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:30.560]   And in seeing it for themselves through the preaching of this pastor, they learn how to
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:32.880]   see it for themselves.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:41.480]   And so by means of good preaching, Bible reading itself becomes increasingly fruitful.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:49.520]   Third, faithful biblical preaching is what I call expository exaltation.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:55.640]   The word expository implies teaching and explaining what the Bible actually means, and the word
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:04.760]   exaltation implies that the preacher himself feels and communicates the worth of what he's seeing.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:16.080]   So preaching is the communication of both seeing and savoring the reality in the text.
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:25.040]   This means that those who listen to such preaching over time will not only have their heads stocked
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:33.680]   with new thoughts, but will have their hearts awakened to new affections for God and his
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:36.400]   Word and his ways and his people.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:44.800]   We might think that the Bible itself should be enough to awaken all the affections and
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.000]   emotions that Christians ought to feel.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.160]   Well, the plain fact is that does not happen.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:03.840]   God has planned that we be inspired and encouraged and humbled and thrilled by the things of
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:12.160]   God which we see more movingly through faithful, Spirit-filled preaching.
[00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:23.680]   That's why he says to those teachers in Thessalonica in 1 Thessalonians 5.14, "Encourage the faint-hearted."
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.760]   Encouragement happens in preaching.
[00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:29.120]   That's a change of emotions and affections.
[00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:36.000]   Affections are changed, not just minds, through God-ordained preaching.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:46.560]   Fourth, God has ordained that the eyes of the spiritually blind be open and salvation
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.280]   come through the foolishness of fallible human preaching.
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:01.360]   1 Corinthians 1.21, "Since in the wisdom of God the world did not know God through
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:11.920]   wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe."
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:19.760]   We might imagine in our own heads that all the world needs is their Bibles dropped from
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.440]   airplanes into people's lives.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:32.480]   Well, we can imagine all we want, but God's plan is that people are saved through the
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:40.160]   preaching of the Bible, through the preaching of biblical truth, not just the reading of
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   the Bible.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:48.200]   The foolishness of preaching is appointed as one of the important means of saving sinners.
[00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   And finally, number five, behind all four of those previous points lies the truth that
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:04.520]   God intends for the church to be a mutually interdependent body of believers.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.920]   The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you.
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:11.920]   I've got my Bible.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:14.120]   I don't need you."
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:21.000]   It's a quote from 1 Corinthians 12.21, "The eye cannot say to the hand, 'I have no need
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   of you.'"
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.960]   In other words, God has determined that Jesus Christ, through the ministry of the Holy Spirit,
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:39.440]   will get more glory through the Christ-exalting, Spirit-dependent, Word-saturated, mutual ministry
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:48.120]   in the church than he would if people only read their Bibles rather than needing to hear
[00:11:48.120 --> 00:11:52.440]   other believers speak the Word into their lives.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.200]   That's the bottom line.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:12:01.240]   Christ is more glorified through doing it God's way than by forsaking God's way while
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.240]   presuming to love the Bible.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.240]   Wonderful.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.340]   Thank you, Pastor John, for your two-stage answer here.
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.880]   This was an episode looking at the inverse of APJ episode 435.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.040]   If I listen to sermons, why do I need to read my Bible?
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.760]   You can find episode 435 in our archive online.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:21.920]   There you can find old episodes, ask a question of your own, or subscribe to the podcast.
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.920]   You can do all that at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:33.840]   Well, what does it mean to pray in the Spirit, and can we accidentally pray out of the Spirit?
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.840]   It's a great question.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.080]   It's coming up next time.
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:40.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reiki, and for that, we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:41.080]   Have a great weekend.
