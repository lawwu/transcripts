[00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.520]   December 2023, StackBlitz board meeting.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.400]   Eric Simons walks into the room knowing that his company is dying.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.280]   Seven years of building this revolutionary web container technology, millions raised,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.520]   but the revenue is practically zero and the growth is practically flat.
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.800]   The board gives him an ultimatum.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.380]   You show us real progress by the end of 2024 or we shut this down.
[00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.780]   Just two months later, Bolt.new is showcasing explosive growth.
[00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.500]   20 million ARR in just two months and today, 18 months later, we expect to see another update
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.740]   crossing over 100 million ARR for Bolt.new.
[00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:43.880]   This overnight success didn't really happen overnight.
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.840]   It took seven years in the making.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.780]   And today, I'm going to tell you exactly how that happened so you can replicate it for your
[00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780]   business.
[00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.620]   I'm Victoria from Evil Martians, the go-to agency for developer tools.
[00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.540]   We've been StackBlitz technical partners since 2021, back when nobody believed in browser-based
[00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.580]   technology, web containers, and investors thought that this was the dead end.
[00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:14.100]   We work with 40-plus early-stage developer tools startups each year and everybody is asking the
[00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.380]   same question: how do I bring AI into my product?
[00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.420]   First, let's talk about what doesn't work.
[00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.100]   The most common mistake I see is let's sprinkle some AI into our UI.
[00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.540]   And the problem with that is people are very tired of chatbot interfaces at this point.
[00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:39.220]   It's very hard to convince yourself to try something new to test new features because
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.420]   oftentimes the results are underwhelming.
[00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.500]   So if you are just slapping on a chatbot, you are taking a risk.
[00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.020]   Your customers might just lose interest and never try it again.
[00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.500]   And the result will be very sad as well.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.100]   A quietly deprecated feature.
[00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.580]   The second common trap I see is boiling the ocean.
[00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:05.540]   When you are trying to AI power everything, you're competing with the big guys like OpenAI and Anthropic.
[00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.740]   And the reality is you just don't have that big of a team and that big of an investment behind you.
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.420]   Instead, try to think about what you can leverage.
[00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.340]   What's your unique domain?
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.100]   What's your unique expertise?
[00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:19.540]   What's your unique technology?
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.380]   If we bet on that, the chances that we succeed are much higher.
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.140]   Then there are companies that are waiting for the AI to be perfect.
[00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.300]   And the reality is we have to build the tooling as we go.
[00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.180]   It's up to us.
[00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:38.500]   If we get scrappy, if we get creative with our solutions, we will stay ahead of the game.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.620]   But the biggest killer?
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.420]   Not talking to users.
[00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.860]   I've seen many companies reinvent the wheel.
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.260]   Invest a lot of money, a lot of resources into building beautiful,
[00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.860]   intricate interfaces that users don't need.
[00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.060]   And the reality is no market, no product.
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.620]   Talk to your users first.
[00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.460]   While everyone else bolted AI into their existing workflows,
[00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.540]   StackBlitz did something different.
[00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.820]   I want to take you through three simple steps that you can apply to your business
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.580]   and try to replicate StackBlitz's success with Bolt.new.
[00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:17.860]   Step 1.
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.780]   Identify your unfair advantage.
[00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.140]   Not product features, but your unique competitive edge.
[00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:24.660]   Let's take StackBlitz.
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.780]   They're the only company that can run a full development environment in the browser.
[00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.460]   They don't need containers.
[00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:32.740]   They don't need servers.
[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:33.940]   They don't need local setup.
[00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.500]   What's your unique advantage?
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:42.340]   It could be something like domain expertise or data distribution or infrastructure.
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.220]   You name it.
[00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.780]   Step 2.
[00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.580]   Figure out how AI can amplify your competitive advantage.
[00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:52.180]   So instead of thinking, how do I bring AI into my product?
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.900]   Think, what becomes possible when AI meets my unique capability?
[00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.220]   For StackBlitz, it was pretty straightforward.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.100]   Every other pipe coding tool had the same issue.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.460]   The process is just too complicated for an average user.
[00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.580]   So instead, you describe your app with words.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.740]   You see it right there in the browser.
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.900]   And you can share the URL with the public.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:13.860]   Easy.
[00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.700]   It only became possible because they had this unique competitive advantage.
[00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.820]   So now it's your turn.
[00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.060]   What becomes possible when AI meets your unfair advantage?
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.020]   Step 3.
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.460]   Last but not the least.
[00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.300]   Create a category.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:39.700]   Instead of thinking in existing workflows, think about how your capability can change the flow
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.340]   altogether.
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.860]   If we take a look at StackBlitz, this is called inventing a category.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.820]   They reinvented how people vibe code.
[00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.340]   Why this moment matters?
[00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.340]   The reality is StackBlitz's secret wasn't unique AI.
[00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.340]   Everybody has access to Anthropic.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.180]   It was their unique competitive advantage.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.140]   And once they figured it out, they reinvented the user flow and they bet everything on it.
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.100]   They went all in.
[00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:13.540]   So I want to encourage you to take a look at your product.
[00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.340]   Be honest.
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.020]   Sometimes it's painful.
[00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.820]   Take a look at your product and think.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.740]   What's your unique mode?
[00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.260]   What's your competitive advantage?
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.820]   How can AI amplify that advantage?
[00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:29.780]   Can you reinvent a workflow?
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.260]   Can you create a category out of this process?
[00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.220]   If you find answers to all of those questions, you're on the right track.
[00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.380]   Good luck.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:06:09.360]   Thank you.
