[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760]   Fred began by talking about an hors d'oeuvre and a main course.
[00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.240]   There is such a thing as a main course and afters.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.500]   I leave you to decide which of us has done which.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:19.760]   I think I'm very particularly happy to be here tonight giving the other half of this
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:27.880]   ensemble, as it were, of talking about my father and his books here at a meeting of
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.840]   the Evangelical Library.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.960]   The Evangelical Library meant so much to him.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.040]   Probably most of you friends who were with him over the years in the Evangelical Library,
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.060]   people like Mr. Mickelright and all the rest of you, you knew this.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:47.980]   You knew how much he loved the work of the Evangelical Library, how much he loved working
[00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:51.120]   first with Mr. Williams and then with Mr. Sayer.
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.120]   This whole idea of this great library full of Christian books, this great heritage and
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.040]   treasure of ours, it meant so much to him.
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.760]   We were talking earlier about numbers of members.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.420]   I think he could never quite understand why there weren't thousands and thousands of people
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.160]   all cramming in for membership and all taking out hundreds of books all the time.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.680]   It was a work that he felt was a great work of God.
[00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.400]   And I know he himself found it a tremendous privilege to be involved in it.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.120]   It all began in such an extraordinary way, how he came across Mr. Williams through a
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.280]   mutual friend of theirs, a chemist somewhere in North London who brought these two men
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   together.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.840]   And from that moment on, here was the work of the Evangelical Library.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   And I think it's peculiarly fitting, perhaps, that we are talking about his books here tonight.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.680]   Now, it's a very difficult thing for me to do, really.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.240]   To start with, the title says, "Him and His Books."
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.880]   Well, I think we found some difficulty in deciding on a title.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.200]   And I think perhaps I will be forgiven if I broaden the spectrum slightly.
[00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.140]   By the way, I'm not coming here to talk about all the volumes on Romans and Ephesians.
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.160]   Somebody once said to me, when they knew I was going to do this, they said, "But why
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.480]   are you doing that, because Ian Murray did it so magnificently in the Thanksgiving service
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480]   anyhow?"
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.200]   Well, I'm not going to talk like Ian.
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.000]   Ian was talking about him and his books.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.680]   This really is about him and his reading.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.720]   Now, it's a great subject, this.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.800]   And I'm very aware that as I start on it, I can see a lot of you here.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:39.800]   Those of his, from the early evangelical library days, as I say, ministers, his, really, his
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   sons in the faith in the Westminster meeting, the fraternal, the Westminster conference,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.720]   you all know so much about him and his love of books.
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.760]   And I'm perfectly certain that probably as time goes on, you're going to say, "My goodness,
[00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:58.120]   she hasn't mentioned that," or, "I don't agree with her about that."
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.160]   Quite likely.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.680]   I can really only deal with this personally.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.440]   And if I leave anything out or if I don't put the emphasis that you wanted, please forgive
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.440]   me.
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.800]   I can only do it, as I say, as I myself saw him.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:22.400]   Well, now, personally, if I'm to be quite honest, I think I must say that on a very
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.680]   human personal level, I miss him along the whole line of reading almost more than any
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.680]   other way.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.120]   A lot of my friends who had lost those dear to them said, "It's funny, you know, it's
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.960]   the little things that bring back your loss to you."
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.240]   And I'd heard them and I'd understood the kind of thing they meant.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.840]   But I must say that one of the most shattering experiences I had, really, was after the great
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.800]   mixture of sadness and of glory, really, of the funeral service and of the thanksgiving
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.760]   service here in the chapel.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.160]   This sense we had that he had gone to be with the Lord in glory, that his weakness was now
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   over.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.080]   And I remember about a few weeks later, I was in the public library and I was looking
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.320]   along the biography shelves.
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.840]   And I had recently been reading the lives of all that remarkable family of Bensons,
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:22.760]   Archbishop Benson and his able sons, the man who wrote for Punch and E.F.
[00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.040]   Benson and all the rest of them.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.100]   I'd been reading them.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:31.480]   And suddenly along the bookshelves, I saw a book called Bishop King of Lincoln.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.080]   I thought, now he must have been around about the same period as Archbishop Benson, who
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.240]   had also at some point been at Lincoln.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.280]   And I thought, when I get home, I must ask my...
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.480]   And I realized I couldn't ask him.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:53.240]   And it was then I realized this great loss I was suffering, this great reader, this friend
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.360]   of mine, in reading, he wasn't there anymore to talk about it.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.320]   And you see, I knew perfectly well, I mean, how many of us have heard of Bishop King?
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.240]   Not many of us, I'm sure.
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.520]   But he would have known about Bishop King.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:11.000]   He would have known where he came from, where he went to, what his relationship with Benson
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.960]   was, where they disagreed, how evangelical he was, all these things.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.040]   And he's not there anymore to answer these questions.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.640]   And I still find, and I'm perfectly certain that I'm speaking here for Anne as much as
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:29.000]   for myself, that so often when one finds a new writer, not new in themselves, but new
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.680]   to me, I still miss this.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.480]   I was put, and I'm very grateful for this, onto that remarkable little book, "The Force
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.080]   of Truth" by Thomas Scott.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.480]   John Marshall said to me, "Have you read it?"
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:43.480]   And I hadn't.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.000]   And I found it and I read it, and it was the most remarkable book.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.320]   I discovered J.G. Philpott, the old Baptist preacher, and I have enjoyed him very much
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.800]   indeed.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.480]   I've been discovering about Vicar Pritchard of Wales, all these people that I didn't know
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.760]   about before.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.840]   Somehow the edge of the enjoyment goes off, because I can't go to my father and say, "Now,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:06.880]   what about these?
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.880]   What about Philpott?
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.760]   What was his influence exactly?
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.520]   How about Thomas Scott?
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.440]   Isn't it remarkable the way that he wrote this book?" and so on.
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:19.960]   And so I do miss him along this line, because as I say, it was a line along which I peculiarly
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.280]   appreciated him and all that he had to give.
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:26.600]   Fred has given this picture already of his sitting in this armchair.
[00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.360]   We've got a photograph of him in the family.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.860]   It's my favorite of all the photographs.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:32.860]   Some of you may have seen it.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.360]   I can't remember if it was in any of the magazines.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.320]   It was, that's right, of him in profile reading.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.360]   And that is exactly how I think of him.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:47.440]   This oasis of peace in the middle of all the life that was going on around us.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:52.400]   This peaceful man sitting there with a book on his knee, enjoying it and wanting us to
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.240]   enjoy it as well.
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.120]   Now my early memories right back are connected with him and reading.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.160]   I remember quite well in the study in Aberavon.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.440]   My mother must have been out or something.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.400]   Sitting in his study, as I say, which was lined with books from floor to ceiling, over
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:14.040]   the floor as well often, on the desk, theology everywhere.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.840]   And here I was sitting.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.080]   I must have been, well I certainly wasn't at school.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:24.680]   Sitting on his knee while he very seriously read to me from the littlest one his book.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.920]   I don't know how many of you know it.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.680]   It's a book of poems, an enchanting book of the '20s and '30s, of poems for children.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.720]   And I remember him very earnestly discussing the characters of Jane and Emily Jane with
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:36.720]   me.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.920]   Why Emily Jane was so much nicer than Jane.
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.320]   And what it was about Jane that wasn't pleasant.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:45.520]   He was perfectly prepared on reading to come down, as it were, to this level.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.920]   It was something that he enjoyed doing.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.320]   And of course, he himself, I know, has said, and here again when I re-read what he had
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:58.520]   to say in Preaching of Preachers, I felt, well really, what am I going to say that he
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.640]   hasn't already said?
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:03.280]   But perhaps I'm really only underlining some of the things he said.
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:08.900]   But he said how always on holiday, he would always read a great deal.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:10.840]   And this takes me back to another early memory.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.120]   I remember going to stay in Bath.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.320]   I was again very young.
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:20.360]   It was the mid-1930s on that lovely sandy beach in Bath.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:22.400]   It was a boiling hot summer day.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:25.880]   I know we always tend to think it was boiling hot when we were children.
[00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.960]   But this really was a boiling hot day.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.080]   And I was gambling about in a bathing costume and digging and paddling and all the rest
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.120]   of it.
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:37.960]   Everybody else was on the beach in the amount of undress that was allowed in the mid-1930s.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:42.960]   We were all hot and there we all were with this glorious sunshine, all sunbathing, as
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.760]   I say, and playing.
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:53.840]   In a rock, in front of a rock, over to one corner of the beach, fully clothed, in a grey
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:09:03.080]   suit with a hat upon his head, his usual hat, shoes, socks, the whole thing, waistcoat,
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.640]   sitting bowled upright, as I say, leaning back against a rock and reading the divine
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:11.120]   imperative.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.480]   And this was on a sunbathing beach.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:14.880]   You see, he read like this.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:20.500]   He read always, as I say, in the mornings and the summer holidays, he read all the time.
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:25.320]   But the great thing about it was that we never resented this.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:28.480]   Anne and I took this as part of him.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.160]   He was the great reader.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.160]   It was his work.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.520]   It was his enjoyment.
[00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:33.520]   It was part of him.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.960]   And so it became a part of us.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   We never resented it.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   In fact, it's interesting, my mother has a story, I don't remember this myself, of apparently
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.200]   in my first term at school, it was the time of the great unemployment in Aberavon at the
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:52.120]   time, and a lot of people, of course, were out of work then.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:58.440]   And every child in the reception class apparently was asked what work their father did.
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   Nobody knew about this.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:01.960]   It was something that apparently landed on us in an ad hoc sort of way.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:08.280]   The first thing that my parents knew was that I came back from school weeping copious tears
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.520]   of indignation.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   And when they tried to find out what was wrong, apparently what had happened was this amiable
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:22.520]   but ill-advised teacher had asked each child in the class what work their father did.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.040]   She'd gone right round the class.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:27.000]   And of course, this was to find out how much unemployment there was in the class.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.160]   Now, as I say, the girl was ill-advised because she happened to know what my father was.
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.720]   He was the minister of the chapel down the road from the school, so she knew.
[00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.520]   She didn't bother to ask me.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.120]   I came back filled with indignation.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.720]   My father worked terribly hard all day reading, and nobody had mentioned that he worked at
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:47.720]   all.
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.800]   So you see, there it was.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:51.800]   Reading was to him something that we knew.
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:58.040]   Yes, he preached, but he read, and he read lovingly, regularly, and a lot.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.880]   Well, now then, as I talk about this reading of his, perhaps I just got to fill you in
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:04.080]   a little with the background.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.960]   I won't belong here.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.040]   He came from a family that was always interested in reading.
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:15.000]   His father was not a very well-educated man, but he was a man who was interested in the
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.840]   whole world around him.
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.920]   He read the papers carefully and methodically.
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.520]   He read one or two religious papers as well.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.240]   He kept himself in touch with the world around him.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:32.880]   My father's older brother, who died in the flu epidemic in 1918, was also a great reader
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:36.360]   who not only read, but also wrote poetry.
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:38.720]   We don't know what the poetry itself was like.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:46.080]   We have one or two little exercise books of rather charming First World War-type poems.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.040]   He knew, apparently, Robert Graves' "Anne C. Cleats of Sune."
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.040]   So, it's interesting.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:54.200]   He was in that kind of literary background, this older brother.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.560]   Tragically, as I say, he died.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.000]   His younger brother also was a literary figure.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.080]   He went to Oxford, and there he knew Ronald Knox.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:07.160]   He met Evelyn Waugh.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:12.040]   He has got a considerable amount of fame over the past weeks with this "Brideshead Revisited,"
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:15.120]   because he'd actually met Evelyn Waugh and knew him.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.400]   Not well, but he had at least come into contact with him.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.160]   And even more interestingly, my uncle was actually in the same tutorial group as C.S.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:24.160]   Lewis.
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:28.720]   So, you see, they were a reading family.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.240]   There was this kind of talk about books and authors and writers and how you wrote and
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.240]   so on.
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.240]   So, there it was.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:41.580]   Well, then, as we look at him as a reader, to come on to how he handled his reading,
[00:12:41.580 --> 00:12:46.720]   I wouldn't be true to his tradition, would I, if I didn't start with the negative.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:51.320]   Remember, he told us we must always start with the negative.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:54.440]   So, I shall start with the negative.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:58.400]   He disliked paperbacks very much indeed.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:04.800]   Now, all of us in the family, grandchildren, children, everybody, we all had to persuade
[00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.520]   him that books were very expensive nowadays.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:11.320]   The students, of course, as you can imagine, were very ferocious about this.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.920]   How could they afford to buy books costing £10.95 and so on?
[00:13:14.920 --> 00:13:19.560]   And he did grudgingly agree that perhaps this was true.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:23.200]   But you see, it's interesting why he disliked these paperbacks.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.800]   Books to him were friends that you kept for life.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.920]   And you see, you couldn't keep these paperbacks, they fall apart.
[00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:31.840]   If you just bend them open, then they're finished, aren't they?
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.000]   He did have a kind of grudging allowance of these halfway house books.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.200]   I can't remember what they're called.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:39.560]   You know, they're sort of stiff paperbacks.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.560]   Then perhaps he could tolerate, but by and large, he did not like the paperback world
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:48.680]   in which he now found himself and was, I think, never quite happy that one or two of his own
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:49.880]   books came out in paperback.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.520]   Though, as I say, he allowed it for expense's sake.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:57.440]   Now, the other thing that's interesting, of course, and one tended to forget this about
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.840]   him, he didn't like digests at all.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.960]   He said at one point, "I am not a believer in digests and encyclopedias.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:12.880]   They encourage a ready-reckoner mentality rather than thought."
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.960]   Now when you think about it, of course, this is very typical of him.
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.020]   He couldn't bear anything potted, as it were.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:22.600]   He didn't like shortened versions of things.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.920]   He didn't like biographies, which are just a few broad sweeps of facts.
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.840]   He liked biography to start about 200 years before the subject was born and work up to
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.840]   it.
[00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:37.880]   He liked his books to be full books.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   He didn't like this modern habit of thinking that you've got a lot of knowledge if you
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.480]   just knew a few headings and so on.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.480]   Digests and encyclopedias, no way for him.
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.920]   I must say, the reader's digest did go in and out of the house, but very rarely would
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.160]   you find him looking at it.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:54.880]   And I'll be coming back to this dislike of potted things later on.
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:59.400]   And interestingly enough, to a rising out of this, in a way, the third thing he disliked
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:06.600]   was an over-concentration, I must underline, an over-concentration on style for its own
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:07.600]   sake.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:13.640]   Now, of course, he liked his books to be well-written.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.840]   I mean, he liked all books to be well-written.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.320]   He himself enjoyed a good style.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:23.760]   What he was worried about was that if the style took over, as it were, from the contents,
[00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:28.200]   if they were mannered books, that he couldn't bear them.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:32.120]   He had a very interesting passage, you may remember, in Preaching and Preachers, where
[00:15:32.120 --> 00:15:36.800]   he says that he thinks that this was part of the cause of the downfall of the pulpit
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   and preaching.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.800]   I don't know if you remember this place.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:44.240]   It was that, you see, preachers had begun producing beautifully styled essays instead
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:47.240]   of preaching the word.
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:54.760]   It was interesting, too, with regard to style, how sometimes he really disliked something
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   that was quite beautiful in style because the content was wrong.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.840]   I remember having quite a discussion with him about Tennyson's poem Crossing the Bar.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:04.480]   I don't know how many of you know it.
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:10.160]   "Night and evening star, one clear call for me, and may there be no moaning of the bar
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.400]   when I put out to sea."
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.560]   I thought this was the most beautiful poetry.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.440]   He said, "But it's wrong," he said.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.720]   "It's wrong.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.320]   The truth is safe into the haven guide.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.120]   Oh, receive my soul at last."
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:30.400]   Christians don't go out to sea when they die.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   They come into the haven.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.400]   I said, "But it is beautiful, isn't it?"
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.080]   He said, "The beauty doesn't matter.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.080]   It's wrong."
[00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:38.960]   So, you see, this is the point.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.320]   It was style you had to be very careful of.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:46.240]   And here, of course, I've got to mention the whole question of style in his own books.
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.480]   I mean now the things he wrote.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:53.880]   Well, no, not he wrote, but his Ephesians, Romans, and all the rest of them.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:56.920]   My goodness, he did have some problem with his editors.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:01.760]   Especially, I remember one day, right at the very beginning, one of the very first books
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:05.440]   he brought out, the very earnest editor.
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.720]   It was a very early book.
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:11.560]   Very earnest editor sent him back his manuscript covered in alterations.
[00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:16.920]   You know, "Nevertheless" instead of "but," or "although" instead of something else, and
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:21.560]   on it would go, or an adjective instead of a noun, or in the margin, "Don't you think
[00:17:21.560 --> 00:17:24.560]   there are too many adverbs in this line?"
[00:17:24.560 --> 00:17:29.520]   My father almost threw the manuscript at me and said, "Cross it all out," he said.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:33.000]   "Put it back in the original and leave it alone."
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:38.120]   And it was interesting, towards the end, he said to me, "When you come to do the editing
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:42.800]   of the books," he said, "don't agonize too much over the words."
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.360]   Now he was perfectly prepared for anything that was repetitive, or where he'd already
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:52.760]   said it, or at the beginning, for instance, he didn't want the same thing repeated over
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:53.760]   again.
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.540]   He didn't mind these first paragraphs and so on.
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:18:01.140]   But this desperate fuss about the exact word all the time, "Don't worry about it," he said.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:02.340]   "This is the truth of God.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:03.860]   Let the truth go out."
[00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.260]   And I must say, it's very interesting how many people have said to all of us in the
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:11.460]   family, "It's great reading his books.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:14.580]   We can hear him as we read it."
[00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:15.580]   And that's the point.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:16.580]   This is what he...
[00:18:16.580 --> 00:18:19.620]   It was the content that mattered.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:21.220]   This was the thing on which you concentrated.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.660]   Of course, you made the content as nice as you could for people to understand it, but
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:30.140]   you didn't fuss and fiddle on about the style, for that style.
[00:18:30.140 --> 00:18:35.900]   Then the other thing that he was really not keen on, he didn't enjoy novels.
[00:18:35.900 --> 00:18:40.140]   Now I must make this quite clear, he didn't disapprove of novels.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.420]   He didn't object, really, to other people reading them within moderation, as with everything
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:47.620]   else, though I think he did sometimes feel that too much novel reading was a waste of
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:48.620]   time.
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.480]   But he himself didn't enjoy them.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:57.100]   He actively disliked Dickens and Hardy, "depressing men," he used to say.
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:02.460]   Dickens, I think, probably because of the intense assault on the emotions that Dickens
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:03.460]   keeps on doing.
[00:19:03.460 --> 00:19:06.260]   You know, he keeps on twanging on your heart strings, "Everybody dies by inches, and they're
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:08.100]   always little girls," and all this kind of thing.
[00:19:08.100 --> 00:19:10.180]   I don't think he could take this.
[00:19:10.180 --> 00:19:16.220]   And then Hardy, with his cynical pessimism, he disliked them.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:22.060]   And as I say, novels in general, he didn't enjoy, but there was one great exception,
[00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:24.660]   and that was Sir Walter Scott.
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.300]   Now Sir Walter Scott, he really had enjoyed tremendously.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:31.420]   As I say, he didn't...
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:35.980]   Time was at a premium in his ministerial life, and I don't remember him reading him much.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.960]   But Scott was a novelist whom he loved.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.640]   And the funny thing about him was, of course, that the bit that the rest of us always skip,
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:48.820]   the first 100 pages of every Scott novel, that was the bit he liked best.
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:52.020]   You see, it's this non-potted thing again.
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.260]   Here was Scott building up his background.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:55.620]   He loved it.
[00:19:55.620 --> 00:20:00.500]   Also, I always think, as far as I myself am concerned, it's interesting how perspicacious
[00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:02.700]   he was as a lover of literature.
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:06.660]   It always worries me, as an ex-English teacher, how they often start children off with Scott
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.100]   with Quentin Derwood or Ivanhoe.
[00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:14.140]   Far and away the most boring thing Scott ever wrote.
[00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:22.820]   Now, my father started me off with Scott with the antiquary, a great novel, and old mortality,
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.460]   another one, Heart of Midlothian, all these.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.220]   They were the ones he got me onto first.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:28.940]   Scott at his greatest, really.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:34.020]   So his whole approach to Scott was interesting, and as I say, really very perspicacious.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:39.100]   So Scott really was all right as far as novels were concerned.
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:44.140]   Now that really also leads me on to say that he was very fair about novels.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:45.540]   I haven't mentioned one thing.
[00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:46.540]   He was very good.
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:50.220]   He would often put us in touch with perhaps writers we hadn't heard of.
[00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.380]   I'll be coming onto this more just a little later on, but it was he, for instance, who
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:55.220]   began me off on John Buchan.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:58.860]   Interesting, he, during the war, produced a few copies of Buchan and said, "I think
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:20:59.860]   you'll enjoy this."
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.780]   But I think probably Buchan again, because he's in a sort of Scott mold, in a way.
[00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:07.820]   It's this kind of novelist he liked.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:11.900]   But there was one lesson, I think, that he always taught us.
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:18.100]   And that was, and here I come onto something else that he felt strongly against in reading.
[00:21:18.100 --> 00:21:22.780]   And that was that reading must never become like a drug.
[00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:27.140]   Fred has memories of his talking about people who are always wandering about with their
[00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.140]   noses in books.
[00:21:28.140 --> 00:21:32.620]   I always have an uncomfortable feeling that he may have been referring to, well, perhaps
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:34.020]   to me, perhaps to Anne, perhaps to both of us.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.020]   I don't know at that time.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:38.860]   There was a time, I remember quite well, when I'd evolved a system whereby you could dress
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.460]   and undress while reading a book at the same time.
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:45.900]   Now, this kind of thing, I think, worried him a little.
[00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:49.180]   In other words, reading can very quickly become a drug.
[00:21:49.180 --> 00:21:53.420]   I think that was why perhaps he had slight reservations about novels as well.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.820]   One must never allow reading to sort of drug one.
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.700]   One must never allow it to take control of one.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:03.300]   The Christian reader is to be in control of his reading as well as of everything else.
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.620]   So that was a danger.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:12.020]   The other thing too, and he makes a very clear point of this, that never, never should one
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:16.040]   read just to impress other people.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:21.020]   He says, "I have emphasized the place and value of reading.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:27.920]   But if your chief reason for reading is to parade it and make a display of your knowledge,
[00:22:27.920 --> 00:22:30.500]   it is obviously bad in every sense."
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:37.540]   Now, he was talking largely about ministers there, but I think he meant all of us as well.
[00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:42.340]   He was always worried when somebody would become famous in the world of whatever it
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:46.620]   was and you'd get Christians rushing to get hold of it just to get a smattering of knowledge
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:49.380]   about him in order to say, "I have read so and so."
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.300]   Now, this always concerned him.
[00:22:51.300 --> 00:22:54.380]   You don't read in order to show how well read you are.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:23:01.140]   You read, as we'll go on to see, for much more important and profound reasons.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:07.780]   And the other thing that he felt very strongly was that you never read just to get ideas
[00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:11.140]   which you then regurgitated.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.340]   He said, "We are not meant to be gramophone records or tape recording machines."
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:22.020]   I remember sometimes he's expressing some anxiety about various speakers who, because
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:27.260]   of their love for the writers of the 17th, 18th, 19th century, would produce the thoughts
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:33.380]   of the 17th, 18th, 19th century and often in the language of the 17th, 18th, 19th century.
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.340]   In other words, a kind of regurgitation of your reading was what he didn't like.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:41.980]   He used to worry sometimes about a person who he'd say, "Goodness, isn't he able?"
[00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:46.060]   "Yes," he'd say, "but I think that what he is is just a good student."
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:50.900]   Now, this didn't mean that he didn't want people to work or to concentrate on their
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:54.900]   work, but not just somebody who read things and could reproduce them.
[00:23:54.900 --> 00:23:58.100]   Reading was much more than that, he said, much more than that.
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.900]   And here I go on to perhaps one of his most significant statements about reading, and
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:05.380]   now I am moving on to the positive.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:10.500]   He said, "In a sense, one should not go to books for ideas.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.220]   The business of books is to make one think.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:22.100]   The function of reading is to stimulate us in general, to stimulate us to think and to
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.340]   think for ourselves.
[00:24:25.340 --> 00:24:29.180]   Take all you read," he said, "and masticate it thoroughly."
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.380]   It's rather like bacon, isn't it?
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.140]   You know about books that are meant to be not some swallowed, etc., etc., but some are
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:37.340]   meant to be chewed and digested.
[00:24:37.340 --> 00:24:39.860]   That was the reading that my father approved of.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.020]   You chewed and you digested your books so that they became part of you.
[00:24:44.020 --> 00:24:45.580]   You were then stimulated.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:46.580]   You thought.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:52.100]   And what came out was your, as it were, quintessence of all the reading, but it was yours.
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:54.700]   It wasn't originality for originality's sake.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:56.180]   That was not what he meant.
[00:24:56.180 --> 00:25:00.300]   You took all this wisdom of all the ages and you made them a part of you.
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.300]   You were stimulated.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:04.940]   So you thought better, and as a result, you spoke better.
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:08.980]   So then coming on to his reading himself, what were the marks of his reading?
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:14.500]   Well, you may be surprised at this, but he was not a quick reader.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.380]   I'm sure most people thought that he got through books at the speed of knots.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:18.740]   He didn't.
[00:25:18.740 --> 00:25:20.440]   He wished he could.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:25.140]   My mother said that he often said, "You know, there are so many books to be read.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.940]   I wish I could read more quickly."
[00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:29.540]   But he was basically a slow reader.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.860]   He once apparently sent away an answer to some advertisement for a book that told you
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:35.900]   how to read more quickly.
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.100]   One of these books that tells you just to look at the middle of the page and all the
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.300]   other words will float into it and it'll be all right.
[00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:45.820]   But in the end, he came back to his own method of reading, and he read in his own way.
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.260]   He read a lot, yes, but he didn't read it quickly.
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:52.780]   But of course, the great thing about him was his phenomenal, and I use the word advisedly,
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.120]   I think, memory.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.300]   He remembered what he read.
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:04.580]   And I think he remembered what he read because of these things that I've talked about before.
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:09.780]   Because he concentrated on the contents and this, what I can not think of putting it in
[00:26:09.780 --> 00:26:13.140]   a better way, mastication principle.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:16.820]   Because he read in this way, then he remembered it all.
[00:26:16.820 --> 00:26:20.820]   It's interesting, as Fred has referred to his knowledge of the New Testament, he was
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.340]   not at all a rote learner.
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.060]   He couldn't learn by heart.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:28.940]   He actually couldn't learn by heart.
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.540]   I mean, to sit him down with a four-line verse and say, "Now, learn that," he couldn't do
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:33.540]   it.
[00:26:33.540 --> 00:26:38.260]   But if he was preaching and he would begin on a passage in Paul, a verse would come to
[00:26:38.260 --> 00:26:42.260]   his mind, he would often go through about 15 verses without stopping, absolutely correctly
[00:26:42.260 --> 00:26:45.460]   in the authorized fashion, because he knew it.
[00:26:45.460 --> 00:26:50.340]   The contents had mastered him, and so it came into his mind.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:53.500]   So the slowness of the reading didn't matter.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.820]   He contained all that he read.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:27:00.500]   May I say, incidentally, it's quite interesting, on this knowledge of the Bible, though she
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:05.900]   would, I think, be very annoyed if she knew I was saying this, my mother, I think, probably
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.680]   could hold a candle to him in the Old Testament.
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:11.260]   He would often have to turn to her over some of the stories.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:14.940]   And if he wanted to know the names of the three daughters of Job, for instance, mother
[00:27:14.940 --> 00:27:16.780]   would know them, the three of them.
[00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:18.340]   This kind of thing often.
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:23.420]   She had a good sense, she has a good sense of the Old Testament stories, and he would
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:27.480]   often turn to her and say, "Now, where does that story about whatever it was come?"
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:32.400]   But on the New Testament, the epistles of Paul, he was matchless.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.700]   Now with regard to his reading himself, his general reading, I think the amazing thing,
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:43.780]   really, was the breadth of his reading, the extent of it.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.660]   And as I said, this is what is so difficult, really, to know even how to begin to handle.
[00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:50.700]   He was a very wide reader, indeed.
[00:27:50.700 --> 00:27:54.360]   Fred has mentioned some of it, and really I can only underline some of the ways in which
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:55.600]   he read.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   He said at one point, he had been asked, obviously, about the chief function of reading.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:02.780]   I've said about the stimulus, that was the main thing.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.160]   But he then went on and said, "What then is the main function of reading?
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.360]   It is to provide information."
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:16.600]   Now he read widely for information, and it was interesting how important this was in
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.520]   so many fields.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.760]   For instance, the Westminster conferences, I'm sure we all remember, don't we?
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.200]   He'd finish, wouldn't he, at the last lecture.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:29.640]   And he'd have his subject, you know, how he'd read it all, how he got all these facts, how
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.260]   he chaired all these meetings.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:37.360]   And he knew all the speaker's facts as well as they did often, sometimes a little better.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.480]   I remember once in the very early days, he's reminding the speaker of something that he
[00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:44.400]   hadn't actually put in his own lecture.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.840]   He read widely for information of that kind.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:49.720]   He also read for information in other ways.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:53.480]   And this is where I often think that he has, certainly as far as I myself am concerned,
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.160]   a lot to teach.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.360]   He read for information on very basic things.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.840]   And here we have a very interesting story in our immediate family.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:06.880]   Our elder son had to have a series of eye operations.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.120]   And at one point, my father was away, and Christopher began producing some very unpleasant,
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:16.560]   frightening symptoms.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:20.880]   And the doctors were completely baffled by them.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:24.140]   It was almost like that bit in Christopher Robin, you know, all sorts and conditions
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:28.360]   of famous physicians, almost came hurrying around at a run.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.800]   But certainly, they were called in, these strange, distressing symptoms that this boy
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:33.800]   had.
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:36.240]   And they began to discuss what it was.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.240]   Was it something psychiatric?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.840]   Was it this and that?
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:40.480]   And nobody knew what it was.
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.880]   In the end, they were going to send him to a series of specialists.
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:49.880]   At this point, my father came back from his holidays, came back to find us all very anxious
[00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.880]   about him.
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:54.120]   And he said, "Well, now tell me about this."
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.680]   Medical system, wasn't it really?
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.960]   And we told him the whole story.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:02.880]   And he said, "The next time you take him to the outpatients, I'm coming up with you."
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.160]   So Christopher and I went up to the outpatients.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   My father came with us.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:07.160]   And of course, it's great.
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:09.600]   The old boy network amongst doctors is terrific.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:13.180]   Doctors can always go in and say, "Well, I'm a doctor here, and this is fine."
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:15.040]   So they let him in.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:23.560]   And he asked the young houseman, I suppose it was, if he could see Christopher's notes.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.880]   And as I say, because imagine one of us asking to see his notes.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:29.880]   You know what happens in hospitals if you ask to see anything, your temperature chart
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.880]   or anything.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.000]   However, there was this old doctor who could...
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.280]   Well, he couldn't do any harm with the notes.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.400]   So they handed him Christopher's notes.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:39.440]   And he sat while Christopher was being seen and everything.
[00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:45.000]   And there was considerable conversation going on, going through the notes, carefully, carefully,
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.440]   and accurately.
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:50.280]   And the consultation was over.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:51.280]   He made notes.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:52.280]   That's another thing, by the way.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:57.760]   He said, "You should never read without having a notepad at your side and a pencil, so that
[00:30:57.760 --> 00:31:00.040]   anything you read, anything that struck you, you could write it down."
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.600]   So he went through the notes carefully.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.000]   He didn't say anything.
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.280]   He came home, got out the notes, and he then went...
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.680]   Now, the doctors, if there's any doctor here, they'll know what I mean.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:14.560]   There's a huge book of medicines, a great big sort of thing, telling you every medicine
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:15.560]   that is made.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.280]   It's brought out afresh every year.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:18.280]   He went to this book.
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:20.160]   He always had one of these.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:26.640]   He looked it up, and he found that at a certain point, Christopher had been given a certain
[00:31:26.640 --> 00:31:29.920]   drug.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.200]   He found out about the drug in his compendium of medicines, whatever it's called, and read
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:40.040]   there the side effects of the drug.
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:43.380]   In other words, he had read the information.
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:48.080]   In other words, you see, instead of just talking about things and airing theories, and I say
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.880]   his winged words about the current state of some young doctors were marvelous to hear
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   afterwards.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:56.960]   But you see, he read.
[00:31:56.960 --> 00:32:03.860]   He never put forward theories and great ideas on things that could be a matter of fact.
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:07.400]   He always made certain that he knew his fact, and so he read them.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:10.640]   And of course, once we had discovered about this medicine, it was passed back to the doctors,
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:13.520]   who all had to agree, "Yes, of course, this was the reason, and everything was perfectly
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.120]   all right," and the symptoms went.
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:18.720]   So, facts.
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:22.560]   But more than this, again, telling you a family story.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:29.160]   Our younger son, as many teenagers do at one point, flirted dangerously with transcendental
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:38.880]   meditation and was talking endlessly about it, of course, and discussing it with everybody,
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:42.280]   and saying he'd been reading these marvelous books that were going to set the world right,
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   and it was all great from the standpoint of 15 years old.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:50.840]   So my father said, "Well, now, what are these books?
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.760]   This is the great thing about grandparents, isn't it?
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:55.840]   They have time to talk."
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:33:01.880]   And so Jonathan produced the book by the guru, a man called Lob Sang Rampa.
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:05.960]   I always have to think, I have a tendency to say Lab Sang Su Shong, which is a kind
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:11.920]   of tea, but it actually was Lob Sang Rampa.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:13.760]   And my father said, "I'll take that book.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:15.920]   I'll read it," he said.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:21.180]   So he took the book with him and went off preaching in Manchester, actually in the Free
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.180]   Trade Hall.
[00:33:22.180 --> 00:33:28.480]   And they had a great service on this particular evening, and as he came home in the train
[00:33:28.480 --> 00:33:34.040]   that evening, he thought he would read Jonathan's book.
[00:33:34.040 --> 00:33:35.840]   And he read it from cover to cover.
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.400]   He did say that he had a slightly uncomfortable feeling.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:45.560]   The book was a little paperback with a picture of a sort of Chinese face.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:49.320]   The book was called, may I tell you, The Third Eye.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:53.680]   And in the Chinese face, there was an eye in the middle like that, a most bizarre-looking
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:58.640]   cover, hideous, with this eye glaring out from the cover.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:02.880]   He did have a slightly uncomfortable feeling that the people who had heard him preach in
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.840]   the Free Trade Hall, if one of them were sitting opposite him, would wonder quite what was
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:08.400]   going on.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.800]   However, he read it.
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:12.760]   He read it with care.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.760]   He read it seriously.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:17.040]   He took notes on it.
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:21.240]   And when he came back, he went through it with Jonathan.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:24.280]   In other words, the tendency so often, isn't it, with young ones is to say, "Oh, but goodness
[00:34:24.280 --> 00:34:25.280]   sake, that's all rubbish.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:27.200]   You forget about trans, and that's nothing.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:28.200]   You grow out of that."
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:29.320]   Not at all.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:33.360]   He wanted to know just exactly what it was that was getting hold of this boy.
[00:34:33.360 --> 00:34:34.960]   And he went through.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:38.880]   He said where the points were good, but he pointed out where they were dangerous.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.580]   And because he had read it, he knew the book far better than Jonathan did.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:47.020]   And as a result, the information that he had acquired made him able to deal with this kind
[00:34:47.020 --> 00:34:48.020]   of situation.
[00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:52.240]   And I'm sure you could all multiply these stories in so many other occasions, this reading
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   for information.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:58.580]   Then, of course, and here, as I say, I can only just say it in general.
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:35:01.280]   He read widely, and he read generally.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:09.200]   He read biography, again, detailed, rich biographies, and of a very interesting variety.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:16.200]   He, for instance, had greatly enjoyed reading a biography of that great, brilliant, and
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.980]   tragic figure of the 19th century, Cardinal Newman.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:25.120]   This whole story of where he'd gone wrong, and how it had happened, and what this great
[00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:30.280]   mind, how it worked, and so on, the whole way the Catholic mind worked, he'd read that.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:34.120]   I remember, too, once Fred and I had to go to a luncheon where I had the great good fortune
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:39.080]   to sit next to Owen Chadwick, one of the Regius professors at Cambridge.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.280]   And I had greatly enjoyed this.
[00:35:40.280 --> 00:35:44.080]   I had come across Owen Chadwick's Victorian church myself.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:47.400]   But I came back, and as Fred says, he was always very interested in everything that
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   was going on.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.720]   And I said I was sitting next to Owen Chadwick.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:56.520]   And I found, you see, he'd read all Owen Chadwick's books, knew them in detail, found them interesting,
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:03.160]   said how significant this outstanding book of Chadwick's is on the secularization of
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.800]   thought in the 19th century.
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.800]   He'd read it.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:06.800]   He knew it.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:12.040]   All these interesting thinkers of the day, he read them, as I say, biography itself.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.440]   And he believed in reading widely, and he gave his reasons.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:18.440]   He said, "It will be good for your mind," he said.
[00:36:18.440 --> 00:36:21.960]   "It will preserve resilience and freshness."
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:28.520]   I have always tried to do this and to take certain journals which deal with general affairs
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:35.040]   and literary matters and where there are good, well-written articles and, and I underline
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:40.400]   it, good book reviews, which will suggest other books for reading.
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:43.360]   Now, I've been talking to Mr. Sayer about this.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.440]   You see, here's the Evangelical Library.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   He read all the book reviews, didn't he?
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.560]   And he told, he phoned up and said, "Now, I've read a good review here.
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:51.800]   How about this book?"
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.560]   He read the reviews.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:58.520]   They not only made him enjoy his own reading and give him further ideas, but you see, they
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:03.820]   enabled him to join enthusiastically in other people's reading as well.
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.480]   And he was really great here.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:07.680]   This is another thing I miss.
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:14.000]   He used to give books for birthdays, for Christmas, for the end of a holiday or the beginning
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   of a holiday.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   Any occasion where he could give a book, he would, and he used to love doing it, and it
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:26.280]   was always the book that you would like because he knew the kind of thing that we liked, and
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.880]   then he would read his reviews and think, "Ah, yes, now that would be a good one."
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:33.360]   He'd keep an eye on contemporary literature for Ann.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:40.280]   Knowing my fondness for Victorian books, religious tract society books, Mr. Sayer is very helpful
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.840]   to me here as well at the Evangelical Library.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:50.600]   People like Hesbert Stratton, the other ones that wrote these Christian-based books, he
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.000]   knew I enjoyed them.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.280]   And so what was my joy one Christmas, you see, to receive a book that I'd never even
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:38:00.680]   heard of called The Religion of the Heart, a book that considers all these writers and
[00:38:00.680 --> 00:38:05.400]   deals with them and gives further suggestions for reading and so on.
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:11.400]   Somebody we once knew was thinking of doing a PhD theology thesis.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:16.240]   He'd got a subject, my father produced him a reading list that long.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:19.720]   He read his reviews, he knew the kind of books, he'd read half of them himself, but at least
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:22.120]   he knew the field in which the man moved.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:27.120]   And in a way, even more remarkable, I think, was his extraordinary series of pieces of
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:36.200]   advice to our daughter, to Bethan, who was doing a very esoteric thesis on a very particular
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:44.600]   sort of literary subject of language in poetry and so on, people like Edward Thomas and the
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:50.040]   old early Welsh poets, these old bards and so on.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:54.080]   And he said to her, "You know, along this line you're discussing," he said, "There are
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:56.920]   some interesting developments in Cambridge at the moment."
[00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.280]   This was about three, four years ago.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.320]   He said, "You see, there are these structuralist fellows in Cambridge," he said, "There's going
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.360]   to be some sort of problem there, I think.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.400]   Obviously, their writings are beginning to clash."
[00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:12.280]   Well, of course, two years later, the whole balloon blew up in Cambridge, but he'd seen
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:13.580]   it coming.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:19.520]   He would say, "There's a book you should read by Frank Kermode, exactly along your line,"
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:20.520]   he would say.
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:24.880]   Or, "I read a poem by one of your tutors, Tom Paulin, in the Times Literary Supplement
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:25.880]   this week."
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:31.720]   I mean, not only in general knowledge, but in specific little details of research, he
[00:39:31.720 --> 00:39:36.480]   would know what was going on, and as a result was able to help us to enjoy what we were
[00:39:36.480 --> 00:39:37.480]   reading.
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.400]   He was a tremendous enthusiast.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:46.840]   And he enjoyed sharing with other people's enthusiasms as well, with the grandchildren.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:53.360]   You see, he would enjoy discussing the finer points of a wrestler with Adam, or school
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:59.120]   problems with the two older girls, or American politics with Jonathan.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:04.320]   And in fact, I remember myself, when I was a very little girl, I used to collect cigarette
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   cards.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Now, as you can imagine, it was rather a hard job for me to collect cigarette cards, because
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.880]   nobody anywhere smoked around me.
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:19.160]   There were very few members of the church in Abravan that smoked either.
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:28.080]   And I really laboured my way through a collection of film stars in cigarette cards.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:30.800]   I can't remember if it was Wills or Players.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:38.000]   Anyhow, by catching from my friends, by borrowing from school friends, fathers, all devious
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:43.600]   means, I got them all, except Norma Shearer.
[00:40:43.600 --> 00:40:46.480]   And Norma Shearer hung over me for weeks.
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.680]   I couldn't get her.
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:51.440]   I kept on getting all these ordinary ones, like Errol Flynn and all these others, but
[00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:53.040]   not Norma Shearer.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.560]   I can't remember what number she was even, and I was getting depressed about this.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:59.240]   I suppose I was about seven or eight.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:04.000]   These cigarette card collections are now selling for anything up to £100.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.040]   But anyhow, as I say, there it was.
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:07.040]   I couldn't get her.
[00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.320]   And then one morning, I've remembered it to this day, I got up and there at my breakfast
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:18.600]   place on my plate was Norma Shearer.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.000]   And my excitement was tremendous.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:25.440]   And apparently what had happened was my father had been preaching somewhere up the valleys.
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:28.000]   And somebody who'd been driving him, they always had tea.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.960]   Oh, goodness, I'd look back at these times, these marvelous teas that there were between
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.880]   the afternoon and the evening meeting.
[00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:38.920]   You'd go to somebody's house, the table groaning with food, and there would be talk, and the
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.200]   ministers would be there.
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:41.480]   They were great days.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.480]   However, on this particular occasion, the man who'd been driving him pulled out a packet
[00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:49.520]   of cigarettes, pulled a cigarette out.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:54.960]   My father leaned across the table and said, "Excuse me, have you got a card in that packet?"
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:42:00.560]   Somewhat surprised, the man said, "Well, I'll have a look."
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:01.560]   "Pulled it out?"
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.560]   "Yes, I have," he said.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   My father said, "Can I see it?"
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   "Good," he said, "it's Norma Shearer."
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:16.200]   Now, you see what I mean.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.960]   I'm now off my point, aren't I?
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.480]   But it's part of the thing that made him such a great reader.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:22.480]   He was a great...
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:25.160]   He joined in with it, or that was why it was so...
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.680]   Ministers have said so often how much they loved him coming to preach for them.
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:32.480]   He'd join in with the enthusiasms and everything, and it didn't matter what it was, whether
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:36.280]   you were reading great tomes of philosophy or whatever, or whether you were a little
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:40.000]   girl collecting cigarette cards, he'd join in with you, and he would enjoy it with you,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.400]   and your pleasure was as much to him as his own pleasure in finding it.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:50.040]   Then, and this is very significant of him as a reader, he believed, of course, in relaxation.
[00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:53.840]   Now, on the whole, if people do a lot of reading, people say, "Well, you know, when you get
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.720]   tired, go out and have a walk, or play a game of tennis, or watch television or something."
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   Not my father.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:02.240]   He has a sentence which I think is very revealing.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:10.080]   He says, "The mind must be given relief and rested, but to relieve your mind does not
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:13.300]   mean that you stop reading.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.000]   You read something different."
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.720]   Now, this is what he did also.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:22.800]   He read for relaxation, and the funny thing about this, and it's something that often
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:29.600]   used to amuse my mother, his real relaxing reading was his medical journals.
[00:43:29.600 --> 00:43:33.360]   He read Netson, as Fred says, right to the end.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.920]   He enjoyed them, and often you'd find him in the evening reading them.
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:42.120]   And as I say, he sometimes read them to the most marvelous effect.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:45.280]   He didn't just read them to relax, he took them in.
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:51.720]   Again, he masticated his medical reading as well, and sometimes it was invaluable.
[00:43:51.720 --> 00:43:56.440]   He would have read of something in some medical magazine somewhere that was just the answer
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:01.080]   that somebody somewhere needed, and so he read for relaxation.
[00:44:01.080 --> 00:44:03.480]   He also read apologetic works, of course.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:06.800]   Now really, where can I start here?
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:10.040]   I was talking to the Reverend Howard Jones the other day, and he said that he thought
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:13.560]   the great thing about him was that he was always about 10 years ahead of everybody else
[00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:16.680]   in his reading, and I think there's a lot in this.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:22.240]   I have read with great interest this last week in the Welsh Evangelical Movement magazine,
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:29.360]   the Kilchgroun, a review, and an excellent review by a book, about a book, by a man called
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:34.520]   Rene Loranta on Catholic charismatics.
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:40.720]   It's a very, the Welsh review is a very interesting one, and I wholeheartedly support what he
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:41.720]   says.
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:47.680]   But the interesting thing is, now this is appearing in June 1982.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:53.880]   My father got a number of us reading this book, I think at the beginning of 1978.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:45:00.960]   In other words, he read, he was aware and kept himself aware of the general thought
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   of the world.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:03.640]   You see, I'm slightly moving on now.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.920]   We've come from literature and so on.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:12.140]   He had read Hans Kuhn long before anybody else had ever heard of Hans Kuhn.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.920]   He knew what Hans Kuhn was saying.
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:15.300]   He could see this problem.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.080]   Not only could he see the problem arising in the English faculty in Cambridge, but he
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:23.680]   could see the philosophical and the theological developments of the world.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.920]   And he was slightly amused at the sort of wild rush that a lot of speakers had to do
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:31.440]   to get hold of a copy of Hans Kuhn to read him because they didn't know him.
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.800]   He had read him and he had understood him and saw how the man's thought was going and
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:39.360]   the problems that were going to arise.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.640]   Again, to quote my mother, she said that he often used to say to her that he felt that
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:50.400]   when you read general reading like this, philosophy, as I say, and general religious thought, he
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:56.360]   always wanted to know the other man's point of view better than he knows it himself.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:01.740]   I illustrated that, didn't I, with Jonathan and that transcendental meditation man.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:07.200]   Not only that, he used to say, you must read all these books, and he used to do it himself.
[00:46:07.200 --> 00:46:10.560]   And because he read them so thoroughly, he always advised us, didn't he, and I'm sure
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:18.280]   you all remember this, to be quite certain what a man didn't say as much as what he did.
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.440]   So often, you know, one would read and get taken over by a writer and say, "My goodness,
[00:46:22.440 --> 00:46:24.120]   he says A, B, C, D, E."
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:28.480]   "Yes," he would say, "but he doesn't say F, G, H, I, J."
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:31.360]   In other words, you're missing what he's not saying.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:35.360]   So all these philosophical books he read, and he read all the journals, they all came
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:40.360]   pouring into the house, the theological journals of every shade and color would arrive in the
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   house.
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.200]   He would read them, and as I say, reading these reviews, he'd have ideas for his own
[00:46:45.200 --> 00:46:46.200]   reading.
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:50.120]   Not only that, he felt that it was important for us all as Christians to know what was
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:51.480]   going on in the world around us.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:56.280]   One of the last books he gave Fred and me was a book by this man, Harry Blaymeier, or
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.480]   Blaymeier, I'm sure some of you've read him.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:00.360]   He said, "Read this man.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.800]   He's an interesting man.
[00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.720]   See what his position is, where he stands with regard to us, how close he comes, and
[00:47:05.720 --> 00:47:08.200]   yet how far away he is," and so on.
[00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:09.760]   He enjoyed this kind of reading.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:15.160]   But he said, too, that one always needed to be careful about one's general reading.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:17.720]   It's the same point as I was making earlier.
[00:47:17.720 --> 00:47:20.700]   General reading is good, but it must never take over.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.120]   You must know yourself, he would say.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:27.000]   If you find you're spending too much time on reading something, stop it and balance
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:28.080]   it back again.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:33.520]   He believed in balance, and not only was he balanced himself, as I said already, he was
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:34.560]   helpful to others.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:41.400]   He said, "You have to know what to read for yourself and also for others," and he certainly
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   did.
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:47.400]   It's interesting to me always, looking back historically, the last 30-odd years, what
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:53.160]   a help he was to those of us who read literature back in the '40s and '50s.
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.040]   You see, this was the time before the whole arts thing had taken over in the Christian
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:01.200]   world, before Dr. Shafer's books had begun to come out and the help that Dr. Shafer's
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.080]   books have to give.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:06.960]   I was reading English at Oxford at the time, and I remember quite well getting myself into
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:13.480]   terrible trouble by attacking Chaucer for writing some story that I felt was old man.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:15.840]   I didn't quite, but I very nearly did.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:19.160]   And of course, the wrath of the tutor came upon my head.
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.520]   And I remember telling my father this, rather thinking that I'd been suffering as a Christian,
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:23.520]   as it were.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.840]   "Not at all," he said, "you're not handling your literature properly."
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   He believed in this balance.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.320]   You looked at literature as literature, and as a Christian, he helped you to handle it,
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:38.480]   to see what the style did, what the content was, what the purpose of the man was in writing
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:39.480]   it.
[00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:43.360]   I learned far more from him than from the tutor how to handle literature itself.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:46.600]   And he was very good at giving the right book to the right person.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:50.000]   He tempered the wind, of course, to the shorn lamb.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:52.760]   He has a marvelous passage, hasn't he, in Preaching and Preachers, where he says, "If
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:57.360]   somebody is introspective and slightly given to depression, you do not give them a book
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:02.640]   that is thundering out the message of conviction of sin and the total depravity of man," and
[00:49:02.640 --> 00:49:03.640]   so on.
[00:49:03.640 --> 00:49:07.320]   Otherwise, he said, you will drive him mad.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:08.320]   He knew his people.
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:09.640]   He knew how to help them.
[00:49:09.640 --> 00:49:13.880]   As I say, from literature students through, as Fred says, to souls who were suffering,
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.400]   there was always something that he could find.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.920]   And now I must quickly do the last three things, the reading he loved best.
[00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:24.940]   I've left this till the end, but of course, in a way, this is what you know even better
[00:49:24.940 --> 00:49:25.940]   than I do, a lot of you.
[00:49:25.940 --> 00:49:28.320]   I know this certainly as well as I do.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.320]   He read theology.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   A preacher, he said, should continue to read theology as long as he is alive.
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:38.280]   But it must be biblical theology.
[00:49:38.280 --> 00:49:42.680]   He didn't like this arid reading and discussion of theology where you tossed one doctrine
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:44.520]   around from one to the other.
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:49.000]   It had to be theology that arose out of the Word of God.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.520]   This was theology at its greatest to him.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:56.000]   And when he read a book of theology, again, he could see what the man didn't say.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.880]   Just I remember when he was in hospital having some very unpleasant treatment.
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:06.440]   For the whole of one hour, when the treatment was really at its worst, he sat talking to
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.720]   us about a person that's having a great vogue at the moment in the States, this marvelous
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:14.080]   new evangelical theologian.
[00:50:14.080 --> 00:50:17.240]   He said, "You need to watch his writings.
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:20.240]   He's not quite right," he said.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.600]   In other words, his theology was so great, it was so much a part of him that he could
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.840]   almost feel what other people were saying.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.560]   Then there was his devotional reading.
[00:50:28.560 --> 00:50:30.920]   I use this word carefully.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.720]   Because he said at one point, "I abominate," he said, and it's a very strong word, "I abominate
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.040]   devotional commentaries.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:41.760]   I do not want other people to do my devotions for me."
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.800]   He didn't like a sort of sentimental devotionalism at all.
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:50.160]   What he meant by something devotional was a type of reading, he said, which will help
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:56.440]   you in general to understand and enjoy the scriptures.
[00:50:56.440 --> 00:50:58.200]   He had a lot of people in this.
[00:50:58.200 --> 00:51:04.080]   The Puritans, he said, "You will find, I think, in general, that the Puritans are invariably
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.440]   helpful."
[00:51:05.440 --> 00:51:09.840]   He told the story of how when he himself was at a low ebb, how the heavenly Dr. Sibbes,
[00:51:09.840 --> 00:51:14.760]   do you remember, had helped him by the bruised reed and the soul's conflict.
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:19.600]   This heavenly pastoral figure had given him great blessing.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:22.680]   He knew that some of them, like John Owen, were the greater theologians, but he said,
[00:51:22.680 --> 00:51:24.460]   that was his expression about it.
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:30.440]   And then, of course, how often have we heard him say, "I am an 18th century man, Jonathan
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:31.940]   Edwards."
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:34.840]   He kept on saying to us, "You must read Jonathan Edwards.
[00:51:34.840 --> 00:51:39.200]   In the middle of your political lives and your traveling around, read Jonathan Edwards,"
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.280]   he said.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:45.480]   He is the one that can keep you with your feet solidly based on the rock.
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.520]   Read him and learn from him.
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:53.960]   Then, it's interesting too how, do you remember how in the Thanksgiving service, Gaius Davis
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:52:01.240]   and Mr. Romney Jenkins had a kind of slight debate about my father as a human being, whether
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.520]   he was essentially a doctor or essentially a preacher.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:06.760]   Do you remember the discussion they had almost?
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:11.040]   Now, not speaking about the greatness of the calling at all, I'm speaking now about him
[00:52:11.040 --> 00:52:13.480]   as a personality and as a temperament.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:16.720]   We in the family think probably that both were right.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   But there is one other thing that one must add, and that is that he was a Welshman.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.400]   Now this was a very important part of him.
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:31.920]   Imagine how many people were surprised that it was in Wales that he was buried.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.780]   He couldn't have been buried anywhere else.
[00:52:34.780 --> 00:52:38.280]   He was a Welshman through and through.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:44.640]   He loved the other nations, sometimes with a sardonic smile, but he was a Welshman.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:49.760]   And at the very end, he only read two things.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:55.560]   Now, one of those things was his book of Welsh hymns.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:53:00.600]   I'm sorry that so many of you are so deprived that I can't read some of them to you.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:06.800]   These men, you see, these transcendental, in the right way, poets, with their marvelous
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.740]   imagery, their great grasp of doctrine, the wonder of their love for God, the tenderness
[00:53:12.740 --> 00:53:15.560]   of their application of the gospel message to the soul.
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:16.560]   He loved them.
[00:53:16.560 --> 00:53:23.640]   And as I say at the end, it was that book, the one of the two, that was by his side.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   Always a Welshman.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.200]   Then, of course, he loved church history and biography.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.880]   Now, this is so obvious that I really need to go on.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:31.080]   You all know this.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:33.280]   What was the Westminster Conference doing?
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:36.560]   What was he always telling us to do but to read church history and biography?
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:38.200]   He loved it for itself.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:41.520]   Again, it had to be a detailed biography.
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:43.200]   None of these potted things.
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:52.080]   That's why he always enjoyed big ones, like, you know, Mr. Dalimor's book on Whitfield,
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:56.680]   or some of the earlier ones with their great concentration of detail and so on.
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:54:02.200]   He also felt, I think, that reading biography provided a balance.
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:08.480]   He said, "The best way of checking any tendency to pride, pride in your preaching or in anything
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:14.680]   else that you may do or may be, is to read on Sunday nights the biography of some great
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:15.680]   saint."
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:20.400]   And all I want to do really is to illustrate this by two short stories.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:23.680]   First of all, this reading on Sunday night.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:26.920]   The beginning of 1954, he was reading through D.E.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:29.360]   Jenkins' "Life of Thomas Charles."
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:31.120]   Some of you probably know it.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.040]   Big tomes again.
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.680]   And for several weeks in January and February, he would read bits of this aloud to us on
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:42.240]   Sunday evenings as we were going around getting supper and so on.
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.480]   He'd be sitting there in the chair reading bits aloud.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.680]   And in these two particular months, Thomas Charles was having terrible trouble with the
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:54.280]   lady whom he subsequently married.
[00:54:54.280 --> 00:54:57.920]   I don't know how many of you have read it, but she dithered for ages.
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:02.880]   She would come right up to the point, and then she would suddenly become afraid of launching
[00:55:02.880 --> 00:55:05.760]   upon the troubled seas of matrimony.
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:08.520]   Back Thomas Charles would go again into a depression.
[00:55:08.520 --> 00:55:10.960]   On and on, week after week, this went with the letters.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:13.520]   He loved the letters, didn't he, in biographies?
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:18.840]   Going back and forth, in the end, one glorious Sunday night, she said, "Yes."
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:22.480]   And I assure you, we were all really rejoicing in this.
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:30.280]   In fact, if I am to be very honest, I have to confess that the Sunday night before Fred
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:36.480]   and I were due to be married, he was reading bits out of Thomas Charles, I actually found
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:40.920]   myself thinking to myself, "Oh, bother, I won't be here next Sunday night."
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:48.560]   You see, so great was his enthusiasm that it had got hold of us all, really.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.560]   That was one story.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:56.000]   The other story was a marvellous occasion when we climbed up to see the great memorial
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.960]   to the Covenanters, the communion stones.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.600]   I don't know how many of you have been there.
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:03.440]   It's just up in the hills behind Hoyk.
[00:56:03.440 --> 00:56:05.840]   You know the great story of the Covenanters, how they used to have to go and have their
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:09.680]   communions up in the hills in case they were caught.
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.280]   We had a dire journey up there.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:13.200]   We had to go through fields full of bulls.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.920]   We had to leap over ditches, climb under barbed wire, but we got there.
[00:56:17.920 --> 00:56:23.600]   And we got to this really lyrically beautiful spot in a sort of amphitheatre of the hills.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:28.880]   And there's a great monument there, a high monument on the top is a communion cup.
[00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:32.920]   It's a wonderful monument to these great men of God, the Covenanters.
[00:56:32.920 --> 00:56:39.800]   And my chief memory is of my father, we arrived there, standing, looking at this thing and
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.720]   taking off his hat.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.000]   You see, he not only loved them, he was not only enthusiastic about these great men of
[00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:50.240]   God, he revered them as brothers in the gospel.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:52.040]   They meant so much to him.
[00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:56.120]   And I felt that was indicative of exactly how he felt about them.
[00:56:56.120 --> 00:56:59.080]   And then last of all, of course, the Bible.
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.520]   I've left this until the very end because you all know it.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:08.480]   He said, "Read it," he said, "because it is the bread of life, the manna for your soul's
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:12.000]   nourishment and well-being."
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.320]   You all know, I'm sure, that he followed the Murray M'Chayne system of reading.
[00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   He believed in reading the Bible often, from beginning to end, through and through, not
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.960]   just reading one's favourite passages.
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:29.480]   You studied certain passages when you needed them, but you read the Bible consistently,
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   time and time again.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.920]   I think Mother worked out that they must have done the system for at least, I think it was
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:37.800]   53 or 54 years.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:42.640]   So you see, the New Testament he would have read at least 110 times on the system, let
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.960]   alone all his own study for his sermons.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:50.780]   And it's a remarkable fact to me, he died on March the 1st.
[00:57:50.780 --> 00:57:58.360]   On February the 28th, the last chapter of the daily reading he would have read was 1
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:00.840]   Corinthians 15.
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:06.560]   It was as if the Lord, yes, he'd stopped taking the times, and the Lord was pointing him on
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:08.880]   to the resurrection of the body that was to come.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.800]   It was this great systematic reading he did.
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:18.880]   I've been rereading recently some of the very early sermons he preached in Aberavum.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.520]   You see, he read his Bible regularly.
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:22.520]   He knew it and he loved it.
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:30.840]   At the very end, when he couldn't speak, he would point to verses out of it.
[00:58:30.840 --> 00:58:37.080]   He pointed Anne to the one about all things to be content, not to be anxious.
[00:58:37.080 --> 00:58:42.000]   He pointed me to the one about, you know, this earthly house of our tabernacle, the
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:43.960]   far better reward that was waiting for him.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.000]   He just pointed to them, or he tried to write them down on a piece of paper.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.320]   It was the Bible, the Welsh hymns, and the Bible.
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:56.360]   And as I say, one of his early sermons in Aberavum said this, "On your own deathbed,"
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:59:03.360]   he was about 28 at the time, "you will be confident in the love of God and the knowledge
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:09.240]   which you have that Christ has died for you and your sins, and that you shall be with
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:12.480]   him in the world to come."
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:15.400]   Now he proved that.
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:23.840]   You see, that was true of him because great, enthusiastic, wide-ranging, fascinated reader
[00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:25.840]   that he was.
[00:59:25.840 --> 00:59:31.720]   As far as he was concerned, the only fact in the whole world that mattered was the truth
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:38.120]   to which the Word of God, his greatest reading, pointed him to, the old, old story of Jesus
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.200]   and his love.
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:45.080]   And to finish, I really would like to read you a passage out of this little book, The
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.560]   Force of Truth.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:56.480]   I think it really expresses the kind of way that we all saw my father at the very end.
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:02.400]   This is written by the Reverend John Scott, who wrote about Thomas Scott, and this is
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.600]   what he said.
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:11.520]   In the concluding years of his life, he was, as it appeared to me, obviously ripening for
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.180]   heaven.
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.040]   He had fought a good fight.
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:17.240]   He had finished his course.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:25.000]   He had kept the faith, so that at the last, his genuine humility before God, his joy in
[01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:32.760]   Christ Jesus, his holy zeal for the diffusion of the gospel, his tender affection to his
[01:00:32.760 --> 01:00:39.600]   family and all around him, his resignation to the will of his heavenly Father, and his
[01:00:39.600 --> 01:00:45.720]   exclusive trust in the merits and grace of his Savior, seemed to leave little more to
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:52.960]   be done but for the stroke of death to bring him to his grave in a full age, like as a
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:01:01.280]   shock of corn cometh in its season.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.200]   We do hope that you have been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones.
