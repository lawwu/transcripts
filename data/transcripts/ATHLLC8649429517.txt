[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.480]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.300]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.640]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I'm so excited you're here today
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:11.620]   for another Mailbag episode.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.660]   Yet again, this episode is packed
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.160]   with a ton of amazing hacks, questions,
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.960]   and wins you've all sent in.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.360]   There is a ton of stuff related to travel hacks,
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.960]   points, and miles, but I'm also gonna share my take
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.560]   on United's massive devaluation, what that means for you,
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.240]   Amex's increased bonus on the green card.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.840]   I'll share some of my top two card combos,
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.000]   talk about some major travel hacks I learned
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.200]   from personal experience on my past two trips,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   and I'll cover a few other great hacks related to health,
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.540]   money, cell phones, and more.
[00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.280]   So thank you all so much for sending in such great hacks,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.400]   deals, wins, questions.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.640]   I get amazing feedback from you all
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.360]   about how much you love hearing
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.080]   from the broader All The Hacks community
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.640]   through these episodes, so please keep those coming
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.720]   'cause there is another Mailbag episode coming soon.
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   But there is a lot to cover today,
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.980]   so let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.560]   If you've been listening to this podcast for a while,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.680]   you know that I'm a huge fan of Daffy,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.000]   a fast-growing modern platform and app
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.980]   for charitable giving that I am so excited
[00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.760]   to partner with for this episode.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.780]   Daffy allows you to give to any charity across the U.S.
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.800]   with just a few taps, but it's so much more than that
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.880]   because they do it all by helping you set up
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.080]   a donor-advised fund, or DAF,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.680]   which is a tax-advantaged account
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.760]   that lets you contribute cash, stocks, or crypto
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.780]   on a one-time or recurring basis,
[00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.800]   take the tax deduction at the time of the contribution,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:36.160]   and then distribute that money
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.800]   to over 1 1/2 million charities, schools,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.280]   and faith-based organizations whenever you want to.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.060]   Amy and I love Daffy because it's our one-stop shop
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.680]   for all our charitable giving
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.120]   and helps us be more intentional with giving.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.360]   We've already set up donations
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.380]   to so many charities that we care about,
[00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.800]   like Zero the End of Prostate Cancer and Charity Water.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.080]   And Daffy stores all our donation history for us,
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.440]   so we have a single summary for tax time
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.360]   and can evaluate and adjust our giving
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.640]   whenever we want in one place.
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.400]   But best of all, they have a mission
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.360]   I think we can all get behind,
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.400]   helping people be more generous more often.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.660]   So if you want a better system for your giving,
[00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.920]   head on over to allthehacks.com/daffy,
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.100]   and for a limited time, if you visit that link,
[00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.200]   you can get a free $25 to give to the charity of your choice.
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.200]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/daffy, D-A-F-F-Y.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.120]   So first I'll start with a few great wins.
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.680]   This one's from Chris about a trip to Europe.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.840]   He said he's learned a ton from listening to the podcast
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.660]   and he just booked a trip to Europe
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.780]   with friends this summer using Miles,
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.280]   and he managed to get four business class tickets
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.400]   from DC to Istanbul for 45,000 points per person,
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.040]   and two business class tickets back from Prague to DC
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.360]   for 61,000 miles a person
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.960]   with only about a $1,500 out of pocket total.
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.920]   He said that point.me had the value of all six tickets
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.280]   at over $27,000.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.080]   So if you subtract out $1,500 from fees,
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.080]   you'd take 25,500 divided by the 302,000 points Chris used.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.000]   That's a value of over eight cents per point,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.960]   which is amazing, awesome redemption.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.440]   Hope this trip is amazing for you.
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.120]   He said before this, he was one of those people
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.840]   that would always just use the portal to book
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.720]   and this is a major upgrade.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.680]   He's very excited for the trip and I'm also excited too.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.440]   So hopefully that can inspire other people
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.680]   to find similar trips.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.120]   RJ wrote in that he just got 100,000 points
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:38.560]   deposited to his account, I assume from a signup bonus,
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.160]   which is gonna help him take his family
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:41.640]   to Kauai next summer.
[00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.920]   Ashley wrote in saying that she's been listening for a year.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.400]   She had no credit cards and very little debt,
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.560]   and she wasn't taking advantage of all these rewards.
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.480]   And since then, she's got two cards with signup bonuses,
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.720]   met the requirements, gotten the bonuses,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.560]   paid off everything in full,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.760]   and took a trip to Granada with her husband
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.520]   that saved her over $1,500.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.360]   So awesome, I hope that trip is amazing.
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.600]   Last, I wanna share an awesome win from James,
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.040]   which is maybe a little different than others.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.520]   So he recently went to Fiji and got a great deal from LA
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.920]   for $800 a person round trip.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.200]   So he paid out of pocket and used points to get to LA
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.600]   from where he lives in Bend.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.720]   Then for hotels, he booked at Overwater Villa
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.120]   at the Marriott Momi Bay
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.480]   and burned through some serious points.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.600]   What I loved was that he said,
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.160]   "Did I optimize 100%?
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.160]   "Probably not.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.780]   "But did we get things done and locked in
[00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.380]   "and he could further worry about optimizing down the road?
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.200]   "Yes."
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.200]   And I love hearing that because yes,
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.360]   sometimes I can get stuck in that mode
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.440]   of trying to optimize the perfect, perfect,
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:42.960]   this getting the best deal.
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.000]   But at the same time,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.500]   I look back to my episode with Bill Perkins
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.240]   about optimizing for net fulfillment.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.680]   Sometimes it's really just about having the trip you want.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.360]   So awesome job, James.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.700]   I'm gonna congratulate you,
[00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.360]   not necessarily for getting the best deal,
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.280]   but for hopefully having the best trip.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.560]   So I wanna jump in and talk a little bit
[00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.620]   about some unfortunate news from United Airlines,
[00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.320]   which is a massive devaluation on the points front.
[00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.720]   So if you look at a lot of international trips,
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.960]   both economy and business,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.200]   you're gonna find now
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:13.760]   that those trips are a lot more expensive.
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.200]   So trips that used to cost 30,000 in economy
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.920]   look like they're now costing about 40 to 44,000 points,
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.140]   depending on whether it's on United or on partners.
[00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.000]   Trips in business that used to cost 60,000 or 70,000
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.440]   are now costing anywhere from 80 to 100,000.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.880]   Overall across the board,
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.480]   it looks like depending whether it's on United or partners,
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.960]   it's anywhere from like a 30 to in some cases,
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.200]   50% increase in the number of points
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.220]   that you need for these flights.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.760]   So obviously if you're earning points
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:45.120]   directly on United or United credit cards,
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   there's not much you can do here.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.200]   But this is just one example
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.960]   of why I love flexible points from credit cards
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.680]   over earning directly in the airline itself.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.280]   Delta is an example of an airline
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   that kind of took a path like this and went even further.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.120]   And now it's not unusual
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:04.760]   to find international business class flights on Delta
[00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.240]   costing three, four, 500,000 miles each way.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:11.240]   So United's not quite there yet,
[00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:13.120]   but seeing this kind of a change
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:16.000]   is definitely unfortunate for lots of us.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.040]   And reminds me why you don't wanna just sit
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:19.560]   on massive numbers of points.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.380]   The industry kind of calls it points deflation,
[00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.960]   which is over time, you're gonna see these devaluations
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:25.520]   and it's just a part of the game.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.600]   So using your points,
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:30.440]   definitely a way to avoid any future devaluation
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.680]   of your points.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.120]   Also earning points in these flexible currencies.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.440]   So if you're looking to fly flights
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.000]   on United or Star Alliance,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.600]   I think right now you should absolutely be looking
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.200]   at programs like Air Canada's Aeroplan,
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.320]   where you can transfer from Chase, Amex, Bilt,
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.000]   Cap One, pretty much everywhere but Citi,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.400]   and Avianca Life Miles,
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.600]   where you can transfer from Amex,
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.400]   you can transfer from Cap One and Citi,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:54.840]   but not Chase or Bilt.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   I think you're gonna get a much better deal
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:59.820]   using those points to book on Star Alliance flights
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:00.920]   and United.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:04.120]   And honestly, I don't see a lot of use cases going forward
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.940]   for transferring Chase points to United,
[00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.660]   unless you're looking to book a flight in business
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.280]   or economy, and it's just so expensive,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.280]   you don't have the cash, you need to take that flight.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.080]   And even though transferring to United
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:17.120]   is gonna be a lot of points,
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.480]   it's a better deal than the portal,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.360]   and that's your only other option.
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.120]   Otherwise, other options for Star Alliance
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.640]   that you should be focused on,
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.480]   and unfortunate for people,
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.400]   especially myself who have put a lot
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:29.600]   into the United program,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:31.280]   I've earned a ton of miles,
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.160]   and have a few hundred thousand United points
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:35.380]   that are gonna get me a lot less further.
[00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:36.800]   So that's one piece of news.
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:37.640]   Speaking of United,
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.400]   I recently had a couple trips,
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:41.340]   both of which ended up being on United,
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:43.560]   neither of which were intentionally on United,
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:45.720]   and I learned a few things along the way.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:48.000]   So one was a very quick trip to New York
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.020]   where I went to record the episodes with Gary and Sahil.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.400]   I had booked flights on British Airways using points,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.880]   and I learned a few things that I wanna share.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.000]   So one, British Airways, as much as I love it
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.920]   as an option for redeeming miles
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.720]   to book flights on American,
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.360]   I learned a rule that was very hard to find.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.440]   In fact, I still can't find it on their website,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:11.040]   and am arguing with British Airways about it,
[00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:14.280]   but if you're booking flights with British Airways points,
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.320]   you are unable to get anything back
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:21.740]   if you cancel those flights within 24 hours of departure.
[00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:22.580]   So two things.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.000]   One, keep that in mind.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.160]   What ended up happening with me
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:26.300]   was I didn't know this rule.
[00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.080]   I couldn't find it online.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.520]   On almost every airline,
[00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:32.640]   if you cancel a flight booked with points before departure,
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.160]   you can get those points back,
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.440]   maybe with a fee, maybe not.
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:38.860]   So it turns out I wrapped up things in New York
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.040]   about eight hours earlier than I thought,
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.440]   and I saw a flight on United
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.200]   for about the exact same number of points
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.920]   I had paid with British Airways,
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.520]   so I ended up canceling the British Airways flight online,
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.720]   booking the United flight, and taking it home.
[00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:53.160]   Well, it turns out I got nothing back from British Airways
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:56.180]   and burned through almost 50,000 points,
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:08:58.000]   which is really frustrating.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.280]   One hack here I learned is
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.320]   if you need to write letters to airlines
[00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.440]   to try to get them to give you refunds or something,
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:06.320]   I suggest using an AI-based tool
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.000]   to help you write those messages.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.600]   I wrote one in Notion AI.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.800]   You could probably also use ChatGPT,
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.260]   but that was super helpful for writing those notes.
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:15.640]   But British Airways.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.800]   So the one trick,
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:18.680]   obviously don't cancel within 24 hours
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.760]   or you'll get nothing back.
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.560]   To be clear, I was using British Airways points
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.840]   to book an American Airlines flight.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.560]   The other, which dovetails into this next one,
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.680]   if you book two one-ways,
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:30.680]   it's almost always the exact same number of points.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.360]   But if you cancel,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.120]   the cancellation rules are based
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.320]   on the first flight departure.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.680]   So I'd always recommend booking two one-ways
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.220]   because in this particular instance,
[00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.060]   you would have been able to get
[00:09:42.060 --> 00:09:43.720]   your British Airways points back
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:46.680]   if you had canceled more than 24 hours before departure,
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.480]   but after the first flight.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.800]   Whereas if you book it as a round trip, you wouldn't.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.900]   British Airways did nothing.
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.720]   Their responses in email were terrible.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.880]   I'm quite frustrated with them.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:58.720]   Meanwhile, United, my flight was a few hours late,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.120]   and they ended up sending me a $75 certificate.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:01.960]   So that was great.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.920]   Thank you, United.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:04.520]   Unfortunately, your points aren't worth as much,
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.440]   but now I've got $75.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.560]   But the second trip was a trip to Cabo
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.440]   for a friend of mine's bachelor party.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.120]   And we showed up at the airport
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:15.360]   and there were seven of us waiting for an Alaska flight
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:17.140]   that just kept getting delayed.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.700]   20 minutes, 45 minutes, one hour.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.600]   And then we asked them what was going on.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.300]   They told us they need to replace the plane.
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.320]   They were gonna place it with a plane from LA
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.640]   that hadn't left yet.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:29.680]   And we decided this just doesn't seem promising.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.120]   And it turns out that United had a flight to Cabo
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.520]   leaving an hour later,
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.320]   and it was the exact same price
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:37.520]   almost all of us had paid for Alaska.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:39.280]   So we said, let's cancel.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.920]   Let's go book the United flight.
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.120]   Well, there were a bunch of situations
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.380]   that different people were in
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.000]   who'd booked that Alaska flight
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.280]   that made it much harder for them to cancel their flights
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.240]   and get their money back.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.640]   So I just wanna share some tips.
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:54.400]   So I had booked a one-way flight on Alaska
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.360]   directly with Alaska, and it was so easy.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.320]   The gate agent was actually able to cancel it,
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.600]   refund everything, no problem.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.880]   A couple other people had booked round-trip flights
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.920]   on Alaska, and for them,
[00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:08.020]   they said if they canceled their outbound flight,
[00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.360]   they were gonna have to cancel their return flight as well,
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:12.100]   and they were gonna have to rebook it.
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:13.600]   They said, if you call up,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.760]   you might be able to get someone
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.840]   who can separate them and cancel them,
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.000]   but because they were all priced together,
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   it's not clear how much you'll get back.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.540]   And so again, another really important reason
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:24.960]   to not book round trips
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.600]   unless you're gonna save a lot of money,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.240]   because if something happens,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.160]   you often get in a situation like this.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.880]   But the worst was for someone who booked through Amex Travel.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.640]   Amex Travel told them to call Alaska,
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:37.480]   Alaska told them to call Amex,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:40.680]   and they couldn't figure out how to get this flight canceled
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:43.120]   because no one knew what was going on,
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.240]   and so they were on hold all the way up
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.560]   until about two minutes before departure.
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:49.540]   I do think they figured it out,
[00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:52.720]   but what took me five minutes of talking to a gate agent
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.200]   took them at least an hour on hold.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.280]   And so my general advice is,
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:59.880]   I'm all for booking in the portal if you have credits to use
[00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:02.200]   and they're gonna make your flights a whole lot cheaper,
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:03.960]   but unless that's the case,
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:06.200]   I would always book directly with the airline.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.820]   I'd always book one-ways if it's the same price,
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.320]   because whenever something comes up,
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:13.360]   it is so much easier to deal directly with the airline
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.000]   and deal with one-way flights.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.720]   So those are two things I learned.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.760]   One other quick thing,
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:19.200]   I'm not gonna go into a lot of detail,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.440]   but I will share a link to a couple posts or videos,
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:24.440]   but I just keep seeing great examples
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:26.680]   of people using their Capital One Points
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.520]   to transfer to Wyndham to book Vacasas.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.360]   And now that my in-laws have a Vacasa in Belize,
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:35.960]   I've started learning a bit more about the platform.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.480]   I'll even link theirs in the show notes
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:39.060]   if you guys wanna go to Belize,
[00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:41.360]   but definitely something to look at
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.880]   if you have Cap One Points
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:45.360]   and you're looking to book lodging somewhere.
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:47.160]   It just seems like it's a great use of points
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.400]   that I've heard a lot from.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.240]   A few more.
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.280]   So I talked about the APEC Business Travel Card
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.480]   a little bit ago,
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:57.400]   and it's this awesome thing you can add on to Global Entry
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:00.320]   that gives you access to the crew diplomat lanes,
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:02.160]   but it's not really talked about that much.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:04.840]   And technically, it's only for people
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:07.400]   who are doing international business travel
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.080]   in the APEC region.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:10.760]   But Danny, thank you for reaching out
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:12.520]   and letting me know about your experience.
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.120]   He's used it in Singapore, Australia, Korea, Malaysia,
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:17.200]   Vietnam, Thailand, New Zealand, China,
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.160]   and he's been able to go through the crew line on his own,
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:22.800]   and he's even been lucky in Thailand and Vietnam.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.200]   It's not supposed to let your whole family come through,
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.240]   but he's had success there.
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:30.000]   He said the card was amazing and so helpful.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.400]   And even in some countries,
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.160]   they have an APEC lane for departing
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.600]   that lets you skip the line on the way out.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.960]   So definitely something to look into.
[00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:41.680]   However, I ended up trying to add this feature to my account.
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.400]   I paid the $70.
[00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.440]   I went in for my interview at SFO and got denied.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.860]   And best I can explain for why I was denied
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:53.840]   was that I have done business travel to the region,
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.080]   but the company that I now work for
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:59.400]   has not yet done international business travel to the region.
[00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:01.640]   So even though in past roles,
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:04.020]   I've had business travel to the region,
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:05.520]   in my current role,
[00:14:05.520 --> 00:14:08.160]   even though All The Hacks is actually currently planning
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:11.000]   a trip to Japan and doing some work with partners
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.880]   that are in foreign countries in the APEC region,
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.040]   I haven't actually taken trips
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.880]   since running All The Hacks to the region,
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:20.380]   mostly because of the pandemic.
[00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:22.980]   And so for that reason, they said they denied it.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:25.260]   So I would say your mileage may vary.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:26.600]   I've heard other people walk in
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.300]   and just get a green light right away and no interview.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:31.580]   At SFO, that wasn't the case for me.
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:34.060]   So I'm gonna reapply once I actually have
[00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.380]   some established business travel for my current business,
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.980]   but it sounds like an awesome thing to add
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:41.580]   if you're eligible and definitely worth looking into.
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:46.340]   My fitness routine this year had a few rocky starts,
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.980]   but I am back into it now.
[00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:50.440]   And honestly, one of the things that helped me get back
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:52.680]   is that I just added some new workout gear.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.960]   And if I'm gonna buy more,
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:56.340]   why not have the best performance apparel out there,
[00:14:56.340 --> 00:14:57.960]   which I think is Viore,
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:14:59.760]   and I am excited to be partnering with them
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:01.000]   for this episode.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.200]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.040]   Everything's designed to work out in,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.320]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.940]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:11.880]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.000]   But it's not just for men.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.220]   My wife is obsessed with Viore as much as I am.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:18.380]   While my personal favorite will probably always be
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:19.780]   the Sunday Performance Joggers,
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.300]   I have at least three pairs.
[00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.680]   I just got a few pairs of the Core Shorts
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.760]   and three or four Strato Tech Tees, and I'm loving them.
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:28.560]   Honestly, I can't think of the last time
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.680]   I went on a run, bike ride, or walk in anything else.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:33.160]   Their products are so versatile,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.420]   you can use them for just about any activity,
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.560]   whether it's running, training, or yoga,
[00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:40.400]   but they're also great for lounging, running around town,
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:41.700]   or they even have a few things
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.380]   you can wear for a night out.
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:46.200]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness,
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.520]   and for All The Hacks listeners,
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.380]   they're offering 20% off your first purchase,
[00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:54.880]   as well as free shipping and returns on US orders over $75.
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:56.400]   So you should definitely check them out
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.720]   at allthehacks.com/viore.
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:03.440]   Again, go to allthehacks.com/v-u-o-r-i,
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.420]   and get yourself some of the most comfortable
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.420]   and versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.220]   You all know I love credit card points,
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.140]   so I'm excited to be partnering with Card Pointers today,
[00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.780]   which is one of my favorite tools for travel hacking.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:18.540]   It's a free app that helps you manage
[00:16:18.540 --> 00:16:20.700]   all of your credit cards in one place,
[00:16:20.700 --> 00:16:22.820]   and makes it easy to find the right card
[00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:26.440]   to maximize your category bonuses on every purchase.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.660]   You can also load it on your partner's phone,
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.640]   so they always know the best cards to use.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:34.620]   The app automatically tracks every category bonus
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.020]   and recurring credit from over 5,000 cards,
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:41.900]   and they also track and help you use your Amex, Chase,
[00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.260]   Bank of America, or Citibank offers
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:46.740]   to save even more money every day.
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.260]   And with their browser extension,
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.860]   you can actually activate every single Amex and Chase offer
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:53.460]   in just one click.
[00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:55.940]   And because of that massive credit card database,
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:58.440]   you can do all of this without having to give up
[00:16:58.440 --> 00:17:00.980]   any personal or banking details.
[00:17:00.980 --> 00:17:02.760]   The app is free to download,
[00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:05.180]   and many of the features are free as well,
[00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:06.940]   but if you wanna try out the pro version,
[00:17:06.940 --> 00:17:08.260]   there's a free trial.
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.060]   And if you decide you wanna sign up after the trial,
[00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.700]   which you probably will,
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.660]   you can go to allthehacks.com/cardpointers
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.380]   to get 20% off.
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.380]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:25.380]   Then another shout out to Ise
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:27.800]   for sending in a great reminder
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:31.120]   that actually really helped someone out that I know.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:33.860]   If you signed up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:36.260]   when the bonus was 60,000 points,
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.780]   and then it bumped up to 80,000 points,
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:41.300]   they are honoring that if you write in.
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.140]   So funny enough, our au pair's boyfriend
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.500]   actually signed up for the Chase Sapphire Preferred
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.460]   for the 60K link.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.860]   Once it bumped up to 80,
[00:17:48.860 --> 00:17:50.940]   I felt so bad that he didn't wait,
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:52.380]   but I shared this tip with him.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:54.900]   He called up, got their customer line,
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.820]   asked if they could do the extra points,
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:17:58.960]   and they said that they would note it in his account,
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.820]   and he ended up getting the 80,000 points.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:03.480]   So if you signed up during the 60K window,
[00:18:03.480 --> 00:18:05.680]   you might have luck calling into Chase
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.900]   and asking them to match the 80K that everyone else got.
[00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.140]   I don't know if it'll still work
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:12.540]   because the 80K public offer's not there anymore,
[00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:14.420]   but it's definitely worth trying,
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.340]   and you can reference it.
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:18.140]   At least two people you know have had this success
[00:18:18.140 --> 00:18:19.660]   because that's the case.
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.380]   But speaking of card bonuses and card signups,
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:23.220]   I wanna talk a little bit
[00:18:23.220 --> 00:18:25.400]   about the American Express Green Card.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:26.860]   It's kind of a silent card.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:29.660]   People don't talk about it that much for a lot of reasons,
[00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:31.200]   one of which is that they haven't really had
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:32.920]   a compelling signup bonus.
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:35.540]   Another is that Amex hasn't really ever worked
[00:18:35.540 --> 00:18:38.500]   with partners on the Green Card, which they're now doing,
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.060]   but right now the elevated welcome bonus
[00:18:41.060 --> 00:18:43.280]   is 60,000 membership rewards points
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:46.340]   after you spend $3,000 in the first six months,
[00:18:46.340 --> 00:18:50.380]   plus you get 20% back on travel and transit purchases
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:52.660]   made in those six months up to $200
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:54.460]   in the form of a statement credit.
[00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:56.900]   The card does have $150 annual fee,
[00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.420]   but you get three points on all travel,
[00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.820]   three points on all transit purchases,
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:03.980]   and three points on restaurants worldwide,
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:06.100]   including takeout and delivery in the US,
[00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.900]   and then one point per dollar on everything else.
[00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:11.060]   So it's a pretty comparable card
[00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.500]   to a Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:15.180]   The annual fee is $150,
[00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:18.860]   but you do get a credit for up to $189 for Clear
[00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.000]   and $100 towards Lounge Buddy.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:23.420]   So it's a pretty compelling offer
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:25.240]   that I think is comparable
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:27.300]   to the Chase Sapphire Preferred or Reserve
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.180]   in terms of getting dining and travel covered.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:32.620]   I don't totally understand Amex's strategy here
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.500]   because there's a lot of overlap.
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:36.140]   So you're getting 3X on travel.
[00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:38.700]   You know, you get 5X on airfare with the platinum.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:40.420]   You get 3X on restaurants,
[00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:43.220]   but you get 4X on dining with the gold.
[00:19:43.220 --> 00:19:45.860]   So it's not necessarily a perfect pairing card
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:47.420]   with other Amex cards,
[00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:50.700]   but it definitely is a great one-stop Amex card,
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.020]   especially if you're thinking about the gold,
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:55.100]   but you don't spend a lot on groceries.
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.260]   Here's one where you get travel and dining covered
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.220]   at 3X across the board at a lower annual fee.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.700]   So despite the fact
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.980]   that I've got all of these categories covered,
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:05.780]   I do think it's an interesting card.
[00:20:05.780 --> 00:20:08.180]   So if you wanna learn more and check out the 60,000 point,
[00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.300]   welcome bonus, you can go to allthehacks.com/amexgreen.
[00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:14.100]   Speaking of how cards fit in together,
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:15.640]   I just wanted to share the result
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.380]   of a little bit of research I did
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:19.260]   for a presentation recently
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:21.580]   that I gave to a wealth management firm's clients
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:23.140]   all about credit cards.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.420]   And so also, if you happen to be in any industry
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:26.800]   where you think it'd be interesting to hire me
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.360]   to come give a talk like that, let me know.
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:32.060]   But the specific thing I wanted to cover now
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:34.460]   is around two-card combos.
[00:20:34.460 --> 00:20:37.240]   So if you search around about cards on the internet a lot,
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.300]   you'll hear people talk about trifectas,
[00:20:39.300 --> 00:20:41.460]   the Chase trifecta, the Citi trifecta,
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.260]   and I'm definitely going to do an episode in the future
[00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:46.340]   diving deeper into all of those.
[00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:49.580]   But as part of the research for this talk,
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:51.100]   I built out a model
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.500]   where it basically looked at all the cards you have
[00:20:54.500 --> 00:20:56.120]   and you could add on new cards
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:20:57.380]   and see how that would affect
[00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.500]   your overall earnings for the year,
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:01.340]   either using point valuations
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:03.740]   or just raw number of points earned.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.660]   And the delineation there is that
[00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:08.860]   I'd rather earn an Amex point than a Marriott point,
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:10.780]   so you can look at it either way.
[00:21:10.780 --> 00:21:12.020]   And it was really cool
[00:21:12.020 --> 00:21:14.420]   because I could tag all the cards that I have
[00:21:14.420 --> 00:21:16.300]   and then I could tag a new card and say,
[00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:18.780]   "Well, if I added an Amex green, what would that do?"
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.220]   And in my case, since I already have 4X dining on the gold
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:25.400]   and I already have 3X travel on the Chase Reserve
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:27.420]   and 5X on airlines or the Amex Platinum,
[00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.340]   it actually did nothing other than add on an annual fee,
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:32.580]   so it was actually not a net positive for me
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:33.980]   and the cards I have.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.960]   I'm actually gonna take that model, I think,
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:38.220]   and I'm gonna share that with All The Hacks members.
[00:21:38.220 --> 00:21:40.220]   So as I think about the future
[00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:41.380]   of the All The Hacks membership,
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:42.880]   one of the things I'm actually thinking about
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:45.380]   is taking a lot of these little mini research reports
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.000]   I've written and making them available to members.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   So that's something to keep in mind.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.120]   You can check out the membership
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.380]   at allthehacks.com/join.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.080]   But I do wanna just share here
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:57.020]   the result of some of that research
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.280]   when it comes to two-card combos.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.960]   And so the way I did this was
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:03.600]   I took the Bureau of Labor Statistics data
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:06.040]   for the average spending of a household
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.220]   that makes over $200,000
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.000]   and I just spread that across
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.600]   all of the different card categories
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.200]   so I got a sense of what the average person would earn
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.980]   in all of these cards.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:18.940]   And the card combos that I pulled together
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.000]   that I thought were the most interesting
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.160]   weren't necessarily ones I think everyone's considered.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.960]   So one was the Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.280]   and the Freedom Unlimited,
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:27.560]   which I think is a good combo
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.640]   that'll end up getting you 3X on travel,
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:32.660]   dining, and 1.5X on everything else.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:34.720]   On City, I looked at comparing
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.800]   the City Premier and the Double Cash.
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.680]   So with the Premier, you get 3X on dining,
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:42.160]   grocery, flights, hotels, gas, and 2X on everything else.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:43.600]   And then with Capital One,
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:46.040]   I paired the Venture X and the Saver,
[00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.880]   which gets you 4X on dining, 3X on groceries,
[00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.680]   2X on everything else.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.400]   And then on Amex, I looked at the Gold and the Green,
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:55.280]   which would get you 4X on dining, grocery,
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.280]   3X on travel, transit, and 1X on everything else.
[00:22:58.280 --> 00:22:59.840]   So the interesting thing I learned
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:02.200]   applying the average spending to this
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:06.660]   is that one, having a 2X everything else card
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:08.440]   adds so much value.
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.680]   So for example, Capital One,
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.280]   if you take the average spending
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.280]   and apply those points earnings,
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:19.280]   the average earning is 2.41 points per dollar spent.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.640]   So across all your spending,
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:23.080]   you'd earn 2.41 points per dollar.
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:26.680]   If you take the City combo, you'd earn 2.35.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:30.200]   But if you take the Chase combo, it goes down to 1.9X.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.880]   And if you take the Amex combo, it goes to 1.95X.
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:37.340]   Now, in all the portals except Chase,
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:39.640]   you're gonna only be getting one point per dollar.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:42.300]   But if you are using portals as the way you book,
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.440]   getting one and a half cents per point
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.480]   with the Chase Reserve makes that combo slightly better
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.880]   if you wanna book in the portal.
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.160]   But for the sake of just earning,
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:52.640]   that was the learning I have.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:54.560]   So my takeaway here is that those are kind of
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:56.200]   the best two-card combos.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.400]   That's just within one platform.
[00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.300]   But if you took that Amex Gold and Green
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.040]   and you swapped out the Green for the Venture X,
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:04.720]   getting two points per dollar,
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:07.400]   or if you're eligible, Amex has the Blue Business Plus card,
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:11.120]   which earns two points on everything up to $50,000.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.840]   That bumps the average earning on that combo
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.600]   of Amex Gold plus Venture X
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.620]   to an average of 2.49 points per dollar,
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:19.840]   which is the best combo.
[00:24:19.840 --> 00:24:22.360]   So my takeaway from this at the end,
[00:24:22.360 --> 00:24:24.000]   and this got really technical,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.920]   it was almost 75 of 80 slides,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.360]   but I summarized it at the end and said,
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:31.880]   if you wanna stick within one program
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.800]   and you already have either a Capital One or a Chase card,
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.880]   the Chase Sapphire Reserve
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:37.520]   and the Freedom Unlimited is great,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:40.160]   has a slight edge if you're redeeming in the portal
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.320]   over all these others,
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.240]   and then the Capital One Venture X and the Saver card
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.800]   are awesome if you wanna stick in Cap One.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:48.740]   But the best two-card combo,
[00:24:48.740 --> 00:24:51.420]   if you're good earning points across two programs,
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:53.900]   was the Amex Gold and the Venture X.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:55.860]   And that was based just on my spending.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:57.020]   In this spreadsheet tool
[00:24:57.020 --> 00:24:58.560]   that I'm gonna make available to members,
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.060]   you can go in and you can actually model out
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:04.220]   your cards and your spending and see how this'll change.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.760]   So stay tuned on that.
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:07.620]   But those are the best two-card combos.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:09.220]   I think if I had to add one more,
[00:25:09.220 --> 00:25:11.760]   it would be the Citi Premier and the Citi Double Cash.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:12.620]   But at the end of the day,
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.340]   I think I have a slight edge for earning Cap One,
[00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.800]   Amex, or Chase points over Citi points.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.980]   And so I'd put those three combos slightly above there.
[00:25:20.980 --> 00:25:22.440]   Obviously, if you pay rent,
[00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.640]   adding a built card is a no-brainer
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:26.880]   that I would absolutely be doing to these combos,
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.800]   but just thought I'd share that.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.600]   That presentation was actually really fun to put together.
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:34.040]   It actually seems like it might be the framework
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.760]   for a course that I build out.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:38.600]   There's a whole part three on earning more points
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   and a part four on maximizing your redemptions,
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.540]   and then another thing on card benefits.
[00:25:43.540 --> 00:25:45.100]   So there's really gonna be a lot there,
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.680]   and I'm excited to find some way to share that.
[00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:50.220]   In fact, there were a bunch of questions you guys wrote in
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:52.740]   that I think tie into that presentation
[00:25:52.740 --> 00:25:55.080]   that I'm gonna give some quick answers to
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.720]   or some quick shares to,
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:58.980]   but hopefully we'll get to more in detail
[00:25:58.980 --> 00:26:00.840]   when I build out those other sections
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:02.200]   and share that on the show.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.820]   So one was from Josh.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:04.660]   He said, "What are the limits
[00:26:04.660 --> 00:26:06.580]   "on how many Capital One cards you can have
[00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.820]   "and how often you can apply for them?
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:10.280]   "He likes no annual fee cards,
[00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:12.300]   "and Capital One has a bunch of those."
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:13.800]   So the rule with Capital One,
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.840]   you can only have two personal Capital One cards at once,
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:20.200]   and I think you need to wait 90 days between applications.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.120]   I haven't tested these.
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.280]   I only have one personal card, the Venture X,
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.840]   and one business card, the Spark Cash Plus.
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.360]   So that's my understanding there.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.800]   The rules change for every different issuer.
[00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.880]   So Chase has rules, Amex has rules, Capital One has rules.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.240]   Part of what I wanna build out
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.500]   when I start to build this into a lot more,
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:39.480]   whether it's multiple episodes, a course, a guide,
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:42.680]   something, is this information on each individual issuer
[00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.600]   and what those rules are.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:44.880]   So stay tuned there.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.040]   Separately, I got an email from Willie
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.240]   who was concerned about some of the language Citi has
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.320]   about taking legal action to recover losses
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.640]   for people that are effectively
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:54.600]   trying to churn through bonuses.
[00:26:54.600 --> 00:26:56.320]   But I was reading through the language
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.760]   'cause I wanted to give my take.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:26:59.400]   And by the way, of course, I'm not a lawyer.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.680]   I don't have experience in all these situations.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:05.320]   But a lot of the restrictions seem to be around
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.180]   repeated cancellations of cards within one year.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.940]   That seemed to be the red flag area.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:12.280]   The other ones were like taking advantage of offers
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.120]   that weren't intended for you or purchasing things
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:17.400]   and returning them after the bonus is hit
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.100]   or not using a card for your own personal spending.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:21.560]   Those ones seem pretty easy to mitigate.
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.360]   But the one about repeated cancellations
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:25.220]   was one that I wanted to address.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.960]   And I think the answer is not canceling the card
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:32.200]   within a first year and waiting until the annual fee posts
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:34.440]   and then cancel it within 30 days.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:37.300]   And within that window, most of the card issuers,
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.340]   if not all of them, I can't say for certain,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:41.080]   will give you back your annual fee
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:42.400]   if you cancel that window.
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.040]   And then you won't be canceling within one year,
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.580]   which kind of makes that rule
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.300]   or the stipulation and the terms not apply.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.760]   That said, as I've said multiple times,
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.600]   if I have an annual fee on a card I don't want,
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:58.960]   I will definitely first look at either downgrading that card
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.160]   or reaching out to see if there's a retention offer.
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:03.800]   A lot of issuers will offer you huge deals,
[00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:07.120]   sometimes lots of points or waived annual fees
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.820]   to get you to keep the card for another year.
[00:28:08.820 --> 00:28:11.400]   And so if you don't wanna keep it because of the annual fee
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:14.120]   and they can waive the annual fee or give you 50,000 points,
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.400]   it might totally be worth it.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:17.520]   So that's my advice there.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:19.000]   But again, things like this,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.760]   the rules around opening and canceling
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:23.360]   are things that I wanna include in the future.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.560]   But I do wanna share an awesome hack that Marco shared.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.520]   And this also deserves a little bit more of a deep dive
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.040]   than I'm gonna give it today.
[00:28:31.040 --> 00:28:33.560]   But he mentioned how I haven't covered the fact
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.920]   that a lot of the business gold and platinum Amex links
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.500]   are what are called no lifetime language links,
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   which means you can get the cards multiple times.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:45.980]   And so this seems crazy, but Marco wrote in and said,
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.140]   he's gotten four business platinums,
[00:28:48.140 --> 00:28:50.260]   four business gold cards.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.380]   He says he's on track to earn at least one and a half
[00:28:52.380 --> 00:28:55.100]   to 2 million Amex points from doing this.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.300]   Yes, they're business cards,
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:58.300]   but he's done it all as a sole proprietor,
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:00.740]   doesn't have a business with an EIN.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.500]   And he's just verified that the first time you do it,
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.740]   you do it with the best link you can find.
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:09.940]   Then after that, you find the links
[00:29:09.940 --> 00:29:13.860]   with no lifetime language and you can do them every 90 days.
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:15.140]   He pointed out that Amex allows you
[00:29:15.140 --> 00:29:17.160]   to have up to 10 charge cards.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:20.060]   So you could do any mix of business golds and platinums,
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:22.980]   and you can cancel them after you've had them 12 months.
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.340]   It seems crazy.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:25.940]   I wanna do a little bit more homework,
[00:29:25.940 --> 00:29:28.700]   but he cycled through a lot of these cards
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:32.220]   and been able to rack up hundreds of thousands
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:35.140]   by the time I'm recording this, probably millions of points.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.860]   And so that's definitely something
[00:29:36.860 --> 00:29:38.460]   that if you're eligible for business cards
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:40.060]   and you have the spend to do it,
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:42.900]   there is a formula here that I wanna dig into
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.380]   a little bit more in the future.
[00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.420]   If I can find anything he's written publicly about it,
[00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:47.900]   'cause I know Marco's written some posts,
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:49.580]   I'll share that in the show notes.
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:51.820]   Another question came in about credit card approvals
[00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:52.940]   with low credit.
[00:29:52.940 --> 00:29:55.900]   So Ed said that his player two got denied for a card
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:57.700]   'cause they didn't have enough credit history
[00:29:57.700 --> 00:29:59.740]   and wanted to know some advice.
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.340]   I don't have a ton of experience with this,
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.260]   but a few things I wanted to share.
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:05.620]   One, I love the Credit Karma app
[00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:08.420]   because it shows you not only nuance of your credit
[00:30:08.420 --> 00:30:10.140]   and what you can do to improve it,
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.980]   but it also sometimes shows you cards
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.020]   they think you're likely to get approved for.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:14.860]   If you Google around,
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:17.700]   there's a tool called the card match tool
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:18.780]   that does something similar
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.780]   where you can get matched with cards you'll get approved for.
[00:30:20.780 --> 00:30:23.420]   And then Amex just launched a tool
[00:30:23.420 --> 00:30:26.020]   that lets you know if you're gonna get approved for a card
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:27.380]   before you apply for it
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.340]   so you don't have to take the credit hit.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.140]   So those are three things I would be using
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.660]   if I had a lower credit score
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:33.740]   and I wanted to try to make sure
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.580]   I wasn't applying for cards that I got denied for.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:38.780]   Another question from Yvonne about the Apple credit card
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:40.100]   and what I think about it
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.460]   now that it's tied to a savings account.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:45.220]   I gotta say, I am a huge fan of Apple products,
[00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.460]   but I'm not a huge fan of the credit card.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:49.180]   Yes, you get 3% at Apple.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.700]   And so if you spend a ton at Apple, maybe that's worth it.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.980]   But for the rest, you get 2% back on Apple Pay
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:57.980]   and 1% everywhere else.
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.380]   You can use the Citi Double Cash.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:02.100]   You can use the Venture X to get 2% back
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:03.980]   or 2X points on everything else
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:06.340]   without having it to be on Apple Pay.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:08.700]   I think recently there's been a small signup bonus,
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:10.740]   maybe $100, $200.
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:12.380]   So for me, it's just not worth it.
[00:31:12.380 --> 00:31:15.620]   If you do the math on what you'd get from a signup bonus,
[00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.260]   it just makes using this card totally not worth it.
[00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:21.460]   The interface supposedly is great.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:24.220]   However, I think that it's very difficult
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:28.140]   to sync Apple Card data with most budgeting tools.
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.060]   And so actually I think that's another downside.
[00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:32.460]   I know that a lot of the products I've been playing with,
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.540]   it's like, here's how you can link any of your cards.
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:35.500]   And for the Apple Card,
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.020]   you've got to download and export your PDF statements
[00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:39.500]   and upload them manually.
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:42.460]   So for me, I'm not a fan of the Apple Card.
[00:31:42.460 --> 00:31:43.740]   If you want 2% cash back,
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:45.020]   there are a lot better cards to do it
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.460]   that don't require Apple Pay.
[00:31:46.460 --> 00:31:50.940]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:54.460]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.340]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.420]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:03.340]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:05.300]   and let our sponsor Drizzly,
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.220]   the go-to app for drink delivery,
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:09.020]   take care of the supplies.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:11.820]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.660]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:15.100]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.060]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.540]   or maybe you just want to celebrate
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.620]   that you got through another week.
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:22.740]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.260]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:27.020]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.100]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.740]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:32:31.740 --> 00:32:34.300]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:37.300]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.340]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.160]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:43.220]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:44.860]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.340]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:32:48.340 --> 00:32:51.420]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.420]   or go to drizzly.com, that's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:32:57.300 --> 00:33:00.540]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:33:00.540 --> 00:33:05.420]   I've heard too many stories from friends, family,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:08.540]   and even listeners about identity theft and phishing scams
[00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:10.780]   causing so much pain and hassle,
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:13.300]   and it's just not something I want in my life.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:15.700]   And I feel like we have the right to stay private
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:18.140]   and protect our personal data.
[00:33:18.140 --> 00:33:20.220]   One of the biggest reasons a lot of this happens
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.860]   is that there are dozens of data broker sites out there
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.840]   selling and sharing our personal information online.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:27.180]   When I first looked up our family,
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.740]   there were hundreds of pieces
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:30.400]   of our personal info out there,
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.580]   but thankfully I started using Delete.me
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:35.200]   to automatically get all of our personal data
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.180]   removed from the web,
[00:33:36.180 --> 00:33:38.140]   and I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.400]   for this episode.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.280]   Delete.me is an amazing service
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:43.860]   that will not just find and remove your personal information
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.200]   from hundreds of data broker websites,
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:48.980]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.860]   and get that removed as well.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:53.580]   Delete.me removes data from over 500 websites,
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.240]   and on average, they find and remove over 2,000 pieces
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:01.000]   of personal data for a customer in their first two years.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:01.920]   When I first signed up,
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:03.980]   I was actually skeptical about needing a service
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:05.200]   on an ongoing basis,
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:07.120]   but these data brokers are relentless,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.000]   and I've seen my personal data pop up again and again
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:10.840]   throughout the year,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.400]   so I love having a service
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.800]   that continuously sends me updated reports
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:17.600]   on all the removals they're doing in the background.
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.800]   So if you wanna get your personal information
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.020]   removed from the web,
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:23.880]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:34:23.880 --> 00:34:28.320]   and get 20% off a plan for you or your entire family.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.920]   I just wanna thank you quick for listening to
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.400]   and supporting the show.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:40.240]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.960]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals,
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.720]   and discounts from our partners,
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.240]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deals,
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.620]   so please consider supporting those who support us.
[00:34:51.620 --> 00:34:53.460]   On the point of cards and perks,
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:54.660]   I wanna answer Kate's question
[00:34:54.660 --> 00:34:57.260]   about the best uses for travel credits.
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:58.220]   So this is a good one.
[00:34:58.220 --> 00:34:59.060]   Between my wife and I,
[00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:02.220]   I think we have seven cards that have travel credits.
[00:35:02.220 --> 00:35:05.740]   We have three that earn the Amex airline credits,
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:08.280]   two Capital One cards that get their travel credits,
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.460]   and two Chase cards that earn their travel credits.
[00:35:10.460 --> 00:35:12.320]   So on the Amex side,
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.420]   I'll talk for a second about their airline credits.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:16.540]   So the way it works is you have to specify an airline
[00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:18.140]   at the beginning of the year,
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.460]   and spend money on that airline,
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.660]   but not on tickets.
[00:35:21.660 --> 00:35:23.300]   It needs to be on any incidentals,
[00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:26.860]   seat fees, Wi-Fi, priority boarding,
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:28.740]   upgrades, that kind of stuff.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:30.900]   I will say the Flyer Talk has a number
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:35.300]   of tremendously helpful posts for every single airline
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.420]   that will help you figure out
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:39.060]   what codes for those travel credits and what doesn't.
[00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:41.520]   Southwest, one of the most interesting things
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:45.420]   is it seems that tickets under $100 code for credit,
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:48.260]   and so one thing I've seen people do
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:51.100]   is buy tickets for $80, $90,
[00:35:51.100 --> 00:35:52.460]   and then if you're not gonna use it,
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.660]   cancel it and then apply that ticket
[00:35:54.660 --> 00:35:56.540]   towards a flight that's more expensive.
[00:35:56.540 --> 00:35:58.900]   That's a strategy I know has worked really well
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.300]   to redeem those airline credits easily.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.140]   So I think Southwest has been my choice
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.180]   for all of our Amex credits to be able to redeem,
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.580]   and we've been pretty fortunate to be able
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:10.340]   to make sure we're getting the max value there.
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.140]   On the VentureX side, those travel credits with Capital One,
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:15.980]   I don't know if there's a best use,
[00:36:15.980 --> 00:36:19.140]   though I prefer using it for airlines over hotels
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:21.180]   because I think on the hotel front,
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:23.380]   booking directly gets you a lot more perks,
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:25.420]   being able to reach out, talk about upgrades,
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:27.820]   which I'll get to later in this episode.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:30.940]   I've used all of our VentureX credits for booking flights.
[00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:32.860]   They've almost always been flights
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.940]   where they were one-way and I was very confident
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:37.260]   I was gonna take them
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.460]   and it wasn't something too far in advance.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.940]   So that's how I've used it.
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:42.260]   On the Chase side, it's so easy
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:45.340]   because they just reimbursed your card for travel spend.
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:46.900]   So you don't really have to do anything
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:49.380]   other than spend $300 a year on travel,
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.180]   which happens naturally for us,
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:53.100]   and so I haven't had to do anything.
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:53.980]   Love those credits.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:57.180]   I wish every airline credit was as easy to use as Chase's.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:58.740]   Speaking of airline benefits,
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:01.700]   Ben corrected something that I said earlier.
[00:37:01.700 --> 00:37:03.780]   I was talking about using your priority pass
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:06.340]   to get some of these airport spa benefits,
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.580]   and he pointed out that I might've gotten the cards wrong.
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:12.060]   So the Amex and Capital One priority passes
[00:37:12.060 --> 00:37:15.260]   are not able to get the spa experiences.
[00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:16.580]   In fact, they're usually not able to get
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:19.620]   most of the non-lounge experiences, including restaurants,
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:22.820]   but the Chase Sapphire Reserve priority pass does qualify.
[00:37:22.820 --> 00:37:24.540]   So if I misspoke, I'm sorry.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.620]   If you've got your priority pass through Chase,
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:28.540]   hopefully you're eligible for dining
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:30.660]   and spa benefits with priority pass.
[00:37:30.660 --> 00:37:32.460]   Also, I mentioned the Clear credit
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:34.500]   with the Amex Green above,
[00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.860]   but I've got a lot of value out of Clear recently,
[00:37:36.860 --> 00:37:38.260]   and I just wanna make sure that people know
[00:37:38.260 --> 00:37:39.420]   about some of the other ways
[00:37:39.420 --> 00:37:41.140]   you can get a better deal on Clear.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.940]   So obviously, if you have an Amex Platinum or Green card,
[00:37:43.940 --> 00:37:45.820]   you get Clear statement credits,
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:49.100]   but if you're a student, you can get Clear for $60.
[00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:51.620]   If you're in the military, you can get it for $99.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:54.380]   If you have any status on Delta or United,
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:57.700]   you can get Clear for anywhere from $179
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.580]   all the way down to $0.
[00:37:59.580 --> 00:38:01.860]   So just being a member of those programs
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:04.220]   will get you $10 off, so that's a no-brainer.
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:06.340]   And then if you have multiple people,
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.300]   you can add them for $60 to a family plan.
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:11.060]   So I definitely think it's worth,
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:12.860]   if you're trying to have Clear with a partner
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:14.700]   and you don't have any credits for it,
[00:38:14.700 --> 00:38:17.180]   definitely make sure you pool your accounts.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:20.140]   I know that all of our family is in one Clear account,
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.180]   including parents, because we wanted to make sure
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:23.980]   we save as much as possible.
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:25.220]   So that's one thing there.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:28.060]   So that was a ton of deals and hacks on points.
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:30.220]   There's still a few more travel ones I wanna get to,
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:32.300]   and then I'll get to some of the non-travel ones.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.900]   So Garrison wrote in and wanted to say,
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:37.940]   first off, that he used the hotel upgrade tips
[00:38:37.940 --> 00:38:40.140]   to get an incredible experience
[00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.620]   at the Fairmont in San Francisco,
[00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:44.300]   double room upgrade, significant drink credits,
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.380]   all the result of emailing in.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:50.100]   So again, if you haven't emailed in to your hotel
[00:38:50.100 --> 00:38:52.500]   to get upgrades, definitely do that.
[00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:55.580]   The trick is to book direct, reach out in advance,
[00:38:55.580 --> 00:38:56.540]   let them know you're coming,
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:58.060]   you're excited to stay at the hotel,
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.860]   let them know if you're celebrating anything
[00:38:59.860 --> 00:39:01.040]   and see what happens.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.860]   And I've seen so, so many listeners get amazing deals,
[00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:07.220]   but I will say Carol wrote in asking,
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.620]   how do you get the hotel email?
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:10.140]   Sometimes it's hard.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:13.180]   And so I'll say that here are all the tips I have.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.300]   Sometimes it's easy and it's on the website.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.520]   Sometimes it's not.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.680]   Recently, I tried using Google Bard
[00:39:18.680 --> 00:39:20.540]   because unlike chat GPT,
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:23.020]   it's using more up-to-date information and just said,
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.580]   can you find me the email address for the hotel?
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.460]   That worked.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:28.860]   If that doesn't work, you can call the front desk
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:31.780]   and you can ask for an email address to send something in,
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:33.120]   you can search around,
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:35.700]   you can look on Flyer Talk or TripAdvisor.
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:38.380]   Sometimes the concierges or the managers
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:40.680]   leave their email address in comments.
[00:39:40.680 --> 00:39:44.820]   You can try to find the GM or the head concierge on LinkedIn
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:46.420]   and use one of the tools.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:49.540]   I like one called Lucia to get email addresses
[00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:52.160]   from people's LinkedIn profiles.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:53.700]   All of those options could work.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:55.780]   And hopefully if you use all of them,
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.420]   you'll be able to get an email address.
[00:39:57.420 --> 00:40:00.420]   I do find that just calling or checking the website
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.280]   or using a tool like Google Bard is the fastest,
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.000]   but plenty of options.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.320]   Also, one hack from Francis was that
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.740]   when he was on his honeymoon,
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.200]   he met someone that told him one thing he always does
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.960]   when he's traveling internationally
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.040]   is email the hotel manager
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.120]   and ask if there's anything he can bring from the US.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:22.960]   The manager in this particular situation asked
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.100]   if there was any chance he could buy a couple English books
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:30.240]   that were under $20 and brought those to the manager
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.280]   and got upgraded to the penthouse suite.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.920]   So I love this hack,
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.160]   adds even more to the email to the hotel.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.700]   Obviously it's not always gonna work.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.760]   Maybe somebody doesn't need anything,
[00:40:40.760 --> 00:40:42.400]   but definitely worth asking.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.660]   And I think we'd all love to get the penthouse suite upgrade
[00:40:44.660 --> 00:40:45.600]   anytime we're traveling.
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:46.920]   So hopefully that works.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.600]   Going back to Garrison's email,
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.640]   he also pointed out that getting into the points game
[00:40:51.640 --> 00:40:53.880]   as a Canadian can be a little tricky,
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:56.360]   but he was really happy with using point.me
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.240]   to find some great flights and maximizing AeroPlan points
[00:41:00.240 --> 00:41:02.600]   and suggested that if anyone's in Canada,
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.720]   they should get on top of the Amex AeroPlan Reserve Card,
[00:41:05.720 --> 00:41:08.160]   which he's got a tremendous amount of value for.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:10.120]   I don't have any partner links for that,
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:11.680]   but I will put Garrison's link.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:13.060]   So if you're a Canadian listening
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:16.040]   and you're looking to get the Amex AeroPlan Reserve Card,
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.040]   Garrison's link for that referral is in the show notes.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.920]   Obviously he would love it if you used it.
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.520]   Couple more things on hotels.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.420]   So Carl wrote in and asking how I think about resort fees
[00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.380]   and taxes when I'm redeeming points for a hotel.
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:31.520]   And I think it's pretty straightforward for me.
[00:41:31.520 --> 00:41:33.960]   Whenever I'm trying to figure out what a hotel will cost,
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:35.960]   I'm not looking at the regular rate.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:38.240]   I'm looking at the final, final rate
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:41.560]   and double checking that it includes any extra fees,
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:44.680]   especially resort fees, which can be quite expensive.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:47.080]   And then I'm comparing that to using my points.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.240]   And so sometimes you'll look
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:51.160]   and a hotel might look like it's $120 a night,
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.200]   and this is especially true in Vegas.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:55.640]   But by the time you check out two nights at that hotel,
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:58.820]   which should have been $250, end up being $400
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.220]   because there's resort fees, there's taxes,
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:03.120]   there's surcharges and everything like that.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   So anytime I'm trying to compare redeeming points
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:07.480]   and booking with dollars,
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.640]   I'm always looking at that final, final rate
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.600]   and comparing that.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.760]   This is especially good for people booking Hyatt,
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:18.200]   Hilton, Wyndham or Choice Hotels
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.080]   because all those programs waive resort fees
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.400]   on award bookings.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:25.860]   So definitely a chance to save a little extra.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.640]   Unfortunately, Marriott does not waive resort fees
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:30.640]   on awards days, which is unfortunate,
[00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.000]   but there's not really a good trick around that.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.220]   Also on paid stays,
[00:42:34.220 --> 00:42:36.240]   if you can achieve Hyatt Globalist status,
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:39.340]   I know that you can get your resort fees waived as well.
[00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:40.640]   I've never stayed at hotels enough
[00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.120]   to get that kind of super premium top tier status,
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:44.400]   especially on Hyatt.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.800]   So I haven't had any experience there.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.920]   Finally, this almost never works,
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:52.200]   but there are cases where it has worked in some places.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:55.360]   You can always ask to waive the resort fee.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:57.840]   It doesn't usually work, but every now and then it does,
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:01.440]   especially if any of the amenities listed on the resort fee
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:03.040]   are not available.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.720]   So if a resort fee is supposed to include a room safe
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.880]   or wifi or a business center
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:10.640]   and any of those things aren't available,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:11.980]   then definitely you should be able
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:13.160]   to get the resort fee waived.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:14.920]   So that's something to look into.
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.840]   I hate resort fees, they drive me crazy,
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.760]   but at the end of the day,
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.120]   there's just sometimes you can't do anything else about 'em.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:22.320]   Also, Ben wrote in, long time listener.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.840]   Ben, thanks for listening.
[00:43:23.840 --> 00:43:26.120]   He noticed I mentioned all the flight drops
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:30.080]   on flights and car rentals, but I didn't talk about hotels.
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.000]   He said he's been using a cool free app
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.640]   called Pruvo, P-R-U-V-O, for the last few years.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:37.200]   He says it's kind of like AutoSlash,
[00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:38.980]   but for refundable hotels.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.880]   It saved him hundreds of dollars
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.960]   and offered him some last minute savings.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.740]   So he said, definitely check that out.
[00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:46.560]   He might not know this, but it turns out
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:49.920]   that AutoSlash actually launched HotelSlash as well.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.520]   So that's another option for monitoring hotel flight drops.
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.120]   And another great hack from Casey around hotel prices.
[00:43:57.120 --> 00:43:59.640]   He's planning a trip to Scottsdale for winter break
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.960]   and it was gonna be $2,200 to book on Hilton's website
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.480]   for a refundable option.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.400]   So he tried HotelSlash
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:09.240]   and he found a fully refundable option for $1,800.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.320]   So he booked that, but there wasn't a place
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.260]   for him to add his Hilton Honors number in the process.
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:14.100]   And that's true.
[00:44:14.100 --> 00:44:16.920]   A lot of the times you book hotels in portals
[00:44:16.920 --> 00:44:18.860]   and on discount sites,
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:20.920]   not only might you not be able to add your number,
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:24.180]   but you also might not be able to earn points.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:26.660]   So he called the hotel to give him his Hilton number.
[00:44:26.660 --> 00:44:27.700]   And as they were looking it up,
[00:44:27.700 --> 00:44:29.400]   they mentioned that the reservation actually came
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.380]   from Expedia, which is important for what happened next.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:37.380]   So he remembered that Hilton has a price match policy,
[00:44:37.380 --> 00:44:39.240]   where if you find a lower price somewhere else,
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:42.060]   they'll match it and take 25% off.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:44.340]   So he called the Hilton customer service line
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:46.060]   and asked for the deal.
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:47.660]   While they said HotelSlash
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:50.420]   wasn't one of the sites they recognize,
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:51.820]   he had learned that that booking
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:54.100]   actually came through Expedia.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.900]   So he had them verify the price on Expedia
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:00.300]   where they did find the $1,800 price and they would match.
[00:45:00.300 --> 00:45:03.460]   So Hilton ended up lowering the price by 25%
[00:45:03.460 --> 00:45:07.180]   and he ended up paying 1,400, still fully refundable
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:09.380]   and now booked directly with the hotel,
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.140]   which meant he could send an email
[00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:13.500]   and definitely have a higher chance of getting upgraded
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.860]   and certainly earn his points.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:19.700]   So moral of the story is with any hotel chain
[00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.360]   that has a price match policy,
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.300]   if you ever find better rates on other sites,
[00:45:24.300 --> 00:45:25.600]   definitely worth trying to see
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.020]   if you can get them to match it
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:28.460]   so that you can book direct,
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.720]   you're gonna have a better experience if you book direct.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.580]   So hopefully that helps somebody else save.
[00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:36.460]   As with all of these deals and hacks and ideas,
[00:45:36.460 --> 00:45:38.700]   definitely if you have success, send it in
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:41.460]   because I know people love hearing about all these wins.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:43.220]   There are plenty of examples of people
[00:45:43.220 --> 00:45:46.100]   who heard me mention unclaimed money multiple times
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.100]   and it wasn't until they kept hearing stories
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:50.860]   about people having such great success that they tried
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:53.900]   and then they found hundreds or even thousands of dollars.
[00:45:53.900 --> 00:45:55.180]   So hopefully that helps.
[00:45:55.180 --> 00:45:57.420]   And just as I was about to upload this episode,
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:45:58.980]   I got an email from Aways,
[00:45:58.980 --> 00:46:02.200]   which is my favorite hotel award searching product,
[00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.700]   that they're having a huge summer travel sale

[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.060]   They also have a free plan
[00:46:40.060 --> 00:46:41.940]   that lets you do five searches a month.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:43.660]   But if you wanna check out the three-day trial

[00:46:49.700 --> 00:46:50.900]   and let me know what you think.
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:52.700]   When it comes to air travel,
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:56.220]   Frances wrote in and said that she had a broken stroller
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:46:57.820]   on her American Airlines flight.
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:00.020]   And even though it was outside of the 24-hour window,
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:03.120]   she was supposed to reach out to get any compensation.
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.760]   She still had the photos.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:06.680]   So she ended up trying anyways,
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:09.780]   and they ended up replacing the entire price of the stroller.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.180]   So for anyone who ever has anything damaged,
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.700]   don't forget to reach out.
[00:47:13.700 --> 00:47:15.300]   Even if the airline won't do anything,
[00:47:15.300 --> 00:47:17.360]   go back to episode 113,
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:19.380]   where I talk all about the credit card benefits.
[00:47:19.380 --> 00:47:20.740]   It's possible that your credit card
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.180]   might have you covered here.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:24.260]   Okay, finally, the last travel-related hack.
[00:47:24.260 --> 00:47:25.860]   I know we've got so many of these.
[00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.740]   Hopefully you guys enjoy all these travel hacks
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.020]   and you can get a lot of value.
[00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:31.900]   Please shoot me an email, tag me on Instagram,
[00:47:31.900 --> 00:47:32.980]   @replyme on Twitter.
[00:47:32.980 --> 00:47:34.380]   Let me know what you think.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.580]   I'm always trying to find out the right format
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:38.540]   for making these episodes great.
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:39.940]   But this one's from Mike,
[00:47:39.940 --> 00:47:41.020]   and he pointed out that he does
[00:47:41.020 --> 00:47:42.780]   a lot of international travel
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:45.660]   and wanted to share some rental car tips.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:48.540]   So he always denies the rental car collision coverage.
[00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.500]   He's using his Venture X to get his collision damage
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.260]   covered through his credit card.
[00:47:53.260 --> 00:47:54.660]   But in the past few years,
[00:47:54.660 --> 00:47:56.460]   he's noticed that internationally,
[00:47:56.460 --> 00:47:59.280]   a lot of the rental car companies are requiring a letter
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:01.180]   from the credit card company
[00:48:01.180 --> 00:48:04.220]   stating that they provide collision damage coverage.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.720]   He said the letter's easy to get.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:07.560]   Usually you can email, support,
[00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:10.700]   or call the card concierge and they'll forward you something,
[00:48:10.700 --> 00:48:12.140]   but it does take time.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:13.700]   So if you have some time to kill
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:16.060]   before you're traveling internationally
[00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:18.780]   and planning on using your card for rental coverage,
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:21.380]   it could be worth getting a printed copy of a statement
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:23.620]   saying that you have this coverage in advance.
[00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.260]   He said you don't need to email it to them.
[00:48:25.260 --> 00:48:27.060]   You don't need to plan, but I would bring it
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:28.900]   so that you can show it to them at the counter.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:31.420]   The second was about a car accident in Costa Rica
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:33.420]   where the person needed to actually use
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:35.980]   one of these claims with this credit card company.
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.580]   And so the important piece of information here,
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:40.240]   no one was hurt fortunately,
[00:48:40.240 --> 00:48:42.800]   but he said the insurance company
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.100]   wanted so much documentation and fortunately they had it.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:48.700]   But the most important thing he said that was essential
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:50.300]   was getting a police report.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:53.060]   So if you're in an accident in a foreign country
[00:48:53.060 --> 00:48:55.740]   using a credit card or really anything for insurance,
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:48:58.180]   make sure that you get a police report.
[00:48:58.180 --> 00:49:00.780]   Funny enough, the only circumstance I have
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.340]   of this happening was also in Costa Rica
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:04.800]   and we did get a police report.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.380]   So definitely make sure that you can get the police report
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:10.720]   when that happens, it's very important.
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:13.780]   Fortunately, after many phone calls and many escalations,
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:16.620]   he was able to get fully covered,
[00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:19.700]   but the $2,000 deposit they held on his card
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:21.700]   didn't get released until that was all resolved
[00:49:21.700 --> 00:49:22.880]   three months later.
[00:49:22.880 --> 00:49:25.700]   So just know that that can happen,
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:27.700]   but getting the right documentation,
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:30.340]   making sure you get everything you need can really help
[00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:32.380]   and make sure that you get covered at the end.
[00:49:32.380 --> 00:49:33.700]   Good news is he did get covered.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:35.280]   It wasn't a problem in the long run,
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.000]   but it was a little bit of a hassle.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.060]   And had he not had that police report,
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:40.980]   the assumption was that it probably wouldn't
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:43.220]   have gotten reimbursed as he had expected.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:46.060]   Finally, I've got a few things that aren't related to travel
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:48.580]   but are great hacks and great learnings
[00:49:48.580 --> 00:49:49.940]   and great questions from you all.
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:51.580]   So the first two are on health.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:53.420]   I've talked a lot about different health
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.780]   and blood-related diagnostics to do.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:57.740]   You all know I'm a big fan of InsideTracker
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.260]   who's a partner of the show
[00:49:59.260 --> 00:50:02.140]   and I've used them multiple times over the last few years
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:04.980]   to do a lot of my blood work and check biomarkers.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:06.380]   So definitely, if you're interested,
[00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:09.900]   you can check them out, allthehacks.com/insidetracker.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   But Bizu wrote in and wanted to share a program
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:12.900]   called All of Us,
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.380]   which is currently being sponsored by the NIH
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.580]   and it's geared towards precision medicine.
[00:50:17.580 --> 00:50:18.780]   I took a look at it
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:21.320]   and they're looking at all kinds of information
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.200]   related to genes, hereditary disease, blood work.
[00:50:24.200 --> 00:50:25.460]   But the cool thing for Bizu
[00:50:25.460 --> 00:50:28.140]   is that in her location due to a grant,
[00:50:28.140 --> 00:50:29.980]   the blood work was all free.
[00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:32.620]   So it cut down on the cost significantly.
[00:50:32.620 --> 00:50:35.340]   So definitely something worth checking out.
[00:50:35.340 --> 00:50:38.180]   I haven't spent a lot of time looking into All of Us,
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:40.020]   but I'm always a big fan
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.780]   of the government-sponsored programs
[00:50:41.780 --> 00:50:44.580]   that can help you get blood work done for free
[00:50:44.580 --> 00:50:46.100]   or really anything that would help you
[00:50:46.100 --> 00:50:47.740]   be more intentional with health.
[00:50:47.740 --> 00:50:50.540]   I'm excited, Bizu, you're doing that this year in 2023
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:52.820]   and hopefully this helps other people.
[00:50:52.820 --> 00:50:54.700]   Similarly, John sent me an email
[00:50:54.700 --> 00:50:57.100]   letting me know that for the GRAIL test,
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:00.340]   which is a cancer detection test using blood work,
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:02.080]   that there's actually a giant study
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.740]   called the Pathfinder 2 study
[00:51:03.740 --> 00:51:05.960]   happening all across the country
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.500]   that ends up giving free GRAIL tests as part of the study.
[00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.980]   Unfortunately for anyone under 50 years old,
[00:51:12.980 --> 00:51:14.500]   that is a requirement of the study,
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:16.160]   but for anyone over 50,
[00:51:16.160 --> 00:51:19.260]   it's definitely a way to get this test done for free.
[00:51:19.260 --> 00:51:21.360]   I know my doctor recommended this test
[00:51:21.360 --> 00:51:22.960]   as something to consider,
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:26.260]   not necessarily something necessary for my age,
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:28.140]   but the question I actually asked my doctor,
[00:51:28.140 --> 00:51:30.380]   which I'd encourage other people to ask,
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.580]   because so much of medicine
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.940]   is based on what insurance covers,
[00:51:33.940 --> 00:51:35.460]   I said, "Hey, if I was willing to spend
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:38.080]   "a couple thousand dollars this year on my health,
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:40.380]   "are there specific diagnostics or tests
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:41.960]   "that you would recommend?"
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.780]   And the GRAIL test came out of that conversation.
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:46.420]   If you do some searching on the GRAIL test,
[00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:49.340]   you will see an article in the New York Times recently
[00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:50.460]   that sounds pretty bad.
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:52.960]   For the people affected, it probably very much was.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.820]   They had a system error that falsely sent
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:51:58.100]   either letters or emails to 400 people,
[00:51:58.100 --> 00:51:59.880]   letting them know that their test
[00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:01.780]   came back positive for cancer,
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.320]   when in fact it wasn't.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:05.440]   I think the silver lining was,
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:07.580]   it was much more related to back office work
[00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:09.940]   than the quality of the tests.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:12.420]   Obviously, not a great situation for them,
[00:52:12.420 --> 00:52:15.060]   and even worse for the people that got that message,
[00:52:15.060 --> 00:52:17.500]   but I do think that they've probably figured out
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.340]   how to make sure that doesn't happen again,
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:20.820]   so I am interested in this test.
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:21.840]   I haven't done it yet,
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:24.700]   but it's something that is on my plan for this year.
[00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:26.060]   And so the Pathfinder 2 study,
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.180]   which I'll link to in the show notes,
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:28.940]   might be great for people listening,
[00:52:28.940 --> 00:52:29.780]   or if you're too young,
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:31.800]   maybe people who's listening's parents.
[00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.220]   I've talked a lot about how I love clipping deals
[00:52:34.220 --> 00:52:35.600]   in the Safeway app,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:38.580]   but Sarah wrote in to tell me to let everyone know
[00:52:38.580 --> 00:52:41.680]   that you should also be looking at warehouse stores.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.460]   So she was heading to BJ's and she checked their app,
[00:52:44.460 --> 00:52:47.140]   and they had coupons for $10 off any purchase,
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:49.340]   a free case of water, free chips.
[00:52:49.340 --> 00:52:51.980]   She ended up getting over $20 of value for 30 seconds.
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:54.460]   So whether it's Costco, Sam's Club, BJ's,
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.380]   or your grocery store, Kroger, Safeway,
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:58.100]   definitely check those apps.
[00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:01.740]   I think almost every single time I open up the Safeway app,
[00:53:01.740 --> 00:53:05.220]   there is a $5 to $10 off your next grocery purchase
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:06.060]   in that app.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:07.360]   So every time I open the app,
[00:53:07.360 --> 00:53:09.460]   I almost always save $5 to $10,
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:11.140]   again, for 30 seconds of work.
[00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.020]   So definitely something that you should all be doing.
[00:53:13.020 --> 00:53:16.380]   Thank you, Sarah, for the reminder to do it other places.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:17.820]   Couple things on money.
[00:53:17.820 --> 00:53:20.060]   Ryan wrote in wanting to say
[00:53:20.060 --> 00:53:22.040]   that we talked about high yield savings accounts
[00:53:22.040 --> 00:53:23.700]   in the episode with Ben Carlson,
[00:53:23.700 --> 00:53:26.560]   but we didn't talk about the Wealthfront Cash account.
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:29.180]   Maybe it's that I worked there and I feel a little bit
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.580]   like I don't want to constantly talk about Wealthfront,
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:34.480]   but I will say I'm a huge fan of their product.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.300]   I have my money in the Wealthfront account.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:38.600]   It is super simple and seamless.
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:42.000]   Tons of FDIC insurance, easy deposit withdrawal.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:43.440]   Is there a window of time right now
[00:53:43.440 --> 00:53:45.120]   where you might be able to earn higher yield
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.200]   or better tax advantaged yield from short-term treasuries?
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:49.080]   Yes.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:50.580]   If you're not in a high tax bracket,
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:51.700]   maybe it doesn't matter as much,
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:53.420]   or maybe you live in a state with no tax
[00:53:53.420 --> 00:53:55.000]   and it doesn't matter for you either,
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:56.560]   but his top money hack this year
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:58.320]   that he's been sharing with everyone
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.240]   is using the Wealthfront Cash account.
[00:54:00.240 --> 00:54:01.240]   And I just want to flag that
[00:54:01.240 --> 00:54:04.460]   that is where I keep majority of my cash.
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:07.560]   Also, if you sign up with anyone's cash referral link,
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:10.840]   you should be able to get an extra 0.5%,
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:15.840]   boosting the 4.55% to 5.05%, which is pretty awesome.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.520]   I'll put a referral link for my account in the show notes
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:20.520]   if you want to use that,
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:22.300]   or if you want to use anyone else's.
[00:54:22.300 --> 00:54:24.140]   And if you're signing up for any of the investment accounts,
[00:54:24.140 --> 00:54:24.980]   which by the way,
[00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.180]   Wealthfront recently launched a cool bond portfolio,
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:29.020]   which is kind of supposed to live somewhere
[00:54:29.020 --> 00:54:31.540]   between the risk of cash and investing.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:33.860]   And if you want to use that or any of the investing accounts,
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.940]   you can get $5,000 managed free with a referral link,
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.500]   and I'll post mine in the show notes as well.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:40.220]   Speaking of personal finance,
[00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.180]   Tony wrote in a question asking what apps I use
[00:54:43.180 --> 00:54:47.200]   when it comes to tracking all of my spending and budgeting.
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:49.520]   And I'll share three options.
[00:54:49.520 --> 00:54:51.920]   There are plenty of tools and services out there.
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:54.680]   I know a lot of us used to use Mint back in the day,
[00:54:54.680 --> 00:54:57.380]   but I've kind of grown tired of Mint,
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.860]   and I've settled on three
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:55:01.380]   that I think are great recommendations.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:03.900]   So if you don't want to pay anything,
[00:55:03.900 --> 00:55:06.100]   I'm a big fan of the Rocket Money app.
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:07.900]   Yes, they're a partner of the show,
[00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:11.420]   but I really think they have a great free tracking app
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.140]   that lets you manage all of your transactions,
[00:55:14.140 --> 00:55:17.420]   categorizing, getting alerts on when things get refunded
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.380]   or unusual purchase sizes.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:21.560]   I'm also a big fan of the premium version of Rocket Money
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.900]   that will just cancel subscriptions for you.
[00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:25.660]   So definitely check out Rocket Money
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:27.780]   if you want a free app for this.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:29.840]   If you're an Apple or Mac user,
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.660]   I'm also a big fan of the Copilot Money app.
[00:55:32.660 --> 00:55:33.500]   They don't have any of the
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:35.060]   canceling your subscription features
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:36.340]   you'll get from Rocket Money.
[00:55:36.340 --> 00:55:39.740]   It's purely focused on budgeting and transactions,
[00:55:39.740 --> 00:55:41.940]   but it's really great UI.
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.380]   Personally, this is my budgeting app
[00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:47.460]   and the premium paid app that I'd recommend.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:48.300]   I love it.
[00:55:48.300 --> 00:55:49.580]   It's so seamless.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:51.340]   I will put my referral link.
[00:55:51.340 --> 00:55:53.320]   I'll get a couple of months free if you use it.
[00:55:53.320 --> 00:55:55.300]   So thank you, but I do love this app.
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.140]   I pay for it.
[00:55:56.140 --> 00:55:57.620]   They're not a partner of the show.
[00:55:57.620 --> 00:55:59.660]   I think it's great if you're willing to pay
[00:55:59.660 --> 00:56:03.700]   and you're an Apple user and you value kind of the UI, UX,
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:07.060]   and some of those extra features of a premium paid app.
[00:56:07.060 --> 00:56:09.680]   And then last, if you don't really wanna use apps
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:11.860]   and you'd rather manage everything in a spreadsheet,
[00:56:11.860 --> 00:56:13.840]   check out Tiller HQ.
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.100]   I've used it in the past.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.700]   It's a pretty cool product that pulls
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:20.440]   all of your transaction data into Google Sheets or Excel,
[00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:22.840]   letting you kind of run your own analysis,
[00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:24.020]   but being able to benefit
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:27.260]   from kind of Plaid and Yodlee style syncing
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:28.800]   where you're able to get your transactions
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:29.900]   pulled in automatically.
[00:56:29.900 --> 00:56:31.520]   So those are three I'll recommend.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.100]   And I'm really glad you asked that question, Tony,
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:33.940]   'cause I love that.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:36.380]   You didn't ask Tony about net worth tracking
[00:56:36.380 --> 00:56:38.020]   and budgeting and forecasting,
[00:56:38.020 --> 00:56:41.180]   but my two favorites there are the Wealthfront app,
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:43.360]   the product we built for financial planning
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.480]   and being able to model out the future
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:47.460]   based on home purchases,
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.820]   based on sending your kids to college and all that stuff.
[00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:52.100]   I don't think there is a better net worth
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:54.580]   for forecasting tool than what we had at Wealthfront.
[00:56:54.580 --> 00:56:56.260]   I say, we, I don't work there anymore,
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:58.860]   but what Wealthfront has is my favorite there.
[00:56:58.860 --> 00:57:00.620]   And then for tracking net worth,
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:02.420]   if you wanna go to a little bit more nuanced
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:04.940]   and you go on to dial in things a little bit more detail,
[00:57:04.940 --> 00:57:06.620]   I'm a huge fan of Kubera.
[00:57:06.620 --> 00:57:08.460]   It's how I track my net worth.
[00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:10.100]   I don't do my forecasting there,
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.020]   but I do track everything there.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:14.360]   They did recently launch a forecasting tool
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:16.020]   that I haven't spent enough time with.
[00:57:16.020 --> 00:57:17.820]   So I can't endorse that tool yet,
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:19.180]   but if you wanna check out Kubera,
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:20.140]   I'm a huge fan.
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:21.260]   I'll put a link in the show notes.
[00:57:21.260 --> 00:57:23.620]   I think it's just all thehacks.com/kubera.
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:25.300]   And I'm actually working with them right now
[00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:26.780]   to see if we can get a deal for members.
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:28.060]   So stay tuned there.
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.340]   Last thing to close this out is about cell phones.
[00:57:30.340 --> 00:57:32.620]   Two hacks from Scott and Chris.
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:34.340]   Scott wanted to share his experience
[00:57:34.340 --> 00:57:36.100]   buying for phones for his family,
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:37.880]   which includes a bunch of teenagers
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.260]   who always seem to want the latest iPhones
[00:57:40.260 --> 00:57:42.180]   and regularly break them.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:46.180]   He said that he's been using a site called Swappa,
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:50.060]   S-W-A-P-P-A, to buy mint condition
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.860]   or very good condition iPhones
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:53.980]   for anywhere from a third to half off.
[00:57:53.980 --> 00:57:56.220]   He's bought over 10 iPhones here.
[00:57:56.220 --> 00:57:57.920]   Ouch is what he said in his email,
[00:57:57.920 --> 00:57:59.600]   but he hasn't been burned yet.
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:00.980]   So that's how he's buying iPhones
[00:58:00.980 --> 00:58:03.020]   to get a huge discount for his family.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.300]   And then Chris pointed out,
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:06.580]   I've shared in the past using Phone Barn
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:09.900]   to buy numbers so that you can port to get deals
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:12.140]   when you're transferring numbers to carriers.
[00:58:12.140 --> 00:58:14.220]   He pointed out that Google Voice can do this for free.
[00:58:14.220 --> 00:58:16.180]   You can get your line from Google Voice
[00:58:16.180 --> 00:58:18.140]   and then you can transfer that number
[00:58:18.140 --> 00:58:21.020]   over to another carrier to get a deal.
[00:58:21.020 --> 00:58:24.020]   You may have to pay a $3 unlocking fee,
[00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:27.620]   but it's very minor compared to the $500 to $1,000
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:30.420]   you might save porting a number over to a new carrier.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:32.120]   So he said that was a great tip.
[00:58:32.120 --> 00:58:34.180]   And then last, Francis asked a question,
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.780]   which I'm gonna have to punt on, but it's in this camp,
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.980]   so I didn't want you to think I wasn't covering it,
[00:58:38.980 --> 00:58:40.920]   just about covering cell phone plans
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:44.060]   and how to compare them and how to figure out what to do.
[00:58:44.060 --> 00:58:45.500]   Part of the reason I'm not including it
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:47.220]   is because I was gonna talk about Verizon
[00:58:47.220 --> 00:58:49.660]   and then they just up and changed all their plans again.
[00:58:49.660 --> 00:58:52.700]   And I still don't even know how that affects my own plan.
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:54.420]   So stay tuned in the future.
[00:58:54.420 --> 00:58:56.500]   I'd love to talk more about cell phone plans,
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:58.000]   but not gonna be this episode.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.300]   Wow, I know we covered a lot of hacks, deals, questions.
[00:59:02.300 --> 00:59:03.580]   Hopefully this was helpful.
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:06.140]   Definitely reach out to me and please share more.
[00:59:06.140 --> 00:59:07.380]   I love getting questions.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:09.060]   I love doing these episodes
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:11.020]   and I know they're really valuable to people.
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:12.620]   I can see it in the feedback I get.
[00:59:12.620 --> 00:59:14.340]   I can see it in the download numbers.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.820]   So keep them coming.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:17.420]   Still, this is overdue,
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:19.060]   but I've been saving all the questions
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.780]   related to family, children, travel with kids,
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:24.820]   college savings for a big episode
[00:59:24.820 --> 00:59:26.100]   to do all of those things together.
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:27.060]   That's coming soon.
[00:59:27.060 --> 00:59:29.340]   So feel free to add more there.
[00:59:29.340 --> 00:59:31.100]   Otherwise, thank you so much for listening.
[00:59:31.100 --> 00:59:32.360]   I will see you next week.
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:34.940]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.980]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:37.980 --> 00:59:40.560]   (upbeat music)
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:43.320]   [BIRDS CHIRPING]
