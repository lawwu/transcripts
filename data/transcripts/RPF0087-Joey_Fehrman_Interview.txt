[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.080]   know, the boring ones? You know, I do it too. Or maybe Christmas is coming up. Well, my
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:01:13.160]   guest today has written just such a book. Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.360]   My name is Joshua Sheets. Thank you for being here. Today is Thursday, October the 23rd,
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.040]   2014. This is episode 87 of the show. And today I have an interview with a man named
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:33.440]   Joey Furman who has written a pirate adventure novel to teach you about finance. It's going
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:47.040]   to be good. One of the things that I see happening more and more in today's world is we're developing
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.280]   brand new types of media to appeal to different people. And one of the types of media that
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.960]   I see at least a need for is better books, not necessarily just more boring finance books
[00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.680]   that tell you here's what you do. There's plenty of those. And it seems if you go down
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.040]   to the personal finance section, it seems like if you read four of them, you've probably
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.460]   read about all of them. Many of them say about the same things. But what if there's an opportunity
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.400]   for a different format? My guest today is a man named Joey Furman. Joey's a really great
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.480]   guy. We met at FinCon when I was out there a few weeks ago or a month or so ago in New
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.960]   Orleans. And Joey formerly worked on Wall Street where he worked as an investment analyst.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:33.320]   And then he quit Wall Street to pursue his dream of writing and publishing his book.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.640]   He's written a book entitled Pirates of Financial Freedom that purports to teach approximately
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:45.240]   70 important financial planning concepts and lessons about personal finance. And it does
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.680]   so in the context of an adventure novel.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.200]   So we're going to talk with him today. The interview is just a little bit over an hour.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.840]   The first half is all about the book. And then the second half is all about what it's
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.840]   like to go on Wall Street. And because Joey started in that business and worked in that
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.960]   business, he's a chartered financial analyst, he has experience in that business, I thought
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.280]   many of you who were interested in finance would be interested in hearing a little bit
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.640]   more of his story, hearing about some of his experiences, hearing what it takes to be an
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.520]   analyst and be involved in Wall Street.
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.280]   So if you're just interested in the books, excuse me, in the book, the first half of
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.480]   the show is the half for you. If you're interested in what it's like to be a financial analyst,
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.400]   the first and the second half is what's right for you. Enjoy.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   So Joey, welcome to the Radical Personal Finance podcast. I appreciate you're making the time
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.400]   for this interview.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.920]   Well, it's great to be here.
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:47.080]   So I've been looking forward to talking with you since we met. And I have your book. And
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.760]   what I'd like to do is I'd like to accomplish in our interview today almost two different
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.360]   courses of discussion. I'd like to talk with you about your book and some of the lessons
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.320]   that are in it and some of the ways that it can be applicable and about that. And I'd
[00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:07.600]   also like to talk to you about your experience in the financial business.
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:13.400]   But to kick things off, would you start by sharing with me and the audience a little
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:19.560]   bit about your history, especially just your personal history and experience in the world
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:23.600]   of high finance, so to speak? What's your story?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:29.920]   Sure. So let's see. Grew up in Omaha, went to University of Pennsylvania for college,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:35.600]   where I actually studied computer science and engineering and did a minor in poli sci.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.160]   Had no interest in finance in college until I read Rich Dad, Poor Dad. And I was like,
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.400]   "Oh, this finance stuff's actually kind of interesting. Maybe I should look into it."
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.240]   So Penn has the Wharton School of Business, which is one of the best business schools
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.240]   in the country. So I took some classes there. And I actually had to learn finance on my
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.120]   own in order to get my first Wall Street job, which was actually down in Boca Raton, Florida.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.120]   I think that's near where I live.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.120]   Where I live, right. Yeah.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.000]   So I wanted to live near the beach for a while. So I just moved to Florida and ended up getting
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.280]   a job at Morgan Stanley down there. And the way I got the job, because I had really no
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:15.840]   finance academic experience, was I just immersed myself in it. So I read dozens of investing
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.960]   books. I was trading my own stocks and options account. I was watching CNBC. A lot of my
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.440]   friends were in the finance business, so I knew the lingo. And I found a guy who took
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:34.760]   a chance on me. So I worked with my mentor for probably five years. And that was at Morgan
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.000]   Stanley Merrill Lynch. Then I moved to New York because I wanted to live in New York.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.840]   Real quick, real quick. Were you working on the retail side or were you working on the
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.400]   institutional side? Were you a trader? What was your role there? And explain the different
[00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:50.200]   possible roles. Because working at Morgan Stanley Merrill Lynch can mean many, many
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.200]   things.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.520]   Absolutely. So down in Florida, there aren't many institutional jobs in finance. It's mostly
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.440]   all retail because there's a lot of wealth down there. So my job was on the investment
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.600]   analysis side. So I worked for a financial advisor. I didn't do any sales. I did more
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.880]   of the analysis for the portfolios. So that was my role down there. And yeah, there's
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:15.480]   lots of different roles in finance, which I'm happy to get into. But basically I wanted
[00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:20.640]   to move to New York because New York is awesome. So I worked for Morgan Stanley there at their
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:26.640]   Fifth Avenue office. Same thing. I worked for one of the biggest investment teams in
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.960]   the firm. And my job was, again, like the portfolio manager route. And then I decided
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:37.760]   I wanted to become an entrepreneur and pursue that dream. So I quit my Wall Street job to
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:43.120]   come out with my book, Pirates of Financial Freedom. And now I'm on that route because
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.640]   I see a lot of I see more potential with that right now than I did on the Wall Street path.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.280]   So I guess that's kind of my my story in a nutshell.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:54.800]   How long ago did you leave Wall Street to work on your book?
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.960]   Earlier this year. So that was probably April-ish.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:02.040]   Awesome. So tell us about the book.
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:08.960]   Yeah. So I got tired of reading all those boring personal finance books. And I know
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:14.320]   that there's a big need to learn about financial literacy, but nobody wants to read a thick
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:18.240]   long book or listen to a boring lecture. So I was like, how can I make this exciting?
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:22.840]   So I wrote the first personal finance adventure novel. Basically, it's a pirate adventure
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:28.960]   story that teaches over 70 money lessons. And I think that it can help a lot of people.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.440]   Yeah, I have a copy of the book, which I got I bought from you after we met. You told me
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:41.360]   about it. And I am so excited to see. I didn't know it was the first, but I'm so excited
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:48.480]   to see you doing this and leading the charge, I guess, with finding some ways to adjust
[00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:52.640]   and teach personal finance lessons in a way that is more accessible.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:08:00.200]   I'm really concerned about just our general population, our general culture. Knowledge
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:05.560]   comes from largely comes from books. And all the knowledge of the world is found in a book.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:10.200]   But I'm really concerned that many people can't read, many people don't read, and many
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.920]   people when they do read, choose not to read books that have information, but rather to
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:21.280]   read books that are more exciting. And I love to read an exciting book, but I'm just so
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.000]   concerned with financial literacy in our country. And so I love having this as an option for
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   people.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.600]   Well, I'm glad you got a chance to read it and that they like the idea. I'm calling
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.880]   this, I don't know if I'm trying to start a movement, but I call it financial edutainment.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.240]   And I think that this category of book can just really explode and edutainment in general
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:48.480]   can really explode just based on, you know, people have short attention spans, they want
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.840]   results now and they get bored easily. So I think that teaching in this manner, and
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:56.320]   I'm trying to get this book into schools and homeschoolers are working with it, all that,
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.520]   I think it can really change the future of education.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.880]   Right. Are you aware of, I mean, are you aware of any competition in this genre? You mentioned
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:09.280]   that you're the first kind of with the adventure story, but are you aware of other allegories,
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:14.680]   other parables, other books that maybe influenced this or influenced your idea?
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.600]   Well, Pirates of the Caribbean definitely influenced my book. But as far as like a finance
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.720]   type book, I think the best known one is Richest Man in Babylon. And I've read that and, you
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:34.400]   know, I thought it taught valuable lessons, but it wasn't funny, it wasn't adventurous,
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.000]   it wasn't much action or plot twists or anything like that. And then another one is The Wealthy
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.400]   Barber, which also teaches good lessons. But again, it didn't have that kind of, it wasn't
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:52.160]   a page turner. But I would say that those are probably, you know, the two that I'm aware
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:57.600]   of. Yeah, I love Richest Man in Babylon. It appeals
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:02.920]   to me. I like the language of it and I actually like, I like the lessons, I like the language,
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:06.400]   and I like that it is so far removed. You actually did something similar with your book
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.680]   because you used a lot of kind of pirate language to mix it up a little bit and make it not
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:17.640]   necessarily sound like 2014, although you didn't set it in 1714. It was clearly a modern
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:23.760]   setting, but just with a twist. But I loved the language in Richest Man in Babylon because
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:28.160]   the passage that stands out to me is there's a passage in there where somebody went and
[00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:33.560]   spent all of their, spent a massive amount of money on, you know, the finest new camel
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.440]   hair robes, something like that. And the greatest...
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.200]   Who doesn't want one of those? Right. And you're thinking, "Well, that's stupid.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.800]   Who would spend a lot of money on a camel hair robe? Oh, wait a second. You mean these
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.320]   new, you know, $300 jeans I just bought? Oh, man."
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:56.360]   Yep, that's a good point. So that's, and I think there's a real need
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:11:01.080]   for it. And I hope you, do you think you'll, and I want you to go through kind of the plot
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.960]   of the book in just a second, but do you have ideas for more books similar? Obviously, you
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:09.920]   got to make this one a raging success first, but have you had other ideas as well?
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.400]   I definitely have other ideas. But as you said, I'm just focused on kind of sales and
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:18.960]   marketing for this book, which is a whole learning experience on its own. But yeah,
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.840]   I want to make this book a success first. And if I can make it a success, then yeah,
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:26.040]   I've got plenty of other ideas for future books and courses and speaking and all that
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:28.240]   kind of stuff. Awesome. That'd be exciting. I've wanted
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.120]   myself to create almost like a Hardy Boys for business adventure.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:37.040]   Oh, nice. Because when I was a kid, I loved reading
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:43.200]   Hardy Boys stories, and they were all about kind of detective work. But I would love to
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:50.480]   bring that in and bring in business adventure somehow and teach kind of concepts of finance
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.680]   on the side of entrepreneurship, on the side of due diligence, on investments, things like
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:12:00.160]   that. So we'll see if I can build the margin into my life to be able to get it done at
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:05.960]   some point. But if not, take it and run with it, because I'd love to see more of this genre
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:11.200]   exist. Go ahead. Excuse me.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:19.200]   No, I think the genre can definitely grow. I'm going to mispronounce his name, but Patrick
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:25.320]   Leoncioni or somebody wrote fables of business. So I'm going to look up that, but that might
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.520]   interest you as well. It's based more on the modern time, but that's probably another type
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:36.160]   of book that is similar to this kind of fable type story with business lessons.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:41.040]   Neat. There's one other person also you might check out who I'm aware of, because he taught
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:47.800]   my CFP prep class, one of the named Ken Zahn. It's Z-A-H-N. He wrote, I think he's written
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:57.800]   three murder mystery finance novels. So he is a financial planner and with a lot of experience.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:03.840]   So he wrote some murder mysteries and he uses them as a context for teaching people about
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.760]   some intricacies of financial planning. So he basically presents some financial planning
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.120]   cases through the context of a murder mystery. And it's pretty cool. I've only read one of
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:18.520]   his books, but he gets pretty in depth into, for example, here's the wealthy heiress and
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:22.920]   here's how her estate plan would be structured. And if we use this discount, we can get this
[00:13:22.920 --> 00:13:30.480]   valuation and does it. So you may also check out his work. It's a little different than
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.960]   yours. Yours is very focused on practical stuff. His is a little bit more the intellectual
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:39.520]   financial plan side, but he also recommendations for the audience.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.240]   But Ken's not here, you're here. And I want you to talk about your book. So tell us the
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.680]   plot and then share some of the lessons that you've worked in.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:54.040]   Sure. So the basic idea of the plot is you've got Captain Rich R. Daly, and he's a pirate
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:14:01.320]   captain and the book is based in kind of like today's world, but with 17th century pirates,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:05.080]   like off the coast of South Carolina or something, they're still kind of there doing their own
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.840]   thing. I kind of compared to the Amish, right? So they're kind of still doing their same
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.960]   things that they were doing hundreds of years ago. So these pirates are still around kind
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.240]   of doing the same things that they're doing hundreds of years ago. But a lot of these
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:19.200]   pirates are becoming landlubbers, which are us, right? They're attracted by the cell phones
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:28.080]   and like the, you know, those fancy jeans and everything. So they decided to move and
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:34.120]   become a landlubber. So the captain, he has to recruit all these landlubbers to become
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.060]   pirates. And he thinks the best way to do that would be to show the world that his pirates
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:43.320]   are rich and wealthy and that they have lots of gold. The problem is his pirates are broke.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:49.360]   So he just so happens to have a son that works on Wall Street. So he requested his son come
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:53.400]   down and teach his pirates like how to build wealth and how to build treasure and all that
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:59.560]   kind of stuff. So it's their adventure story where Giuseppe, the Wall Street guy, teaches
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.920]   these pirates how to pay down debt, how to build their credit score, how to save for
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:09.000]   retirement, how to think like the rich, buy their first home. You know, there's over 70
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.640]   lessons. And along the way, they've got sword fights and treasure hunts and mythical beasts
[00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:20.880]   and kidnappings and walking the plank and all that kind of stuff. So yeah, that's the
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:21.880]   basic idea of the book.
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.680]   What are some of the types of lessons that you have woven in? When you say 70 lessons,
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:30.840]   what would be some of the general concepts that you're referring to?
[00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:35.840]   What I did is I tried to, you know, the main lessons that a lot of the personal finance
[00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:45.320]   people are well aware of, right? So live below your means, snowball method, dollar cost averaging,
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:50.360]   like all those kind of basic things that you and I and the other personal finance people
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:54.520]   are well aware of, but that the general public really isn't aware of. So I wanted to make
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:16:00.080]   sure that I covered a lot of the basics. But then I threw in some extras and I invented
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:05.600]   kind of some of my own terms like the 10 times test or the think delay mentality. I also
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:12.680]   got into kind of things that aren't necessarily covered in personal finance as much. So like
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:17.600]   stock ownership rights and ETF investing and some of these other things that maybe aren't
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.200]   getting as much attention as they probably should.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.040]   I want to read one of the things I wanted to read. Let me read about four paragraphs,
[00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.200]   just a little bit of the dialogue around the 10 times test, because this was one of the
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:32.360]   things that stood out to me. I love these little rules of thumb and I have never heard.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:40.000]   So let me read it and then we'll talk about it. Just read about a very short excerpt here.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:44.320]   He said, "But buying things you want isn't always a bad thing," continued Joey. "Part
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.120]   of the joy of being financially secure is that you can blow your money on silly things
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:53.320]   you don't need." "Really? So I can buy it?" Rusty became excited again. "Well, it depends.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:57.880]   You need to be able to comfortably afford your wants. I live by the 10 times test."
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:03.040]   "What be that?" asked Sandy. "The 10 times test says that when it comes to something
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.840]   you want, you should have at least 10 times that amount in savings. If you don't, that
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   means you are spending over 10% of your life savings on something you don't even need."
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.760]   And it goes on from that. So did you make up that 10 times test?
[00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:23.880]   I did. Yeah, it's my own original concept. And that section you're talking about, Rusty
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.200]   wants to buy a $500 parrot, right? Because everybody, or every pirate quote-unquote "needs"
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:30.200]   a parrot.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   Of course.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:38.440]   But obviously it's not a need, it's a want, which Joey, aka Giuseppe, aka looks, talks
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:46.120]   and acts a lot like me, that character. So he doesn't have that 5,000 doubloons in savings
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.840]   and so it doesn't pass the 10 times test. This is actually something that I applied
[00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:54.080]   in my own life just when I was getting out of college. I was just kind of like, "Oh,
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:59.280]   that's a good idea. Why would I spend 10% of my lifetime savings on something that I
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.640]   don't even need?" And then I just kind of like, "Oh, you know what? Other people may
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:06.080]   find that useful as well." And based on the reviews and people that I'm hearing from,
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.640]   they're like, "That's a really cool idea. It's really easy to understand. I'm going
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:10.640]   to start applying that."
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:15.840]   It's very useful. And I'm glad you made it up. I may steal it. I'll credit you every
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:23.080]   time I can. But some of these just little rules of thumb I find are so useful to help
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:30.400]   us, I guess, have a basis that moves toward wealth. I remember another one I've stolen
[00:18:30.400 --> 00:18:37.160]   is Sam, Financial Samurai. His, "Don't buy a car that's more than 10% of your annual
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:41.480]   income. Make sure that you have never owned vehicles that are worth more than 10% of your
[00:18:41.480 --> 00:18:48.320]   annual income." And what can happen with these things is that we don't really have any societal
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:53.680]   rules about what we spend money on and what we don't spend money on. So therefore, oftentimes,
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.920]   the default becomes we just simply, if we have it, we buy it. If we have it, we spend
[00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:03.480]   it. And without some sort of guideline, we don't have anything to judge things on.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:07.440]   So if I tell somebody, "You should never spend more than 10% of your annual income
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.720]   on a car," then they can say, "Oh, wow. So that means I make $30,000, so I should
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.440]   drive a $3,000 car. Why?" And they can say, "Well, if you want to be wealthy, this
[00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.440]   would be a rule." And so when they're going and looking for cars, automatically,
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.280]   they're looking in a different price range than if somebody's making $30,000 a year
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:32.520]   and is saying, "Oh, I should spend 10% or 15% of my monthly income on a car," then
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.480]   they're looking and saying, "Well, 10% of my income would be a little under $300 a
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.440]   month, so therefore, I can afford the payment on a $300-a-month car," and they wind up
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.280]   with a $25,000 or $30,000 car, and they have no ability to become wealthy.
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:54.240]   So these rules need to be rules, these work ideas of mine. I should spend 25% of my income
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.000]   on housing. Well, wait a second. What if you had it, I should spend one year's salary
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.680]   on housing? It changes the scenario. So I really like your 10 times test because it's
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:08.960]   useful even for younger people to say, "Hey, have 10 times this amount of money in savings
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.400]   and don't ever wipe out all your savings on something."
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:17.240]   Yeah, and I think it's applicable to everyone. So if you have no savings and you're going
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:22.560]   to buy a dollar candy bar, at least that'll get you started to save $10 before you buy
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:27.060]   that candy bar. And a lot of times, it's just getting started. People are so intimidated
[00:20:27.060 --> 00:20:32.960]   by taking that first step. And then if you're a millionaire and you want to buy a $300,000
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:37.400]   Ferrari or whatever, then you should probably have $3 million in savings. So I think it
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.680]   can apply to everybody.
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:43.920]   Absolutely. It's useful, and I don't really care that much if people follow it to the
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:48.800]   letter. I care that you think it through and that you have a logical framework for what
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:54.000]   you're thinking through and that the rules that you have are rules surrounding wealth,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.160]   not rules that are dictated by a consumer-driven society who says, "Yes, you can afford this
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.840]   if you can afford the monthly payment."
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.040]   Are you aware—is there any other of your ideas that you implemented in the book that
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:11.160]   I might not know that were original with you?
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:17.960]   Well, it's kind of associated with that 10 times test, but this idea I call "think delay."
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.480]   And basically what this says is—let's say you don't pass the 10 times test. That's not
[00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.560]   saying that you can never buy something. I think the general public thinks like all the
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.680]   personal finance people are saying, "You can never buy nice things," or "You can't buy
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:36.800]   that," and they think that you can never buy it. I think delay says, "No, you can eventually
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:41.440]   buy it once you're financially responsible and in a better place." People think that,
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:45.000]   "Oh, I don't want to listen to these personal finance people because I can't buy luxurious
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:48.680]   things and whatever." And I don't think that's what any of the personal finance people are
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:53.760]   saying. It's saying, "You want to delay that purchase until you're in a better spot."
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:57.320]   And so I just coined "think delay" for that, but a lot of people preach the same thing.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.600]   Awesome. That's really cool. I like that. It's good to have a little bit of lingo.
[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:08.320]   Do you have a list on your website, or are you personally a list of the 70 or so lessons
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.640]   as far as specifically enumerated somewhere?
[00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:19.160]   You know, I do. It's not well-formatted or anything. I think it's probably more than
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.080]   70 lessons, but I was like, "Yeah, let me just see all the things that are in here."
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.080]   So yes, I do have a list.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:28.920]   One of the ideas that I had when I was reading the book—and I'm not sure if you thought
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.960]   of it and decided not to—I was thinking about how I could leverage the book for other
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:39.920]   people. And I could just give it to somebody and say, "Hey, here, read this book." I think
[00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:46.320]   that I would use this book—I'm going to interrupt my own question. Did you specifically
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:51.240]   target this toward a certain audience, a certain age bracket, a certain type of person in your
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:52.240]   mind?
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:57.040]   I did. So I wrote it—so I tried to think of what would be the best type of person that
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:01.220]   I could really make a difference for that could apply the lessons. So there's a lot
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:06.680]   of the retiree market, there's a lot of the kid books. But kids, they don't make any money.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:13.400]   Retirees, I don't want to say it's too late, but it's kind of too late. So what I did is
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:18.680]   I focused on the teens and 20s market, because they're starting to make some income, they
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.080]   haven't formed these bad habits yet, they're hopefully not in a load of debt, and you can
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:28.960]   really make a difference. So I focused on that market. But it turns out that people
[00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:34.400]   from ages 8 to 48 have read the book and are like, "Wow, this is great, I understand it,
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:38.320]   it's making a difference in my life." So I guess it's one of those books that can apply
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:43.480]   to multiple ages, but I did write it for the teens and 20s market in mind.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   Right. Yeah, that's what I thought, partly because you said that on the back cover.
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:50.840]   I did.
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.920]   But my thought was that with those 70 lessons, I kept wanting to look to the back of the
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:24:00.800]   book and find an appendix with a listed number of those lessons. And you didn't include an
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:04.960]   appendix or an index of the lessons. What you did include was you included some note
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:10.480]   pages. And so when I thought about how I would maybe leverage this book is I would give this
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:19.480]   to teenagers as a book report topic. And I would use it almost as a...and say, "Hey,
[00:24:19.480 --> 00:24:24.800]   read this book." And then the goal would be after reading it, go back through and outline
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:30.580]   it and try to bring out as many of the lessons. And maybe if I were a teacher, I would maybe
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:35.320]   integrate this as you get points based upon how many lessons you can bring out.
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:39.160]   And so maybe if you actually take your list and just simply produce it as a teacher's
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:44.840]   guide or as a manual. I mean, if my son were older, I would be assigning him, if he weren't
[00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:49.560]   already reading them, I would be assigning books like this and setting up an incentive
[00:24:49.560 --> 00:24:56.080]   system for him to read them, understand them, outline them, apply the lessons, enumerate
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.280]   them, and figure out how they could be applied to his own life. So maybe if you built out
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:05.160]   that out, maybe with the home education community and maybe with teachers who are economics
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.820]   teachers in the government school system or in private schools, maybe you could build
[00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:13.560]   out some teacher resources for them and that would help teachers and parents to be able
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:14.560]   to assign it.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.240]   I think that's a great idea. I'm actually putting together a curriculum for teachers
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:26.080]   right now. It's based per chapter and each chapter has discussion questions, activities,
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:30.880]   and test questions that the homeschool community and the teachers in general can use. But I
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:35.560]   hadn't thought of adding just the 70 lessons in that guide. So that's a really good idea.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.200]   I can easily do that.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:43.000]   That'd be cool. Because it's so pithy. And the challenge with these books, as far as
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:49.820]   a book that is an edutainment, as you mentioned in the show, or in the book, is the key to
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:55.360]   education is implementation. Knowledge isn't what makes the difference. It's applied knowledge.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:26:02.720]   So my thinking with books, I have had to learn how to read books and figure out how to apply
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:06.560]   them because reading goes far beyond just the reading. So it's kind of an easy entry
[00:26:06.560 --> 00:26:11.160]   way. But then I need to go back and dissect it and figure out and apply it because it's
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.520]   the application of the knowledge, I think, that really makes the transformation.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:19.940]   Oh, I agree 100% with that. And that's why the last chapter in the book is basically
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:26.060]   the goal setting guide and kind of my system on how I think you can set and achieve goals.
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.540]   Because you're right, there's a lot of people that already know this knowledge and are still
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:33.420]   broke. Why is that? Because they haven't applied it. I think the biggest money mistake people
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:38.060]   make is that they don't actually take steps to apply the lessons that they've learned.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.900]   They're not taking any action towards financial freedom. They just kind of read about it and
[00:26:41.900 --> 00:26:48.900]   think about it, but don't actually take those steps. So we're on the same page for that.
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:54.460]   Absolutely. So I would encourage people to get the book. I was impressed when I looked
[00:26:54.460 --> 00:26:58.900]   at your website that you have an excerpt from the book. Frankly, I don't know how to--this
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:03.620]   is the first time I've ever done an audio interview about a book. So I want to intrigue
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:06.260]   people with the concept without ruining the book.
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:11.020]   Right. There are some plot twists in there. So I don't want to spoil them.
[00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:17.220]   Right. So I'm trying not to give a spoiler. I have no idea how to do a book interview
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:24.220]   with an author other than kind of what we're doing. But you have a really great--go ahead.
[00:27:24.220 --> 00:27:26.860]   I spoke over you. I apologize. Say what you just said.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:30.660]   Well, I'm curious if you had a favorite character or a favorite lesson in the book.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:36.860]   For me, I just--I didn't have a favorite character or a favorite lesson. I thought
[00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:43.500]   that--I'm partial to pirate captains, so I thought the captain was a fun character. And
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:50.100]   I liked how you used kind of these wacky--slightly wacky, not absurd, but slightly wacky characters
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:55.420]   with the pirates. And because it's kind of funny because you can almost create a caricature.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:28:02.420]   And instead of building out a modern caricature, you can joke about how this pirate is--what
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:08.620]   was the scene in the book where the pirate is going to the store and buying all of these
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.780]   bottles of rum?
[00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:10.660]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:14.020]   And he's got all these different brands of rum and has no money. Well, it's kind of a
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:18.640]   joke about a pirate doing that, but yet how many of us know people that do the equivalent
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:21.740]   of that, whether it's with alcohol or not?
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.700]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:29.700]   And so I like these caricatures because instead of being specifically critical of modern society,
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:37.460]   we can kind of take the indirect lesson and apply it to somebody that we know and recognize,
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.100]   "Ah, look at that."
[00:28:39.100 --> 00:28:44.580]   Well, it's funny. So this--an eight-year-old girl in New Zealand read my book in about
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:51.580]   five hours, she said. And her mom emailed me and was like, "Joe, you've created a monster.
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:55.260]   Every time we go to the store, she's like, 'Mom, is that a need or a want?'"
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:55.820]   Right.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.060]   "Have you thought about inflation? What are we going to do about that?" And she's saying
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:03.540]   all these things from the book, and she's starting to apply some of the lessons with
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:09.420]   her own entrepreneurial-type things, and she's starting to save some money. So yeah, some
[00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:14.580]   of these characters really live in people's minds for a while, because they're at the
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:18.140]   store and they're like, "Oh, you know, I thought about what Rusty said, and I ended up not
[00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:19.140]   buying it."
[00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:19.660]   Right.
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:21.260]   And so, yeah.
[00:29:21.260 --> 00:29:26.300]   Right. And that's the thing that we can do, is you create books as--I'm creating a different
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:32.300]   medium here, or a different type of media, with podcasting. I would love to see--I've
[00:29:32.300 --> 00:29:36.300]   seen some people--I mentioned it in one of the shows where some people are producing
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:40.340]   a cartoon series of business lessons with Warren Buffett on YouTube. I don't remember
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:41.900]   the name of it.
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:48.900]   But we need--it's very easy for me to get really hardcore and radical about the doom
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:55.940]   that is facing our world because of a lack of academic excellence, and to just be awful.
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:03.500]   But the key is, we've got to adjust and learn how to reach people with lessons, and learn
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:09.380]   how to encourage other people. And not everybody is the same way, and we need different types
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.660]   of media that appeal to different people.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:17.460]   And just by giving--I mean, I'm thrilled that you created this, because--and I'd love for
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:22.860]   the audience to buy a copy. Go and buy a copy. Even if you aren't that interested in reading
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:29.340]   it for yourself, buy a copy to give to somebody. It may be that somebody says, "I don't need
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:35.540]   to read a novel that appeals to teens," and I would encourage them to read it. But I'm
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:40.940]   going to be giving my copy away, simply because this is the type of format. It's easier for
[00:30:40.940 --> 00:30:45.100]   me to give your book to somebody who's not that interested in finance than it is for
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:51.460]   me to figure out, "What book do I give them? Do I give them the Boglehead's Guide to Investing?
[00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:55.820]   Do I give them the Dave Ramsey Total Money Makeover? Do I give them the Rick Edelman
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:31:02.820]   this, or the Jacob Blunt Fisker's Early Retirement?" A novel is a fairly straightforward thing.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:11.040]   And if we can--the decisions that we make are influenced by the paradigm that we have.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:15.300]   So we've got to intentionally shape that paradigm, that way of thinking, and encourage others
[00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:17.820]   with new, more constructive ways of thinking.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:23.340]   I'm glad you think that way. And I do think my book makes a good gift for somebody who
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:27.460]   knows nothing about money, because you can give it to them in a way that's not insulting.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:30.820]   If you give somebody a "How to Get Out of Debt" book, you're kind of like, "What are
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:33.940]   you saying? I don't know how to manage my own thing." But if you're like, "Hey, here's
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:38.700]   this really funny book, and on a side you'll also learn some good money lessons, but the
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:43.860]   story's really cool," that makes it an easier way for them to learn these lessons, like
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:46.140]   wrapping the medicine in some bacon or something.
[00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:53.140]   Right. I remember when we were at FinCon, I heard Pete "Money Mustache" say, "Trick
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:32:00.380]   people into learning something." I hate that philosophy, because it's so antithetical to
[00:32:00.380 --> 00:32:05.500]   how I think I should be, and we should be. We should desire to learn people. I just hate
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:11.420]   that philosophy, but I recognize that sometimes it is important and necessary.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:15.580]   It's sad, but that's kind of the world we're living in for most people. The people that
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:20.100]   need these lessons are the ones that aren't reading the books. You kind of have to trick
[00:32:20.100 --> 00:32:20.900]   people.
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.860]   Right. Very cool. What is the website for the book?
[00:32:24.860 --> 00:32:31.860]   You can go to PiratesOfFinancialFreedom.com. You can also Google "Pirates of Financial
[00:32:32.220 --> 00:32:36.620]   Freedom" and it'll come right up. But for those who aren't skeptical of what is this,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:41.060]   you can also get the first half of the book for 99 cents on Amazon.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:41.660]   Oh, cool.
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:44.620]   So people can preview it and see if they like it.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:45.900]   That's a great marketing idea.
[00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:50.980]   Thank you. But to buy the actual book, you have to go to my website, because I've done
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:55.500]   a lot of research, and that's the best way to do it, if you can pull it off.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:33:02.180]   Right. Yeah, self-publishing, as long as you're okay with it from not having a book, you can
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:09.180]   bring the prestige. It certainly seems like you can. It results in more money in the author's
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:14.140]   pocket, depending on the marketing platform. So that would be great.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.340]   And I would just encourage people, it's October. October 21 is when we're recording this interview,
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:23.620]   so this interview will go out sometime here toward the end of October. And Christmas is
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.820]   coming up. If you're looking for a good Christmas present, I think I love to give and receive
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:35.660]   books. And sometimes books stay on the shelf until they're timely. But that's a great present
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:39.900]   to give somebody as a Christmas present. It can be a great present for a young person,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:45.780]   for a not-young person. I think it's a very, an excellent way to bring in financial concepts.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:52.780]   And because there's so many financial concepts, unlike some personal finance books that are
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:57.580]   written in the mindset of, "This is what you must do. Here's the plan. Here are these five
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:02.940]   steps, and you have to follow these five steps." It's much more low-key, and there are enough
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:07.220]   lessons that somebody could pull from it to say, "Here's what's appropriate to me at this
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:14.220]   stage." I think it could be an excellent gift as a Christmas gift. So I would encourage
[00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:18.140]   people to consider that as we approach the Christmas season.
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:21.780]   Well, I appreciate that. And a good news for if you're going to make a New Year's resolution
[00:34:21.780 --> 00:34:26.260]   for taking control of your finances in the next year, that's also right around the corner.
[00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:30.860]   It's hard to believe that it's already end of October. Time just flies.
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:35.220]   Amazing. Anything else on the book that I missed, or anything you'd like to mention
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:38.820]   about it before we flip over to your experience in the world of finance?
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:41.700]   No, I don't think so. I think we did a good job.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:46.620]   I think it's a good introduction, and again, first time I've done a book interview, so
[00:34:46.620 --> 00:34:47.820]   this is the best shot I've--
[00:34:47.820 --> 00:34:49.740]   You did a great job. I was impressed.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:55.260]   Oh, good. Thank you. So the world of finance and the world of Wall Street, there are a
[00:34:55.260 --> 00:34:59.140]   lot of people who are interested in-- they listen to this show, they write me emails
[00:34:59.140 --> 00:35:03.100]   and say, "Well, how do I get into finance? I'm interested in personal finance, I'm interested
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:09.180]   in investment, I'm interested in learning." I have experience in the personal finance
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:14.980]   space and on the perspective of the retail financial advisor space, but I have no experience
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:19.340]   on the institutional side, on the portfolio management side, and kind of on the Wall Street
[00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:25.220]   side. So what's it like? Why did you leave? Did you leave because you didn't like it?
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:28.580]   What's it like to work on the institutional side?
[00:35:28.580 --> 00:35:35.380]   No, I actually did enjoy it. There's a lot of opportunity, and it's hard to categorize
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:43.580]   a finance job in general, because there's so many different types. Even within firms,
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:47.700]   you can't really stereotype firms either, because each department is different, each
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:52.660]   experience is different, so to kind of generalize the whole thing is very difficult to do. But
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:57.620]   the reason that I liked being in the finance industry is because there's so many different
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:06.060]   options. You can go down many different avenues in terms of research, like the amount of reading
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:12.100]   and learning you can do is just infinite. Even in personal finance, there's a lot to
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:17.100]   know, but when you're doing research on companies and on economic trends, and when you're trying
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.140]   to make predictions about stock prices and asset classes and all that stuff, literally
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:26.980]   you could never read it all. So the opportunity for learning is infinite. And obviously you
[00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.980]   can make a ton of money, so that's another appeal. I think that's probably the main appeal
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:38.020]   for a lot of people to go into finance. What's interesting is that a lot of my friends work
[00:36:38.020 --> 00:36:42.420]   in finance, they work in hedge funds, investment banking, private equity firms, and a lot of
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:47.380]   them, they're not that excited about their job. They got in because it's prestigious
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:53.340]   and the money's good, but I don't feel like they're excited and passionate in their jobs
[00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.420]   right now. Some are, don't get me wrong, some are definitely. And some of them are very
[00:36:56.420 --> 00:37:02.260]   good, but that's one of the reasons I kind of wanted to try something different, because
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.860]   I'm excited every day talking about my book and figuring out how to get it out there,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:11.380]   helping people. Whereas a lot of the finance people, they're not that thrilled about going
[00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:13.820]   to work every day.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:21.300]   Do you, you've done enough academic work. You hold the CFA charter, which is a substantial
[00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:25.820]   amount of work. And I'm going to ask you in a bit kind of just to lay that out for people,
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:29.460]   because people oftentimes have questions. They see all these designations and they don't
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:36.300]   understand the course of study. But before we get there, how do you handle the, like,
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:42.220]   how do you handle the idea of the value that you actually bring working in mainstream finance?
[00:37:42.220 --> 00:37:48.460]   Many people in the personal finance space view, and I think rightly so in many circumstances,
[00:37:48.460 --> 00:37:55.420]   view the finance industry, especially the Wall Street finance industry, as more of a
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:38:03.860]   leech on society and as a cost, an embedded cost on society, rather than as a value that
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:09.980]   bring, something that brings value to people. Based on your experience, how would you answer
[00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:10.980]   that challenge?
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:19.140]   Well, I don't think that that's entirely inaccurate, but it depends. Right. So there are some finance
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:25.740]   people who are really intelligent, who put in the work and they do add value. But another
[00:38:25.740 --> 00:38:28.660]   reason that I got discouraged with the finance industry right now, because it's really hard
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:38.900]   to generate alpha. So alpha is, let's say the S&P 500 is up 10 percent in the year and
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:45.820]   your investment mutual fund was up 12 percent. Right. So back of the hand calculation, you
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:50.300]   added two percent of alpha above the market. So, you know, for people who aren't maybe
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:53.620]   familiar with that term, but it's really, really hard to generate alpha. And it's especially
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:59.380]   hard right now because over the past couple of decades, so many smart people have gone
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:04.380]   into the finance industry that it's really saturated. And so to find that edge and like
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:08.880]   a large cap company is really difficult right now. And you find a lot of people leaving
[00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:14.060]   finance going to technology because you can kind of get rich quick in that kind of area
[00:39:14.060 --> 00:39:19.740]   where there aren't as many smart people, but that's becoming saturated too. So, I mean,
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:24.940]   I think a lot of the people in finance are really doing their best. They have good intentions.
[00:39:24.940 --> 00:39:28.900]   They work hard. I mean, these people work 80 hours a week, you know, looking for that
[00:39:28.900 --> 00:39:37.420]   edge. But it's pretty tough. But there are, I mean, there are good people out there and
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.740]   it's kind of changing. So like it used to be all about active management and now passive
[00:39:41.740 --> 00:39:48.020]   management is kind of making its trend with like low cost ETFs that are cost effective,
[00:39:48.020 --> 00:39:51.940]   tax efficient. You're not you're never going to beat the market, but at least you'll be
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:56.660]   the market. You're never going to underperform. And so that's kind of been my philosophy when
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:40:01.140]   I was managing portfolios. Like the core would be kind of like this passive approach where
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:05.460]   you're not paying these exorbitant fees. And then you look for like the outliers where
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:09.740]   you actually do find some managers who really are adding value and who really do a good
[00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:13.840]   job. But it's like any other industry, like 80 percent of the people in any industry just
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.740]   aren't adding that much value. It's those finding those 20 percent of the people who
[00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.540]   really are really good at what they do.
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:25.060]   Right. Right. And what's frustrating is that, I mean, the challenge of finding those people,
[00:40:25.060 --> 00:40:29.380]   it's double challenging. And this is where when you get into the the kind of the world
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:34.420]   of prediction, which is why so many people throw in the towel and I understand why they
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:39.700]   do is that not only do you have is that you have two levels of challenge. The manager
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:46.340]   has defined. The manager has to create Alpha and Alpha, and I'm glad you defined it because
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:51.540]   we throw that term around. But how I think of it is just simply the value that the manager
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:57.340]   adds over and above just simply the market condition. And so the manager has to create
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:02.020]   Alpha. And then if you're a portfolio manager, you've got to find the managers who are creating
[00:41:02.020 --> 00:41:07.860]   Alpha in a specific asset class. And it's a tough that's that's it's a it's a double
[00:41:07.860 --> 00:41:13.780]   whammy tough. But yet that I mean, do you believe it's possible to do on based on your
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.780]   experience?
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:21.660]   No, I do believe it's possible. Yes, I do. But another challenge on top of what you mentioned
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:24.860]   is that you can find the managers who have generated Alpha in the past, but that doesn't
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:29.340]   necessarily mean they'll generate Alpha in the future. Absolutely. Which, you know, makes
[00:41:29.340 --> 00:41:34.060]   it even more difficult. I mean, I spent, you know, two or three years just interviewing
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:39.740]   investment managers. And I learned a lot about, you know, how they perform the research, what
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:45.020]   they think their edges are. And so I got a real in-depth look and I talked to the salespeople
[00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:49.540]   and the portfolio managers. So you kind of see both sides. And, you know, it's tough.
[00:41:49.540 --> 00:41:56.100]   But there are there are people out there who generate who have generated Alpha over a sustained
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:00.660]   period of time. But it's it's very tricky because those people suddenly get all that
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:03.660]   all the money. Right. So you're doing a good job. You're generating Alpha. And now all
[00:42:03.660 --> 00:42:08.460]   of a sudden, like you get all these asset flows. So while it might be easy to generate
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.780]   Alpha with like a hundred million dollar fund, try generating that same Alpha with a two
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:17.900]   billion dollar fund or whatever the numbers are. It just becomes the more successful you
[00:42:17.900 --> 00:42:24.700]   are, the more difficult it is to generate that upper performance going forward. So it's
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:28.500]   tricky. But yeah, I mean, there are successful people out there who have done a good job
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:34.540]   at it. Explain for somebody who's not familiar with institutional management, why is it more
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:40.340]   difficult when you have more money? Why is it more difficult to make a higher rate of
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.820]   return? Shouldn't it be simpler because you have more money, you can buy more deals?
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:50.300]   Well, so Warren Buffett has said I'm a Warren Buffett fan. I mean, I'm from Omaha, Nebraska,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:56.100]   originally. So, you know, he said that if he could just manage like a small cap portfolio,
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.180]   small cap, meaning, you know, small stocks, not the big stocks like IBM and Microsoft.
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:03.860]   And, you know, those are the large cap stocks, but like just a small cap portfolio. And he
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:11.100]   could he could generate 100 percent plus returns. Right. Because there's there's more inefficiencies
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:19.220]   when you get to kind of more esoteric, smaller type of asset classes. But when you've got,
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:27.020]   you know, like Facebook or some company that every Wall Street firm has an analyst covering
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:31.500]   it and they have all this research reports coming out and there's 20 different research
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:38.620]   reports on the same company, like trying to get an edge in that field is it's very difficult.
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:43.120]   Plus if the managers in that large company, let's say they were able to double the revenue
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.660]   in one department. Right. I mean, that's huge. That's a huge deal. But like when your company's
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:51.860]   that big, like doubling the revenue in one department, it's like nothing. Whereas in
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:56.260]   a smaller company and a manager makes a change like that. Now, all of a sudden, like that's
[00:43:56.260 --> 00:44:02.820]   a game changer. So those are some of the reasons. Right. And also, in addition to that, at least
[00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:06.300]   from and again, I haven't worked in this, I've read a little bit, but you also just
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:11.980]   have the problem of making your trades. And when you have I mean, that's what Buffett
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:17.460]   talks about. And I don't remember the numbers he uses in recent discussions. But when you've
[00:44:17.460 --> 00:44:23.040]   got to make a 50 billion dollar deal and a 30 billion dollar deal, that's a lot tougher
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.620]   than making a three million dollar deal. But if he went if he made three million dollar
[00:44:27.620 --> 00:44:33.460]   deals every hour of every working day, that would never be anywhere near that would never
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:38.860]   be anywhere near it wouldn't even it would be completely mindless in terms of the sheer
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:44.260]   size of the portfolio that he has to allocate. Whereas for an individual, let's say that
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:49.300]   you are a massive fluent person and you can go out and and do a three hundred thousand
[00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:53.460]   dollar deal or a million dollar deal or a three million dollar deal. That can make a
[00:44:53.460 --> 00:45:00.220]   major difference in the size of your of your returns. If you can you can I mean, you can
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:05.900]   find a lot of small deals is kind of 50 billion dollar deals don't come along too frequently.
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:09.500]   No they don't. And he's and Warren Buffett is looking for those types of deals. You know,
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:13.220]   he's looking for those big elephants where he can put 20 billion dollars to work. But
[00:45:13.220 --> 00:45:19.660]   I mean, the opportunity size is also smaller. Like how many 20 billion dollar companies
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:23.140]   are out there versus how many three million dollar companies are out there. Right. So
[00:45:23.140 --> 00:45:29.060]   another reason why it's just really hard. The bigger you get, the harder it is. Right.
[00:45:29.060 --> 00:45:36.100]   Yeah. I mean, I've struggled because there's so many conflicts, even in my own thinking,
[00:45:36.100 --> 00:45:42.580]   to be able to make general general observations, like more specific, you know, suggestions
[00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.980]   for in an individual situation where you know the facts of the situation are easier. But
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:51.220]   more generalized observations are tough because there's so much nuance, you know, active,
[00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:55.580]   passive, you know, investment styles, investment approaches. But I talked with a guy from Morningstar
[00:45:55.580 --> 00:46:01.700]   one time, extremely smart guy, and he was a upper level researcher at Morningstar. And
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:05.580]   we were talking about portfolio design. And he's in the statement he said struck with
[00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:14.260]   me as being a sensible statement. He said, if we're going to use an active strategy,
[00:46:14.260 --> 00:46:20.860]   it better like it better be in an area where we're sure it's adding value beyond the passive
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:25.940]   strategy to justify the fee. Because, you know, it's almost like you see this approach
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:31.700]   happening many times is that somebody may build a core portfolio around large cap U.S.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.980]   stocks, a large, very efficient market, a lot of information, a very stable market.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:43.900]   But buying an S&P 500 index is not necessarily the same opportunity as buying a Brazilian
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:49.940]   gold mining index. You know, there's a little bit of a difference for somebody to maybe
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:54.660]   be able to sniff out outperformance or be able to do a little bit more of exhaustive
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:00.340]   analysis on whether it's a fundamental analysis or there may be a it's just a less efficient
[00:47:00.340 --> 00:47:06.820]   market. So I see it as that's currently the opinion that I hold. And I just keep looking
[00:47:06.820 --> 00:47:11.380]   just to see is this opinion accurate. But to me, that makes a lot of sense as markets
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:18.340]   develop, then a lot of times the smart money, the researchers are going to move to areas
[00:47:18.340 --> 00:47:23.180]   where they're not as developed. And then that will help those markets to develop and to
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:28.680]   become more efficient. And gradually over time, then these this is how the economies
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:30.940]   adjust and shift and evolve over time.
[00:47:30.940 --> 00:47:38.180]   Yeah. And the reason that those smaller markets develop, as you say, is because when they're
[00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:42.740]   kind of undeveloped and there's inefficiencies there, those investment is you're making really
[00:47:42.740 --> 00:47:48.240]   good money. Right. So they're putting up good returns. Now, that's I mean, returns draws
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.860]   a crowd. Right. So if you're in an inefficient market, you're putting up good returns. That's
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.820]   going to draw all the people to help develop that market. And then the returns aren't as
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:59.740]   good because now there's more people researching it. And so that's kind of the cycle.
[00:47:59.740 --> 00:48:04.660]   Right. And then in an idealistic world, whether this practically works or not, then this is
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:10.260]   all part of the capital, the attraction of capital to a market. So theoretically, one
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:15.340]   of the major functions that so-called Wall Street serves is the efficient allocation
[00:48:15.340 --> 00:48:21.700]   of capital. So if we're working in Malaysian in the Malaysian markets, then if there is
[00:48:21.700 --> 00:48:26.420]   able to be good returns, then the advisors, then capital will flow there. And then so
[00:48:26.420 --> 00:48:31.260]   as the capital flows, that will theoretically help the market to develop over time as the
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:36.020]   outside investors come in and that flows and that helps the local entrepreneurs to have
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:40.460]   access to the capital that they need to be able to exploit the business opportunity that
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:45.900]   they see. Now, whether that works so well in practice, I guess it's different, but it
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:52.100]   does serve a valuable. I mean, to me, what I see in the conversation, what's missing
[00:48:52.100 --> 00:48:57.140]   a lot of times is the understanding of the historical context. And I don't claim to necessarily
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:00.820]   understand how markets develop, but I have a model in my head of how they do. And that
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:07.460]   helps me to kind of see how over time the markets develop and this how economies develop
[00:49:07.460 --> 00:49:12.460]   and efficient markets develop over time. And so we can still serve that valuable function
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:16.820]   by allocating capital into these less developed markets.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:19.900]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:23.980]   You made a statement also that I just thought was really interesting, and I don't think
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:27.700]   I've talked about it on the show, though. But you talked about how a lot of smart people
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:35.380]   went to finance and maybe some smart people are moving out of finance and moving into
[00:49:35.380 --> 00:49:44.000]   tech and just the difficulty of the competition. Did you feel like you were in kind of an Ivy
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:51.820]   League credentialed, just a den of ridiculously overqualified people when you were working
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:55.860]   in Wall Street? Or did you feel like there was an ability for you to build out a competitive
[00:49:55.860 --> 00:49:56.860]   edge?
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:50:03.340]   Well, no, I think that within my circle, I definitely had a competitive edge because
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:09.500]   I worked harder and I think I have some good insights. But the typical path, if some of
[00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:15.500]   your readers or listeners were thinking about how can they get a job in finance, and again,
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:23.580]   it kind of depends what age they are, right? So the typical path to become a hedge fund
[00:50:23.580 --> 00:50:29.540]   hotshot is like you get really good grades in high school, you go to an Ivy League school,
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:36.820]   you study business there, you graduate and you work in investment banking for two to
[00:50:36.820 --> 00:50:41.980]   three years and then you switch over to either the hedge fund job or a private equity job.
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:46.900]   That's the typical path. And then from there, you do a really good job as an analyst working
[00:50:46.900 --> 00:50:51.100]   probably eight hours a week. Then you get the promotions and eventually become a managing
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:56.500]   director and then maybe you spin off and start your own hedge fund and then become a billionaire.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:04.180]   That's kind of the typical path. But there are other ways to get in there. But that's
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:08.860]   the best way to do it if you can start early. But for a lot of people, it's kind of too
[00:51:08.860 --> 00:51:10.420]   late to take that path.
[00:51:10.420 --> 00:51:14.500]   The personal finance lesson I draw from it is if there's a lot of competition and you
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:18.740]   have an efficient competitive market, that sucks. Go somewhere else and find somewhere
[00:51:18.740 --> 00:51:23.020]   where there's not a lot of competition. An example that I have in my personal life, one
[00:51:23.020 --> 00:51:29.180]   of my backup businesses if all of my other business ideas that I'm currently pursuing
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:36.260]   fail is one of my backup business plans I've considered is I may start a daycare business
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.140]   for children. Because I look at a daycare business and...
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:41.140]   You make a lot of money.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:46.140]   Well, you can make a lot of money, but I look at it and I see that this is a societally
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:51.500]   unappealing business. If I were to introduce myself as a 35-year-old male and say, "Oh
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:58.420]   yes, I run a daycare," that's really a tough pill to swallow for many people's pride.
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:03.820]   That means that when you look at it, then the market competition, all of the "smart"
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:08.980]   guys are going to Wall Street. I'll go to the daycare business. There are some very
[00:52:08.980 --> 00:52:15.980]   smart people in that business, but there would be a much higher population of maybe part-time
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:24.020]   people, small family operations. Maybe it's a very part-time focused business. There are
[00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:28.180]   some big chains that are working at things, but I would want to go there because it seems
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:34.620]   like my competition would be perhaps less astute when it came to some of the application
[00:52:34.620 --> 00:52:39.580]   of business principles. It would probably be easier to outstudy my competition in a
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.900]   business like that than it would be to outstudy my competition on Wall Street.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:48.380]   Yeah, it's very hard to outstudy your competition on Wall Street. Too many smart, hardworking
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:52.460]   people there. But you're right, that's kind of the reasons why I left. And I might go
[00:52:52.460 --> 00:52:58.500]   back at some point. I like Wall Street, but I have a monopoly on the personal finance
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:52:59.500]   adventure novel market.
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:06.020]   Right, you created the market. I think I currently have a monopoly on the two-hour daily podcast
[00:53:06.020 --> 00:53:09.020]   about personal finance. It's really crazy.
[00:53:09.020 --> 00:53:14.620]   Perfect, right? It's a lot easier when you have less competition. So yeah, you make a
[00:53:14.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   good point.
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:20.780]   Right. Another example, and I give kind of proof for this one. I remember years ago reading
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:26.900]   in Tom Stanley's books on marketing to the affluent, and he talked about this. I don't
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:31.500]   remember which book he covers it. They all flow together in my mind. But he talked about
[00:53:31.500 --> 00:53:39.760]   something like scrap metal dealers, scrap metal being an incredibly profitable business.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:44.620]   Now in any business, you have the 80/20, where there's the 20% that make 80% of the money.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:49.860]   So 80% of the scrap metal dealers aren't going to make much money. But I've met a couple
[00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:55.820]   of those guys. And there's some guy locally who runs a junkyard. And I found that to be
[00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:02.580]   true here in my market. I never was able to bring on any of them as clients of mine, but
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.360]   I worked with some people who worked in their organizations, and they confirmed, "Yeah,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:12.900]   this guy makes a million two, million three. His CFO makes 650,000 bucks."
[00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:18.200]   And I'm sitting here saying, "Here is this junkyard from this guy who's kind of a scrubby-looking
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:22.380]   guy, and he just goes to work in shorts and a t-shirt every day. But this guy is making
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:26.500]   a million two, a million three. He doesn't have the target on his back that the big finance
[00:54:26.500 --> 00:54:32.540]   guy has. He doesn't have the high lifestyle. And so he's found an ability to exploit this
[00:54:32.540 --> 00:54:38.040]   business." And the challenge is that we don't teach people to use this as an opportunity
[00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:43.500]   to say, "If the market's efficient, get out. Go find somewhere where you can create alpha
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:48.660]   in your personal income stream, in your investment solution, and go find an inefficient market
[00:54:48.660 --> 00:54:52.220]   and exploit that to your own gain, to your advantage."
[00:54:52.220 --> 00:54:58.140]   Yeah. Well, another interesting point is about that junkyard guy. Nobody expects him to live
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:03.100]   a lavish lifestyle. The Wall Street guy or the doctor or whatever, they expect you to...
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:06.500]   So you're actually going to become... You could probably become wealthier faster in
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:10.620]   that type of a role, because no one expects you to spend all this money on fancy things.
[00:55:10.620 --> 00:55:11.620]   Right.
[00:55:11.620 --> 00:55:15.940]   So that's an added benefit. But the thing about finance is, it's still a good job. You
[00:55:15.940 --> 00:55:21.540]   can make six figures right out of college. So that's appealing, whereas some of these
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:26.140]   other jobs, you have to create the opportunity. Whereas a lot of people just are not entrepreneurs.
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:31.140]   They'd rather work for somebody else. And the finance community is great for that. You
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:37.420]   can make good money in finance and learn a ton. So it's still a good path if you're not
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.620]   the entrepreneur type.
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:44.860]   I'm struck by, at least in some of the books I read, with profiles of people who work in
[00:55:44.860 --> 00:55:49.260]   finance. It seems like many of the people who work in finance who are the most successful,
[00:55:49.260 --> 00:55:53.980]   they're doing it, yes, because they make a lot of money and they enjoy it. But they almost
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:58.100]   are still doing it, even if they don't need the money or don't care much about the money.
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.100]   Absolutely.
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:03.100]   They get into it, they find out they liked it, they enjoyed it. And they're kind of just
[00:56:03.100 --> 00:56:09.500]   weird different people who really love the game. And because they love it, they're good
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:15.540]   at it. And so the money is the byproduct. And so many of them maybe would hate running
[00:56:15.540 --> 00:56:20.780]   a scrap metal dealership. They like finance, and then they wind up being really good at
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:21.780]   it.
[00:56:21.780 --> 00:56:26.900]   Exactly. And I do know some of those people, yeah, they make really good money, but they're
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:34.460]   excited to go study the market. They're adding value for their funds. They really do get
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:38.540]   good insights. And that's what gets them excited. Like Warren Buffett, he just loves what he
[00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:41.660]   does, but he doesn't have to work. None of these billionaire hedge fund guys have to
[00:56:41.660 --> 00:56:48.820]   work, but they just love it. So if that's you, then absolutely go into finance, because
[00:56:48.820 --> 00:56:53.060]   you can make a really good living and make a lot of money doing something that you love.
[00:56:53.060 --> 00:56:55.100]   And that's the dream for everybody.
[00:56:55.100 --> 00:57:01.420]   Absolutely. Two other quick areas I'd like to pursue. I've given people, I'd like you
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:05.260]   to kind of lay out, and I'll give you a moment to think about it while I ask the question.
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:10.260]   I'd like you to lay out any categories of jobs that you can think of for somebody who's
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:16.260]   interested in the side of finance that you come from. How I've laid this out on the retail
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:20.020]   side for people that have asked me about is I've laid out that you basically have three
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:23.620]   primary functions on the retail side. And by retail, I mean working with clients in
[00:57:23.620 --> 00:57:28.860]   a personal financial planning, personal financial advisory capacity. You're either, number one,
[00:57:28.860 --> 00:57:34.380]   a producer, meaning that you are meeting with clients and you are selling products, selling
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:39.860]   insurance, selling investments, or you are doing financial planning and bringing on clients.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:46.060]   And so you are responsible for the acquisition of clients. So you're a producer, and that's
[00:57:46.060 --> 00:57:51.140]   in your directly interfacing with clients in some regard. That's where the highest income
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:58.080]   potential is, but it's also the most entrepreneurial activity, but it's also where the highest
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:58:04.540]   income potential is, and it's primarily a client interface job to help people understand
[00:58:04.540 --> 00:58:08.340]   what their goals are and what they're doing. Number two is there's almost the back office
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:12.580]   analyst role. So whether that means you are a competent financial planner, but you're
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:17.320]   not very good at bringing in clients, and so maybe you're a back office CFP or you may
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:23.700]   be a back office portfolio manager. You may have some client situations, but you're primarily
[00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:30.420]   responsible for a more technical job, and that is a profitable position, but it's more
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:37.300]   of a salaried position, and it has less profit potential than does the producer side. And/or
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:42.020]   the third area is you may be involved in an administrative role of some kind. So whether
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:47.100]   this is a paperwork administrative role, whether it's more of a secretarial role, or whether
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:51.900]   it's just simply more handling the administration of accounts. I mean, there can be various
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:56.540]   functions, but it's more of an administrative role. So that's how I've kind of categorized
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:58:59.660]   it in my mind. They're not perfect. They're not exclusive, but I've told that to people
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:03.060]   when they're trying to figure out, "Hey, I want to get into finance. What are the different
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:05.780]   options?" I say, "Well, what option do you want? Do you want to be a producer? Do you
[00:59:05.780 --> 00:59:12.300]   want to be a back office investment analyst?" Just simply responsible for running the portfolio.
[00:59:12.300 --> 00:59:16.900]   Based on your experience, do you have any categories that you would tell somebody that
[00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:21.020]   would be helpful for someone to understand the lay of the land a little bit if they're
[00:59:21.020 --> 00:59:23.260]   interested in pursuing a job in finance?
[00:59:23.260 --> 00:59:28.140]   Well, I'd say there are three main buckets that everybody wants. So you can work at a
[00:59:28.140 --> 00:59:32.900]   hedge fund, you can go into investment banking, or you can go into private equity. I mean,
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:39.300]   those are kind of like the three main areas that you get paid a lot of money. Yeah, you
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.140]   make a lot of money in all three of those areas. I would say those are kind of like
[00:59:42.140 --> 00:59:47.580]   the main buckets on the institutional side. So I'll kind of go into a little detail on
[00:59:47.580 --> 00:59:55.660]   each. So hedge fund, it's a broad term, but basically you're picking either stocks or
[00:59:55.660 --> 01:00:02.700]   bonds or different asset classes and you're trying to generate returns, generate alpha
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:07.980]   over a multi-year time period, or you could have a trading horizon anywhere from a few
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:13.500]   milliseconds to a few years. Hedge fund is a very broad category, but basically you're
[01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:19.260]   investing in publicly traded securities that you can buy and sell on a daily basis. Investment
[01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:24.020]   banking, these are the people that take companies public or raise capital for companies. So
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:33.260]   like when Facebook did their IPO, if a company needs to issue a bond for $500 million or
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:40.580]   billions of dollars, these are the investment bankers and they do research on what's the
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:45.300]   company worth, what kind of interest rates should we do, and they spend a lot of time
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:50.020]   in the office. Private equity is you basically have a large pool of capital that you raise
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:55.220]   from investors, then you pretty much go buy entire companies. You're not buying stock
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.580]   of a company, you're buying the entire company itself. And then these private equity guys
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:03.180]   will try to find the companies that they can add value to. So they'll buy an entire company
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:10.340]   and then restructure it or they'll bring in some consultants and add new products or they'll
[01:01:10.340 --> 01:01:16.740]   reduce expenses or whatever. They'll redo it for like three to seven years and then
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:20.900]   they'll sell it. So they buy the company, they change it over three to seven years and
[01:01:20.900 --> 01:01:26.180]   then they sell it to somebody else. So those are the three main buckets. And then within
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:31.280]   that is the different roles. And basically most people are analysts. They just analyze
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:37.420]   and they can analyze anything, different sectors, different asset classes. So if someone wants
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.780]   to go into finance, I think they should figure out what do they want to do, what do they
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:48.620]   get excited about. Is that high yield debt? Is it emerging market companies? Do they love
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:53.820]   consumer finance companies? Try to figure out what sector excites you the most and then
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:57.180]   that'll give you as much as you can about it. And then when you go to apply for a finance
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.420]   job, you'll be like, "You know what? I love materials companies because of X, Y, Z. Here's
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:06.700]   my favorite material companies. The management is great." If you look at the trajectory of
[01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:10.500]   their growth, I think it's going to continue for a while. And then you basically pitch
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:17.020]   the idea. The best way to get a stock market finance type job is to do research on an investment
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:22.740]   idea for a few pages and then show it to people and be like, "Look at my analytical ability
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:25.420]   skills." And then eventually somebody will be like, "Wow, this is really good. Let me
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   take a chance on you."
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:31.420]   Neat. Is there a type of person?
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:34.540]   I don't know what type of person you're looking for but there's other types of jobs. So you
[01:02:34.540 --> 01:02:38.300]   can work for a mutual fund company which is much less competitive. I mean all the finance
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:41.820]   jobs are pretty competitive but if you become an analyst for a mutual fund company or for
[01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:48.620]   like a smaller type shop, they're more likely to take a chance on you rather than like Goldman
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:51.460]   Sachs or some of the big hedge funds.
[01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:56.500]   Is there a type of person that you would think could be attracted more to a hedge fund or
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:01.640]   more to investment banking or is it primarily more about the interest of the person like
[01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:08.500]   you said of, "Hey, I like this type of analysis." Do you look at people on the subway and say,
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:11.740]   "Ah, investment banker. Oh, that guy's an analyst." That type of thing. Can you pick
[01:03:11.740 --> 01:03:13.140]   something up about people?
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:21.060]   That's a good question. I know people at all these firms. I think the hedge fund types
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:29.740]   just really like the market that they're studying. So whether it's emerging market stocks or
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:36.060]   large cap companies where they really get to sink their teeth into the balance sheets
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:43.100]   and income statements and they just love numbers and they like talking to management. Maybe
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:47.660]   that's the hedge fund type. The private equity guys are I think maybe more entrepreneurial.
[01:03:47.660 --> 01:03:52.460]   They have a vision of like, "How can I change this company to make it better?" And then
[01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:58.580]   the investment bankers, to become a successful investment banker, you have to eventually
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:03.180]   get into sales. And sales is not what most people are probably thinking. You have to
[01:04:03.180 --> 01:04:07.500]   go to companies and be like, "Hey, you know what? You should buy this other company and
[01:04:07.500 --> 01:04:10.500]   here's why." You have to sell the company on the idea of buying another company. Or,
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:14.340]   "You know what? You need to come with us and do your IPO with us because of this." And
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:20.740]   you have to sell them on the idea of listing their stock or going public with you. So you
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:24.460]   kind of have to be a salesperson to become very successful in investment banking. So
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:27.140]   maybe those are kind of broad stereotypes.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:32.140]   Right. Nate, I think that'll be helpful because a lot of people are interested in finance
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:37.220]   that listen to this show, but it's an overwhelming world to an outsider.
[01:04:37.220 --> 01:04:44.620]   Well, the first step is to just get started. If you want to be like a great stock analyst,
[01:04:44.620 --> 01:04:50.800]   start analyzing stocks. If you want to become a great trader, start trading. There's nothing
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:55.660]   but experience. I mean, you can open a Scottrade account for like $500 or something and start
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:04:59.540]   picking stocks. And that's when somebody is interviewing you, especially if you don't
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:03.180]   have that Ivy League background in finance or whatever, they want to see that you're
[01:05:03.180 --> 01:05:07.260]   passionate about the job that you're applying for. Like, "Hey, you know what? I don't have
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:13.860]   much finance experience, but I spend three hours a day analyzing balance sheets of companies.
[01:05:13.860 --> 01:05:19.060]   And I watch Fast Money every day on CNBC. And I talk to my friends about finance all
[01:05:19.060 --> 01:05:24.760]   the time. And I've read these 20 books. And here are the lessons that I learned." People
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.340]   respond to that.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:33.380]   Yeah, absolutely. I liked how you said, as far as getting a job, I think the key to getting
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:39.780]   a job is where you say, "Go and prepare a research report on an investment idea and
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:43.820]   go show it to people." That's very much, I think that works in every industry. Don't
[01:05:43.820 --> 01:05:50.340]   go and don't play this ridiculous game of, "I'm going to answer a job application and
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:55.100]   send in a cover letter and a resume." Maybe it works for some people, but it seems like
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:06:01.400]   a really inefficient way for me. In my mind, I would say, "Go do something and be remarkable
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:06.340]   in some aspect, and then go tell people and show people and try to help people." I'd rather
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:09.700]   go somewhere and say, "Hey, I'd like to work for you guys. I'll work for free for three
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:13.420]   weeks or for a month, show you what I can do, and then you can decide about hiring me
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.980]   then." I mean, it's just a different mindset.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:20.220]   Yeah. Well, the other thing about writing the research report, that piece of advice
[01:06:20.220 --> 01:06:24.220]   came from a very successful hedge fund manager, by the way. When he was asked, "What's the
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.860]   best way for somebody to get a job at your firm?" That's the advice that he gave. So
[01:06:26.860 --> 01:06:28.540]   that's not just coming from me, but from other people.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.540]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:34.580]   But the other thing is you can use that research report to network. If you're a smart person
[01:06:34.580 --> 01:06:37.500]   and you have a good investment idea, everyone wants to read about it and learn about it
[01:06:37.500 --> 01:06:41.100]   because they are all looking for the best investment idea. So you can just call up people
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:45.860]   and be like, "Hey, I wanted to get your advice on this investment idea I have. Would you
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:48.700]   give me your opinion on it? Could you give me some advice on how I could make it better?"
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:52.140]   or whatever. It's kind of like that backdoor networking where you're like, "Yeah, you're
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:59.780]   not asking for a job, but now you've started a relationship with that person. If you show
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:04.100]   it to three people, you now have a much better research report, and then maybe they can introduce
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.300]   you to somebody who they know is hiring." Because you're right, blindly sending resumes
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:13.900]   isn't going to get you very far. But if you have now this network of intellectual, analytical
[01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:18.220]   investment types, they're going to try to help you out if you're a friendly person and
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.220]   smart and you work hard. And they might know of a job, and they'll be like, "Hey, go interview
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.860]   with this person." Now you get a referral, which is way better than a cold anything.
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:32.100]   Absolutely. 100%. I'd like to wrap up with just a little bit of information on the process
[01:07:32.100 --> 01:07:36.020]   of becoming a chartered financial analyst. I think you're the first CFA charter I've
[01:07:36.020 --> 01:07:41.100]   had on the show. I can't remember having another one. I do not hold the CFA charter. I'm interested
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.100]   in it, but it's probably...
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:45.740]   You've sold everything else, though. You've got a billion letters after that, which is
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:49.100]   very impressive on its own.
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:57.380]   Right. I'm sure I could do the CFA. It's just simply not as much of an area of interest
[01:07:57.380 --> 01:08:00.700]   for me because it's so analytical on the investment side.
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:03.060]   Yeah, you've got to be interested in it.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:08.740]   Right. It's a beast. Explain to people, if you see the letters CFA after somebody's name,
[01:08:08.740 --> 01:08:11.380]   what does that mean and why should that count?
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:18.260]   Okay. There's a few different designations. CFA is the gold standard for investment analysis.
[01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:21.660]   If you want to work at a hedge fund or private equity shop, you want to get a job on Wall
[01:08:21.660 --> 01:08:28.780]   Street, CFA, nothing beats it. CFP is terrific if you want to be a financial advisor, more
[01:08:28.780 --> 01:08:34.500]   of a consultant, you're working with clients. CFP is the best designation for that.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:41.740]   The CFA is three tests. Each one has probably a 40% pass rate. They're offered in general
[01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:46.660]   once a year. The first level is offered two times a year. If you fail a test, you have
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:50.980]   to wait a whole year to take it again, which is just awful. I passed level one and level
[01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:56.460]   three on the first try. I did not pass level two on the first try because it's very difficult.
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:00.380]   I decided to take it right after... I took level one in December and just tried to take
[01:09:00.380 --> 01:09:05.820]   level two in June. Not a good idea. Not a good idea because level two is by far the
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:11.500]   hardest. People think they can pass level one, level two, and level three will be no
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.540]   problem. Level two is just ridiculous. I knew one guy who studied for the CFA for eight
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:20.780]   years and finally got it. Other people study for six years and they just give up. This
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:27.140]   is not an easy test. You have to study probably six months before the exam to really have
[01:09:27.140 --> 01:09:31.380]   a good shot at passing it. I think you have to study at least 300 hours. I think one of
[01:09:31.380 --> 01:09:38.380]   the... is the general guideline. I don't know what you want to know about it, but it's the
[01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:41.780]   real deal. When somebody sees a CFA, it's just instant respect.
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.780]   Right. Absolutely.
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:45.660]   If you're looking for a job and you don't have a finance background, get the CFA, which
[01:09:45.660 --> 01:09:50.500]   could take you... which will take you a few years. If that's your purpose in life, get
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:54.860]   the CFA because that'll... people look at that and they're like, "Wow."
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:10:01.100]   I would like to point it out as a personal finance lesson and then just as an opportunity
[01:10:01.100 --> 01:10:07.940]   that most people don't think about. I think that these opportunities exist in almost every
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:14.140]   industry to do something like this. For example, I apply this thinking in terms of college.
[01:10:14.140 --> 01:10:18.900]   Many people are very focused on saying, "How do I go to college? How do I figure out how
[01:10:18.900 --> 01:10:24.540]   to do that? How to pay for it? How can I get the most prestigious college degree?" But
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:30.940]   if you are working in the finance space, I think it probably does matter to some degree
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:37.700]   whether or not you're... if you're trying to go straight to Wall Street and you can
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:43.220]   come from an Ivy League and you have a master... an MBA from Harvard or you have an undergrad
[01:10:43.220 --> 01:10:46.300]   from an Ivy League, that may matter a little bit.
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:47.460]   It definitely does matter.
[01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:51.980]   Until you get in the door and find out if you're good. But you started in Boca Raton
[01:10:51.980 --> 01:10:56.540]   and there's always a way to skin this cat. If I were 16 years old and I knew I wanted
[01:10:56.540 --> 01:11:01.700]   to work in finance and I didn't have the money to go to Ivy League, I would consider just
[01:11:01.700 --> 01:11:07.140]   simply punching the certification on the college. Go get the CFA and get your foot in the door.
[01:11:07.140 --> 01:11:11.140]   You can get your foot in the door there. CFA prep would be what? Five grand for the cost
[01:11:11.140 --> 01:11:14.100]   of the test and all the fees and everything? Do you have any idea?
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:18.940]   Yeah. Well, the first level is a lot cheaper than that. Some people go to MBA school and
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:27.620]   spend $100,000 or whatever. You can get the CFA all in, maybe five grand. And you study
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:33.580]   on your own time and you can still work while you're getting it so you can have an income.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:37.540]   If you're hardcore about finance and you're debating between an MBA and a CFA, CFA blows
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.540]   it out of the water.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:43.060]   Absolutely. And you got the... exactly. That was exactly my point. You got the difference
[01:11:43.060 --> 01:11:48.580]   between I'm going to borrow $80,000 and get an MBA or I'm going to spend $5,000 and get
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:55.260]   a CFA. Now, for those who know, the CFA is one of those things that say, "Wow, okay,
[01:11:55.260 --> 01:11:59.900]   that's a whole lot harder than an MBA." You can skate through an MBA without a lot of
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:06.900]   rigor if you're gifted academically. But you can't skate through the CFA. The test is designed
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:12.620]   to illustrate your knowledge or your ignorance. And every one of us who has been around in
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:18.460]   the finance business and who knows what all this stuff actually means, you are 100% right.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:23.740]   The CFA, I have a tremendous amount of respect for people who have finished that program.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:29.020]   And there's a way where you can knock $70,000 off the bill of an MBA just by taking $5,000
[01:12:29.020 --> 01:12:35.020]   and going the CFA route. Now, it doesn't negate the value of, perhaps, the potential value
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:42.260]   of an Ivy League MBA or an Ivy League undergraduate degree. But if I didn't have the money, if
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:47.380]   I didn't have the background, if I couldn't do that with a scholarship system, I would
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:54.900]   pursue the CFA route and allow myself to demonstrate capability and work ethic, rather than saying,
[01:12:54.900 --> 01:12:59.980]   "I've just got to go and borrow $100,000 so that I might be able to go and get this job
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:00.980]   on Wall Street."
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:06.260]   Yeah. Well, let me address that Ivy League issue. Some people think, "Oh, I could never
[01:13:06.260 --> 01:13:10.660]   afford it." But a lot of these Ivy League schools, if you are dirt poor, you can go
[01:13:10.660 --> 01:13:19.500]   to an Ivy League school for very little money. Because a lot of the Ivy Leagues, they want
[01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:24.620]   a well-rounded population and they don't want somebody who can't afford it. They're not
[01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:28.900]   going to reject somebody just because they can't afford it. They have lots of grants.
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:32.100]   If you're dirt poor but you are qualified to go to an Ivy League school, you can go
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:38.820]   there for really, really cheap. Which isn't true for, necessarily, middle-tier schools.
[01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:44.260]   But for the top schools, they want the best people no matter what. So you can go to these
[01:13:44.260 --> 01:13:53.060]   schools for really, really cheap if your parents are poor, or you're poor, or whatever. So
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:56.660]   don't let that discourage people. If you want to go to an Ivy League school and you can't
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:59.900]   afford it, well, guess what? You can't afford it. They'll make it happen for you.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:05.780]   Right. I think culturally, we just don't bother to apply. And this kind of happens a lot of
[01:14:05.780 --> 01:14:11.900]   times. I remember years ago, I heard Zig Ziglar give an account he made of, he did an experiment
[01:14:11.900 --> 01:14:17.900]   where he made two newspaper job offers and the syntax of the newspaper ad for the classified
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:23.220]   section was the same. Except he did it in one major market and he offered $30,000 a
[01:14:23.220 --> 01:14:28.500]   year. And he did it in another major market and he offered $100,000 a year. And he got
[01:14:28.500 --> 01:14:34.500]   a massively smaller percentage of applicants to the $30,000. But the listed necessary qualifications,
[01:14:34.500 --> 01:14:38.940]   excuse me, he had a massively smaller number for the higher paying job, but the listed
[01:14:38.940 --> 01:14:44.700]   qualifications and requirements were very different. And it's remarkable because so
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:50.580]   many people just simply wouldn't see themselves as Ivy League material. Whereas, what's the
[01:14:50.580 --> 01:14:58.580]   harm of applying? Just apply and if you have some skill or some desire, things can be worked
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   out. I think it's a good point you make.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:09.180]   Well, that's something I address in my book, the limiting beliefs. So one of my favorite
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:12.780]   quotes in the book is, "Whether you think you can or whether you think you can't, you're
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:19.100]   right." It's a famous quote from Henry Ford back in the day. And so if you think that,
[01:15:19.100 --> 01:15:23.420]   you know, "I could never get an Ivy League school," or "I could never get a job in finance,"
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:28.540]   or "Oh, I'm not smart enough for this." You're right. You're simply right. You're not. But
[01:15:28.540 --> 01:15:32.820]   if you think, "You know what? I do have the potential for this. I can become a Wall Street
[01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:37.180]   billionaire. I really can. I do have the potential. Even though I have limitations, I can figure
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:43.220]   it out." Well, then you're right about that too. So really think about what you want and
[01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:46.020]   then believe that you can do it and then be willing to work hard to get it. But if you
[01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:50.900]   think right from the start that, "Oh, I can't do that," no matter what it is, you're right.
[01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.980]   You probably can't. But everyone has the potential to do whatever they want, especially in today's
[01:15:53.980 --> 01:15:54.980]   economy.
[01:15:54.980 --> 01:16:01.140]   >> An excellent reminder. Because no matter how--I think all of us, no matter how much
[01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:08.340]   we--no matter how much we think, you know, I recognized a few weeks ago just even that
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:14.460]   in my own thinking. I was up in Pennsylvania and I thought about calling John Bogle for
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.420]   an interview because I've read several of his books and I thought, "No, he wouldn't
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:22.420]   talk to me. I just have this show." And I had to--and I caught myself thinking that
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:26.540]   like, "I haven't interviewed enough famous people yet to really have the platform, you
[01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:32.380]   know, to call him for an interview." And I was pretty ashamed of myself because there's
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:35.820]   no reason why I can't call him for an interview. There's no reason why I couldn't have popped
[01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:39.900]   in, you know, and said, "Hey, I'd like to--I brought my voice recorder. I'd love to talk
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:44.540]   to Mr. Bogle if he's available and I'd love to talk with him." But I had the limiting
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:49.300]   beliefs and it was--I was pretty embarrassed to find myself thinking that way. I wound
[01:16:49.300 --> 01:16:50.300]   up deciding not to do it.
[01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.300]   >> It happens to everybody.
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:53.900]   >> It happens to everybody. It's all of us. And no matter how much we think we're immune
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:55.380]   to it, we're really not.
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:56.820]   >> Yeah, absolutely.
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:02.660]   >> So, well, Joey, thank you so much. I think this provides a really interesting insight
[01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:08.300]   into people's--into the world of finance. And I'd encourage people, don't forget, I
[01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:12.140]   mean, the latter half here, we haven't been talking about the book, but go over to Joey's
[01:17:12.140 --> 01:17:15.220]   site, Pirates of Financial Freedom. You've got the first chapter on there for free, right?
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.980]   And then the first half for 99 cents, you said? Or--
[01:17:17.980 --> 01:17:20.700]   >> I've got three sample pages on the site.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:21.700]   >> Okay.
[01:17:21.700 --> 01:17:24.900]   >> And then you can get the first half for 99 cents on Amazon if you just want to kind
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:25.900]   of preview it.
[01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.780]   >> Yeah. Do the first half for 99 cents and read that. And then check it out, consider
[01:17:29.780 --> 01:17:37.660]   it for your Christmas gift list. And I think it'd be a valuable work. And keep writing,
[01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:42.660]   Joey. We need more and more in this genre. So since you've created it, you now have the
[01:17:42.660 --> 01:17:45.020]   opportunity to be the master of it.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.340]   >> Absolutely. Well, I'll do my best.
[01:17:47.340 --> 01:17:52.380]   Anything else that you'd like to share? Or anything I missed?
[01:17:52.380 --> 01:17:56.180]   >> I just want to say you did a great job on this interview. I had a real good time.
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:59.900]   And you keep up your good work, too, because I'm going to be--I'm going to check in with
[01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:02.620]   you every now and then and see if you've got that Bogle interview.
[01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:03.620]   >> Absolutely.
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:07.260]   >> That needs to be your goal. Within the next two years, I want to have you interview
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:09.940]   him and I'll cheer when you do.
[01:18:09.940 --> 01:18:15.220]   >> Absolutely. That would be wonderful. I've got--the biggest challenge that I'm facing
[01:18:15.220 --> 01:18:19.700]   right now is just the amount of time needed to do some of the things. I mean, I'm here
[01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:27.260]   in Palm Beach and season is coming. And every big wig of finance--every big wig of--many,
[01:18:27.260 --> 01:18:31.740]   many big wigs of finance are here and will be here during season. So I've got a unique
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:38.820]   opportunity that if I can get the introductions, I can go and visit with people here during
[01:18:38.820 --> 01:18:44.140]   the Palm Beach season. But I've got to build it into the time. And I just am feeling so
[01:18:44.140 --> 01:18:47.940]   stretched with all the different things that I've got going on. I've got to build in the
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:52.660]   time to make the connections through the contacts that I do have, to get the referral, to get
[01:18:52.660 --> 01:18:56.820]   the introduction, to get the appointment, to get the interview, and then go in and bring
[01:18:56.820 --> 01:19:01.540]   the interviews to the show. But the urgent and the important are often--are sometimes
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:08.220]   at war. And oftentimes, I'm making time for the urgent and not necessarily the important
[01:19:08.220 --> 01:19:09.220]   and non-urgent.
[01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:15.420]   >> That's a common problem for everybody. Like, you know, the last chapter in my book,
[01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:19.300]   it talks about my weekly goal-setting system of setting smart goals and having an accountability
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:24.860]   partner to make sure you get the things done that you want. And then also, I've been overwhelmed
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:28.900]   with work myself, and I found that time-blocking really helps. So some of your listeners are
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:35.860]   like, you know, "I'm not getting my goals done," or "I'm just busy but not productive."
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:40.980]   You know, look into that goal-setting thing or time-blocking each day. I found that that's
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.140]   helped a lot in my own personal life.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:46.580]   >> Absolutely. Well, awesome. Joey, thank you for coming on. I really appreciate your
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:47.580]   making the time.
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.580]   >> Well, thanks for having me. This was great.
[01:19:50.580 --> 01:19:59.020]   >> I hope you enjoyed that. I know Joey's not going to want any competition, since he's
[01:19:59.020 --> 01:20:02.780]   created a monopoly in his business. But I would like to encourage some of you in the
[01:20:02.780 --> 01:20:08.700]   audience who are excellent at finance, at concepts of finance, and you know a lot, you
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.940]   understand a lot. I know many of you listen to the show because I've heard from you. And
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:19.220]   I would encourage many of you to maybe consider adding your own form of media. Perhaps you
[01:20:19.220 --> 01:20:24.620]   might be able to take my idea and write the Hardy Boys series books of business success.
[01:20:24.620 --> 01:20:31.060]   I know that we seem to be going toward a more of a—as a culture, we seem to be going in
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:36.060]   the direction of more of a video, multimedia type of context. But I really want some of
[01:20:36.060 --> 01:20:41.460]   these great books to succeed that teach business lessons, that teach life lessons. So maybe
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:45.340]   you can do that project. I don't know if I'll make time for it in the future or not. I'm
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.700]   not ready to make time for it at the moment. But maybe you can. So consider if you can
[01:20:49.700 --> 01:20:58.620]   use some art, some form of art that you have to teach people something that will be helpful.
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.960]   You probably have about enough financial blogs out there. There's enough financial books
[01:21:02.960 --> 01:21:10.520]   that are boring and dry. But maybe you can bring up and bring in some valuable new ideas
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:14.240]   and present them in a different way. If you have done projects like this, I'd love to
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:19.960]   hear from you. I'd love to profile things like this. I'd encourage you to go check out,
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.880]   read the first half of the book, see if you like it. That's a good deal. Pay a buck and
[01:21:23.880 --> 01:21:28.880]   read the first half and then maybe order a half a dozen or a dozen or so for your friends
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:33.080]   and family for Christmas. And let's use some of this new art, not new, but let's use some
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:38.480]   of these art forms to spread the message of financial independence and financial prosperity
[01:21:38.480 --> 01:21:43.040]   to more and more people. Thank you so much for listening today. I want to thank all of
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:48.960]   you who have been subscribing to the show. I want to thank you for that. That is helping.
[01:21:48.960 --> 01:21:52.600]   So please make sure if you're not subscribed to the show, if you like the kind of content
[01:21:52.600 --> 01:21:56.840]   that we had today, I'm here every day, Monday through Friday, five days a week with in-depth
[01:21:56.840 --> 01:22:01.520]   shows that hopefully are easy to listen to every day because we vary them dramatically
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:05.340]   as days go by. Make sure that you subscribe to the show. I would love to have some reviews
[01:22:05.340 --> 01:22:10.120]   on Stitcher. I still only have five reviews over there. So if any of you are listening
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:13.880]   on Stitcher, it would really, really, it would really helpful, be helpful if you would take
[01:22:13.880 --> 01:22:17.080]   a few minutes and review the show over there. That would mean a lot to me. Thank you so
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:23.160]   much. Thank you for listening. Tomorrow, I think I'll be back with a Q&A show. And then
[01:22:23.160 --> 01:22:26.720]   I got a bunch of interviews lined up next week. Still have room for some questions though.
[01:22:26.720 --> 01:22:31.080]   If you call them in this afternoon, today as the show goes out, I may be able to get
[01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.160]   them on tomorrow's show. So come on by and leave them. Thanks for listening, everybody.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   Have a great Thursday.
