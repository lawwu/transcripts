[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.720]   So, is there a general rule of thumb for how to breathe during repetitions, during work,
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.520]   for strength, maybe even strength versus hypertrophy, in a way that maximizes oxygen input to the
[00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:23.160]   system, you know, keeps you alert and conscious, but that also protects the body by creating
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.200]   some rigidity in the system, right?
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.040]   So certainly being, with all your air exhaled, the body is a very different beast in terms
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.400]   of stability than with the body full of air versus, you know, breathing during the repetition
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   movement.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.400]   There's a maneuver that has long been labeled the Valsalva technique, so what that really
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.360]   means is you're trying to use air to create intra-abdominal pressure, and what you're
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.400]   really trying to do is create a cylinder around your spine.
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.480]   The real issue you have to play here is regulation of blood pressure and spinal stability.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.040]   Now you should be able to breathe and brace.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.240]   What I mean by that is you should be able to create total intra-abdominal pressure,
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.960]   regulate spine control while breathing.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.660]   It's just very hard for a lot of people to do.
[00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.160]   It's a skill you should absolutely work on.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.360]   You can actually, you can do this and you can go around, like I do this trick in class
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.840]   and students can come and I can push any part of my entire abdomen, it's super tight and
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:20.840]   I can talk.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.000]   It's going to be a little bit labor, you can hear a little bit of a difference, but
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.420]   you should be able to do that.
[00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.440]   If you have to like hunch down and you can't even muster a breath and it takes that to
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.080]   create pressure, you're not actually, you don't really understand the abdominal control
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.960]   necessary to create that stability.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.440]   So step number one is that's the goal.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.200]   Now with the blood pressure thing, we have to be careful because a standard blood pressure
[00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.800]   ideally, if we sat around right now, it was probably something like 120 over 80 systolic
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   versus diastolic.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.640]   That's a normal number, right?
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.920]   High blood pressure is something over that.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.240]   Well, with an acute bout of exercise, you can see that number reaches high as like 450
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.120]   over 350, which effectively means you have total blood occlusion, right?
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.680]   Your blood pressure is so high, blood is not moving anywhere and so in the middle of a
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.280]   very heavy set, especially complex movements, especially when they're loaded on your body,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.520]   this could be an overhead press or squat variations, anything like that.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.640]   Blood pressure is going to be a problem.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.280]   And the reason why that matters is that's what's going to make you pass out.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.160]   It's not the fact that you ran out of oxygen in three seconds.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.080]   It's the fact that blood pressure got so high, you blacked out.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.120]   And so we're going to have to play this game of releasing a little bit of the pressure
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.280]   so we can actually get blood to move a little bit, making sure that we don't lose spinal
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.840]   stability so we can finish our workout.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.400]   That's really the question you asked, right?
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.120]   How do I play this game of, oh, I have several hundred pounds on my back or my chest and
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.760]   I don't want to exhale, right, so that I don't lose spinal stability, but at the same time,
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.480]   I don't want to pass out, right, which is a problem.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.800]   So kind of a couple of rules of thumb.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.840]   If you're going to be doing something in which you can complete the entire exercise without
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.880]   a breath and it is of a maximal or close to load, that's probably your best strategy.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.200]   So in that particular case, you'll see a lot of breathing techniques where you're going
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.160]   to take a very large inhale.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.460]   Ideally, this is done through the abdomen, not the shoulders.
[00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.600]   So we shouldn't see clavicles rising during this thing.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.660]   You'll see a common mistake of the bars on their back and you see people do this like
[00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.360]   big inhale thing and all they do is elevate their clavicles.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.520]   That's not necessarily going to increase pressure through the abdomen, which is what you're
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   looking for.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.400]   So you want to be thinking about belly moving out in all four areas, in front of you, to
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.620]   your left and right, and to your back.
[00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.200]   That's that quadrant sort of idea of stabilizing your spine.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.200]   You can do that independent of your clavicles moving.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.160]   Your shoulders don't need to rise for that.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.720]   You don't really need the oxygen for metabolic purposes.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.880]   You're just using the air for a brace.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880]   That's really all you're after.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.680]   - So you're trying to visualize your torso as more or less a cylinder.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.160]   And you're trying to fill it with air.
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:59.280]   The logic being that if I were to push down onto a, say, a full unopened can of soda water,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.000]   for all you sugar folks out there, soda water, and then push as hard as I could, it's going
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.160]   to be hard for me to crush that can.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.700]   But if the can were empty or if it were a little bit kinked in the middle, then I could
[00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:13.800]   likely crush that can.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.360]   - Yeah, what you're really doing is you have your spinal erectors in the back, right?
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.480]   And then a whole series of abdominal exercises.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.360]   And you actually have some neural control, somatic control, of contracting those.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.120]   But you don't have muscles on the inside that you can do.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.880]   So you're basically bringing in air and saying, "I'll use air to push from the inside out,
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.360]   and I'll use muscles to push from the outside in to create this brace.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.000]   And I don't want over-compression with the muscles."
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.500]   This is, if you see people that have just enormous spinal erectors, sometimes that's
[00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:48.540]   an indicator of actually a poor breathing or bracing strategy because they're using
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.220]   spinal erectors to create all their compression and not actually using the inside enough.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.900]   That's not always the case, but sort of like a thing to think about.
[00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.740]   So over-compression through the spinal erectors is not necessarily ideal.
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.380]   If you want it, the best scenario is a little bit of a brace of both.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.780]   So we use some air to push this side, we use some musculature to press that way.
[00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.120]   And then that spine is just nicely held in position.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.960]   Again, not in a position where I've locked down my diaphragm and I can't get any air
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   out.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.080]   I should be able to get that brace pattern and then be able to speak.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.400]   In fact, like I'm doing it right now.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.720]   And you'll see like a little bit of a, if you're really paying attention to my voice,
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.600]   you can hear a little bit of a subtle difference, but I should be able to do this for quite
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   a long time.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   Right?
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.800]   Like I could take a maximum rep right here in this position, whether I'm overhead pressing,
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:38.780]   doing some sort of row, like anything and feel very braced in the entire quadrant.
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.180]   This is very helpful.
[00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:46.820]   I'm going to work on it, but can we say that an effective way to start off in terms of
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:52.980]   breathing during repetitions would be to take a gulp of air during the lowering phase, the
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.860]   eccentric phase, and then to exhale during the concentric exertion phase?
[00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:02.220]   I ask that because that's what I've been doing for a while and it makes me feel safe.
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:10.520]   I don't know if I am and it allows me to exhale as I exert the hardest portion of the exercise.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.400]   And perhaps I also borrowed that from martial arts where one tends, most often is trained
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.580]   to exhale on the strike.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.780]   If you're going to be doing, again, the number of repetitions can be completed without a
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:23.780]   breath.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.180]   A lot of times you're better off saving that exhalation until you complete, but you don't
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:29.180]   have to.
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.480]   I have an unassumably heavy set of hack squats or even leg extensions and given that I already
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:39.820]   can't leg extension my body weight, maybe this is why.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:47.200]   The idea of holding my breath for an entire compound set brings to mind, you know, like
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.720]   where's my insurance card, who's going to drive me to the hospital, this kind of thing.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:56.160]   In all seriousness, what if I want to breathe during the set?
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:02.660]   So I'll clarify, I'm generally meaning if you're doing like a one rep max or something
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:03.660]   like that.
[00:07:03.660 --> 00:07:04.660]   - Okay.
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:06.060]   Well then certainly I could hold my breath for a one repetition maximum.
[00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:09.900]   - That, you know, maybe like a double or something like that, depending on what you're doing,
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.220]   like maybe a triple, a bench press, you can probably do three and get away with it.
[00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:15.860]   A squat, it gets harder, deadlift.
[00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.540]   So it kind of depends on the exercise.
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.880]   You want to take that breath though prior to the eccentric portion, not during.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:28.340]   So breathe in, lock, we're set, and now start our movement pattern wherever it's going to
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.340]   be.
[00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.740]   Exhaling on the concentric portion during it, it is fine.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:36.580]   It's no problem, especially if you're not extremely heavy.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:39.020]   - And what are your thoughts on grunting and screaming?
[00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:40.020]   - Yeah, fine.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.020]   I don't care.
[00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:42.020]   - I don't tend to do that.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:46.940]   I'm occasionally known to squeal or whimper, but I do it very quietly.
[00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:50.700]   - I think of you and I think squeal, whimper, absolutely.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.780]   If you're going to be doing multiple repetitions, what we actually do for the NFL Combine is
[00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.640]   we teach them a very specific exhale strategy.
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:01.300]   So there's one test that they do, which is they bench press 225 pounds for as many reps
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.300]   as possible.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:05.300]   A lot of these people will get 25 to 40 repetitions.
[00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.740]   So we have a very specific breathing pattern.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:10.580]   It would be something like, if we think that they're going to do around 25 reps, say that's
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:16.340]   like our goal, we might say, okay, do the first 10 without a breath and then exhale,
[00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.900]   reset and then do five breath and then you might do five breath, three breath, two breath
[00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.000]   and then one breath per rep until we can't get any more.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.920]   So we'll have very specific strategies for them.
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.980]   So what I would say is think about how many you're going to complete and then breathe
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:33.820]   according to that.
[00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.820]   And it tends to increase in frequency as the number gets closer to failure, because you're
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.300]   going to want that air a little bit, but you just want to make sure that when you're breathing
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.940]   back in, you're in a safe spot.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.480]   So you don't want to be catching that like re-breath when the weight's on you.
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:54.100]   You want to be in a locked out position or away from you when you're standing.
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:58.940]   So it tends to be like at the end of the exercise, not in the middle of it, which is going to
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:00.900]   be a recipe for problems if you take your breath then.
