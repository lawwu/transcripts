[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab guest series,
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.320]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.360]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.400]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.440]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.880]   Today's episode marks the first in a four episode series
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.920]   all about mental health.
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.200]   The expert guest for this series is Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:26.520]   Dr. Paul Conte is a medical doctor and psychiatrist
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.920]   who completed his medical training
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.040]   at Stanford University School of Medicine,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.160]   and then went on to become a chief resident of psychiatry
[00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.680]   at Harvard Medical School.
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.540]   He then went on to found the Pacific Premier Group,
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.040]   which is a collection of psychiatrists and therapists
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.880]   who are expert in treating all types
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.640]   of psychiatric disorders and life stressors.
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540]   Across the four episodes of this series on mental health,
[00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.040]   Dr. Conte teaches us about the structure of our own minds
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.340]   and how to think about our own minds
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.360]   as a way to enhance our mental health.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.360]   He explains how our subconscious mind
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.480]   and our conscious mind interact to drive our emotions,
[00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.600]   our decision-making, and our behavior.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.400]   And while any series about mental health
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.120]   requires that from time to time,
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.160]   we discuss personality disorders and psychiatric challenges,
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.280]   the main discussion in today's episode,
[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.820]   and in fact, all four episodes in this series,
[00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.040]   are about what it means to be mentally healthy
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.120]   and how to build one's mental health
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.880]   through specific practices,
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.620]   either done alone or with a therapist.
[00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.720]   Today's episode addresses several key questions
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.800]   as well as provides protocols for you to address questions
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   about your own mental health.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.680]   For instance, you will learn what constitutes
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.340]   the most mentally healthy version of yourself.
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.360]   You will learn to assess and indeed you will learn protocols
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.400]   for addressing levels of anxiety, levels of your confidence,
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.220]   how to think about your beliefs and internal narratives,
[00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.800]   how to think about your self-talk
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:48.860]   and restructure your self-talk.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860]   We discuss common challenges such as overthinking.
[00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.920]   We talk about the role of defense mechanisms
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.780]   and other aspects of the conscious
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.880]   and unconscious mind interactions that can lead us toward
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.740]   or away from the healthiest versions of ourselves.
[00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.840]   You'll notice that during the first five minutes or so
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560]   of today's discussion, Dr. Conti describes a framework
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.840]   of what he refers to as the structure of self
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.320]   and the function of self.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.280]   And he describes several pillars
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.260]   for understanding what those are.
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.200]   I'd like to highlight that while that short portion
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.160]   of our discussion does bring up a number of terms
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.600]   that are likely to be novel to you,
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.480]   they certainly were novel to me,
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.660]   that as our conversation proceeds,
[00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.320]   you will really come to appreciate just how simple
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.160]   and yet powerful that framework is.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.600]   It will help you understand, for instance,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.960]   the relationship between your conscious mind
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.040]   and your subconscious mind in ways that you can really apply
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.640]   toward enhancing your mental health.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.480]   In addition to that,
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.880]   Dr. Conti has generously provided a few PDFs
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.780]   which illustrate that framework for you
[00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.040]   and that are available completely zero cost
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.440]   by going to the links in the show note captions.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.880]   So you have the option to download those PDFs
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.960]   and to look them over either prior to or during,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.060]   or perhaps after you listen to these four podcast episodes.
[00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.800]   As a final note before beginning today's discussion,
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.280]   just want to emphasize my sentiment,
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.560]   which I'm confident will soon be your sentiment as well,
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.840]   which is that Dr. Paul Conti shares with us
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.840]   immensely powerful tools for enhancing mental health
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.880]   that at least to my knowledge
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.200]   have never been shared publicly before.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.840]   In fact, as somebody who has done
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.720]   more than three decades of therapy,
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.480]   I've never before been exposed to a conversation
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.500]   about the structure of the mind and the subconscious mind,
[00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.480]   as well as tools and protocols for enhancing mental health
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.160]   as powerful as these.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.080]   For me, the information was absolutely transformative
[00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.120]   in terms of reshaping my thought patterns,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.640]   my emotional patterns,
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.920]   and indeed several of my behavioral patterns.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:40.320]   And I'm confident that the information
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.920]   that you'll glean from today's episode
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:43.040]   and throughout the series
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.800]   will be positively transformative for you as well.
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.400]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.060]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.200]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.700]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.240]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.380]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.220]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.400]   Our first sponsor is BetterHelp.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.240]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.000]   with a licensed therapist carried out online.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.760]   I personally have been doing weekly therapy
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.320]   for more than 30 years.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.720]   And while that weekly therapy was initiated
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.200]   not by my own request,
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.160]   it was in fact a requirement for me to remain in high school
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.960]   over time, I really came to appreciate
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.320]   just how valuable doing quality therapy is.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.940]   In fact, I look at doing quality therapy
[00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.620]   much in the same way that I look at going to the gym
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.420]   or doing cardiovascular training, such as running
[00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.400]   as ways to enhance my physical health.
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.520]   I see therapy as a vital way to enhance one's mental health.
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.460]   The beauty of BetterHelp is that they make it very easy
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.160]   to find an excellent therapist.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.580]   An excellent therapist can be defined as somebody
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.160]   who is going to be very supportive of you
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.140]   in an objective way with whom you have excellent rapport
[00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.900]   with and who can help you arrive at key insights
[00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.080]   that you wouldn't have otherwise been able to find.
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.600]   And because BetterHelp therapy is conducted entirely online,
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.060]   it's extremely convenient and easy to incorporate
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.440]   into the rest of your life.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.820]   So if you're interested in BetterHelp,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.500]   go to betterhelp.com/huberman
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.560]   to get 10% off your first month.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.400]   That's BetterHelp spelled H-E-L-P.com/huberman.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.880]   Waking Up is a meditation app that offers dozens
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.660]   of guided meditation sessions, mindfulness trainings,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:24.060]   yoga nidra sessions, and more.
[00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:27.020]   By now, there's an abundance of data showing
[00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:29.820]   that even short daily meditations can greatly improve
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.380]   our mood, reduce anxiety, improve our ability to focus,
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.360]   and can improve our memory.
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.740]   And while there are many different forms of meditation,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.260]   most people find it difficult to find and stick
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:41.860]   to a meditation practice in a way
[00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:44.020]   that is most beneficial for them.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:46.040]   The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.540]   to learn how to meditate and to carry out
[00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.780]   your daily meditation practice in a way
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:53.900]   that's going to be most effective and efficient for you.
[00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.300]   It includes a variety of different types of meditations
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.480]   of different duration, as well as things like yoga nidra,
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.700]   which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.300]   that allows you to emerge feeling
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.740]   incredibly mentally refreshed.
[00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:08.400]   In fact, the science around yoga nidra is really impressive,
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.680]   showing that after a yoga nidra session,
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.020]   levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:14.740]   are enhanced by up to 60%,
[00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.600]   which places the brain and body into a state
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.560]   of enhanced readiness for mental work and for physical work.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.640]   Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:25.260]   is that it provides a 30 day introduction course.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.860]   So for those of you that have not meditated before
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.340]   or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic.
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:33.400]   Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.080]   and regular meditator, Waking Up has more advanced
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.780]   meditations and yoga nidra sessions for you as well.
[00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:40.660]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.420]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:45.900]   and access a free 30 day trial.
[00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:48.860]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.480]   And now for my discussion about how to understand
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.060]   and assess your level of mental health with Dr. Paul Conte.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.820]   Dr. Paul Conte, welcome.
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:57.940]   - Thank you.
[00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:01.220]   - I'm very excited for today's episode and for this series
[00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.620]   because I, like so many other people out there,
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.140]   have a lot of questions about myself and themselves
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.060]   and not just about ourselves,
[00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:13.600]   but how the different personality types out there,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.420]   the healthy types, the narcissists,
[00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:19.460]   all the things that we hear about these days,
[00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.760]   gaslighting, all these sorts of things,
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:23.440]   what all of that really is.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.800]   Perhaps we can dispel some of the myths that exist
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.180]   during the course of this series.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:30.940]   I'm sure we will, I'm sure you will.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.780]   - Thank you.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:34.440]   - And also raise certain important questions
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:35.740]   that we should all ask ourselves
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.980]   in terms of trying to understand who we are
[00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:39.860]   and how we can be the best versions of ourselves,
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:43.340]   how we can experience the most happiness,
[00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:45.440]   also the most richness in life,
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.240]   because of course life isn't just all about being happy.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:49.980]   So to start off this question,
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.820]   I want to raise a parallel with something I think
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.000]   for most people is more concrete, which is physical health.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.780]   While there isn't an ideal physical self
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.180]   that's been defined by the medical community,
[00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:06.900]   we know for instance that there is a range of blood pressures
[00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:08.660]   that are considered healthy.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.400]   There is a range of body mass index
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:12.780]   that's considered healthy,
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.120]   although that's a little controversial
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.100]   because it depends on how much muscle,
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.320]   how lean people are, et cetera.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:20.060]   But I think it's reasonable to say
[00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:23.520]   that the healthy individual is not going to get exhausted
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:25.400]   walking up a flight of stairs.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:27.060]   They could bend down and lift an object
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.180]   without hurting themselves.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.780]   They might even have some additional strength
[00:08:29.780 --> 00:08:31.660]   or endurance, et cetera.
[00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.380]   Within the physical health domain,
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.140]   all of that is fairly well scripted
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.560]   and there are protocols that people can follow
[00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.880]   to improve their physical health.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.380]   We've covered many of them on this podcast before.
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:45.280]   When it comes to mental health
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   and it comes to concepts of the self,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.300]   things become much more abstract for people.
[00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.980]   In fact, I think most people, including myself,
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:53.640]   are kind of wandering around in the dark,
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.160]   wondering whether or not
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:56.840]   we are the best versions of ourselves,
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.300]   whether or not we're thinking about ourselves
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.340]   and the world around us in the best ways.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:01.620]   So to start things off,
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:05.020]   you tell us what is the healthy version of self?
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:07.300]   I mean, what should we all be aspiring to?
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:10.100]   You've worked with people who presumably are healthy
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.140]   and people who have severe pathologies
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:14.880]   of different psychiatric types, right?
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:18.380]   Bipolar, narcissistic, sociopathic,
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.820]   and everything in between.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:25.960]   So for me and for the listeners, what is a healthy self?
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.660]   What should we be striving for?
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:30.340]   - Well, a healthy self approaches life
[00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:33.200]   through the lens of agency and gratitude.
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.180]   If you look at happy people,
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:37.140]   people who like their lives,
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.220]   no matter what stage of life they're at,
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:43.100]   no matter what their socioeconomic status is,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.620]   race, religion, there's so many things
[00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:48.360]   that we think matters,
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:49.760]   and they matter to a lot of things.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.360]   Do they matter to is someone happy or not?
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:55.340]   They are not factors.
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.620]   The factors that tell us, is this person enjoying life?
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.000]   Are they gonna take care of themselves?
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.540]   Are they happy they're here?
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.060]   Are they engaged productively in the world?
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.380]   Is agency and gratitude.
[00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:10.080]   And if we have those two things, then it's interesting,
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:13.420]   you almost never see someone go wrong, right?
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.260]   And even if there are difficulties,
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.940]   even if there are, if things happen in life
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.380]   that can make some unhappiness, right?
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:23.000]   It doesn't take away the person's engagement in life,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:25.020]   the person's enthusiasm for life.
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.100]   And I think if you look at even traditions of understanding,
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.060]   how are people happy?
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.780]   Whether it's in psychiatry or it's through literature
[00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:33.460]   or through a religious lens,
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.980]   it is always people who approach life
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:39.500]   through the lens of agency and gratitude.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:43.780]   - Could we go a little bit deeper on agency and gratitude?
[00:10:43.780 --> 00:10:44.860]   - Sure. - When I hear the words
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:47.860]   agency and gratitude, I think agency and ability
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.100]   to affect the world around me in the ways that I want,
[00:10:50.100 --> 00:10:52.740]   and I think gratitude, being thankful.
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.420]   And we did an entire episode all about gratitude practices,
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:10:59.580]   some of the neuroscience and neuroimaging
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:02.780]   and neurochemical changes that occur in the brain and body
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.820]   when people exert a gratitude practice.
[00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:06.980]   But I have a feeling that when you talk
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.460]   about agency and gratitude,
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:10.780]   you might be talking about something slightly
[00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:12.100]   or maybe even quite a bit different
[00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.060]   than the way that I'm defining it.
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.840]   - Yeah, I would say agency and gratitude
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.540]   are these amazing rewards, right?
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:24.380]   That sit on top of the highly complex brain function
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:28.660]   inside of us and the highly complex psychology in all of us.
[00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:31.580]   So if we think about a self, right,
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:35.660]   that I identify a self, right, I'm an I, right?
[00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.380]   If I'm gonna approach the world with agency and gratitude,
[00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.380]   that's sitting on top of a lot of healthy things, right?
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.940]   And the idea that, okay, there are ways
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.000]   in which we can be mentally unhealthy, right?
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.180]   But to start with, like, what is going on inside of us,
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:54.340]   and what does it look like when we're healthy?
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:57.220]   So there's a structure of the self, right?
[00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.840]   There's function of the self.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:01.620]   And if we look at the structure and the function
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.680]   and the parts, the components of structure and function,
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.480]   we can come to understand, okay, what is going on in us?
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:10.380]   What might we change for the better?
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:13.220]   How do we build empowerment, right?
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:18.220]   Empowerment is the ability to navigate the world around us
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.700]   and to bring myself to bear in ways that are effective.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.100]   And from empowerment arises the sense of agency, right?
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.260]   I have agency because I am empowered, right?
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:32.100]   And also from a healthy structure of self
[00:12:32.100 --> 00:12:36.100]   and function of self, we end up with humility, right?
[00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.740]   We come through that with a sense of our place in the world
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.020]   and our power in the world to navigate as we choose,
[00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.700]   but also a sense of the world around us
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:49.540]   that's far more complicated than just we are,
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.460]   extends beyond us to other people, to the climate around us,
[00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.720]   to the health of the whole planet, right?
[00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:58.740]   We feel a sense of humility that I'm here
[00:12:58.740 --> 00:12:59.920]   and I can do good things.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:01.860]   I'm fortunate to be here,
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.940]   and I'm part of this bigger ecosystem, right?
[00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:08.340]   All the way up to the scale of the ecosystem of earth, right?
[00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:10.580]   And if we feel that humility,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.340]   then we approach the world through the lens of gratitude.
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:16.360]   So the idea that a healthy structure of self
[00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:19.740]   and a healthy function of self leads to empowerment
[00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.200]   and humility, and then upon that,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.200]   we are sort of imbued with agency and gratitude,
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:32.460]   and that leads us forth to happy lives.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.380]   - Okay, so it's clear to me why having agency and gratitude
[00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:39.840]   would be wonderful, perhaps even the goal state
[00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:42.340]   that we should all be seeking to achieve.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:46.000]   And it also makes sense to me as to why empowerment
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.140]   and humility are important components
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:51.660]   that feed into our ability to have agency and gratitude.
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:52.960]   - Yes. - Right?
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.460]   Because all of that, at least to my mind,
[00:13:55.460 --> 00:14:00.460]   sums to a very clear statement about having agency
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:03.060]   and gratitude is the best way to approach life.
[00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:04.560]   That all makes perfect sense to me,
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:06.520]   and yet I've never really thought about it that way.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:09.120]   And I think most people haven't ever been told this, right?
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:10.560]   I mean, what should we be seeking?
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.100]   Agency and gratitude.
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:12.940]   - Yes.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.260]   - We've heard endless number of podcasts,
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:18.720]   including this podcast, about physical health.
[00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.920]   And we've been told by physicians and everybody else
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:25.120]   that we should seek to have a relatively low blood pressure,
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:28.760]   we should seek to have a relatively low heart rate,
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:31.440]   that our cholesterol should be at a certain level, et cetera.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.620]   So within the physical health domain,
[00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:35.600]   there are strong, clear messages
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.920]   about what we should all be striving toward.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:41.740]   And in a similar way to how we're discussing the self
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:43.900]   in psychology, I don't think anyone seeks
[00:14:43.900 --> 00:14:46.080]   to have low blood pressure or low heart rate
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.600]   because that's what they want per se.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:51.240]   They want those things along with some capacity
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:54.480]   for endurance, the ability to lift an object,
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:55.680]   so some strength, et cetera,
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:14:59.320]   because of the way that those metrics of health
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:00.840]   allow them to move through the world
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:01.680]   in the best possible way.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.640]   In other words, having some degree of endurance
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.380]   allows you to walk down the block maybe a lot further,
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.280]   or to walk up several flights of stairs,
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.480]   or to have some strength allows you to pick up objects
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.980]   and effectively move through life.
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.220]   - Right.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.380]   - You're telling us that having a sense of agency
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:20.840]   and gratitude, and that agency and gratitude
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:24.340]   are undergirded by empowerment and humility,
[00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:25.920]   and that's the best way to move through life,
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.220]   the most effective, happiest, if you will,
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.320]   way to move through life?
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.220]   Well, then I think we have to ask ourselves
[00:15:32.220 --> 00:15:34.060]   the same thing we would ask about physical fitness,
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.340]   which is what goes into creating a sense of agency
[00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.540]   and gratitude, empowerment and humility?
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:40.580]   What are the action steps?
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.860]   Because if I want more endurance,
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.220]   I know to get on an exercise bike or a treadmill,
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:47.320]   or go out for a run a few times a week or more.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.160]   If I want to get stronger,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.080]   I'm going to lift objects that are difficult to lift
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.380]   until they're easier to lift.
[00:15:52.380 --> 00:15:53.740]   I mean, it's all pretty straightforward
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.460]   in the physical domain, but in the mental health domain,
[00:15:57.460 --> 00:15:58.900]   in the psychological domain,
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:00.460]   it does become a bit more abstract,
[00:16:00.460 --> 00:16:03.300]   I think in part because no one's ever told us,
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:04.960]   certainly no one's ever told me,
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.100]   what you really need is agency and gratitude
[00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:09.620]   in order to have the best possible life.
[00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:12.700]   So I very much appreciate that you're telling us this,
[00:16:12.700 --> 00:16:15.940]   and I'd love for you to tell us what are the action steps
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.700]   that go into creating these things that we're calling
[00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.740]   agency, gratitude, empowerment and humility?
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.980]   - There's actually quite a strong parallel
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.180]   between the physical health dimension
[00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:27.860]   and the mental health dimension.
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:31.200]   So as you're saying, why do you put in the time,
[00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:34.620]   the energy, the learning to be physically healthy?
[00:16:34.620 --> 00:16:38.500]   It's a lot of effort and we put so much of ourselves
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:41.340]   towards it if we decide that we value that, right?
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:42.660]   Why do we do it, right?
[00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.940]   Because as you said, it's the best way to approach life.
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:48.180]   Like there may be some thing that I want to do.
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.860]   I wanna run a race, right?
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.180]   Or I wanna climb a mountain, right?
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.780]   But ultimately we take care of ourselves physically
[00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:57.180]   because we don't know what's coming next in life
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:00.580]   and we wanna be prepared for it good, bad and otherwise.
[00:17:00.580 --> 00:17:03.800]   And the same thing is true of mental health.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.860]   So I can feel grateful for something.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.340]   I can feel grateful that I'm still breathing right now.
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:10.140]   I can exercise agency.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.240]   I can pick up that cup and take a drink, right?
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:15.260]   But that doesn't mean that I'm living life
[00:17:15.260 --> 00:17:18.340]   through the lens of agency and gratitude,
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:20.700]   which is consistent with every opinion.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.380]   If you look psychologically through the lens of literature,
[00:17:23.380 --> 00:17:26.380]   through the lens of sociology and psychology,
[00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:30.160]   agency and gratitude make happiness, right?
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:33.100]   They're ways of approaching life.
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:36.140]   And just like physical health is undergirded
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:41.140]   by cardiovascular health, heart health, muscle strength,
[00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.300]   that there's an undergirding of agency and gratitude.
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:49.340]   And empowerment and humility are ways of describing,
[00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:54.340]   okay, what arises from understanding ourselves,
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:56.200]   taking care of ourselves,
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.820]   that then gives us the agency and gratitude.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.860]   So we have empowerment, we have humility,
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.320]   but where does it all come from, right?
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:05.920]   So just like we have to understand the physical body
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:08.600]   and what to do to it in order to be healthy, right?
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.280]   We also have to understand the mind, right?
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.840]   The self that wants to be healthier.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.340]   And that comes through understanding
[00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:17.340]   the structure of the self.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:20.520]   And we have enough science through the lens of neurobiology
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:24.380]   and psychiatry to understand the structure of self
[00:18:24.380 --> 00:18:26.460]   and then the function of self, right?
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.000]   How we work, right?
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:30.080]   How we interface with the world.
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.820]   So it's actually not more complicated than physical health.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:37.320]   It's just that we don't spell it out that way, right?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:39.560]   We come at it through the lens of pathology,
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:42.260]   of what's wrong and who has some diagnosis.
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.720]   And we're looking for the problematic
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:45.640]   instead of saying like,
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:48.360]   what do we look like when we're happy, right?
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:50.060]   And then going and digging down
[00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:52.360]   into the mechanics of it all, right?
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.820]   And if we're not in that state, right?
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:18:57.340]   To go and look at that and to make changes,
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:00.840]   just as if you were very, very physically healthy, right?
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:03.060]   But your heart rate couldn't go up that much
[00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:04.760]   without you feeling very, very fatigued.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.800]   We'd say, well, look,
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.740]   you're doing a lot of the right things, right?
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:11.440]   But let's work more on your heart, right?
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.580]   We would go look at the specifics of it
[00:19:13.580 --> 00:19:15.740]   because that's how we understand it.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:20.400]   And we just don't apply the same science, logic,
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.400]   common sense to mental health as we do to physical health.
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.200]   But it's time for that to change
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:29.160]   because we have the knowledge and ability to do just that.
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:33.400]   - When we had Dr. Andy Galpin on this podcast
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   to do a series on physical health and fitness, essentially,
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:40.720]   he said something that really stuck with me,
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:43.380]   which was that the number of different workouts
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:45.880]   that people can do out there, body weight workouts,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.480]   work with weights, with machines, you can run far,
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.600]   you can run shorter distances more quickly,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.280]   you can do planks, sit-ups,
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:57.520]   so many variations on exercise routines.
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:00.160]   But what he very clearly stated
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.900]   was that there are only a few core adaptations
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:07.160]   that the body can undergo that lead to these byproducts
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:09.800]   that we call lower blood pressure, enhanced endurance,
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.520]   improved strength, improved neuromuscular function,
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.280]   improved brain function, for that matter.
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.060]   It sounds to me like there are a lot of parallels
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:20.000]   in creating the healthy psychological self.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.520]   So what are the core components
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.880]   that I and others should think about
[00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.560]   in terms of understanding,
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.720]   can you describe them as the structure of the self
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.160]   and the functions of the self?
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.280]   Again, just to draw a parallel,
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.260]   if we were talking about physical health,
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.680]   we'd say, okay, there's connections between nerves and muscle
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.540]   that allows us to move our limbs.
[00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:38.560]   If you apply a certain amount of resistance,
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:39.600]   you get a certain adaptation,
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:41.780]   which is the neuromuscular connection gets stronger,
[00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:44.760]   the muscle might get bigger or just stronger, et cetera.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.480]   Flexibility, you know, you just push your range of motion
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.080]   just a little bit into discomfort.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.860]   You do that, it so happens to be the case
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:54.360]   that you do that for just a couple of minutes each day
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.560]   over the course of about a week or so,
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.560]   you get a significant increase in flexibility.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:59.600]   Okay, so it's all very clear in the physical domain.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.900]   In the psychological domain,
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:02.760]   I hear you telling us that the action steps
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:04.840]   that we all should be taking
[00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.320]   in order to be the happiest version of ourselves
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:10.120]   by achieving agency and gratitude
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:12.040]   is to explore the structure of self
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:13.840]   and the function of self.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:17.600]   So if you could tell us about what is the structure of self,
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.920]   like what goes into Andrew being Andrew
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:22.440]   and Paul being Paul and whoever the listener is
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.300]   and to being who they are.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.760]   What is that and what is the function of self?
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.560]   How does a psychiatrist think about that?
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.480]   How should we think about that?
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:35.100]   - Okay, if I could start maybe to set the stage for that
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.100]   by pointing out that as we go up the hierarchy of health,
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:45.720]   everything should get simpler, not more complicated.
[00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:48.000]   If you think about physical health,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.640]   there's so much complexity on the initial levels.
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:55.400]   So we think about your physical health status versus mine.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.280]   It's gonna be different.
[00:21:56.280 --> 00:21:57.720]   We're gonna have different cardiac function
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:21:59.680]   and muscle function and pulmonary function.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.900]   And if we're gonna be healthy,
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:03.140]   we could do a lot of different things, right?
[00:22:03.140 --> 00:22:04.600]   There might be a whole set of choices
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:06.100]   that would work well for you,
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.860]   different choices that would work for me,
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.060]   and we can gauge intensity, timing, frequency, right?
[00:22:11.060 --> 00:22:12.920]   It's very complicated
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.880]   when we're on the lower levels of the hierarchy.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.040]   As we get higher up,
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.600]   let's say you and I both do the right things, right?
[00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:21.460]   Then what happens?
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:23.300]   We both have endurance, right?
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.520]   We both have some strength.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.880]   We're both robust, right?
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:30.200]   Things are getting simpler because we're approaching
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.720]   the unique idiosyncrasies in all of us, right?
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.560]   And we have to look at that
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.840]   and look at that in a very specific way.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.120]   But what we're trying to get to
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:40.600]   is something that's common for all of us.
[00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:43.960]   So stamina, for example, in physical health and endurance,
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.840]   and agency and gratitude in mental health, right?
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:49.600]   So then if we go and we look
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.000]   and we look at the structure of the self
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.780]   and the function of self,
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.720]   we find that there's more complexity,
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.720]   but that it is also understandable.
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.080]   I mean, there's tremendous complexity in the body,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:02.800]   just as there's tremendous complexity in the mind,
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:06.940]   and we can understand what is the structure of self,
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:08.680]   what is the function of self,
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.740]   and we can look at that and assess that
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:13.520]   in the same way we would physical health parameters
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.500]   so that we arrive at the place we wanna be,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.040]   be it endurance or agency or gratitude.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:22.580]   So structure of self, right?
[00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:26.040]   We all have an unconscious mind, right?
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:29.980]   And we pay so little attention to this part of us
[00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:33.280]   that really is the biological supercomputer, right?
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.740]   So millions of things are going on all the time,
[00:23:36.740 --> 00:23:38.320]   like in every split second.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.740]   So for example, I can say these words, right?
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:41.580]   You can listen to the words,
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.300]   and you can say things back, and I can listen, right?
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:46.780]   There are millions and millions of things going on
[00:23:46.780 --> 00:23:48.140]   under the surface,
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:52.460]   much of which comes from either biological predispositions,
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.980]   or habits over time, right?
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.100]   Thought processes, patterns, right?
[00:23:57.100 --> 00:24:00.460]   So this unconscious mind, this supercomputer,
[00:24:00.460 --> 00:24:02.260]   is doing all of these things,
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:04.300]   like at the speed of light, right?
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.520]   There are electrical and chemical signals,
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:11.520]   and multiple pathways as complicated as superhighway systems
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.620]   that then get consolidated and communicate with others, right?
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.300]   And then what comes up from all of that
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.020]   is the conscious mind.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.340]   So imagine an iceberg, right?
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:24.420]   And it's a really, really big iceberg, right?
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:27.480]   And we see the part above the surface, right?
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.300]   That's the conscious mind, right?
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:32.460]   But there's a huge part of this iceberg,
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:36.540]   maybe 95% of it that's underneath the water, right?
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:39.540]   There's this hulking mass that we don't see.
[00:24:39.540 --> 00:24:41.380]   That's the unconscious mind, right?
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.920]   And it's feeding up to the conscious mind,
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.980]   which is a much smaller part of our brain function, right?
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.660]   But it's the part that we're aware of, right?
[00:24:50.660 --> 00:24:53.180]   It's sitting on top of all the unconscious things,
[00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:55.300]   which are extremely important,
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:57.300]   but then we become aware
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:59.420]   so that we can engage in the real world.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:01.420]   In order for us to have this conversation,
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.020]   the millions of things per second
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:05.180]   have to be going on underneath the surface
[00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:08.340]   so that you and I, as conscious eyes, right,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:11.580]   as conscious selves, can ride along on top of it.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:14.700]   So that's the part of the iceberg that's above the water.
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.460]   It's the conscious self.
[00:25:16.460 --> 00:25:19.180]   Then imagine that the conscious self
[00:25:19.180 --> 00:25:24.180]   is girded by a set of long tendrils
[00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:29.180]   that come out from under the water, right?
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:32.780]   That they're defense mechanisms that are unconscious to us
[00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:34.740]   that sort of gird the conscious mind.
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.260]   So do we rationalize automatically?
[00:25:37.260 --> 00:25:39.420]   Do we avoid automatically?
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:41.120]   Do we act out automatically?
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.460]   Are these things in us in ways
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:46.000]   that we can observe and change,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.760]   but that are there to try and protect the conscious mind
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.900]   from the slings and arrows of the world around us, right?
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.600]   So if you imagine, there's the big part of the iceberg
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.240]   under the water, the unconscious mind.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.520]   The conscious mind is riding on top of it,
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:01.480]   but the conscious mind,
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:04.240]   that part sticking out of the water is vulnerable, right?
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.960]   So imagine that there's a defensive structure
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.680]   then that arises from the part of the iceberg
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:12.400]   that's underwater that is there to defend
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:15.040]   and protect the conscious mind.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:18.280]   So when you say to defend and protect,
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.100]   when you say that the conscious mind is vulnerable,
[00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:21.940]   what do you mean?
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.840]   Do you mean that it's vulnerable to physical attack
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.440]   or that it's vulnerable to us realizing
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.100]   that we're just a bunch of neurons
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:30.560]   that are clicking away underneath?
[00:26:30.560 --> 00:26:32.600]   Like in other words, where does the vulnerability
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.320]   of the conscious mind really reside?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:36.800]   Not physically where does it reside,
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:40.840]   but what am I so worried about in terms of my safety?
[00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:44.100]   I mean, right now we're in a room, I feel pretty safe.
[00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.720]   I don't think you're gonna attack me verbally or physically.
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.760]   I suppose it's possible that could happen,
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:51.460]   but it seems like a very distant possibility.
[00:26:51.460 --> 00:26:54.140]   So when you say that these defenses are there to protect us
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:55.800]   from some sort of awareness,
[00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.460]   what awareness are we trying to avoid?
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:27:01.920]   - So the vulnerability of the conscious mind
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:05.980]   is to fear, confusion, despair, right?
[00:27:05.980 --> 00:27:08.840]   There's so many things that we can fear, right?
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:10.720]   Some people are afraid of snakes or spiders.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:12.240]   Some people are afraid of death.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.520]   Some people are afraid of health issues
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:17.000]   that could come to them or to people they love.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.600]   We can get confused and not know what decisions to make
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.300]   and how to navigate the world
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.360]   and how to be who we want to be to ourselves and to others.
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:27.700]   We can feel tremendously vulnerable and despairing
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.400]   if we lose others or we start to see things happening
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.500]   in the world around us that we don't like, right?
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.820]   We start to feel like what will happen
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:37.400]   to the planet we live on?
[00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:39.360]   Will there be war where I live?
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.980]   Will my children be safe, right?
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:44.540]   There's so much that we need to protect ourselves against.
[00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:48.700]   So that vulnerable part of us, right,
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.500]   the part of the iceberg sticking out above the water
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:54.260]   needs a defensive structure around it
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.380]   to protect it against the vulnerability
[00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.640]   of fear, confusion, despair, right?
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:03.140]   And because the conscious mind is sticking out of the water
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.720]   with a defensive structure around it, right,
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:08.600]   it is the raw material
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.560]   from which we create our character structure.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:13.880]   So the character structure is all of that,
[00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.480]   the part under the water, the part above the water,
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.760]   the defensive structure.
[00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:20.800]   So imagine like a nest around all of that
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:24.040]   and that's the character structure that we utilize
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:26.640]   to interface with the world, right?
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:28.400]   So the character structure is,
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.200]   it's like the thing that I'm using, right?
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.440]   It's like if you're driving somewhere in a car, right,
[00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:35.200]   the car is the thing that you're using to go there, right?
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:37.660]   The character structure is the thing that we're using
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:39.280]   to interface with the world.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.980]   So for example, how trusting am I versus suspicious, right?
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:47.940]   How readily do I come to make friends with people, right?
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:52.060]   How much do I act out if I'm frustrated, right?
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:56.040]   How much do I, you know, exclaim something negative, right,
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:57.920]   as opposed to holding it inside of me?
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.300]   How much do I rationalize if something isn't going well?
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:03.540]   Do I wanna look at it and maybe see that it is
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.320]   so that I don't have to face it, right?
[00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:08.920]   How much do I avoid problems in the world around me?
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.340]   How much do I exercise altruism, right?
[00:29:11.340 --> 00:29:14.440]   These are all the ways in which we're engaging
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.060]   with the world around us and this determines the self.
[00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:21.580]   Imagine that the self then grows out of this nest
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.500]   from the character structure that we use
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:27.480]   to interface with the world and the decisions that we make.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   So if our character structure is the thing
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.480]   through which we engage with the world,
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:37.460]   then we're enacting what is inside of us,
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.660]   what we've determined through our unconscious mind,
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:41.560]   our conscious mind, our defense mechanism,
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.500]   there's a certain us that comes at the world
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.380]   in a certain way and if we're more or less trusting,
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.780]   more or less avoidant, we rationalize more or less,
[00:29:50.780 --> 00:29:53.100]   these are the factors that determine,
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.380]   like where do our lives go, right?
[00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:57.120]   Because on top of all of this,
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:59.540]   imagine that the nest of the character structure
[00:29:59.540 --> 00:30:03.140]   around all of this grows from the self, right?
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.660]   The product of the feelings inside,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:07.180]   the things that we know about ourselves
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:08.660]   and don't know about ourselves,
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:11.180]   the decisions that all of it leads to.
[00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:14.400]   So I may choose to be, for example, more trusting
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   and that may bring an opportunity to me
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.660]   that I wouldn't have otherwise had, right?
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:20.740]   I may choose to be more trusting
[00:30:20.740 --> 00:30:22.600]   and it may bring risk to me
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.480]   that I wouldn't otherwise have had.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.940]   So we wanna be as healthy as we can,
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:30.420]   as knowledgeable of ourselves and the world around us
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.540]   so that it's safe for us to have a healthy
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:36.300]   character structure through which we can engage
[00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:39.540]   in the world around us with a sense of prudence, right?
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:41.580]   Taking reasonable risks, right?
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:44.020]   Not too little so that we shut ourselves down
[00:30:44.020 --> 00:30:45.780]   and maybe end up despairing.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:48.980]   Not so much that scary things can happen to us
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.700]   and we end up fearful, right?
[00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:54.100]   But the idea that if we know ourselves well,
[00:30:54.100 --> 00:30:57.220]   the character structure is healthy, right?
[00:30:57.220 --> 00:30:59.660]   Because it's built upon a structure of self
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:01.580]   and a function of self that are healthy
[00:31:01.580 --> 00:31:04.440]   and out of it is coming empowerment, right?
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.380]   And empowerment and humility, right?
[00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:09.400]   That then lead us to agency and gratitude, right?
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.180]   The idea here is that this is the character structure
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:16.660]   that we create that can then interface with the world
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:20.140]   in a way that's good for us and good for the world around us
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.340]   that leads us to be able to live in much more harmony
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.500]   inside of ourselves and outside of ourselves.
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:29.220]   - So if I understand correctly, defense mechanisms
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:32.520]   that grow up out of this portion of the iceberg
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:35.460]   that we're calling the unconscious mind,
[00:31:35.460 --> 00:31:40.380]   they protect our conscious self in ways that can be adaptive
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:42.140]   or that can be maladaptive.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:43.960]   In other words, defenses can be healthy
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:46.100]   or they can be unhealthy.
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:48.700]   And perhaps in a few minutes we can get into
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:52.060]   what a healthy versus an unhealthy defense looks like.
[00:31:52.060 --> 00:31:55.180]   But the way you described character structure
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:32:00.180]   sounds to me like an array of contextual dispositions.
[00:32:00.180 --> 00:32:04.960]   I don't want to add unnecessarily complex language,
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:07.480]   but it sounds to me like a bunch of dispositions.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:10.820]   Like if I'm walking into the office where I know everybody
[00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:13.320]   and I see familiar faces, there's no reason for me
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:16.360]   to be on guard if I trust those people.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:19.300]   But if I'm walking down a street at night
[00:32:19.300 --> 00:32:21.860]   that I'm not familiar with and I'm starting to get the sense
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:23.820]   that this neighborhood might not be the best,
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.100]   it makes sense for me to be on relatively high alert.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.300]   So different dispositions
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:30.140]   depending on different conditions.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:33.500]   I can't help but mention my bulldog Costello
[00:32:33.500 --> 00:32:36.140]   who had basically three dispositions.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:38.620]   He was asleep, but in all seriousness,
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:42.260]   the second one was kind of bored,
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:43.660]   the bulldog faces kind of bored,
[00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:46.580]   or if something was given to him that he liked
[00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:48.460]   or if we were doing something that he liked, delight.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:51.260]   He basically had three dispositions as far as I could tell.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.420]   I think one of the reasons we like dogs so much
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.780]   or that many of us like dogs so much
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:58.820]   is that their decisions are very predictable.
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:00.200]   Take him to the park, he's happy
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:03.100]   unless he happened to be ill that day, which was rare.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:04.820]   Feed him, he's happy.
[00:33:04.820 --> 00:33:08.100]   There wasn't a lot of, I don't like this particular meal
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:09.720]   or I don't like this particular park
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:12.560]   or this Bijon Frise doesn't smell so good to me.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:17.020]   It was so simple and yet people are very complex.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:19.560]   I can look at myself and say,
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:21.260]   okay, what is my character structure?
[00:33:21.260 --> 00:33:23.220]   Character structure is certain things I like,
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.320]   certain things I dislike, certain things really irritate me.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.540]   Certain environments and people I just delight in.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:32.540]   Okay, so is the definition of a healthy character structure
[00:33:32.540 --> 00:33:37.540]   one in which the dispositions match the context perfectly?
[00:33:37.540 --> 00:33:40.740]   I mean, I don't know how any of us could be like that,
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.520]   but is that sort of the ideal much in the same way
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   that we could probably arrive at an ideal degree of stamina
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.940]   that one could have?
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:55.500]   Some people run ultra marathons, 100 miles or more.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.600]   Some people want to run a marathon.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:58.780]   Some people don't really desire to run a marathon,
[00:33:58.780 --> 00:34:01.300]   but I want to be able to run a mile if I need to
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:03.580]   without being completely exhausted and injured.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:07.780]   So when we ask ourselves about character structure,
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:11.600]   are we asking ourselves about context-driven dispositions?
[00:34:11.600 --> 00:34:14.740]   And how do we start to evaluate that for ourselves?
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.740]   - I think because we're more complicated,
[00:34:16.740 --> 00:34:18.300]   I think it's not dispositions
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:20.940]   as much as it's predispositions, right?
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.580]   So in the example that you gave,
[00:34:23.580 --> 00:34:25.460]   you have a certain predisposition
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:28.500]   to be either trusting or wary, right?
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.460]   And that's healthy in you, right?
[00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.160]   So when you come into a setting
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:37.500]   where there's not a good reason to feel mistrustful,
[00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.900]   to feel anxious, to feel vulnerable, right?
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:41.580]   Then you feel at ease, right?
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:42.820]   So you walk into the work setting,
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.660]   there are people you know, there are people you like,
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:46.200]   everything is okay, right?
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:48.780]   You have a different predisposition
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.460]   when the context is different, right?
[00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.300]   So if the context could bring a lack of safety,
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:56.980]   then you respond accordingly with a lack of safety, right?
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.460]   But it's possible certainly those predispositions
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:02.300]   can be in unhealthy places, right?
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:04.020]   So for example,
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.980]   you might have been traumatized in a certain way,
[00:35:06.980 --> 00:35:09.260]   or you might approach the world in a certain way
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:10.900]   because of prior experience
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:13.540]   that you may not register as trauma,
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:15.180]   but it may be that within you
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:17.600]   is a predisposition to be mistrustful.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:20.260]   So you could walk into a room of people that you know,
[00:35:20.260 --> 00:35:22.300]   of people who've never met you any harm
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:24.680]   and still feel unsafe, right?
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:27.720]   Now this happens most often after trauma,
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:30.440]   but there are other ways people can get to that
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:32.700]   where the predisposition isn't so healthy.
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:34.780]   The converse is true too, right?
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.020]   There are people who can have
[00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:38.260]   too much of what's called an omnipotence defense,
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:39.940]   and then they don't recognize danger
[00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.580]   when danger is around them.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:43.660]   So the idea, the character structure,
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.260]   that nest, right,
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.260]   that's built around the defensive structure
[00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:49.340]   and the conscious mind that's sitting on top
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:50.620]   of the part of the iceberg,
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.860]   the unconscious mind underwater, right?
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:57.180]   It's that nest that is interfacing with the world
[00:35:57.180 --> 00:36:00.860]   through a whole set of predispositions.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:01.940]   I'd like to take a brief break
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:04.620]   and acknowledge one of our sponsors, AG1.
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.020]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:09.600]   that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:12.620]   I started taking AG1 way back in 2012,
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:14.800]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.540]   The reason I started taking AG1
[00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:18.460]   and the reason I still take AG1 once
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:20.280]   or generally twice per day
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:22.260]   is that it's the easiest way for me to ensure
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:24.260]   that I'm getting all of the vitamins, minerals,
[00:36:24.260 --> 00:36:27.020]   probiotics, and fiber that I need in my diet.
[00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:28.080]   Now, of course, it's essential
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.400]   to get proper nutrition from whole foods,
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:31.900]   but most people, including myself,
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.900]   find it hard to get enough servings
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:35.420]   of fruits and vegetables each day,
[00:36:35.420 --> 00:36:38.540]   and especially to get enough prebiotics and probiotics
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:39.980]   to ensure gut health.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.820]   As you may know,
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:43.660]   your gut contains trillions of little microbiota,
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:45.440]   the so-called gut microbiome,
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.400]   which establishes critical connections
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:50.340]   with other organs of your body to enhance brain health,
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:52.100]   as well as to support your immune system
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:55.060]   and other aspects that relate to mental and physical health.
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:56.960]   One of the most common questions I get
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:59.280]   is if you were to take just one supplement,
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.520]   which supplement would that be?
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.740]   And my answer is always AG1,
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:04.560]   because by taking AG1,
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:06.740]   I'm able to ensure that I'm getting all of the vitamins,
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:09.000]   minerals, and probiotics that I need
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.220]   to enhance my mental health,
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:11.720]   physical health, and performance.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.360]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:17.500]   go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a special offer.
[00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.140]   They'll give you five free travel packs,

[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.660]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:27.540]   to claim this special offer.
[00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:31.020]   I think most of us are familiar with assessing
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:34.900]   and assigning names to the character structures of others.
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:35.940]   And at least for most of us,
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:38.700]   we do that with no professional training or authority, right?
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.900]   We say, that person is great.
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:42.620]   They're super nice.
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:44.080]   Person's a jerk.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:47.420]   They're like weird, you know, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:50.700]   I think very few of us are familiar
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:52.840]   with assessing our own character structure.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:53.680]   - Right, right.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:55.980]   - And I have to presume that some of what happens
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:58.700]   when somebody comes to you as a psychiatrist
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.660]   or to a psychologist is that certain questions are asked
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:03.540]   and certain narratives are told
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:06.060]   that start to reveal to the clinician
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.440]   the character structure.
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.360]   And perhaps from there,
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.400]   some of the possible defense mechanisms
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:14.640]   and structure of the person's unconscious mind
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.940]   and conscious mind that obviously are unaware to them,
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.700]   but would be clear to the clinician.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:22.080]   Much in the same way that if somebody goes into the doctor
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:24.140]   and says, you know, I don't feel well,
[00:38:24.140 --> 00:38:25.720]   they're going to start probing with questions.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.120]   Are they going to listen to their breathing,
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:29.960]   listen to their heart, right?
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.060]   - Right, get out the stethoscope and figure it out.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:32.900]   - These are the pros,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.420]   whereas the psychiatrist or psychologist uses words
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:36.720]   and language to probe.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:37.560]   - Yes.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:40.240]   - So what are the sorts of aspects
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.800]   of character structure that we can be aware of in ourselves?
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:47.340]   You know, I mean, in other words,
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:51.320]   should we be asking what type of character do I have
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.700]   depending on one circumstance or another?
[00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.540]   Should we ask ourselves what sorts of defenses we have?
[00:38:57.540 --> 00:38:59.440]   And maybe this would be a good opportunity
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:02.720]   to address this issue of what are healthy
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:05.080]   versus unhealthy defenses?
[00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:07.240]   Because it sounds to me, if I understand correctly,
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.200]   that the defense mechanisms are a very strong component
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:12.580]   in determining what our character structure is.
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:13.520]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:16.700]   Right, because the defense mechanisms are unconscious, right?
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.560]   The character structure that nest around the defenses
[00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:22.280]   in the conscious mind through which we interface
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:24.880]   with the world is very, very complicated.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.720]   So there is many character structures
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:28.560]   as there are human beings, right?
[00:39:28.560 --> 00:39:30.060]   So it's very, very complicated,
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:33.960]   but there are factors that are consistently relevant
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:36.920]   across people and get identified as such.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.600]   So one example would be isolation versus affiliation, right?
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:44.640]   So does a person tend to group with others, right?
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.840]   Or does the person tend to avoid grouping, right,
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:52.440]   and go about thoughts, tasks, approaches to life
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:55.200]   in a more singular manner, right?
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.240]   So it's just one element.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:39:58.280]   I'm making value judgment about it
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.200]   'cause it can be good or bad
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:01.900]   on either end of the spectrum, right?
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:03.400]   So we're just saying, what are the factors?
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   So am I more affiliative or do I tend to isolate
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.360]   and be more singular?
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.680]   That's just one example, right?
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:11.320]   Another example could be things like,
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:13.680]   for example, use of humor, right?
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:16.120]   Does a person use humor and in what way, right?
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:18.000]   Does a person use humor
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.460]   to deflect discomfort in negative situations?
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.500]   Does a person use humor in order to be little others
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.120]   or to be little themselves?
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:28.120]   Or does a person not use humor, right?
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:30.400]   So there are these aspects of character structure
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:33.380]   and so much research has been done on this over the years
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.240]   to determine what is most salient, right?
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.220]   In this thing that we use
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:42.280]   in order to interface with the world around us
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.040]   out of which grows our self.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.100]   - That makes good sense.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.040]   And it makes me want to revise a little bit
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.940]   what I asked about before,
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:54.480]   which is I said that when it comes to an exam
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:56.840]   of physical health, measure blood pressure,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.960]   measure breathing, et cetera,
[00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:02.880]   maybe even a blood test, look at some biomarkers.
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.040]   But what you're describing is a little bit more analogous
[00:41:06.040 --> 00:41:09.340]   to the physician addressing a patient
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:11.760]   who's having some physical discomfort or malaise
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.800]   and saying, "Tell me about your day.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:16.040]   What do you do when you get up in the morning?"
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.160]   If the person says, "Well, I drink a quarter pint of vodka."
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:21.400]   It's a very different answer
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.840]   than I go outside and get sunlight in my eyes,
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.640]   drink a glass of water and maybe have a cup of coffee, right?
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:30.240]   Or if somebody says, "I have six espresso."
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.480]   If I understand correctly,
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.620]   the character structure is better revealed
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.800]   by exploring the action states
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.060]   that somebody engages in. - It comes to life.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.200]   - Isolation versus engagement,
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:44.400]   as opposed to a read of one specific biomarker.
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:48.520]   - Yes, it's character structure brought to life, right?
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:49.360]   Yes.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:53.360]   - Immediately, I'm thinking about movies and books
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:56.400]   where we learn so much about somebody
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:42:00.220]   through observing the way that they interact with people
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:02.760]   in very, very potent ways.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:05.440]   So for instance, I can think of countless movies
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:09.080]   where you learn a ton about somebody in the first scene
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.940]   simply because of the way they react to somebody
[00:42:10.940 --> 00:42:13.540]   who cuts them off in traffic.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:14.660]   They just explode.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.080]   Okay, well then we think of that person as reactive
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:18.200]   from that point on,
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.000]   unless there's a significant amount of material
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:21.260]   to revise that.
[00:42:21.260 --> 00:42:24.480]   But it's in the action of getting explosive
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.580]   and cursing, et cetera,
[00:42:25.580 --> 00:42:27.960]   as opposed to if they just kind of laugh it off
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.500]   or laugh at themselves
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.640]   or blame someone within their own vehicle
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:33.060]   or something like that.
[00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:36.620]   So are those the sorts of things that a clinician
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.160]   like yourself is listening for
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:39.760]   when somebody says, "You know, I don't feel well."
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.040]   And you say, "Well, tell me about what's going on lately."
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:45.440]   And they start describing what's going on in their life.
[00:42:45.440 --> 00:42:47.600]   And are you listening for those places
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.240]   where the defense mechanisms start to reveal themselves,
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.540]   the character structure starts to reveal itself
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.020]   through these action steps
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:42:57.760]   that the person seems to be taking?
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:01.840]   I mean, maybe one way of looking at character structure
[00:43:01.840 --> 00:43:05.760]   is that it's potentialities and predispositions, right?
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:08.080]   That there's so much that's latent
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:10.020]   that then interfaces with events,
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.560]   like a person's stuck in traffic.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.300]   How does that person respond?
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:15.000]   If that person weren't stuck in traffic,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.560]   there wouldn't be a response to it, right?
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:19.920]   So there are potentialities, there are predispositions,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:22.920]   and then we live through enacting them
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.160]   as we're moving then through life, right?
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.120]   And the attempts to understand,
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:30.960]   so using the physical health parallel, right?
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.920]   If you came in and you said, "I don't feel well," right?
[00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.980]   We might run a lot of tests, right?
[00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:38.360]   We might get an MRI or a CAT scan
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.100]   or even putting the stethoscope
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:41.680]   and listening to what's inside of you.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:43.540]   Those, we could say, are unconscious things,
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.240]   like you're not aware of what the imaging may show
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:49.200]   or the blood test may show or how your lungs may sound
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:51.360]   when someone puts a stethoscope on them, right?
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:54.140]   So a clinician, if you're trying to understand
[00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:55.280]   and help someone,
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:57.280]   then you do wanna look for those things, right?
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:58.400]   You wanna look for the things
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.380]   that are underneath the surface
[00:44:00.380 --> 00:44:03.800]   but that can be very, very important, right?
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:06.640]   You also wanna look at everything that's on the surface,
[00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:07.480]   right?
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:09.680]   So if you're engaging with someone,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.480]   you're engaging with the self, right?
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.560]   The self that grows out of the character structure nest,
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:16.400]   right?
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.980]   So by engaging with and doing one's best
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.080]   to understand the self,
[00:44:21.080 --> 00:44:24.120]   then you learn about what is underneath of it, right?
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:25.320]   So I may then learn,
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:27.520]   well, how do you respond in certain situations, right?
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:29.080]   Just like I could ask you questions
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.280]   or well, when do you not feel well, right?
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.180]   So you're asking a person questions
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.080]   because the idea is to understand
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.640]   elements of the character structure.
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:39.440]   So how do you respond in certain situations?
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:41.280]   What's going on inside of you, right?
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:42.960]   What do you understand about yourself
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:45.400]   and what do you not understand about yourself, right?
[00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:48.240]   How do you bring yourself to bear in the world around you?
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.720]   So there's a similar process going on
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.640]   but here we're trying to understand the self
[00:44:53.640 --> 00:44:55.440]   and the understanding of the self
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:57.280]   can help us understand the components
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.040]   underneath of the self
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.880]   because that's where we're gonna go to make things better,
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:02.720]   right?
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:05.120]   The idea is there shouldn't have to be mystery
[00:45:05.120 --> 00:45:06.320]   or certainly not mystery
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:08.360]   any more than there is in physical health.
[00:45:08.360 --> 00:45:10.440]   I mean, rarely someone comes in
[00:45:10.440 --> 00:45:12.600]   and they're really not feeling well
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:15.840]   and a whole set of everything that should be done is done,
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:16.680]   right?
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:20.040]   Labs, physical examination, history, imaging, right?
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.920]   And you still just don't know, right?
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:23.320]   I mean, sometimes that can happen
[00:45:23.320 --> 00:45:24.840]   but it's very rare.
[00:45:24.840 --> 00:45:27.080]   And the same should apply here
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:30.160]   that if we're examining a self, right?
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.840]   And we're looking for the components
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:34.400]   out of which that self comes, right?
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.840]   Then we should be able to understand
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:40.360]   well enough to go back to the components of self
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:42.200]   and to make change
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:45.440]   so that the self is in a better place, right?
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.440]   And that self can then be empowered,
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.920]   can feel humility, right?
[00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:53.040]   Can then come at life through the altruism
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.840]   and gratitude that we seek
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.960]   because again, you show me someone
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:59.360]   who's coming at life through altruism and gratitude
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:01.280]   and is not happy with their life
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.480]   and you'll be showing me something I've never seen before,
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:05.600]   something entirely new.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:07.160]   So if we wanna get there,
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:09.280]   we wanna know how to get there
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.880]   and there are ways as there should be
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:15.520]   that parallel physical health that aren't mysterious
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.520]   that we can come at to make understanding and change.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:24.040]   - I'm wondering about the role of anxiety in all of this.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.560]   The reason I ask about anxiety
[00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:28.560]   is that you said that so much of character structure
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:33.560]   is determined by a set of predispositions and potentialities.
[00:46:33.560 --> 00:46:36.600]   And earlier we were talking about example
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.560]   of either being afraid or unafraid
[00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.720]   in particular environments
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.760]   or feeling like we can walk into a classroom and learn
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:44.280]   or whether or not we're overly concerned
[00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:46.440]   about what people think about us or both, right?
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.340]   It could be a mix.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.080]   Whether or not we can embrace novel environments
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:53.040]   in safe and adaptive ways,
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:55.200]   whether or not we can grow from them
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.680]   as opposed to whether or not we can be overtaken by them
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.120]   or perhaps even injured,
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:01.320]   harmed psychologically, physically, or both.
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:05.420]   Anxiety to me is a very basic function.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.440]   I think about it in terms of the autonomic nervous system
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:10.440]   and when degrees of excitability and et cetera,
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.480]   inability to sleep at night,
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:13.720]   inability to wake up feeling reasonably good
[00:47:13.720 --> 00:47:15.580]   but not have a panic attack.
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:20.280]   But anxiety to me does seem like a key node in all of this.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:24.540]   Meaning, most people, including myself,
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:28.740]   I don't walk around thinking about my character structure.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.180]   I don't walk around thinking about how I'm going to behave
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:33.520]   in a bunch of hypothetical environments.
[00:47:33.520 --> 00:47:37.380]   Think about the fact that most mornings I wake up
[00:47:37.380 --> 00:47:40.020]   and I feel pretty good, to be quite honest,
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.620]   not as good as I would like to feel.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:43.780]   And not necessarily because anything's wrong
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.500]   but because I think I'm wired to be a little bit more
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.860]   on the anxious side and to predict what's going to happen next
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:49.700]   and what needs to be done.
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.100]   And so until I'm actually engaging in certain behaviors,
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.900]   that anxiety hums a little bit high for me.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:56.800]   The gears turn a little bit faster perhaps
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:47:59.080]   than I would like when I wake up in the morning.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:01.580]   But once I engage, I feel like the speed
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:04.540]   of that gear turning matches the demands
[00:48:04.540 --> 00:48:07.580]   of life pretty well and I feel agency.
[00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:12.740]   So if you don't mind, could we explore this feeling
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:15.260]   of anxiety or lack of anxiety that I think people
[00:48:15.260 --> 00:48:17.600]   are pretty familiar with within themselves
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.560]   at different times of day and under different conditions?
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:24.060]   Because to me, it seems like an interesting lens
[00:48:24.060 --> 00:48:27.260]   to explore this notion of character structure and defenses.
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:30.500]   Is anxiety a healthy defense or an unhealthy defense
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.900]   or does it simply depend on the circumstances?
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:38.520]   - Well, we all have some degree of anxiety in us, right?
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.580]   We all have some awareness that we're navigating the world
[00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:45.140]   and like not everything is perfect, right?
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:46.020]   This is not nirvana.
[00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.980]   So there's some anxiety within us.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.540]   And the thought is that that anxiety can keep us vigilant
[00:48:51.540 --> 00:48:53.660]   about the things we should be vigilant about,
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.060]   health and safety, right?
[00:48:55.060 --> 00:48:59.180]   But that too much anxiety then becomes counter productive.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:02.120]   And we can look at this in a very regimented way, right?
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:05.360]   So some anxiety makes sense, right?
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:06.780]   It keeps us being careful.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.000]   It keeps you being careful as you're pulling out
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.540]   of a driveway, for example, right?
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:13.700]   So, okay, it can be absolutely fine.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:16.140]   But let's say you bring something to clinical attention
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.220]   that isn't absolutely fine, right?
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:19.900]   Let's say I didn't know you and you come in,
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.700]   we have the example that you used before
[00:49:22.700 --> 00:49:26.220]   where you walk into work and there's a group of people
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:28.720]   that you know well and like, right?
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:31.340]   Let's say you told me, when I walk in there,
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.280]   I feel very anxious, right?
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:35.740]   I don't feel like things are okay, right?
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.260]   So then we would go through it.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:38.440]   We said, that's not good, right?
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:40.020]   Maybe it's impacting your professional life.
[00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:40.980]   Things are not going well.
[00:49:40.980 --> 00:49:42.720]   Like you really want this to change
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.860]   'cause it's impacting your life in a negative way.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:47.260]   And we say, okay, let's look at that
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.920]   from the perspective of structure of self, right?
[00:49:50.920 --> 00:49:53.540]   So first, unconscious, right?
[00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:56.060]   Is it that just genetically are you built
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.160]   with just higher levels of anxiety, right?
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:49:59.060]   So we could learn, okay,
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:00.620]   have you always been anxious like this?
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.140]   Has this always been in your life
[00:50:02.140 --> 00:50:03.960]   since you were a little kid, no matter what?
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:06.480]   So we're looking for biological nature,
[00:50:06.480 --> 00:50:08.220]   so to speak, variables.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:11.740]   We might also look for things that have happened to you
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.160]   that are lodged in your unconscious mind, right?
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.740]   Is there trauma that you haven't processed, right?
[00:50:16.740 --> 00:50:19.080]   That now is underneath the surface
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:22.100]   but is spinning off more anxiety, right?
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:23.000]   Let's say you tell me,
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.580]   oh, it wasn't that long ago you started being anxious.
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.500]   Ah, did something happen?
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.620]   Did you walk into a group of people and I don't know,
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:31.300]   you tripped and you felt bad about something, right?
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.180]   And then you get more anxious, right?
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:35.920]   So are there things going on underneath the surface
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:36.860]   that are impacting you?
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.220]   Like, let's look into that, right?
[00:50:39.220 --> 00:50:41.680]   Because that's the biggest part of the iceberg, right?
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:44.920]   Then your conscious mind, we could start thinking about,
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.880]   okay, what's going on?
[00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:48.800]   What are you actively thinking about, right?
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:51.420]   So this is where sometimes cognitive behavioral techniques
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:52.580]   can come into mind.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:54.660]   Like, are you thinking like, oh no, I'm scared.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:55.580]   It isn't gonna go well, right?
[00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:56.520]   Like, are you having thoughts?
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:50:58.580]   Are there thoughts in making you more anxious, right?
[00:50:58.580 --> 00:51:00.680]   What's going on in your conscious mind, right?
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:04.520]   I would also be very interested in the defenses around you.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.340]   So for example, do you tend to avoid, right?
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:09.640]   Has this been getting worse for three months,
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.160]   but you just, your mind wouldn't acknowledge it, right?
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.760]   And by the time you have to acknowledge it,
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.440]   now it's really bad, right?
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:19.600]   Or do you not avoid and like this just started happening
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:21.300]   and you wanna nip it in the bud, right?
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:24.540]   So I would be interested in the defense mechanisms, right?
[00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:26.520]   That are girding your conscious self.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.720]   And I would be interested in the character structure.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:31.160]   What decisions are you then making?
[00:51:31.160 --> 00:51:33.440]   Like, are you going anyway, right?
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:36.240]   Are you having trouble so sometimes you avoid?
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:38.720]   Are you then making decisions that make you late
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.600]   and that causes problems.
[00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:42.580]   How does it impact you once you're there?
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:44.300]   Are you engaging differently with people,
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:45.720]   doing your work differently?
[00:51:45.720 --> 00:51:48.320]   So I wanna understand the character structure
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:50.720]   and ultimately you understand all of this
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:55.080]   by probing the self that's riding along on top of it.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:57.560]   And then what is the experience of that self?
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:59.800]   Like, do you see that, okay, this is a problem
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:01.560]   and I wanna address it, but like, look,
[00:52:01.560 --> 00:52:03.080]   I know that I'm good at what I do
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.000]   and I mean, this isn't some like awful thing about me,
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.600]   I just have to deal with it, right?
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:10.440]   Or is yourself impacted where you start thinking,
[00:52:10.440 --> 00:52:12.480]   maybe I can't do this anymore, I'm not good enough
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:16.360]   or we wanna understand what's the experience of the self.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:18.500]   Right, and if we do all of that,
[00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:20.860]   how is it that we don't get to a place
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.640]   where we can understand that anxiety, right?
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:25.480]   And we can make things better.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.780]   So just like in physical health, okay, maybe we can't,
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:31.520]   but that is a dramatic outlier.
[00:52:31.520 --> 00:52:33.960]   If we bring ourselves to bear, we would say,
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:37.600]   you should not have to have this in you, right?
[00:52:37.600 --> 00:52:38.920]   Because it is something negative,
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.640]   it is making unhappiness for you,
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.720]   it is taking away from empowerment, right?
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:46.760]   And it's also taking away from humility, right?
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:48.320]   Because if someone's beating up on themselves,
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.200]   you're beating up on yourself about it,
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:51.820]   then that's not humility, right?
[00:52:51.820 --> 00:52:55.000]   Then that's being sort of falsely persecutory, right?
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.600]   This is not an honest humility to that,
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:58.400]   it leads us away from health.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:01.000]   So it's like, we don't want it to be this way, right?
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:05.440]   Because that is working against agency and gratitude,
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:09.040]   so we can understand it and we can go after it
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.520]   and make it better.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:14.640]   - One of the most common questions I get on the internet,
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.280]   and I get a lot of questions,
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:21.280]   is what can be done to improve confidence?
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:23.540]   And I've thought a lot about that question
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:25.300]   and what is confidence?
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:27.040]   In the context of what we're talking about now
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.040]   is one reasonable definition of confidence,
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.040]   our ability to trust our predispositions
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:36.120]   and our potentialities enough
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:41.120]   that were we to encounter scenarios A through Z,
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:44.360]   we feel pretty good that we would respond the right way
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.760]   in a way that wouldn't threaten our conscious mind
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:50.480]   at a core level, right?
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.240]   You know, that we wouldn't,
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.660]   I used to use the term and joke a lot in my laboratory
[00:53:55.660 --> 00:53:57.840]   with the phrase, you know,
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:54:00.140]   dissolve into a puddle of our own tears, right?
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:02.720]   It's kind of this like hyperbolic explanation
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:04.520]   of what I think many people fear,
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.840]   like they're going to be called upon
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.860]   to answer a question publicly or give a speech,
[00:54:08.860 --> 00:54:10.560]   or they're going to be at a critical moment
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:12.720]   in a relationship or something,
[00:54:12.720 --> 00:54:15.620]   and just everything is just going to go so badly wrong
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:17.920]   that it's just going to dissolve them as a person.
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:19.680]   It's impossible, right?
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:21.960]   Dissolving a bottle of our own tears is impossible,
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:25.800]   but I think that's a fear that a lot of people live with
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.040]   because we can get into this a little bit later and we will.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:29.880]   I'm sure, you know,
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:32.080]   this notion of like protecting one's ego
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:34.840]   seems really vital to being a human being at some level.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.160]   Like we don't want to dissolve
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:37.440]   into a puddle of our own tears.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:40.800]   So is confidence the ability to trust ourselves
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:42.740]   in a bunch of different contexts?
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:45.680]   And at the same time,
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:50.240]   I do have to raise this notion of narcissism.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.400]   I think, you know,
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.240]   this word gets thrown around a lot lately,
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.120]   but it seems to me that any truly
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:58.920]   psychologically healthy person
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:00.880]   would also not want to be the idiot
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.560]   that thinks that they're better than they actually are.
[00:55:03.560 --> 00:55:07.120]   What are your thoughts on this?
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:09.780]   - Well, I agree with the things that you said
[00:55:09.780 --> 00:55:13.080]   about confidence, except I would add two factors
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.760]   that I think are like really big factors, right?
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:18.640]   One being state dependence
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.820]   and the other being phenomenology, right?
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:23.400]   So think about the state dependence first, right?
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:27.080]   We're talking about confidence, it's not uniform, right?
[00:55:27.080 --> 00:55:29.160]   Or it's not automatically uniform, right?
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:32.880]   So if you were to tell me, oh, I lack confidence, right?
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:35.560]   Then I want to understand, is that across the board?
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.000]   Is like, is that a way that you feel about yourself?
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:41.240]   That like, I'm not good enough at anything, for example,
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.080]   right?
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.840]   Or do you lack confidence in a specific area, right?
[00:55:45.840 --> 00:55:47.400]   And this is often the case, right?
[00:55:47.400 --> 00:55:48.760]   And it's a huge difference, right?
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:51.440]   It says that person has the machinery of confidence,
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.620]   so to speak, right?
[00:55:52.620 --> 00:55:55.560]   They have the potentialities and the predispositions
[00:55:55.560 --> 00:55:57.080]   for confidence, right?
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:59.500]   When that character structure, the self built upon it
[00:55:59.500 --> 00:56:01.920]   is engaging with the world, right?
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.840]   But they're not able to bring it to bear
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:08.480]   in a certain special situation, so to speak.
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:10.360]   So for some people, for example,
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.400]   the way we most often see this is like
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.600]   the carve out of romance, right?
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:17.320]   Where because it's so emotionally laden, right?
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:19.400]   And like rejection can feel so bad, right?
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:21.680]   That we can see people who are very confident
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:23.860]   in many, many aspects of life,
[00:56:23.860 --> 00:56:25.620]   but they are very diffident about romance.
[00:56:25.620 --> 00:56:27.800]   And they'll say different, oh, it never works out for me,
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:29.480]   or no one will ever like me, right?
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:32.120]   And you see like, that's not how that person
[00:56:32.120 --> 00:56:33.760]   actually feels, right?
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:36.720]   About themselves as a whole human being, right?
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:41.040]   Which is then we are coming at how to make that better
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:42.720]   in a way that's very robust, right?
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:45.560]   We might say something like, hey, here's the good news is
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:48.120]   you have the tools and the machinery that you need, right?
[00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.440]   You're confident in so many ways, right?
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.400]   In fact, maybe in all ways, except this one.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.900]   So let's go take a look at like, why is that special, right?
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:59.320]   And then, and where are we?
[00:56:59.320 --> 00:57:01.980]   We're back to, is it something in the unconscious mind?
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:04.140]   Is it something in the conscious mind
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:05.940]   about how that person is engaging, right?
[00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:09.520]   So we have to understand what the state is
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:12.240]   and if the lack of confidence is state dependent.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.240]   If the person is not confident across the board,
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:17.000]   then again, we go back to the same,
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.880]   we always go back to the same places to look, right?
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:22.160]   But then you might more think, okay,
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.160]   is there an impact of childhood trauma
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:28.320]   or early life trauma that took away from that person,
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.400]   you know, their ability to gain confidence, right?
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.200]   'Cause if you'd have no confidence across the board,
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:35.600]   there's a deeper problem, right?
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:39.240]   Because there would be something anyone can be good at
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:41.160]   and feel confident in, right?
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:43.140]   So the state dependence is very important
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:45.260]   as is phenomenology.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:49.160]   So what is your experience of being confident?
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.640]   If you tell me, well, I'm,
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:53.600]   let's say in a different version of this example,
[00:57:53.600 --> 00:57:56.360]   you say, you know, actually I'm quite,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:00.520]   I feel quite confident when I walk into a room of people.
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:04.160]   I say, okay, I wanna understand more about that too, right?
[00:58:04.160 --> 00:58:06.800]   Because if I ask questions about that and you say,
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:09.280]   well, I feel confident because, you know,
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:11.680]   look, I'm a pretty smart person.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:15.460]   I can think on my feet, I can deal well with people.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:18.360]   If something doesn't go right, I can recover from it.
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:21.080]   Like I've got, you know, that's why I feel confident,
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:23.080]   you know, and say, okay, that sounds pretty good.
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.060]   If you say, well, I feel confident
[00:58:25.060 --> 00:58:27.320]   because I know that I'm better than everybody, right?
[00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:28.960]   Now we have a problem, right?
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.720]   Right, like that's not gonna go well
[00:58:30.720 --> 00:58:35.360]   in other, you know, in other aspects of life and engagement.
[00:58:35.360 --> 00:58:36.200]   Like there's, you know,
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:38.000]   it's not gonna lead to humility and gratitude.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:39.760]   So where's that coming from?
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:42.120]   And again, maybe there's a deeper problem, right?
[00:58:42.120 --> 00:58:43.880]   As you said about narcissism, right?
[00:58:43.880 --> 00:58:46.440]   Which can be a reaction, right?
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.700]   Which is a reaction to vulnerability, right?
[00:58:48.700 --> 00:58:51.480]   So then there's, what's called a reaction formation.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:55.640]   And now the person is actually deeply diffident, right?
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:57.500]   But presents as very, very confident
[00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.200]   and with a sense of superiority.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:03.000]   And that's not a recipe for happiness, right?
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.400]   So in approaching it,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.920]   we do wanna understand all the things that you said.
[00:59:08.920 --> 00:59:12.000]   What are the factors and the set of predispositions
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.600]   and the set of potentialities?
[00:59:13.600 --> 00:59:16.680]   But then what's the real world experience of that
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.080]   across situations?
[00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.340]   And what is the person's experience of that inside?
[00:59:21.340 --> 00:59:23.520]   Which is why if we're gonna understand and help people,
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:25.520]   like that's the understand part, right?
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:28.160]   You know, it's why the conveyor belt medicine,
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:30.480]   you know, it doesn't work, right?
[00:59:30.480 --> 00:59:33.360]   In situations where we're dealing with human beings,
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.820]   like mental health, right?
[00:59:34.820 --> 00:59:37.120]   We have to understand something about people
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:40.500]   to understand whatever they're telling us means.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.780]   Otherwise you have no context, so you have no knowledge.
[00:59:43.780 --> 00:59:46.200]   - Another very common set of questions that I get,
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:48.940]   that I believe is very directly related to this,
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:52.140]   is about beliefs and internal narratives.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:55.660]   You know, people ask me all the time,
[00:59:55.660 --> 00:59:59.120]   how can I change what I believe about myself?
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:02.620]   And they also ask, how can I change the script in my head?
[01:00:02.620 --> 01:00:05.000]   How do I, typically it's how do I shut down
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.340]   a particular narrative in my head?
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:08.660]   That seems to fit very well
[01:00:08.660 --> 01:00:10.020]   in thinking about structure of self,
[01:00:10.020 --> 01:00:11.460]   because as you pointed out, you know,
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:14.060]   the self or the structure of self
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:15.960]   includes the unconscious mind, you know,
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:17.820]   what's going on below the surface of the water
[01:00:17.820 --> 01:00:19.180]   in this iceberg model,
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.740]   what's going on in the conscious mind,
[01:00:20.740 --> 01:00:22.980]   that the conscious mind is protected
[01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:24.260]   by these defense mechanisms
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.780]   that grow up from the unconscious mind,
[01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:28.720]   from that character structure,
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.360]   and then this thing that we call the self, right?
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:34.340]   But when it comes to beliefs and internal narratives,
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:36.980]   those seem to me things that people are pretty well aware of.
[01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:39.180]   In fact, the very example that people are asking me this
[01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:41.340]   all the time, how to change beliefs, internal narratives,
[01:00:41.340 --> 01:00:42.800]   it means they are aware of them.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:46.000]   It also suggests that for many people out there,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.260]   their beliefs about themselves
[01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.020]   and their internal narratives are not healthy,
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:52.140]   or at least they don't feel are serving them well
[01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.500]   or that they are intrusive.
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.580]   I don't know how open people are about their beliefs
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:58.380]   and internal narratives when they come to you
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:00.500]   in your clinical practice.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:04.260]   But if you could tell us a little bit about beliefs
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:06.500]   and internal narratives and whether or not
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.660]   they are important to rewire and reset.
[01:01:09.660 --> 01:01:13.740]   - This part is extremely important, right?
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.900]   So imagine, for example, that I'm saying to myself
[01:01:16.900 --> 01:01:19.500]   over and over again that I'm a loser, right?
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.960]   Or I'm not good enough, right?
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:22.940]   I mean, imagine trying to go through life
[01:01:22.940 --> 01:01:25.900]   and someone else were saying that to you all the time, right?
[01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:28.500]   I mean, it's worse when it's inside your own head, right?
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.600]   So what's going on inside of us, our internal dialogue,
[01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:35.400]   our internal narratives are extremely important.
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:38.440]   And here's where we run into a very big problem
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:41.680]   is that we live in an era and in a culture
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:45.200]   that is very attuned to rapid gratification, right?
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.820]   And all of this that we're talking about can change,
[01:01:49.820 --> 01:01:52.760]   but it does not change quickly.
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:54.940]   And it's amazing to me when,
[01:01:54.940 --> 01:01:58.340]   you'll see under insurance paradigms often, right?
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:01:59.840]   No matter what's going on with someone,
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:02.880]   they have 10 sessions of cognitive behavioral treatment,
[01:02:02.880 --> 01:02:03.720]   right?
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.960]   So if there's something like we're trying to change beliefs,
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:08.360]   it's a guarantee of failure, right?
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:12.220]   Because beliefs don't change that fast, right?
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:15.440]   So imagine, for example, that you and I chose a word,
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.460]   a random word, and we decided to say it 500 times, right?
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:21.380]   We'd each be saying it tonight, right?
[01:02:21.380 --> 01:02:23.840]   Like it's not gonna be out of our minds by tonight,
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:25.840]   but because we, what, took a random word
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:28.080]   and said it 500 times, right?
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.620]   So imagine that there's something
[01:02:29.620 --> 01:02:32.980]   that's highly emotionally laden,
[01:02:32.980 --> 01:02:34.840]   and we've said it thousands and thousands
[01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:37.080]   and thousands of times, right?
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.460]   That's not gonna go away quickly, right?
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:41.520]   But it can go away.
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:45.080]   And during the process of it atrophying, right?
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:46.720]   Our lives can get better, right?
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:49.260]   This is the opposite of hopeless, right?
[01:02:49.260 --> 01:02:51.640]   It's actually very, very encouraging,
[01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.580]   but in a world that's rapid gratification, right?
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:55.420]   Like how do we fix this?
[01:02:55.420 --> 01:02:58.680]   How do we fix this now that doesn't acknowledge this?
[01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.120]   We hear all the time that a person has failed therapy,
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:03.780]   right, like this is said all the time,
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.320]   that person failed, what does failed therapy mean, right?
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:09.720]   I mean, I think therapy failed that person, right?
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:12.720]   But we label like, oh, a person isn't better, right?
[01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.000]   But there are things going on inside of us
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:18.240]   that could take months and months or years to make better.
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:21.740]   Now again, that's okay if we're aware of what's going on.
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:23.880]   Just the very fact that we understand
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:25.640]   and we're making change, right,
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.520]   helps us feel better about ourselves and more confident,
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.560]   right, that we can change all of this,
[01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:32.720]   but we have to approach it in the right way.
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:36.860]   So let's say that I'm telling myself over and over again,
[01:03:36.860 --> 01:03:39.240]   you're not gonna get there, right?
[01:03:39.240 --> 01:03:41.520]   And let's say a place I wanna go professionally, right?
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:44.160]   Or no one's ever gonna really want you, right?
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:46.800]   If I'm looking for a romantic partner, right?
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.300]   So imagine these things are going on
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.320]   and they're going on over and over again.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.960]   And you can imagine now that it's intruded
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:55.240]   into the unconscious mind,
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:57.000]   it's going on in my conscious mind,
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.880]   my defensive structure is shifting in negative ways,
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:00.920]   I'm becoming more avoidant.
[01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:05.040]   Like nothing about this is good and I want it to change.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:07.320]   And I want it to change to something that says,
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:09.140]   like you can do it, right?
[01:04:09.140 --> 01:04:10.960]   Or you're lovable, right?
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.000]   Or you can be a good partner to someone.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.720]   So I wanna change it, right?
[01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:18.440]   So imagine now when I start to make that change,
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.520]   I'm blazing a path, right?
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:21.760]   And I'm blazing a path
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.720]   where there wasn't a path before, right?
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:27.280]   And I can blaze a path and I can go through that path,
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.320]   but that path is gonna be nothing like maybe
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:32.400]   the four lane highway, right?
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:35.640]   Adjacent to me where the thing that I've been telling myself
[01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:38.880]   for years and years and years, born of trauma, right?
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:42.120]   Is going back and forth, right?
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.640]   I mean, it's got a four lane highway,
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.240]   I'm cutting a path, right?
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.420]   But over time, you cut that path more and more,
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.100]   you tread that path more and more,
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.600]   you take energy towards that path, it becomes better.
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:55.880]   Now let's imagine like the path is well-lit
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:58.640]   and it's 12 feet wide and maybe we can pave the path
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.480]   so more traffic, so to speak, goes down it.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.120]   And we're taking energy away from that four lane highway
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.800]   and maybe it starts to be overgrown a little bit
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:07.880]   and there are cracks in the road.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.140]   Like we can change all of that,
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.360]   but we have to understand what's going on and identify it.
[01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:16.080]   Like what is going on inside of me?
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:17.560]   What do I make of it, right?
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.560]   How do I understand the process of change?
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.940]   How do I increase my empowerment
[01:05:21.940 --> 01:05:23.580]   during the process of change?
[01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:27.640]   If we come at it the right way, all of this can be changed.
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.860]   It's not hardwired in us,
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:33.820]   it's just very, very strongly reinforced.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.340]   The same way our brains are built this way,
[01:05:35.340 --> 01:05:37.660]   so we don't forget our own names, right?
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:39.580]   You know, we don't forget where we live,
[01:05:39.580 --> 01:05:41.420]   you know, back when we were hunting and gathering
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:45.420]   and we don't forget, you know, where the good fruits are,
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:47.060]   right, I mean this goes on in human life now.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:49.700]   Like we have to remember things, it's very, very important
[01:05:49.700 --> 01:05:52.640]   if something has high emotional valence
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.260]   and we've thought it a lot that we don't forget it,
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.140]   but that mechanism gets hijacked
[01:05:57.140 --> 01:05:59.280]   by things that are not good for us
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:02.660]   and we can take it back, but not if we don't understand.
[01:06:02.660 --> 01:06:05.780]   - What are the tools or the questions
[01:06:05.780 --> 01:06:09.700]   that you give or ask of patients
[01:06:09.700 --> 01:06:12.800]   in order to help them along that pathway?
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:15.360]   Because I totally agree that changing beliefs
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.060]   and internal narratives is very, very hard.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:20.980]   Just one quick example that meshes
[01:06:20.980 --> 01:06:22.220]   with the physical health realm.
[01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:24.020]   I have a friend and colleague,
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.840]   he's a very accomplished scientist
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:28.660]   who was very overweight for a long period of time.
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:31.260]   He finally made some behavioral changes
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:32.340]   that allowed him to lose,
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:34.460]   I think it was in upwards of 80 pounds,
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:35.860]   a significant amount of weight,
[01:06:35.860 --> 01:06:37.920]   felt much better, looked much better.
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.760]   He just delighted in his ability to do that,
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:44.680]   but then started to reveal to me
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.740]   that he was deathly afraid
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:49.920]   that he was going to lose control
[01:06:49.920 --> 01:06:52.020]   and start eating the way he was before
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:54.880]   and stop exercising in a way that would return him
[01:06:54.880 --> 01:06:58.340]   to his previous weight and feelings of malaise.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.680]   And I said, well, all the things you're doing
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.220]   are in the direction of health.
[01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:05.020]   None of what you're doing speaks
[01:07:05.020 --> 01:07:07.960]   to the possibility of this all crumbling.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:09.260]   This was the dissolve into a puddle
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.940]   of my own tears kind of narrative,
[01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.360]   but at this point coming from him.
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:15.100]   And he just said, I know,
[01:07:15.100 --> 01:07:17.820]   but despite doing all the right things,
[01:07:17.820 --> 01:07:21.300]   I'm still incredibly afraid that it's going to happen.
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.840]   It was as if the beliefs and the internal narratives
[01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:26.380]   hadn't changed despite the fact
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:28.460]   that he was engaging in the world differently
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:29.980]   and more positively.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.240]   I haven't checked in with him recently
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:32.740]   to find out where he's at with this now,
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:33.820]   several years later.
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.800]   He has kept off most of the weight, not all.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.880]   They gained a little bit back,
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:40.140]   but he's still far healthier than he ever was.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:42.620]   So hopefully he's experienced some relief.
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:47.060]   But what do you tell a patient who is saying,
[01:07:47.060 --> 01:07:48.980]   I've got this loop in my head
[01:07:48.980 --> 01:07:50.580]   that tells me I'm not good enough,
[01:07:50.580 --> 01:07:53.180]   or that even when things are going well,
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:54.960]   they're going to return to that state
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:57.240]   that I fear so much once again.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.740]   This kind of like, you know, lack of agency, right?
[01:08:00.740 --> 01:08:04.020]   Just lack of agency, lack of agency, lack of empowerment.
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:09.100]   What sorts of practical tools can one give themselves
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:11.340]   or that you would provide to somebody?
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:14.460]   - No matter what is behind what's going on
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:18.100]   in that person's mind, it's addressable.
[01:08:18.100 --> 01:08:21.420]   But you don't know what it is and how to address it
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:26.120]   until we ask the question of what's going on inside, right?
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.300]   So if he's afraid
[01:08:28.300 --> 01:08:31.240]   that he's gonna gain all that weight back, right?
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:32.500]   And he has a history
[01:08:32.500 --> 01:08:35.680]   that if significant negative things happen,
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:38.600]   he throws self-care to the wind, right?
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:42.100]   Then we'd come at it through that pattern, right?
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.700]   Because he would have a very, you know,
[01:08:43.700 --> 01:08:45.740]   he'd have a good reason to be worried, right?
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:48.580]   Because this pattern of something bad happens
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:50.620]   and I don't take care of myself for six months.
[01:08:50.620 --> 01:08:52.380]   You know, maybe someone, I'm just making this up,
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.900]   and maybe someone in his life is ill
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:55.540]   or he's fearing a death, you know,
[01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:57.380]   and if it's just something that would say,
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:08:59.740]   that's a very legitimate fear to have,
[01:08:59.740 --> 01:09:01.260]   like, let's talk about that.
[01:09:01.260 --> 01:09:04.140]   Like, let's look at where that comes from, right?
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.160]   Got that person into that pattern in the first place, right?
[01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:10.300]   By understanding the pattern and by working together, right?
[01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:12.660]   Can we stave that off, right?
[01:09:12.660 --> 01:09:13.580]   But it could be different.
[01:09:13.580 --> 01:09:14.940]   The person might say,
[01:09:14.940 --> 01:09:17.820]   well, I'm really, I'm having a lot of food cravings, right?
[01:09:17.820 --> 01:09:19.420]   And we're like, okay, what does that mean?
[01:09:19.420 --> 01:09:20.660]   Where's that coming from?
[01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:23.180]   Or maybe he's depressed and he's getting depressed
[01:09:23.180 --> 01:09:25.860]   and when he's depressed, he can't stop eating more, right?
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:27.060]   So, you know, you would look,
[01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:28.700]   or it might just be plain old fear.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:30.620]   Like, this is so good, right?
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.680]   That I'm worried it will go away, right?
[01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.820]   Then we might want to reinforce like, okay,
[01:09:34.820 --> 01:09:36.580]   like, you know, you're a person who's able
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:38.820]   to use circumspection and perseverance
[01:09:38.820 --> 01:09:40.420]   and preserve goodness, right?
[01:09:40.420 --> 01:09:42.620]   So like, you do that and you do that really well.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:45.820]   So let's make sure we're doing that here, right?
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:48.980]   So, you know, a lot of times a person is worried,
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.020]   but that worry is coming through the lens of health.
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:52.000]   Like, they're healthy, right?
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.340]   So then we look at, okay, can we soothe that worry?
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:56.580]   Where's that coming from, right?
[01:09:56.580 --> 01:09:59.900]   We can come at it and reinforce the positive.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.700]   But if there is something negative,
[01:10:01.700 --> 01:10:03.100]   there's a trauma-driven cycle,
[01:10:03.100 --> 01:10:04.980]   there's depression, there are cravings,
[01:10:04.980 --> 01:10:06.580]   we can understand that too.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.860]   So I come back to this idea that there's answers
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:13.220]   to just about everything and in a very regimented,
[01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:17.500]   scientific way, it's not that hard to come to them, right?
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:19.020]   Just like in physical medicine,
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:22.300]   like we have the tools that we need to bring to bear,
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:23.780]   but you have to understand the person.
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:25.580]   Again, if you come in and say, I'm not feeling good
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:28.280]   and someone else comes in and says, I'm not feeling good,
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.860]   the doctor better not do the same things, right?
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:32.660]   As is, how are you not feeling good?
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.780]   Okay, let me understand that and then let me map that also
[01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:38.920]   to you, whatever underlying state of health you may have
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:40.260]   or diagnoses you may have.
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.860]   The same is true in mental health.
[01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:45.540]   If we just apply that, then it's remarkable,
[01:10:45.540 --> 01:10:48.500]   the good that we do, which I've seen very consistently
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:51.340]   across 20 years of doing this, not only in my own practice,
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:54.020]   but like who are the people who do really, really well
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:56.260]   trying to understand and take care of people,
[01:10:56.260 --> 01:10:58.620]   including sometimes not doing too much
[01:10:58.620 --> 01:11:00.980]   and realizing like, hey, this person is okay.
[01:11:00.980 --> 01:11:02.140]   Like there's a state of healthier,
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:04.700]   but this person is worried, how do we reassure them, right?
[01:11:04.700 --> 01:11:06.160]   How do we help someone living a good life,
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:07.500]   live a better life, right?
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.260]   If we're gonna do all of this,
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:11.200]   we have to approach people as individuals.
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:13.360]   It's just, I mean, the science tells us that
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.360]   and common sense tells us that too.
[01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:19.280]   But if we do that, a person can get to the place
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:20.680]   they wanna be.
[01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:23.400]   - I'd like to address a different person as an example,
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.000]   a hypothetical person.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:27.120]   And I'm certain there are many, many
[01:11:27.120 --> 01:11:28.800]   of these people out there.
[01:11:28.800 --> 01:11:31.700]   These are the sorts of people that think, okay,
[01:11:31.700 --> 01:11:35.280]   there's a self and a mind and a unconscious mind, et cetera.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:39.220]   But at some level, why not just do
[01:11:39.220 --> 01:11:40.580]   what needs to be done in life?
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:43.180]   Like the people that don't want to explore the self.
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:45.540]   Because to me, it seems so absolutely clear
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:47.540]   that just as it's important to have a certain level
[01:11:47.540 --> 01:11:49.520]   of endurance, strength, flexibility,
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.460]   so that one can extract the most joy and agency
[01:11:53.460 --> 01:11:56.860]   and gratitude and empowerment and humility from life,
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.560]   that it makes sense to explore the self.
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:02.220]   To ask, where am I internally strong?
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.100]   Where am I internally weak?
[01:12:04.100 --> 01:12:05.900]   Where might I perceive myself as strong
[01:12:05.900 --> 01:12:08.260]   where as I'm actually weak, right?
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:11.060]   These seem like very important,
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:12.840]   if not crucial questions to ask.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:14.500]   But I know that there are a certain number of people
[01:12:14.500 --> 01:12:17.960]   in the world think all of that is just kind of a waste
[01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:19.040]   of time, right?
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.880]   It's all about doing stuff.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:23.840]   It's all, why explore the self, you know?
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:28.160]   And I think the rest of us are looking at that person often
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:30.020]   and thinking, well, you're exactly the kind of person
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:31.800]   that needs to do this because of the ways
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:34.520]   that you grate on other people, but not always, right?
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:37.360]   Sometimes these people just appear to be just very effective.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.240]   They're all about the outward expression
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:40.400]   of what they're doing.
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.240]   And I certainly don't know how other people feel
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:44.480]   waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:45.640]   and throughout the day.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:50.600]   But to the person that feels like introspection
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:53.620]   and exploring, maybe even excavating for trauma
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:55.080]   that they haven't been in touch with
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:12:56.800]   or haven't dealt with yet,
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:58.220]   for the person that feels that all of that
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.320]   is kind of not really worth the effort
[01:13:01.320 --> 01:13:02.960]   and that it's all about action,
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.480]   what can we say to that person or those people?
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:11.600]   Put differently, does one need to change
[01:13:11.600 --> 01:13:13.600]   and need to believe in the power
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:17.880]   of these sorts of approaches in order for them to work?
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:19.120]   We often hear that people don't change
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:20.580]   until they want to change.
[01:13:20.580 --> 01:13:24.800]   And could we also say perhaps that even for the people
[01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:27.360]   that feel like they're functioning extremely well
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:30.280]   in all domains of life, I know no such people
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:33.200]   and I know some very high achieving people as you do too.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:35.020]   I know no such people.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.460]   The only people who seem to exist in that sphere
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.540]   are the clear narcissists that to them
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:41.580]   just seem like they're doing great,
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:42.820]   but everyone else can't stand them.
[01:13:42.820 --> 01:13:45.320]   By the way, narcissists, no one else can stand you.
[01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:50.160]   What do we say to those individuals?
[01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.920]   'Cause I think it's a big swath of humanity.
[01:13:52.920 --> 01:13:56.400]   And I think it accounts for a lot of suffering in the world,
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.880]   including their own suffering.
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:02.120]   Yeah, so I would make an appeal to common sense, right?
[01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.360]   So imagine you take someone
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:05.800]   who doesn't know anything about health.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.800]   They don't know how to exercise,
[01:14:07.800 --> 01:14:09.440]   they don't know how to eat well, they just don't know
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:11.720]   and they're really, really unhealthy, right?
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:14.280]   They're overweight, they have low energy,
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:17.000]   they have sleep apnea, they don't need to have any,
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.400]   and why not just say to them,
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.860]   well, like, just go be different?
[01:14:21.860 --> 01:14:24.000]   Like, in fact, be different now.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:25.720]   Why aren't you different right now, right?
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:27.880]   Like, of course, we would never do that
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:31.160]   because it's absurd, and by the way,
[01:14:31.160 --> 01:14:33.280]   also would be cruel, right?
[01:14:33.280 --> 01:14:34.640]   So it's absurd and it's cruel,
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.700]   so we would never do that, right?
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:39.460]   Let's say now, let's say we fast forward
[01:14:39.460 --> 01:14:41.760]   some period of months, say, make it up, right?
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:45.460]   And we see that person and wow, they are much healthier,
[01:14:45.460 --> 01:14:47.440]   they have much more energy, they've lost weight,
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:51.480]   they're physically fit, a lot will have gone on
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:54.480]   in between those two snapshots of that person.
[01:14:54.480 --> 01:14:56.240]   That person has to learn a lot, right?
[01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:58.740]   How does one take care of oneself, right?
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.720]   Then more specifically, how do I take care of myself, right?
[01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:04.120]   What healthy foods will I like?
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:05.920]   What healthy foods will I eat?
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.280]   How will I put that on the table?
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:09.200]   What kind of exercises can work for me?
[01:15:09.200 --> 01:15:10.440]   How will they work for me?
[01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:11.860]   How do I strengthen muscle?
[01:15:11.860 --> 01:15:13.040]   How do I strengthen the heart?
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:14.680]   How do I increase lung capacity, right?
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:17.040]   There's learning, there's diligence,
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:20.000]   there's stick-to-itiveness, right?
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.320]   There's resilience.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.400]   That's how the person gets there, right?
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:27.600]   It is no different, and it's mental health, right?
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:30.940]   If we say, well, you feel diffident across the board,
[01:15:30.940 --> 01:15:34.120]   or you feel superior across the board, or whatever it is,
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.280]   like life isn't going well,
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:36.760]   and you don't have things you want,
[01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:38.840]   and the self-talk is negative,
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:41.640]   then we'd say, well, just be different right now, right?
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.320]   I mean, it's remarkable that people will say that at times,
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:49.480]   not just in a way that's denigrating and awful for others,
[01:15:49.480 --> 01:15:51.120]   but to themselves too, right?
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:54.220]   I mean, I hear people say this most often
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.040]   to themselves, like, why am I not just different, right?
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.080]   I want to be different,
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:00.080]   or what's wrong with me that I'm not?
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:02.700]   And they're like, yeah, it's like everything else.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:05.400]   Like, you have to apply understanding, and work, and effort.
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:06.920]   Like, the good news is,
[01:16:06.920 --> 01:16:08.960]   you can get to whatever change you want.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:12.360]   I mean, a person can get to whatever reasonable change
[01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:13.360]   that person wants.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:14.980]   Like, you know, I'm 54 years old.
[01:16:14.980 --> 01:16:16.200]   I'm not gonna climb Mount Everest.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:17.580]   I'm not a mountain climber, right?
[01:16:17.580 --> 01:16:19.760]   But if I want to, like, I want to climb some mountains.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.000]   I want to get out there and do some things.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.440]   I can go do that, right?
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.420]   The same thing is true with our mental health goals,
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:30.440]   but not at the snap of a finger, not by magic, right?
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.540]   It's through applying the same science and common sense,
[01:16:33.540 --> 01:16:35.340]   combination of science and common sense
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:37.200]   that we apply to other things.
[01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:38.960]   That's why we go through this procedure
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:41.080]   of unconscious mind, conscious mind,
[01:16:41.080 --> 01:16:42.940]   the structure and function of the self,
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.540]   because that's how it's done.
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:47.860]   That's how the after snapshot looks different
[01:16:47.860 --> 01:16:52.240]   than the before from the mental health perspective as well.
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.240]   - That's very helpful.
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:55.240]   And I think it's going to be very helpful
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:16:59.400]   to a lot of people in thinking about what to think about,
[01:16:59.400 --> 01:17:01.720]   what sorts of questions to address,
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:04.600]   maybe even whether or not to get therapy.
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:07.800]   And hopefully we'll remap their notions of therapy.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:09.360]   I mean, of course, this critically relies
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:12.880]   on the therapist being good to excellent.
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.880]   And I think in the previous sit-down we had
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.320]   around the, in the episode on trauma specifically,
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.600]   you mapped out a number of the features of quality therapy.
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.520]   So we can refer people to that if they're thinking about,
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.040]   it's timestamped in that episode,
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.000]   as to what to look for in a therapist,
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:32.520]   how to assess whether or not it's going well or not,
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:34.520]   whether or not to move on or stay put
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:36.020]   with that therapist and so on.
[01:17:36.020 --> 01:17:39.280]   You've been telling us a lot about the structure
[01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:42.760]   of the self, unconscious mind, conscious mind,
[01:17:42.760 --> 01:17:46.040]   defense mechanisms, character structure, self.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.540]   We haven't talked so much about the function of self.
[01:17:49.540 --> 01:17:51.480]   I realize it's been woven in here or there.
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:52.320]   - Yes.
[01:17:52.320 --> 01:17:55.840]   - Could you tell us about the function of self?
[01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:58.560]   Are the functions of self verb actions?
[01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.660]   I mean, are these things that we are all doing right now
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:04.540]   that reflect our character structure?
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:08.000]   Are these things that we can change more readily
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.140]   than trying to snap our fingers and say,
[01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:12.880]   okay, I'm now going to be a more altruistic person
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.380]   because I can decide that right now,
[01:18:14.380 --> 01:18:16.280]   but then ultimately I have to engage
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:21.020]   in some altruistic behaviors to lend support to that.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:23.000]   Again, same with the parallel
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:24.120]   that I can't just snap my fingers
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:25.640]   and say lower blood pressure.
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:27.300]   I have to do some meditative practices,
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:30.120]   some cardiovascular training and things of that sort.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:33.680]   What is this function of self thing?
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:36.280]   What goes into the functions of self?
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:40.100]   - Okay, so just stepping back to the framing, right?
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:45.100]   So there are these two pillars upon which we build our lives.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:49.060]   The structure of self and the function of self.
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:50.420]   And we've been talking, as you said,
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.440]   more about the structure, which is more the nouns of it.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:55.300]   Like there is an unconscious.
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:57.080]   What is in that unconscious?
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.460]   For example, there are defense mechanisms.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.060]   How are we using them?
[01:19:02.060 --> 01:19:03.680]   Like it's not all nouns, but it's more,
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.280]   what are those things?
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.520]   And then we start talking about
[01:19:06.520 --> 01:19:08.200]   how we put them into practice.
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.820]   The function of self is much more the verbs, right?
[01:19:10.820 --> 01:19:12.320]   So if the structure is more nouns,
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.880]   the function is more the verbs, right?
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:16.640]   The actual engagement, right?
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:20.200]   So that would start with an awareness of I.
[01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.920]   So a function of self has to start with an awareness
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:25.920]   that like there's a person, there is a me
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:28.840]   that is separate from others, right?
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:32.120]   And I have responsibility for this I, right?
[01:19:32.120 --> 01:19:34.300]   Like it is me, no one else is guiding it.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:37.560]   Like it's me, I know there's a me, okay?
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.960]   Then on top of that,
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:41.600]   we start seeing defense mechanisms in action, right?
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.840]   'Cause we're thinking about function, right?
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:45.680]   We're aware that there's an I.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:47.920]   But the first thing that starts happening to that I
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.920]   are unconscious things, right?
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:51.320]   So the defense mechanisms,
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   because we're not choosing them, right?
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.360]   They start doing things automatically.
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.360]   So if, for example, I have a defense of avoidance, right?
[01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:03.400]   Then I'm not thinking, you know,
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.640]   if it's I'd like to meet a new person,
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:09.020]   but I automatically am shying away, right?
[01:20:09.020 --> 01:20:10.920]   Then that's not, it's not good, right?
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.380]   It's a factor, right?
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:14.600]   But it's a factor I'm not aware of
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:17.480]   until I start this process of introspecting, right?
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:19.680]   So the defense mechanisms are then
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:23.640]   kind of determining the lay of the land, right?
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.540]   - So in that example, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:26.880]   but it's hard to interrupt. - Yeah, please, yeah.
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.760]   - But in that example,
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:31.680]   the turning away you describe as reflexive.
[01:20:31.680 --> 01:20:33.600]   So you're talking about someone,
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:35.440]   perhaps who would like to have a romantic partner
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:38.160]   or meet somebody, have a companion,
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:40.000]   and they go to the grocery store
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.520]   and somebody says something
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:42.700]   as they're reaching for the milk.
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:44.500]   And, you know, there's that moment of opportunity
[01:20:44.500 --> 01:20:45.660]   where they could say something back,
[01:20:45.660 --> 01:20:47.460]   but instead they just kind of go, "Oh yeah, thanks."
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.080]   And then they kind of move away.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:51.180]   And then the narrative in their head might be,
[01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:54.280]   "Oh gosh, that was silly."
[01:20:54.280 --> 01:20:57.980]   But they don't really think about the alternate possibility.
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:20:59.600]   - Or there might be no narrative.
[01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.680]   - But they just head off to the produce section.
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.480]   - Yeah, and then they go home and someone says,
[01:21:04.480 --> 01:21:05.900]   "Oh, did anything happen at the grocery store?"
[01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:06.940]   "Did you meet anyone at the grocery store?"
[01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.140]   "No."
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:09.820]   Right, because- - It's all unconscious.
[01:21:09.820 --> 01:21:10.660]   - Right. - Okay.
[01:21:10.660 --> 01:21:13.720]   - Right, now again, can we explore that and change that?
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:16.260]   Yes, right, but it's important to understand
[01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.320]   that whatever that nest of defense mechanisms is,
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.640]   like, that's what I've got right now, right?
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:24.580]   And I'm living through that right now, right?
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:26.600]   It's performing a function, right?
[01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.260]   Just because it's an unconscious function
[01:21:28.260 --> 01:21:32.100]   doesn't mean it's not a very, very important function.
[01:21:32.100 --> 01:21:33.500]   - I can see in that example
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.780]   how it protects the conscious mind from risk,
[01:21:35.780 --> 01:21:38.020]   because there's always the possibility of rejection.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:39.960]   There's a possibility of over-interpretation
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:43.160]   of what the other person is talking to them for, right?
[01:21:43.160 --> 01:21:44.400]   Is the person interested in them
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.120]   or whether or not this is just friendly banter
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:50.620]   of the sort that anyone would have next to anybody,
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:52.360]   that it's not special to them.
[01:21:52.360 --> 01:21:56.240]   So I can see how the unconscious turning away
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:59.720]   is protective against all the negative possibilities,
[01:21:59.720 --> 01:22:01.980]   and in some sense is pretty rational,
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:05.060]   because the probability that that one interaction
[01:22:05.060 --> 01:22:07.960]   could ratchet up to a life of companionship
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.960]   and romance with somebody is exceedingly small, really.
[01:22:12.960 --> 01:22:14.980]   - Although you could imagine a set of data points
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:19.040]   where you string together, you know, like five-second clips,
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:21.540]   you know, like the time something like that has happened,
[01:22:21.540 --> 01:22:24.780]   right, so maybe this is a person that, you know,
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:27.340]   intermittently, like, people are interested in them,
[01:22:27.340 --> 01:22:29.660]   or saying, "Hey," or saying, "Hello," or showing interest.
[01:22:29.660 --> 01:22:31.140]   You could string all those together,
[01:22:31.140 --> 01:22:33.380]   and the person hasn't noticed one of them, right,
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:34.940]   and then could have a very negative scene.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:37.980]   Nobody, no one wants me, no one's interested in me,
[01:22:37.980 --> 01:22:40.160]   or whatever the person is saying,
[01:22:40.160 --> 01:22:43.140]   but like, it's different if you see from the outside.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:45.300]   Like, it's objectively different,
[01:22:45.300 --> 01:22:47.340]   but that person doesn't know,
[01:22:47.340 --> 01:22:51.640]   and that's why after an awareness, there is an I.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.640]   The next thing that I think of in the function of self
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:59.160]   is the defense mechanisms in action.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:00.260]   - What are some other examples
[01:23:00.260 --> 01:23:01.940]   of defense mechanisms in action?
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:05.780]   Because I think there's immense interest in this.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:10.360]   You know, the idea that we have unconscious processes in us
[01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:12.940]   that are reaching up out of the iceberg
[01:23:12.940 --> 01:23:16.200]   and preventing us from seeing our life and ourselves
[01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:19.060]   the way that it actually is occurring,
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:22.460]   and perhaps preventing us from achieving these ideals
[01:23:22.460 --> 01:23:25.960]   of agency and gratitude, empowerment and humility.
[01:23:25.960 --> 01:23:28.860]   You know, I mean, these seem like very powerful
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:30.420]   and important forces,
[01:23:30.420 --> 01:23:32.860]   and I and I know many other people out there
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:35.860]   want to understand whether or not what we're doing
[01:23:35.860 --> 01:23:37.660]   and what we're feeling and experiencing,
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:40.420]   whether or not that is serving us well or not.
[01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:43.100]   - So I think the place to start is to say
[01:23:43.100 --> 01:23:47.020]   that there's something very, very complicated going on.
[01:23:47.020 --> 01:23:49.340]   The part of the iceberg underneath the surface, right,
[01:23:49.340 --> 01:23:52.140]   that biological supercomputer that's running
[01:23:52.140 --> 01:23:54.920]   at a million thoughts and a million actions
[01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:57.700]   and a million internal processes a second, right,
[01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:01.300]   is constantly shifting our defensive structure.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:04.100]   So it's complicated, and you can almost imagine
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:05.820]   that like one leaves and another comes in
[01:24:05.820 --> 01:24:07.560]   and they're shifting and there's a little bit of one
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:08.860]   and some of another.
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:11.180]   So it's a very complicated process,
[01:24:11.180 --> 01:24:13.900]   but we can look at it and understand.
[01:24:13.900 --> 01:24:17.420]   So an example of a defense mechanism that's very common
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:21.300]   and can cause us a lot of problems is projection, right?
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:23.780]   So I'll give two examples of projection.
[01:24:23.780 --> 01:24:28.180]   So one is the experience of sitting in a car, right,
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:31.660]   and being stuck in traffic, being a little bit late,
[01:24:31.660 --> 01:24:33.680]   and feeling beleaguered, right?
[01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:37.100]   I mean, this has happened to me more times than I can count,
[01:24:37.100 --> 01:24:39.500]   but at some point I started through my own therapy
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.780]   looking at like what's going on in me, right,
[01:24:41.780 --> 01:24:43.500]   when I'm doing this, right?
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.700]   So the thing about feeling beleaguered, right,
[01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:47.940]   as if what does that mean?
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:50.980]   Like there's something called traffic that exists
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:54.340]   and has a mind and wants to thwart me, right?
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:56.140]   Is it individual cars?
[01:24:56.140 --> 01:24:58.500]   Is it the people in the cars, right?
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:01.300]   What's going on is I'm having a perception of hostility.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:02.920]   I feel beleaguered, right?
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.300]   But it's anger and frustration inside of me, right?
[01:25:06.300 --> 01:25:08.500]   I'm the one feeling angry and frustrated.
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:11.580]   There's no one and nothing but me
[01:25:11.580 --> 01:25:14.180]   that's feeling anything about this, right?
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:17.900]   But I have this sense of the world around me being hostile
[01:25:17.900 --> 01:25:21.940]   because I'm projecting my anger outward, right?
[01:25:21.940 --> 01:25:23.760]   Now, I think this isn't good
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:26.860]   because instead of sitting in traffic and saying,
[01:25:26.860 --> 01:25:30.520]   look, maybe it totally makes sense that I'm stuck in traffic
[01:25:30.520 --> 01:25:32.100]   and that I'm not happy.
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.120]   Like maybe I should leave a little bit earlier
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:36.920]   and I wouldn't be late, or if I'm going to work,
[01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.140]   should I live closer to work?
[01:25:38.140 --> 01:25:40.240]   I could make a whole set of decisions
[01:25:40.240 --> 01:25:41.940]   that I'm not making, right?
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:45.540]   Or maybe I know, I thought it was gonna be a 15-minute drive
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.020]   and like there was an accident, right?
[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:48.740]   And okay, there are things that I can't control.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:50.460]   I'm not supposed to control everything, right?
[01:25:50.460 --> 01:25:53.660]   If you think about what can I control, being aware of that,
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:55.940]   and what can I not control, right?
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.900]   Then it can make the situation much better
[01:25:57.900 --> 01:26:00.260]   so this doesn't happen with this frequency.
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:04.220]   And it also takes away the anger and the frustration, right?
[01:26:04.220 --> 01:26:07.820]   So I think that's a good example because it happens a lot.
[01:26:07.820 --> 01:26:09.140]   It's very, very common.
[01:26:09.140 --> 01:26:12.340]   But projection then also happens with people, right?
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:14.180]   So let's say you and I work together
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:17.180]   and we're gonna do something collaborative together
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.800]   and I'm just not having a good day
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:22.340]   and something negative happened before I came to work
[01:26:22.340 --> 01:26:24.020]   and I'm not at my best
[01:26:24.020 --> 01:26:27.420]   and I'm a little bit irritable and frustrated, right?
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:28.460]   This happens all the time
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:30.660]   where then the person sits down with someone
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.300]   and then I'm being irritable and frustrated
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.340]   which doesn't feel good to you, right?
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:37.980]   And you may become irritable and frustrated, right?
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.460]   And then I say, oh look, he's irritable and frustrated, right?
[01:26:40.460 --> 01:26:44.940]   But even if you don't, the fact that I feel that way, right?
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:47.860]   That projection often would lead me
[01:26:47.860 --> 01:26:49.740]   to think that it's you who's that way.
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:51.500]   Here I come wanting to do this job
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:52.540]   and you're not at your best.
[01:26:52.540 --> 01:26:54.500]   It's me who's not at my best, right?
[01:26:54.500 --> 01:26:57.020]   But we do this all the time
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:27:01.020]   and then we make incorrect or inaccurate attributions, right?
[01:27:01.020 --> 01:27:05.420]   So projection is an example of a defense mechanism
[01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:10.180]   that can cause us a lot of trouble, right?
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.300]   A lot of trouble.
[01:27:11.300 --> 01:27:13.300]   Another can be displacement
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:17.220]   where if I'm feeling anger or frustration,
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:19.460]   say in a certain realm,
[01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.780]   then the idea of feeling it at work
[01:27:21.780 --> 01:27:23.420]   and then kicking the dog, right?
[01:27:23.420 --> 01:27:25.100]   Like it's not good that we do that.
[01:27:25.100 --> 01:27:27.460]   We're not acknowledging what's going on inside of us at work,
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:29.300]   what we could change, what we could make better
[01:27:29.300 --> 01:27:31.460]   and the dog doesn't want to be kicked, right?
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:34.780]   And the dog is often also the family, right?
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:37.420]   And it could be physical or it could be through words, right?
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:40.740]   But the idea that there's something negative being generated
[01:27:40.740 --> 01:27:45.340]   in us, but inside we're perceiving
[01:27:45.340 --> 01:27:47.460]   that it's coming from somewhere else, right?
[01:27:47.460 --> 01:27:49.300]   I mean, the thought would be it's all things
[01:27:49.300 --> 01:27:50.780]   to lead us astray, right?
[01:27:50.780 --> 01:27:52.660]   When there are negative defenses, right?
[01:27:52.660 --> 01:27:56.580]   There can be positive defenses too, such as altruism, right?
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:28:00.180]   That someone could do something negative to me, right?
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:02.940]   And instead of me passing that along,
[01:28:02.940 --> 01:28:05.900]   I could decide, no, I'm gonna do something nice
[01:28:05.900 --> 01:28:07.460]   for the next person I have an opportunity
[01:28:07.460 --> 01:28:09.180]   to do something nice for, right?
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.660]   Like that's a defense.
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:12.860]   So sometimes we could think of it and decide that way,
[01:28:12.860 --> 01:28:14.500]   but there are people who react that way.
[01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:16.260]   Like there's something negative that happens
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:19.380]   and they respond with something that's different from that.
[01:28:19.380 --> 01:28:21.820]   So defense mechanisms can work against us,
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.940]   they can work for us, they're complicated,
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:25.420]   they're combinations of them,
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:27.580]   but we can look inside and say, for example,
[01:28:27.580 --> 01:28:30.380]   if I'm using projection all the time, right?
[01:28:30.380 --> 01:28:31.900]   And I think everyone around me
[01:28:31.900 --> 01:28:34.260]   is kind of always angry and frustrated, right?
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:35.780]   And there's always bad traffic, right?
[01:28:35.780 --> 01:28:38.820]   But then as we start to talk about it more,
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:42.020]   it becomes apparent that there's a lot I'm angry about,
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:43.860]   right, but I'm not aware of it.
[01:28:43.860 --> 01:28:46.900]   Then reflection or therapy, right,
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:50.460]   or a good friend we're talking to can help us see, right,
[01:28:50.460 --> 01:28:54.080]   that, hey, this is going on inside of me, right?
[01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.940]   And that can really help us.
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:57.020]   Same with use of humor.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:58.220]   Like if I'm using humor
[01:28:58.220 --> 01:29:01.920]   and I'm kind of decompressing uncomfortable situations
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.380]   or things that make me feel uncomfortable,
[01:29:03.380 --> 01:29:06.060]   maybe that greases the wheels of social progress,
[01:29:06.060 --> 01:29:08.340]   but maybe over time,
[01:29:08.340 --> 01:29:11.600]   I come to use humor in a way that's self-denigrating, right?
[01:29:11.600 --> 01:29:14.260]   Well, that's not so good anymore,
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:17.100]   but I may not be aware of the shift
[01:29:17.100 --> 01:29:19.700]   just 'cause I can maybe be funny in certain situations
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:22.340]   that I'm now not using that for myself anymore,
[01:29:22.340 --> 01:29:23.780]   I'm using it against myself.
[01:29:23.780 --> 01:29:26.380]   And by talking to people, by reflection,
[01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:29.380]   like we can be aware of the defensive structure
[01:29:29.380 --> 01:29:31.200]   that's going on inside of us,
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:33.760]   and then there's not an automaticity to it.
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:36.700]   If you point out that I'm using projection a lot,
[01:29:36.700 --> 01:29:38.960]   I can start to be aware of that.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:40.780]   Just like if someone,
[01:29:40.780 --> 01:29:43.460]   let's say you were with me at the grocery store, right,
[01:29:43.460 --> 01:29:45.660]   and someone says something nice and I shy away
[01:29:45.660 --> 01:29:47.420]   and you say, hey, you know,
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:49.860]   you weren't even aware someone said hello to you.
[01:29:49.860 --> 01:29:52.360]   And then I say, I want to be more aware of that.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:55.060]   Like I don't want that thing to happen unconsciously.
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:56.440]   So maybe now I think, okay,
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:58.900]   anytime someone I don't know says something to me,
[01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:01.280]   I'm going to just stop and think like, what's going on here?
[01:30:01.280 --> 01:30:02.120]   Right?
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.200]   Is that person being friendly to me?
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:04.760]   Is it, are they just, you know,
[01:30:04.760 --> 01:30:06.800]   it's just a person exchanging money at the cash register,
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:07.980]   like what's going on?
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:11.560]   So we take what's unconscious and we make it conscious
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:12.900]   so that we can change it.
[01:30:12.900 --> 01:30:15.960]   - Sounds to me like exploring and thinking
[01:30:15.960 --> 01:30:19.440]   about our reflexes is what's really key here.
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:23.180]   The example of displacement that you gave,
[01:30:23.180 --> 01:30:24.320]   you know, kicking the dog.
[01:30:24.320 --> 01:30:26.520]   I couldn't help but smile,
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:28.340]   not because I think it's a good thing to do.
[01:30:28.340 --> 01:30:30.440]   I never once kicked my dog, by the way, folks.
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:31.520]   Terrible thing to do.
[01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.040]   Also, he was the size of a boulder.
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:34.800]   It would have injured me more than it would have injured him,
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.440]   but I never would do such a thing.
[01:30:36.440 --> 01:30:40.920]   However, in academia, there's this phenomenon.
[01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:44.680]   It's very common that I refer to as trickle-down anxiety
[01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:46.820]   where the person running the laboratory
[01:30:46.820 --> 01:30:49.160]   is inevitably under a tremendous amount of stress,
[01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:51.080]   grants and papers, et cetera.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:52.980]   And graduate students and postdocs
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:55.260]   will immediately be familiar with what I'm describing.
[01:30:55.260 --> 01:30:57.720]   But for those of you that haven't gone
[01:30:57.720 --> 01:31:00.540]   to graduate school, this will be a little bit foreign,
[01:31:00.540 --> 01:31:01.780]   but you'll think of other examples
[01:31:01.780 --> 01:31:04.740]   where when the lab head is under stress,
[01:31:04.740 --> 01:31:08.480]   it's incredibly common for lab heads
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:09.820]   to walk through the laboratory
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:11.500]   and start asking about experiments
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:13.200]   and telling people to do additional experiments
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.560]   and basically just assigning busy work to people
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:20.340]   or pressuring what simply cannot be moved along any faster.
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:21.540]   And when I was a graduate student,
[01:31:21.540 --> 01:31:24.000]   I worked for somebody who was the exact opposite
[01:31:24.000 --> 01:31:25.200]   of this phenotype.
[01:31:25.200 --> 01:31:26.300]   When I was a postdoc, frankly,
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.860]   I worked with someone who was a little bit of that phenotype,
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:31.140]   although I still liked working for him very much.
[01:31:31.140 --> 01:31:33.620]   But I used to have a response that at least for me
[01:31:33.620 --> 01:31:35.580]   was adaptive, which was, I would always say,
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:37.740]   I'm working as fast as I carefully can
[01:31:37.740 --> 01:31:40.840]   because no scientist ever wants somebody to cut corners,
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:42.540]   no good scientist anyway.
[01:31:42.540 --> 01:31:45.820]   But trickle-down anxiety is common in every occupation,
[01:31:45.820 --> 01:31:46.660]   I think.
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.220]   We see this sort of displacement all the time
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.380]   where someone's anxious and so they go start creating
[01:31:51.380 --> 01:31:52.920]   anxiety for other people.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.220]   I mean, you can just, as you're describing,
[01:31:55.220 --> 01:31:56.900]   I was just seeing how pathologic that is
[01:31:56.900 --> 01:31:58.060]   for everybody involved.
[01:31:58.060 --> 01:32:01.100]   - So the academic, the trickle-down anxiety
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.900]   that you were just talking about is it's a related,
[01:32:03.900 --> 01:32:06.360]   but it's a different defense mechanism.
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.000]   It's projective identification, right?
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:13.580]   Which is causing others to feel the way that you feel
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.700]   in order to get your needs met, right?
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:17.260]   - Is this a form of projection?
[01:32:17.260 --> 01:32:20.400]   And actually, perhaps you could clarify the definition
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:22.940]   of projection versus displacement
[01:32:22.940 --> 01:32:24.860]   versus projective identification.
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:26.980]   - Yeah, so projection is when you don't own it.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:30.100]   So it's not me who's mad, it's you, right?
[01:32:30.100 --> 01:32:32.340]   So I don't own that I'm mad at all, right?
[01:32:32.340 --> 01:32:33.300]   I just think that it's you
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.540]   even though I'm the one who's mad, right?
[01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.820]   Displacement is what comes out of us
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:41.620]   or what our attribution can shift, right?
[01:32:41.620 --> 01:32:44.740]   It's not this person who's making me angry,
[01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:47.460]   it's that person 'cause that's a safer person, right?
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:49.460]   To be angry at, right?
[01:32:49.460 --> 01:32:52.760]   Or if I'm then going to take out my anger, right?
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:55.040]   Instead of metaphorically kicking the person
[01:32:55.040 --> 01:32:58.240]   who might respond to me in a way I don't want,
[01:32:58.240 --> 01:33:01.280]   maybe I kick the dog that's helpless to respond back, right?
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:02.540]   So that's displacement.
[01:33:02.540 --> 01:33:06.600]   Projective identification is there's an expression
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:08.720]   of an emotional state inside of a person
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.100]   that then becomes contagious to other people
[01:33:11.100 --> 01:33:13.280]   even though the person isn't trying to do that.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:14.880]   The person says, "I'm gonna make you anxious."
[01:33:14.880 --> 01:33:17.080]   That's not a defense mechanism anymore, right?
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.440]   So here's an example I think.
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.920]   I think this is the best example of projective identification.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:23.280]   So for a little bit of time at work,
[01:33:23.280 --> 01:33:25.960]   I would occasionally lose my keys, right?
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:29.400]   So then I'm trying to go and I can't find my keys, right?
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:30.960]   So I say, "Oh, I don't know where my keys are."
[01:33:30.960 --> 01:33:32.480]   So I start expressing something, right?
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.320]   And I'm anxious and I'm tense, right?
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:36.720]   Now people around me hear that, right?
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:38.320]   And what do they start feeling?
[01:33:38.320 --> 01:33:41.120]   They start feeling anxious and tense the way that I do,
[01:33:41.120 --> 01:33:41.960]   right?
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:44.480]   And now they're like, "Well, now they wanna find my keys."
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:47.700]   They wanna help me so that I stop spreading anxiety
[01:33:47.700 --> 01:33:51.220]   and tension into the whole environment around me, right?
[01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:53.220]   So then they helped me find my keys.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:54.060]   I say, "Thank you."
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:57.260]   My own emotional state comes down and upon reflection,
[01:33:57.260 --> 01:33:59.900]   I think, "Look, I don't wanna do that," right?
[01:33:59.900 --> 01:34:02.740]   I got my, I'm getting my needs met
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:05.380]   by making other people feel in a way
[01:34:05.380 --> 01:34:07.580]   that's like not a good or comfortable way to feel.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:08.680]   So here's a way around that,
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:12.220]   like put my keys in the same place every day, right?
[01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:15.160]   So then I can avoid that because it doesn't feel good to me.
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.340]   Like then if I get out to my car, like I find, you know,
[01:34:17.340 --> 01:34:18.740]   I'm a little bit, I'm breathing a little heavy.
[01:34:18.740 --> 01:34:19.660]   Like I don't, it doesn't feel good
[01:34:19.660 --> 01:34:21.260]   'cause I was just agitated, right?
[01:34:21.260 --> 01:34:23.620]   And I did that to other people too, right?
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:27.340]   So it's an example of how projective identification works.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:29.820]   And it's kind of a simple example, but it shows,
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.100]   it's happening all the time.
[01:34:31.100 --> 01:34:33.340]   You know, all these things are happening all the time,
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:34.780]   but we can become aware of it.
[01:34:34.780 --> 01:34:35.960]   Then I don't lose my keys.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:36.800]   I don't have to feel bad about it.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.180]   I don't have to activate myself for no reason.
[01:34:39.180 --> 01:34:41.520]   And I don't have to activate other people for no reason.
[01:34:41.520 --> 01:34:43.080]   So sort of thinking and reflecting,
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.460]   like change that thing for the better.
[01:34:45.460 --> 01:34:47.880]   And it can do it with much bigger things too.
[01:34:47.880 --> 01:34:50.260]   - Thank you for those clarifications.
[01:34:50.260 --> 01:34:52.140]   I'd like to touch on humor for a moment.
[01:34:52.140 --> 01:34:54.140]   Obviously humor is a wonderful thing
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:34:55.700]   or can be a wonderful thing.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:35:00.940]   I've also seen a lot of examples of where very smart
[01:35:00.940 --> 01:35:02.380]   and or accomplished people,
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:06.740]   because those are not always the same thing,
[01:35:06.740 --> 01:35:11.300]   use sarcasm as a form of humor.
[01:35:11.300 --> 01:35:12.860]   And it can be very funny,
[01:35:12.860 --> 01:35:16.040]   but I have to imagine based on everything
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:16.960]   I'm hearing from you today,
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.260]   that there's a form of sarcasm,
[01:35:19.260 --> 01:35:20.860]   which is an unhealthy defense.
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:23.300]   I'm thinking of the person that no matter
[01:35:23.300 --> 01:35:26.240]   what someone else says that's positive
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:28.460]   or no matter what someone does
[01:35:28.460 --> 01:35:31.040]   that could be viewed as positive,
[01:35:31.040 --> 01:35:32.840]   they find some way to diminish it
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:35.700]   by kind of like through sarcastic humor.
[01:35:35.700 --> 01:35:37.900]   I see this a lot.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:42.740]   And I think closely nested with sarcasm is cynicism.
[01:35:42.740 --> 01:35:45.780]   In fact, I have a family member,
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:48.900]   I won't name who they are to protect the not so innocent,
[01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.820]   who used to be very cynical.
[01:35:50.820 --> 01:35:54.500]   And I want to ask, what is the thing about cynicism?
[01:35:54.500 --> 01:35:55.580]   And they said, well,
[01:35:55.580 --> 01:36:00.380]   I have had a particular genre of schooling growing up,
[01:36:00.380 --> 01:36:05.380]   a formal schooling where if anyone behaved too happy,
[01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:09.220]   expressed too much happiness rather, too much delight,
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.380]   they were viewed as stupid.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:14.180]   Like as if to be happy is to be unaware
[01:36:14.180 --> 01:36:17.580]   of the sophistication and the importance
[01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:19.940]   of things in life, right?
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:22.420]   And I hope that this is unrelatable
[01:36:22.420 --> 01:36:23.500]   to most people listening,
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:28.100]   but I do think that sarcasm is a double-edged blade
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:28.940]   in this sense.
[01:36:28.940 --> 01:36:33.940]   And that cynicism is perhaps a double-edged blade as well,
[01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:36.340]   but that it might even be worse than sarcasm
[01:36:36.340 --> 01:36:40.620]   because it's a way of really reflecting back what's,
[01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.420]   by definition, what's not good about life,
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:45.500]   what's not good about what's happening.
[01:36:45.500 --> 01:36:47.700]   And it does seem protective, right?
[01:36:47.700 --> 01:36:49.700]   It protects one from disappointment.
[01:36:49.700 --> 01:36:50.940]   If you're already disappointed,
[01:36:50.940 --> 01:36:52.840]   how could you be further disappointed?
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.500]   It's also seems to me like a bit of a power move.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:56.460]   It's like, you're going to be happy.
[01:36:56.460 --> 01:36:58.840]   Well, I'm going to take that away from everybody.
[01:36:58.840 --> 01:37:00.940]   Like as something that's like for myself.
[01:37:02.780 --> 01:37:04.420]   Does any of this actually hold
[01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:07.480]   in the inside of the clinical literature?
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.020]   Because again, I enjoy a good sarcastic joke.
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:12.920]   In fact, there's a collaboration around a sarcastic joke.
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:15.460]   It can be truly funny to everybody,
[01:37:15.460 --> 01:37:18.340]   but sarcasm and cynicism,
[01:37:18.340 --> 01:37:21.000]   I feel like are often used to cut down
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:26.000]   what would otherwise be benevolence or bonding experiences.
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:27.580]   - Absolutely.
[01:37:27.580 --> 01:37:29.340]   Look, I grew up in central New Jersey.
[01:37:29.340 --> 01:37:31.580]   Humor is a weapon, right?
[01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:33.220]   Or it certainly can be, right?
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:36.320]   And people can be very aggressive through humor.
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:40.060]   So acting out, which is just letting our aggression flow,
[01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:41.780]   right, that's a defense, right?
[01:37:41.780 --> 01:37:45.780]   So just being aggressive and pushing someone back, right?
[01:37:45.780 --> 01:37:48.860]   However that means, like if I don't feel good about myself,
[01:37:48.860 --> 01:37:51.120]   I want you to feel not so good about yourself, right?
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.500]   Is where we start getting into envy, right?
[01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:55.180]   And humor can be used that way.
[01:37:55.180 --> 01:37:59.060]   So that sort of biting sarcastic humor
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.220]   is a form of acting out.
[01:38:01.220 --> 01:38:02.820]   It's a form of aggression, right?
[01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:05.320]   It's not humor as a healthy defense, right?
[01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.380]   We can call it the same thing,
[01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:08.260]   but we could also call it different things.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:09.900]   It's just a nuance of our language, right?
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:13.220]   If humor can be a defense, like I trip and fall,
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:14.160]   I make a little joke,
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:17.340]   people are laughing with me instead of at me, right?
[01:38:17.340 --> 01:38:18.400]   Hey, humor is a good defense.
[01:38:18.400 --> 01:38:19.380]   I made myself feel better.
[01:38:19.380 --> 01:38:21.780]   It made things flow more easily.
[01:38:21.780 --> 01:38:26.540]   But if I'm using sarcastic humor to assail someone, right,
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:29.620]   then it's not that thing anymore, right?
[01:38:29.620 --> 01:38:32.500]   And now it's a manifestation of aggression, right?
[01:38:32.500 --> 01:38:36.580]   And the idea that cynicism is more,
[01:38:36.580 --> 01:38:38.300]   then we're just talking about a worldview, right?
[01:38:38.300 --> 01:38:40.540]   Like sarcasm is something that can be done now.
[01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.740]   Like we can make a sarcastic joke, funny or not,
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:43.940]   then it's over, right?
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:47.540]   But cynicism is a way of coming at the world
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:49.500]   that is a different kind of defense, right?
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:52.460]   The idea that, hey, it's like the fox and the sour grapes.
[01:38:52.460 --> 01:38:55.700]   Like I don't think there's anything good to be had anyway,
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:56.540]   right?
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:57.660]   So you can't take anything away from me.
[01:38:57.660 --> 01:38:59.460]   You can't make me feel worse, right?
[01:38:59.460 --> 01:39:02.500]   I already feel very, very bad about the world
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.660]   and about everybody in it.
[01:39:03.660 --> 01:39:05.900]   And I'm protecting myself that way.
[01:39:05.900 --> 01:39:08.060]   Like that's then an unhealthy defense.
[01:39:08.060 --> 01:39:09.060]   'Cause what does that lead to?
[01:39:09.060 --> 01:39:10.100]   It leads to isolation.
[01:39:10.100 --> 01:39:11.540]   It leads to mistrust.
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:13.860]   You know, we know that people are happy
[01:39:13.860 --> 01:39:15.940]   if they live through altruism and gratitude
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:17.820]   and they're well-connected with others.
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:22.020]   So the cynical point of view, which again, to some degree,
[01:39:22.020 --> 01:39:24.300]   being in the world builds some cynicism in us, right?
[01:39:24.300 --> 01:39:25.280]   Like that's okay.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.500]   That's part of awareness in some sense.
[01:39:28.500 --> 01:39:29.860]   But I think what you're talking about
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:32.360]   is a very pervasive cynicism
[01:39:32.360 --> 01:39:34.660]   that then is an unhealthy defense
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:36.620]   that is very harmful to others.
[01:39:36.620 --> 01:39:39.460]   The idea that I feel lousy about everything.
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:42.140]   And if you don't, I'm gonna try and bring you down, right?
[01:39:42.140 --> 01:39:43.200]   Like too much happiness.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.700]   We'll label that as something, right?
[01:39:44.700 --> 01:39:46.200]   We could label it as stupid, right?
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:48.420]   So now it's like, it's not okay to be happier
[01:39:48.420 --> 01:39:51.060]   than some sort of cynical baseline, right?
[01:39:51.060 --> 01:39:53.740]   And again, there's nothing about altruism and gratitude.
[01:39:53.740 --> 01:39:54.980]   Like that's not happy, right?
[01:39:54.980 --> 01:39:57.500]   I mean, who's happy in that situation?
[01:39:57.500 --> 01:39:59.760]   The people who are overly cynical are not happy
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:01.600]   and the people around them are not happy.
[01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:02.480]   Nobody's happy.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:06.340]   - Thanks for the clarification on New Jersey.
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:09.620]   A good portion of my biological family is from New Jersey.
[01:40:09.620 --> 01:40:10.460]   - Come out well-armed.
[01:40:10.460 --> 01:40:12.460]   - I adore them, but it's true.
[01:40:12.460 --> 01:40:15.100]   There was once a moment at a family gathering
[01:40:15.100 --> 01:40:19.740]   where somebody said, "Oh, let's, let's hug or something."
[01:40:19.740 --> 01:40:22.740]   And the reaction was like, "Oh, we're gonna hug now."
[01:40:22.740 --> 01:40:27.740]   You know, it was entirely sarcastic and cynical
[01:40:27.740 --> 01:40:30.180]   and the hug that resulted from that
[01:40:30.180 --> 01:40:32.580]   was this like little like distant hats kind of thing.
[01:40:32.580 --> 01:40:35.060]   It was, now I'm laughing about it and it's funny
[01:40:35.060 --> 01:40:36.980]   and they're very loving people, but you're right.
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:41.380]   It's a different style of humor and discourse.
[01:40:41.380 --> 01:40:43.020]   So you've been talking about these two pillars
[01:40:43.020 --> 01:40:44.940]   of the self and who we are
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:47.820]   and how things play out in the world for us
[01:40:47.820 --> 01:40:50.500]   as the structure of self and the function of self.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.900]   And in terms of the function of self,
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:56.040]   you described self-awareness, this notion
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.500]   or this realization that there is an I, there's a me.
[01:40:59.500 --> 01:41:01.400]   And then we've been talking about defense mechanisms
[01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:04.220]   in action and how these play out in the real world,
[01:41:04.220 --> 01:41:05.620]   both positive and negative.
[01:41:05.620 --> 01:41:09.340]   It seems to me that a lot of what is happening here
[01:41:09.340 --> 01:41:11.900]   in terms of understanding the function of self
[01:41:11.900 --> 01:41:15.820]   has to do with like what we pay attention to
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:18.860]   and like where we place our efforts
[01:41:18.860 --> 01:41:21.420]   or choose to not place our attention
[01:41:21.420 --> 01:41:22.820]   and not place our efforts.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:23.740]   Do I have that right?
[01:41:23.740 --> 01:41:24.580]   - Right.
[01:41:24.580 --> 01:41:27.800]   Yeah, salience is a huge concept in,
[01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:29.820]   I think in human existence, right?
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:32.540]   I mean, there are thousands upon thousands of things
[01:41:32.540 --> 01:41:35.820]   that you or I could be paying attention to right now, right?
[01:41:35.820 --> 01:41:37.980]   But we're not paying attention to anything
[01:41:37.980 --> 01:41:39.340]   except what we're doing right here.
[01:41:39.340 --> 01:41:44.220]   So we are gating out so many other thoughts, ideas,
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.700]   narratives inside.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.500]   Now, if something were to shift very quickly,
[01:41:47.500 --> 01:41:49.060]   if we heard a loud noise, right?
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:51.020]   Our attention would shift, right?
[01:41:51.020 --> 01:41:53.320]   So our attention is it's focused.
[01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:55.000]   We're salient to one another
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.980]   because this is what we've chosen
[01:41:56.980 --> 01:41:58.620]   and we're focusing our minds.
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:01.220]   And we are also somewhere inside of us
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.380]   aware that we could shift away from it
[01:42:03.380 --> 01:42:05.540]   if something more important like something dangerous
[01:42:05.540 --> 01:42:06.640]   like were to happen, right?
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.340]   So it lets us be here and be salient to one another
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:11.460]   and have this conversation, right?
[01:42:11.460 --> 01:42:14.940]   But in the course of life, what's salient to us,
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:18.380]   it's so complicated and determined by so many factors
[01:42:18.380 --> 01:42:21.780]   that it's absolutely worth a lot of attention to.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:24.300]   So one example is so many people
[01:42:24.300 --> 01:42:26.580]   have a negative internal dialogue
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.920]   that's running in them over and over again,
[01:42:28.920 --> 01:42:31.940]   or they're running through images, events.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.620]   They may be traumatic events
[01:42:33.620 --> 01:42:35.380]   or things that they're not happy with,
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:37.740]   images of themselves in negative ways
[01:42:37.740 --> 01:42:42.660]   that these internal narratives or internal images
[01:42:42.660 --> 01:42:46.700]   can become so strong that there's no room for anything else.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:49.780]   So an example would be a person
[01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:53.220]   who really, really loved music, right?
[01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:56.620]   And could have, just in addition to enjoying music,
[01:42:56.620 --> 01:42:59.680]   like had like good thoughts while listening to music.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.520]   Like, you know what?
[01:43:00.520 --> 01:43:02.420]   I could go do this, right?
[01:43:02.420 --> 01:43:05.940]   And had a history of like that really working out well,
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:07.500]   like following his interests
[01:43:07.500 --> 01:43:10.700]   and like really creating sort of goodness in his life, right?
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:12.960]   Who now was going for long drives,
[01:43:12.960 --> 01:43:15.860]   like longer than would be needed to go somewhere,
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:18.940]   get something like, why the extra time in the car?
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:20.880]   And I had had a presumption,
[01:43:20.880 --> 01:43:23.420]   okay, the person's listening to music and thinking,
[01:43:23.420 --> 01:43:25.060]   but it doesn't quite add up.
[01:43:25.060 --> 01:43:26.580]   And then I learned that the person
[01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:28.900]   is not listening to music, right?
[01:43:28.900 --> 01:43:30.560]   That they're using that time
[01:43:30.560 --> 01:43:33.280]   so that the internal narrative, right?
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:36.860]   Which was a very, very negative, repeated internal negative.
[01:43:36.860 --> 01:43:37.820]   You're not gonna get anywhere,
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:40.100]   you're not gonna make anything of yourself, right?
[01:43:40.100 --> 01:43:42.900]   It could be there in his mind, right?
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:45.220]   So it was a form of self-punishment, right?
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:48.260]   It was a form of taking the anger and frustration inside
[01:43:48.260 --> 01:43:50.820]   and enacting it towards himself.
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:53.380]   And that was so salient
[01:43:53.380 --> 01:43:57.060]   that this person could not see his way to any goodness.
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:59.140]   Like nothing could change.
[01:43:59.140 --> 01:44:00.540]   Nothing could get any better.
[01:44:00.540 --> 01:44:04.140]   Like felt very sure and very resolved about that.
[01:44:04.140 --> 01:44:06.860]   And the answer was, yeah, that's right, right?
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:11.340]   Nothing can get any better with this constant mantra
[01:44:11.340 --> 01:44:13.380]   running over and over again.
[01:44:13.380 --> 01:44:15.140]   But things can get better, right?
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:18.780]   If that becomes less salient over time
[01:44:18.780 --> 01:44:22.360]   and your own thoughts and reflections become more salient.
[01:44:22.360 --> 01:44:24.700]   So at the other end of that shift,
[01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:27.300]   you know, that narrative that was still there,
[01:44:27.300 --> 01:44:28.380]   but it was weakened, right?
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:30.540]   Because it takes time to really change things.
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:32.120]   So it was very much weakened.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:34.220]   The person was listening to music again.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:36.540]   Those thoughts had kind of come back to the surface
[01:44:36.540 --> 01:44:38.500]   and they were being sort of jumbled, you know,
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:40.940]   in ways that brought new and interesting thoughts
[01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:42.060]   coming from them.
[01:44:42.060 --> 01:44:44.380]   And the person was in an entirely different place
[01:44:44.380 --> 01:44:47.540]   and like completely changed their life, right?
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:49.780]   I mean, this is true, right?
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:50.980]   It's a dramatic example,
[01:44:50.980 --> 01:44:53.100]   but dramatic examples inform us, right?
[01:44:53.100 --> 01:44:55.200]   Where the salience shifted
[01:44:55.200 --> 01:44:58.120]   and then the life shifted after that.
[01:44:58.120 --> 01:45:01.700]   - What you're describing in terms of the specific example
[01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:03.960]   doesn't resonate with me in terms of my own experience.
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:06.160]   Although, as you pointed out, it's very striking.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:07.360]   It's very dramatic.
[01:45:07.360 --> 01:45:11.160]   But it resonates with me from a different perspective.
[01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.140]   I'm not seeking a free clinical session here,
[01:45:14.140 --> 01:45:18.120]   but to give meat to the example
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:20.700]   I'm about to ask you for insight on,
[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:23.600]   I've never allowed myself to stay
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:27.100]   in a bad professional situation for very long.
[01:45:27.100 --> 01:45:28.740]   You know, when things didn't feel right
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:31.860]   or when I sensed someone I was working with or for
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.200]   wasn't the right situation, I got out,
[01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:36.460]   despite if I were to really think about it,
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:40.200]   there could have been pretty severe long-term consequences.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.580]   Fortunately, it all worked out.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:43.440]   In fact, so much so that I would say,
[01:45:43.440 --> 01:45:46.900]   you know, I pay attention to whether or not
[01:45:46.900 --> 01:45:48.380]   people I work with and for
[01:45:48.380 --> 01:45:50.740]   are of the sort that I want to be working with.
[01:45:50.740 --> 01:45:52.520]   And if I sense a particular type of danger,
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.820]   I'll look at that.
[01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:58.260]   And I'm 100% so far, knock on wood,
[01:45:58.260 --> 01:46:01.540]   but 100% so far on recognizing later
[01:46:01.540 --> 01:46:03.740]   that it was a great decision to move on.
[01:46:03.740 --> 01:46:06.740]   And on the flip side of it, I've made, I believe,
[01:46:06.740 --> 01:46:09.480]   excellent decisions in terms of who to work with,
[01:46:09.480 --> 01:46:11.060]   in terms of my podcasting,
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:13.300]   in terms of my academic career, et cetera.
[01:46:13.300 --> 01:46:15.140]   But I've had to move away from people
[01:46:15.140 --> 01:46:17.320]   that just weren't right for me.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:18.860]   I don't think they were truly bad actors,
[01:46:18.860 --> 01:46:20.700]   but thank goodness I moved away.
[01:46:20.700 --> 01:46:23.420]   And thank goodness I found these other
[01:46:23.420 --> 01:46:24.920]   wonderful people to work with.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.940]   However, there are circumstances
[01:46:28.940 --> 01:46:32.980]   that have been repetitive in my life where I've,
[01:46:32.980 --> 01:46:37.860]   just to be honest, repeatedly made not good decisions
[01:46:37.860 --> 01:46:40.540]   about who to be involved with
[01:46:40.540 --> 01:46:42.820]   over fairly long periods of time.
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:44.540]   And there can even be an awareness,
[01:46:44.540 --> 01:46:46.060]   or I should say there has been an awareness,
[01:46:46.060 --> 01:46:48.040]   like this isn't a good situation.
[01:46:48.040 --> 01:46:50.260]   And yet I'm persisting in seeking out this
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:52.460]   in similar types of situations.
[01:46:52.460 --> 01:46:56.300]   So I consider myself at least partially rational human being
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:58.120]   with some degree of introspection.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:01.600]   You know, when I look at this and I think,
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:06.520]   okay, this is a choice to focus on placing myself in,
[01:47:06.520 --> 01:47:08.740]   I have to assume placing myself into situations
[01:47:08.740 --> 01:47:11.140]   that are challenging for me,
[01:47:11.140 --> 01:47:13.620]   in a way that I know is preventing me
[01:47:13.620 --> 01:47:15.460]   from living in certain ways that I want
[01:47:15.460 --> 01:47:18.580]   and from being "happy" in certain ways that I want.
[01:47:18.580 --> 01:47:20.180]   When you hear a scenario like that,
[01:47:20.180 --> 01:47:22.340]   like I can do it over here,
[01:47:22.340 --> 01:47:24.620]   but I can't seem to do it over here.
[01:47:24.620 --> 01:47:28.100]   In fact, I see myself doing it the wrong way here, right?
[01:47:28.100 --> 01:47:30.240]   A little bit different than the example you gave a moment ago
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.820]   because the guy was driving to work, not listening to music,
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:34.740]   but wasn't putting two and two together
[01:47:34.740 --> 01:47:36.060]   about what was going on.
[01:47:36.060 --> 01:47:38.800]   But when somebody can see what's going on,
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:41.640]   I think this might even be called the repetition compulsion
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:45.180]   or sometimes, you know, what is that about?
[01:47:45.180 --> 01:47:48.420]   Are people trying to work out something specific
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.460]   or are they deliberately creating some friction
[01:47:50.460 --> 01:47:53.120]   to accomplish something else, right?
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:55.520]   I mean, I realize this could be infinitely complex.
[01:47:55.520 --> 01:48:00.520]   And again, I'm not trying to extract the clinical insight
[01:48:00.520 --> 01:48:01.760]   for my own sake.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:03.300]   - I started the clock on that.
[01:48:03.300 --> 01:48:04.140]   - Thank you.
[01:48:04.140 --> 01:48:08.220]   But I think a lot of people do this.
[01:48:08.220 --> 01:48:11.820]   They do what they know they shouldn't be doing.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:15.640]   They know they shouldn't be doing it.
[01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:18.220]   Duh, I just said that, two ways.
[01:48:18.220 --> 01:48:21.940]   And, but they do it, like it must serve them in some way.
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:25.300]   You know, you think about when you get a dog
[01:48:25.300 --> 01:48:27.780]   and you talk to a dog trainer, they say, you know,
[01:48:27.780 --> 01:48:30.160]   a dogs do what works, right?
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:31.480]   They get a reward for doing something
[01:48:31.480 --> 01:48:33.300]   and they're going to continue doing it.
[01:48:33.300 --> 01:48:35.220]   You apply that to the same sort of thing
[01:48:35.220 --> 01:48:36.420]   I'm describing for myself
[01:48:36.420 --> 01:48:38.100]   and that I've observed in other people.
[01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:40.420]   And you must say, it must work for them.
[01:48:40.420 --> 01:48:42.100]   You hear this in kind of pop psychology,
[01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:43.420]   like it must work for them.
[01:48:43.420 --> 01:48:45.300]   Like it must be solving something.
[01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:48.980]   Why the hell do I do this?
[01:48:48.980 --> 01:48:50.620]   Why do people do this?
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:53.380]   Is it real pathology or is it a roundabout way
[01:48:53.380 --> 01:48:57.340]   to get to something else that's actually pretty adaptive?
[01:48:57.340 --> 01:48:59.060]   - I mean, instead of defining it as pathology,
[01:48:59.060 --> 01:49:00.580]   I would not define it as pathology.
[01:49:00.580 --> 01:49:02.700]   I would define it as humanness.
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.920]   If humanness is not in and of itself pathological,
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:09.060]   then all you're doing there is describing something
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:12.340]   that is common widespread across human beings.
[01:49:12.340 --> 01:49:14.040]   Now, it doesn't mean we can't understand it
[01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.540]   and make it healthier, right?
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:17.980]   I work in a discipline that wants to put a number
[01:49:17.980 --> 01:49:18.980]   on everything, right?
[01:49:18.980 --> 01:49:21.420]   Label it as something and then do something about it
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:24.220]   that's more often than not ineffective, right?
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:27.180]   Because we're not looking at things in a top-down way
[01:49:27.180 --> 01:49:29.100]   of what is human experience?
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:32.340]   What are the natural aspects of human experience
[01:49:32.340 --> 01:49:34.240]   that are less than ideal, right?
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.900]   That we can then understand and make better.
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:39.820]   If we come at it that way, then we see ah,
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:42.180]   this is a great example because here's where structure
[01:49:42.180 --> 01:49:43.540]   meets function, right?
[01:49:43.540 --> 01:49:45.140]   So on the structure side, we say, okay,
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:48.080]   there's defense mechanisms and we imagine the branches,
[01:49:48.080 --> 01:49:51.240]   right, that are coming up from the unconscious mind, right?
[01:49:51.240 --> 01:49:53.040]   And here it meets function, right?
[01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:56.300]   Defense mechanisms in action on the function side,
[01:49:56.300 --> 01:49:58.400]   then determining salience.
[01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:00.620]   So what I would imagine in your example,
[01:50:00.620 --> 01:50:03.560]   my image is that your defensive structure
[01:50:03.560 --> 01:50:06.420]   when you're doing the thing that's effective, right,
[01:50:06.420 --> 01:50:09.120]   the professional decisions, right, looks elegant, right?
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:12.300]   Like there's harmony to where those branches are.
[01:50:12.300 --> 01:50:14.180]   The consciousness is sitting in between it.
[01:50:14.180 --> 01:50:17.160]   You can see the elegance to it, right?
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:20.820]   That I can just imagine shifting, right,
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:25.580]   when you're not doing the thing effectively, right?
[01:50:25.580 --> 01:50:28.780]   Because now you're using an entirely different
[01:50:28.780 --> 01:50:31.260]   defensive structure, which is gonna function differently
[01:50:31.260 --> 01:50:32.540]   and create different salience.
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:35.640]   And I imagine that it's convoluted and, you know,
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:36.900]   that it's sort of piecemeal,
[01:50:36.900 --> 01:50:39.280]   that it's not something elegant, right?
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:41.240]   So you say, okay, what does that actually mean?
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:43.860]   Let's translate it into what are the actual defenses.
[01:50:43.860 --> 01:50:46.700]   So let's think about what you're not doing
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:48.320]   when you're making good decisions
[01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.800]   in the professional realm, right?
[01:50:49.800 --> 01:50:52.900]   You are not using denial or avoidance
[01:50:52.900 --> 01:50:55.800]   or rationalization or projection
[01:50:55.800 --> 01:50:59.200]   or projective identification or acting out, right?
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.820]   There are all these things that you are not doing
[01:51:01.820 --> 01:51:05.480]   that are the sort of unhealthy defenses beckoning to us.
[01:51:05.480 --> 01:51:06.460]   Like, oh, wouldn't it be easier
[01:51:06.460 --> 01:51:08.460]   to kick the can down the road, right?
[01:51:08.460 --> 01:51:10.220]   You know, wouldn't it be easier to just say,
[01:51:10.220 --> 01:51:11.100]   no, no, everything's okay.
[01:51:11.100 --> 01:51:12.740]   Everything's gonna work out okay.
[01:51:12.740 --> 01:51:16.820]   Wouldn't it be easier instead of being angry at one person
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:18.900]   who is really intrinsic to the environment,
[01:51:18.900 --> 01:51:20.840]   if you, you know, it's actually somebody else, you know,
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.660]   are you displacing and projecting?
[01:51:22.660 --> 01:51:24.080]   That's how people,
[01:51:24.080 --> 01:51:26.180]   that's how we get ourselves into trouble, right?
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:28.460]   And if that's going on,
[01:51:28.460 --> 01:51:33.460]   then that set of defense mechanisms in action, right,
[01:51:33.460 --> 01:51:36.900]   creates something that obscures the ability
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:38.200]   to make good judgment, right?
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:40.580]   But with none of those things going on,
[01:51:40.580 --> 01:51:41.820]   then what are you doing?
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:43.340]   What, you're applying your intelligence,
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:45.380]   you're applying your discernment, right?
[01:51:45.380 --> 01:51:47.840]   You're applying your desire to make things better.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:49.480]   You're able to look at it.
[01:51:49.480 --> 01:51:52.160]   You're able to bring diligence, perseverance, right?
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:55.220]   You're able to bring healthy aspects of self
[01:51:55.220 --> 01:51:57.200]   to the question and decide like,
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:00.020]   oh, I don't want this and it should be different, right?
[01:52:00.020 --> 01:52:01.740]   And there again, what's going on?
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:03.800]   There's a complexity under the surface,
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:06.900]   but now we're coming up towards simplicity, right?
[01:52:06.900 --> 01:52:08.680]   We're coming up towards the things that are healthier,
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:09.820]   that are simplistic.
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:11.980]   If we look then, okay, what's going on
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:15.040]   if you're making the same mistakes over and over again?
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.380]   Well, we could, you know,
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.500]   we would dive under the hood and really look
[01:52:18.500 --> 01:52:20.280]   and say, okay, what are you doing there?
[01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:23.120]   But it has to be an array of unhealthy defenses.
[01:52:23.120 --> 01:52:24.720]   There's no other thing it could be.
[01:52:24.720 --> 01:52:28.440]   So we would say, okay, are you using avoidance?
[01:52:28.440 --> 01:52:29.860]   Maybe a little, maybe a lot.
[01:52:29.860 --> 01:52:31.000]   What about denial?
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:32.760]   What about rationalization?
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:33.840]   What about projection?
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:36.640]   Like, you know, you go through the unhealthy defenses
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:40.440]   and you see what is it that you're bringing to bear
[01:52:40.440 --> 01:52:41.760]   that is leading you astray.
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:46.460]   And then of course the goal is to use the role modeling
[01:52:46.460 --> 01:52:49.620]   and you role model for yourself how to be healthy, right?
[01:52:49.620 --> 01:52:51.100]   So let's take that role modeling
[01:52:51.100 --> 01:52:54.080]   and apply it to the thing you're sort of carving out
[01:52:54.080 --> 01:52:56.100]   and treating differently.
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:57.100]   And that's the reason
[01:52:57.100 --> 01:52:59.940]   when people talk about repetition compulsions,
[01:52:59.940 --> 01:53:01.740]   you know, it's not a formal term
[01:53:01.740 --> 01:53:06.260]   because what we're really talking about is repetition, right?
[01:53:06.260 --> 01:53:08.920]   And we're interested in like, why do we repeat things?
[01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:12.200]   Now that's one reason, right?
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:14.900]   Because we bring an unhealthy set of defenses
[01:53:14.900 --> 01:53:18.020]   and then at the end of the day, things come out the same
[01:53:18.020 --> 01:53:20.620]   because we're bringing an unhealthy set of defenses, right?
[01:53:20.620 --> 01:53:22.600]   There can be other motivations
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:25.220]   that are related to all of that
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.820]   and there's getting this complexity to it.
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:29.460]   But the compulsion part can be
[01:53:29.460 --> 01:53:33.460]   that we can reenter situations that didn't go well
[01:53:33.460 --> 01:53:36.300]   with the idea that we're gonna fix
[01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:37.380]   what happened in the past.
[01:53:37.380 --> 01:53:38.740]   We're gonna make ourselves feel better.
[01:53:38.740 --> 01:53:41.320]   We're gonna take away the mark of trauma
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:43.580]   'cause remember trauma doesn't care about the clock
[01:53:43.580 --> 01:53:44.640]   or the calendar.
[01:53:44.640 --> 01:53:45.920]   So that's why you'll see someone
[01:53:45.920 --> 01:53:48.560]   who has had say five abusive relationships
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:51.180]   that looked very much the same, right?
[01:53:51.180 --> 01:53:54.400]   And is about to enter the sixth, right?
[01:53:54.400 --> 01:53:57.560]   And you say, it's not because, hopefully in most cases,
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:00.640]   it's not 'cause that person like wants to be hurt, right?
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:02.580]   I mean, sometimes it's a different problem, right?
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:05.580]   But there can be a drive inside of us
[01:54:05.580 --> 01:54:07.000]   to try and fix something.
[01:54:07.000 --> 01:54:08.500]   If I can make it work this time,
[01:54:08.500 --> 01:54:11.660]   I won't have to feel so bad about the other five, right?
[01:54:11.660 --> 01:54:13.720]   - So an attempt to change the past
[01:54:13.720 --> 01:54:16.340]   through one's current actions.
[01:54:16.340 --> 01:54:18.380]   - Right, which is rooted in the limbic system
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:20.660]   and how trauma affects us
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.140]   and how, again, it's outside the clock and the calendar.
[01:54:23.140 --> 01:54:25.820]   So that kind of magic, so to speak, can happen
[01:54:25.820 --> 01:54:28.040]   so the brain can seek that magic.
[01:54:28.040 --> 01:54:30.820]   But again, there are unhealthy defenses coming into play,
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:33.180]   right, there has to be denial, right?
[01:54:33.180 --> 01:54:35.620]   Otherwise the person would map,
[01:54:35.620 --> 01:54:37.160]   if the same thing happened five times
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:38.520]   and this looks the same,
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:40.380]   it's probably gonna happen now, right?
[01:54:40.380 --> 01:54:45.380]   So anytime you think a person, most often it's us, right?
[01:54:45.380 --> 01:54:48.980]   Is smart enough or worldly enough to like know better,
[01:54:48.980 --> 01:54:50.920]   which happens all the time, right?
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:52.740]   Then look for the answer, right?
[01:54:52.740 --> 01:54:54.740]   You say, well, shouldn't that person know better
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:57.620]   than to get into the sixth abusive relationship?
[01:54:57.620 --> 01:54:59.280]   The answer is like, yes, right?
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:01.020]   Like, because it's not that hard
[01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:03.360]   if you saw a set of circumstances five times
[01:55:03.360 --> 01:55:06.060]   to map that the sixth is gonna have the same outcome, right?
[01:55:06.060 --> 01:55:08.740]   The person would do that in other scenarios, right?
[01:55:08.740 --> 01:55:10.220]   So then you say, right, that is true.
[01:55:10.220 --> 01:55:15.220]   So now let's look for why the person doesn't recognize that.
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:18.000]   And again, we go down into the structure of self
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:21.000]   and the function of self, defense mechanisms and actions,
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:23.460]   salience, the things that we're talking about now,
[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:24.860]   does that fit?
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:25.700]   - Yeah, it makes sense.
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:29.520]   And what comes to mind is the idea of getting into a car
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:32.720]   that you know is going to get into an accident
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:34.880]   over and over and over again,
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:39.580]   but being quite cognizant of safety and its importance
[01:55:39.580 --> 01:55:41.900]   in every other domain of life.
[01:55:41.900 --> 01:55:45.500]   Not even jaywalking, but getting into,
[01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:48.780]   like if certain Ubers arrived with a little flashing light
[01:55:48.780 --> 01:55:51.660]   that said this ride is gonna have an accident,
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.380]   it's like getting into that vehicle.
[01:55:53.380 --> 01:55:55.340]   And I see this in others as well.
[01:55:55.340 --> 01:55:58.420]   And it raises all sorts of questions like,
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:02.860]   is the person actually unconsciously afraid
[01:56:02.860 --> 01:56:05.460]   of the vehicle arriving where they wanna go?
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:06.900]   Because then like,
[01:56:06.900 --> 01:56:10.020]   are people actually afraid of things working out?
[01:56:10.020 --> 01:56:11.740]   I mean, this gets to something that-
[01:56:11.740 --> 01:56:13.360]   - But that, I'm so sorry, can I say?
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:14.200]   - Yeah.
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:15.940]   - That's why you have to know the person, right?
[01:56:15.940 --> 01:56:17.700]   Like who is that person, right?
[01:56:17.700 --> 01:56:19.960]   Why do they not wanna get in that car, right?
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:21.500]   Are they afraid they're not gonna get somewhere?
[01:56:21.500 --> 01:56:23.040]   Are they afraid they're gonna get somewhere, right?
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.260]   But ultimately we're looking for unhealthy defenses.
[01:56:26.260 --> 01:56:28.180]   And I'd still wanna emphasize that,
[01:56:28.180 --> 01:56:32.100]   that I will often think that the aspect of my education
[01:56:32.100 --> 01:56:35.300]   that's most helpful in me doing my job,
[01:56:35.300 --> 01:56:38.500]   when I'm in the job as a practicing psychiatrist
[01:56:38.500 --> 01:56:41.060]   is actually my mathematics minor, right?
[01:56:41.060 --> 01:56:44.280]   Because there's a lot more math to this, right?
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:47.000]   People tend to think, oh, mental health, it's all esoteric.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.860]   And you can sort of say anything you want
[01:56:49.860 --> 01:56:51.620]   and there's no way of proving or disproving.
[01:56:51.620 --> 01:56:53.780]   It's not like that at all, right?
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:55.900]   There's a mathematical aspect to it.
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:57:00.900]   So if you do the correct logical common sense thing, right?
[01:57:01.460 --> 01:57:03.700]   In all aspects of your life, except one,
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.520]   and you're like 100 times more intelligent
[01:57:06.520 --> 01:57:09.220]   than you need to be to figure it all out, right?
[01:57:09.220 --> 01:57:11.280]   Then if there's a carve out, we say,
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:13.940]   look, that's of huge interest, right?
[01:57:13.940 --> 01:57:15.820]   I mean, the probability that we're gonna find
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:18.460]   something interesting, there's 100%, right?
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:19.980]   Because we know that you know better,
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:23.160]   we know that you do better, but why here?
[01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:24.940]   So like, that's so interesting, right?
[01:57:24.940 --> 01:57:26.380]   Like that's where the X marks the spot,
[01:57:26.380 --> 01:57:28.040]   like let's go dig there, right?
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.600]   So then when we go and dig there,
[01:57:29.600 --> 01:57:32.280]   like we're gonna find something, right?
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:33.780]   And we'll say, what is that?
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.180]   Like do we find that like, oh, it's an array
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:38.120]   of really unhealthy defense mechanisms.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:39.580]   Maybe we find that.
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:42.960]   Do we find that there's a deep unconscious motivation, right?
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:45.440]   Like we might find that too, right?
[01:57:45.440 --> 01:57:47.720]   We might find a lot of things, right?
[01:57:47.720 --> 01:57:49.560]   But we're going to find them.
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:57:52.740]   If we go back to what is the structure of self?
[01:57:52.740 --> 01:57:54.020]   What is the function of self?
[01:57:54.020 --> 01:57:56.700]   If we go and look like that X marks the spot
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:58.760]   means there's pay dirt there, right?
[01:57:58.760 --> 01:58:00.940]   And then when we figure that out,
[01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:03.940]   then we go through and we can make things change.
[01:58:03.940 --> 01:58:06.180]   So if it's a deep seated trauma driven
[01:58:06.180 --> 01:58:08.900]   unconscious motivation that is resulting
[01:58:08.900 --> 01:58:11.460]   in an unhealthy array of defense mechanisms,
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:13.260]   well, let's go look at that, right?
[01:58:13.260 --> 01:58:14.300]   Let's look at the trauma.
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:16.160]   Let's take the thing that's unconscious
[01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:17.940]   and bring it to consciousness, right?
[01:58:17.940 --> 01:58:19.800]   Then we can make that better.
[01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.740]   And that array of unhealthy defenses,
[01:58:21.740 --> 01:58:23.720]   again, we're not gonna change it overnight,
[01:58:23.720 --> 01:58:27.320]   but can we change it very, very significantly,
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:29.380]   pretty rapidly? Probably yes.
[01:58:29.380 --> 01:58:32.340]   And we can almost entirely change it across time.
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:35.000]   So there's a mathematical aspect of this
[01:58:35.000 --> 01:58:38.420]   that I think is so important to point out
[01:58:38.420 --> 01:58:42.140]   because mental health, even as a field, right?
[01:58:42.140 --> 01:58:44.100]   We all want to be mentally healthy.
[01:58:44.100 --> 01:58:46.000]   Like there's a rhyme and reason to it
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.420]   that yes, it follows science
[01:58:47.420 --> 01:58:50.060]   and yes, it also follows common sense.
[01:58:50.060 --> 01:58:53.360]   And if we apply those things, we get to answers.
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:56.060]   - It's very reassuring.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:58:58.060]   - Thank you.
[01:58:58.060 --> 01:59:00.920]   - Thinking about the functions of self.
[01:59:00.920 --> 01:59:04.920]   And again, just to remind myself and other people,
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:07.000]   it starts with self-awareness,
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:09.160]   involves defense mechanisms in action.
[01:59:09.160 --> 01:59:11.720]   Then there's the salience piece,
[01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:13.760]   paying attention to what's inside of us
[01:59:13.760 --> 01:59:15.460]   as well as what's external.
[01:59:15.460 --> 01:59:19.720]   And then you're now describing a lot of choices,
[01:59:19.720 --> 01:59:22.420]   choice-making and behavior and action in the world.
[01:59:22.420 --> 01:59:25.360]   I have to assume that for the person
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:26.740]   trying to improve themselves
[01:59:26.740 --> 01:59:29.920]   and get to agency and gratitude,
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.400]   that paying attention to all of these is important.
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:35.840]   But of course, if a defense mechanism is unconscious,
[01:59:35.840 --> 01:59:37.140]   we can't simply decide, okay,
[01:59:37.140 --> 01:59:39.620]   I'm going to see the unconscious defense mechanism.
[01:59:39.620 --> 01:59:41.100]   Does that mean that we should ask ourselves
[01:59:41.100 --> 01:59:43.440]   about what is most salient to us?
[01:59:43.440 --> 01:59:47.960]   Or should we be focusing on our behavioral choices?
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:49.520]   I mean, in the example I just gave,
[01:59:49.520 --> 01:59:51.220]   I'm aware of my behavioral choices,
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:54.400]   making certain decisions to engage with certain people
[01:59:54.400 --> 01:59:56.080]   and not with others.
[01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:01.360]   But should I be asking, for instance,
[02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:03.220]   what's salient, like what are the thoughts
[02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:05.220]   leading up to that decision?
[02:00:05.220 --> 02:00:07.520]   In other words, how does salience
[02:00:07.520 --> 02:00:12.360]   of internal and external cues and processes
[02:00:12.360 --> 02:00:13.720]   relate to behavior?
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:16.400]   And which of these should we be paying attention to
[02:00:16.400 --> 02:00:18.920]   if our goal is to eventually change our behavior?
[02:00:18.920 --> 02:00:20.200]   - Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.880]   So think about what we're starting,
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:24.280]   we're sort of starting at the bottom, right?
[02:00:24.280 --> 02:00:26.760]   So we're starting with, okay, there is an I, right?
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:29.680]   And that's not just an apprehension, right?
[02:00:29.680 --> 02:00:31.100]   There's a lot to that, right?
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:32.720]   So for example, I know someone
[02:00:32.720 --> 02:00:35.120]   who is doing some mirror meditation,
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:36.720]   staring into the mirror, right?
[02:00:36.720 --> 02:00:40.160]   Looking back at self with a desire to be aware,
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.320]   like there is a me, like this me is in the world, right?
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:46.020]   - This is the first I've ever heard of such a practice,
[02:00:46.020 --> 02:00:49.160]   except when I was in elementary school,
[02:00:49.160 --> 02:00:50.220]   or maybe it was the ninth grade,
[02:00:50.220 --> 02:00:54.340]   I had a teacher who talked about, gave us an assignment
[02:00:54.340 --> 02:00:57.280]   to look in the mirror and ask ourselves questions.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:58.640]   But if I understand correctly,
[02:00:58.640 --> 02:01:00.020]   you think there's utility to people
[02:01:00.020 --> 02:01:02.500]   spending a few minutes or more looking in the mirror
[02:01:02.500 --> 02:01:04.360]   and thinking about oneself in the eye
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:06.540]   as a way to build up this self-awareness.
[02:01:06.540 --> 02:01:07.460]   Do I have that right?
[02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.460]   - If you want to take the best care of yourself
[02:01:09.460 --> 02:01:10.500]   that you can, right?
[02:01:10.500 --> 02:01:12.820]   You want to understand yourself the best you can.
[02:01:12.820 --> 02:01:15.760]   You want to make your life the best it can be, right?
[02:01:15.760 --> 02:01:17.460]   Then if there are answers, right?
[02:01:17.460 --> 02:01:18.420]   And let's say the answers
[02:01:18.420 --> 02:01:20.760]   are in five or 10 different cupboards, right?
[02:01:20.760 --> 02:01:22.260]   Look in all of them, right?
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:24.140]   I mean, that's the idea, right?
[02:01:24.140 --> 02:01:28.380]   That if we want to know something, look everywhere for it,
[02:01:28.380 --> 02:01:31.060]   and also realize what we are building, right?
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:33.100]   What we are creating may be a recipe.
[02:01:33.100 --> 02:01:35.840]   There may be things from different cupboards that overlap.
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:39.580]   So the way to translate that practically is to say,
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:43.020]   to find the answers to what is either ailing us,
[02:01:43.020 --> 02:01:45.140]   why we're repeating things we don't want to repeat,
[02:01:45.140 --> 02:01:46.320]   or even if things are going okay,
[02:01:46.320 --> 02:01:48.300]   but we want them to be going better
[02:01:48.300 --> 02:01:50.940]   because we don't quite feel the peace and contentment
[02:01:50.940 --> 02:01:53.580]   we want to feel, then look everywhere.
[02:01:53.580 --> 02:01:55.740]   So in the function of self,
[02:01:55.740 --> 02:01:59.700]   in the function of self, start with the I, right?
[02:01:59.700 --> 02:02:02.220]   There are ways of increasing self-awareness.
[02:02:02.220 --> 02:02:04.380]   They can range from contemplation of self,
[02:02:04.380 --> 02:02:07.340]   to meditation, to looking in the mirror, right?
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:08.500]   There are things that we can do
[02:02:08.500 --> 02:02:10.900]   to more strongly emphasize to ourself
[02:02:10.900 --> 02:02:15.060]   that there is an I and this I is going through life, right?
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:17.420]   Then we know that there are defense mechanisms
[02:02:17.420 --> 02:02:20.340]   and that they're present, that they're acting in us, right?
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:23.080]   We can't just see them because they're unconscious,
[02:02:23.080 --> 02:02:24.780]   but if we start thinking about them,
[02:02:24.780 --> 02:02:26.580]   we can learn about them, right?
[02:02:26.580 --> 02:02:28.400]   And that's where salience comes into play.
[02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.780]   Salience kind of points both ways, right?
[02:02:30.780 --> 02:02:34.280]   Salience can point us towards the unconscious mind, right?
[02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:37.020]   Oh, I realize I'm doing this over and over again,
[02:02:37.020 --> 02:02:39.500]   or I'm saying this thing to myself over and over again.
[02:02:39.500 --> 02:02:40.640]   Where is that coming from?
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:42.740]   We start becoming curious about ourselves,
[02:02:42.740 --> 02:02:45.140]   and we look to the unconscious mind,
[02:02:45.140 --> 02:02:47.380]   and then we also look to the conscious mind.
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:50.020]   That's why after salience is behavior.
[02:02:50.020 --> 02:02:52.380]   Like, what am I doing, right?
[02:02:52.380 --> 02:02:54.740]   And a lot of times we don't know,
[02:02:54.740 --> 02:02:58.100]   just examples of we don't know why we're doing things, right?
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:02:59.420]   Someone who wants to lose weight,
[02:02:59.420 --> 02:03:01.860]   but always goes to the grocery store and comes home
[02:03:01.860 --> 02:03:03.460]   and is like, has some sense of surprise
[02:03:03.460 --> 02:03:05.720]   that there are things there that they don't wanna eat, right?
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:07.860]   Like, why am I behaving in a certain way?
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:11.060]   Why does certain things bother me when other things don't?
[02:03:11.060 --> 02:03:13.380]   Right, why am I really touchy about one thing
[02:03:13.380 --> 02:03:14.740]   and not another?
[02:03:14.740 --> 02:03:17.260]   Why might there be things that bother others and not me
[02:03:17.260 --> 02:03:18.580]   or vice versa, right?
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:21.500]   So, we're looking at what's going on inside of us
[02:03:21.500 --> 02:03:23.460]   and then how we respond, right?
[02:03:23.460 --> 02:03:25.700]   Because what may be upsetting me
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:27.740]   or what's going on inside of me,
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:29.860]   both conscious and unconscious,
[02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:32.380]   is then determining how I'm acting,
[02:03:32.380 --> 02:03:34.740]   how I'm behaving in the world around me.
[02:03:34.740 --> 02:03:36.460]   If I want a better job,
[02:03:36.460 --> 02:03:38.620]   but I never take an interview for another job,
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:40.160]   I'm not gonna get another job.
[02:03:40.160 --> 02:03:41.940]   If I want a romantic partner,
[02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:44.940]   but I automatically turn away from anyone who smiles at me,
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:47.760]   I'm not gonna have a romantic partner, right?
[02:03:47.760 --> 02:03:49.180]   If I want life to be better
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:50.740]   and there's a certain thing I repeat
[02:03:50.740 --> 02:03:52.260]   and I don't wanna repeat that,
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:53.680]   I wanna understand myself better
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:55.500]   so I can change the behavior.
[02:03:55.500 --> 02:03:59.940]   And that's why the function of self ends with strivings, right?
[02:03:59.940 --> 02:04:01.500]   The strivings are into the future.
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:02.860]   I know there is an I.
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:03.980]   I know there's a network
[02:04:03.980 --> 02:04:06.740]   and web of defense mechanisms in action.
[02:04:06.740 --> 02:04:09.140]   I know that there's salience going on inside of me
[02:04:09.140 --> 02:04:11.020]   and I'm only gonna pay attention to a few things
[02:04:11.020 --> 02:04:13.140]   from the thousands I could pay attention to.
[02:04:13.140 --> 02:04:16.460]   I wanna be aware of that and have more control over that.
[02:04:16.460 --> 02:04:18.100]   Then I'm enacting behaviors.
[02:04:18.100 --> 02:04:20.460]   I'm engaging in the world around me
[02:04:20.460 --> 02:04:22.840]   and ultimately I want things, right?
[02:04:22.840 --> 02:04:24.140]   I want life to be better.
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:26.840]   I wanna have that feeling that you can get to.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:31.620]   I want to be in the state of agency and gratitude.
[02:04:31.620 --> 02:04:33.580]   So again, these two pillars,
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:36.320]   structure of self, function of self,
[02:04:36.320 --> 02:04:38.740]   that's where all the answers are.
[02:04:38.740 --> 02:04:40.340]   So there are all the cupboards, right?
[02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.700]   There are these five cupboards in the structure of self
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:44.100]   and five in the function of self.
[02:04:44.100 --> 02:04:47.100]   And I know we'll have it out there in a PDF, right?
[02:04:47.100 --> 02:04:48.340]   'Cause you can go back there
[02:04:48.340 --> 02:04:52.860]   and that's where the vast majority of answers are
[02:04:52.860 --> 02:04:56.900]   to both understanding and routes to change.
[02:04:56.900 --> 02:04:59.660]   - What you just described is incredibly helpful.
[02:04:59.660 --> 02:05:02.260]   It's absolutely apparent to me
[02:05:02.260 --> 02:05:04.980]   why looking at all the cupboards is so key.
[02:05:04.980 --> 02:05:08.020]   It's also apparent that many different aspects
[02:05:08.020 --> 02:05:09.740]   of psychology and psychiatry,
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:13.620]   at least as I understand them might probe,
[02:05:13.620 --> 02:05:15.700]   for instance, just at the level of behavior.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:17.720]   I think this is the just do it mantra.
[02:05:17.720 --> 02:05:20.420]   Well, just do the right thing, right?
[02:05:20.420 --> 02:05:22.460]   You're not finding a romantic partner.
[02:05:22.460 --> 02:05:23.860]   Schedule three dinners with friends
[02:05:23.860 --> 02:05:25.300]   and ask them to invite over people
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:26.120]   who are looking for partners.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:27.620]   Sounds really simple, right?
[02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:30.420]   But much as with the example of my friend
[02:05:30.420 --> 02:05:33.220]   who lost all this weight through behavioral change,
[02:05:33.220 --> 02:05:36.060]   the fear still lives within him very strongly.
[02:05:36.060 --> 02:05:38.700]   And so clearly there's some stuff happening underneath there.
[02:05:38.700 --> 02:05:40.500]   Now, fortunately he did lose the weight
[02:05:40.500 --> 02:05:41.680]   and he's kept most of it off,
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:44.320]   but it's clear to me that until he addresses
[02:05:44.320 --> 02:05:46.020]   some of these other issues of salience
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:48.960]   and defense mechanism, self-awareness, et cetera,
[02:05:48.960 --> 02:05:52.980]   that the fear he's still experiencing makes total sense
[02:05:52.980 --> 02:05:55.220]   because the foundation of that change
[02:05:55.220 --> 02:05:58.100]   is not nearly as strong as it could be.
[02:05:58.100 --> 02:05:59.820]   - Maybe, right?
[02:05:59.820 --> 02:06:01.220]   Or maybe he doesn't have to have the fear,
[02:06:01.220 --> 02:06:04.500]   but he's not gonna learn either one without the exploration.
[02:06:04.500 --> 02:06:06.180]   So he won't, if there is risk,
[02:06:06.180 --> 02:06:08.140]   he won't be able to avert the risk.
[02:06:08.140 --> 02:06:09.780]   And if there's not risk,
[02:06:09.780 --> 02:06:11.620]   he's then sort of laboring through life,
[02:06:11.620 --> 02:06:12.620]   which is difficult enough,
[02:06:12.620 --> 02:06:13.940]   without being worried about something
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:15.800]   you don't have to be worried about, right?
[02:06:15.800 --> 02:06:18.460]   So the process of inquiry will always make that better.
[02:06:18.460 --> 02:06:20.500]   - It's clear to me that his fear of regaining weight
[02:06:20.500 --> 02:06:23.260]   is absolutely sapping his enjoyment
[02:06:23.260 --> 02:06:25.340]   and his productivity in other domains of life.
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:26.540]   - So warrants attention, right?
[02:06:26.540 --> 02:06:29.180]   Because we're deciding in that sort of mathematical way,
[02:06:29.180 --> 02:06:31.280]   like it doesn't have to be that way.
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:32.720]   Doesn't mean it can change overnight,
[02:06:32.720 --> 02:06:35.820]   but it can be understood and it can be changed.
[02:06:35.820 --> 02:06:37.500]   - Well, it's for that reason and many other reasons
[02:06:37.500 --> 02:06:40.560]   that I'm very grateful that you explain these two pillars,
[02:06:40.560 --> 02:06:42.260]   structure of self and function of self
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:06:45.340]   and how these flow up to empowerment and humility
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:48.300]   and how those flow up to agency and gratitude.
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.820]   You've given us a set of ideals
[02:06:50.820 --> 02:06:53.300]   and a roadmap of how to get there
[02:06:53.300 --> 02:06:56.660]   and one that we're going to continue with in a moment here.
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:06:58.340]   I did want to reiterate what you said,
[02:06:58.340 --> 02:07:01.620]   which is that there is a PDF version of this structure,
[02:07:01.620 --> 02:07:05.300]   this roadmap of ideals and how to get there.
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:08.020]   That's been provided as a link in the show note captions.
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:09.740]   So people can refer to them there
[02:07:09.740 --> 02:07:11.500]   and in visual form if they like.
[02:07:11.500 --> 02:07:14.900]   - If you're interested in understanding yourself
[02:07:14.900 --> 02:07:16.620]   and in having goodness in your life,
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:18.620]   as much as you possibly can,
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:21.440]   then you're interested in the structure of the mind.
[02:07:21.440 --> 02:07:22.820]   And this means that you're interested
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:24.360]   in the unconscious mind,
[02:07:24.360 --> 02:07:27.260]   in all the things that go on a million things a second
[02:07:27.260 --> 02:07:30.300]   that we don't know or understand one by one,
[02:07:30.300 --> 02:07:34.300]   but that we can explore and understand better in total.
[02:07:34.300 --> 02:07:36.260]   We're also interested in the conscious mind,
[02:07:36.260 --> 02:07:37.760]   in being self-aware.
[02:07:37.760 --> 02:07:40.580]   We're interested in the array of defense mechanisms
[02:07:40.580 --> 02:07:43.020]   and whether or not they're elegant
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:45.180]   and light passes clearly through them
[02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:46.700]   or whether they're distorting light
[02:07:46.700 --> 02:07:48.740]   and creating misperception.
[02:07:48.740 --> 02:07:51.400]   If you're interested in the structure of the mind,
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:54.700]   then you're also interested in the character structure.
[02:07:54.700 --> 02:07:56.020]   What is your character structure?
[02:07:56.020 --> 02:07:57.720]   What is the nest around all of it?
[02:07:57.720 --> 02:07:59.500]   How do you interface with the world?
[02:07:59.500 --> 02:08:01.260]   And then you're interested in the self
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:03.740]   that you grow from that phenomenologically,
[02:08:03.740 --> 02:08:05.640]   meaning what is your experience of self?
[02:08:05.640 --> 02:08:07.460]   How does it feel to you?
[02:08:07.460 --> 02:08:11.680]   These are all important parts of this pillar
[02:08:11.680 --> 02:08:13.500]   of health and happiness.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:16.400]   The other pillar is the function of the mind.
[02:08:16.400 --> 02:08:17.680]   And of course there's overlap.
[02:08:17.680 --> 02:08:18.620]   There are different cupboards,
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:20.700]   but the cupboards all contain different ingredients
[02:08:20.700 --> 02:08:22.580]   that together make the recipe, right?
[02:08:22.580 --> 02:08:25.060]   So if we're interested in the function of the mind,
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:27.900]   then we wanna pay attention that there's an eye.
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:29.460]   We wanna be self-aware
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:32.060]   and we wanna cultivate self-awareness.
[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:34.920]   We're also interested in how those defense mechanisms work
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:36.540]   when they're in action, right?
[02:08:36.540 --> 02:08:39.360]   What's salient inside of us and outside of us?
[02:08:39.360 --> 02:08:41.400]   What are we paying attention to?
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:42.980]   How are we behaving?
[02:08:42.980 --> 02:08:44.180]   What are our strivings?
[02:08:44.180 --> 02:08:47.220]   Do we feel hopeful about ourselves and the world around us?
[02:08:47.220 --> 02:08:49.880]   And if we're interested in all of these things,
[02:08:49.880 --> 02:08:52.380]   we can't help but be respectful, right?
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:55.140]   Of just how complicated this is.
[02:08:55.140 --> 02:08:56.560]   Like life is difficult
[02:08:56.560 --> 02:08:59.580]   and understanding ourselves is difficult.
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:09:02.580]   You know, wonderful joy can come of living life,
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:05.860]   but it is hard and it's hard day by day.
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:09.020]   And trying to understand ourselves, going to these places,
[02:09:09.020 --> 02:09:12.140]   these pillars that hold the answers, right?
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:16.420]   They can't but make in us a respect for all of it, right?
[02:09:16.420 --> 02:09:19.900]   And the respect for ourselves, for others,
[02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:22.020]   brings with it humility, right?
[02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:25.560]   When we come to this point of looking at ourselves
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:28.940]   and exploring, then yes, we become empowered, right?
[02:09:28.940 --> 02:09:31.740]   Because we've gained a lot of knowledge, right?
[02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:33.840]   We're digging where the pay dirt is
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:35.620]   and we're figuring things out.
[02:09:35.620 --> 02:09:39.040]   And along with that empowerment comes humility,
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:41.500]   a respectfulness for how difficult all of this is,
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:43.360]   how complicated we are,
[02:09:43.360 --> 02:09:45.960]   how we can make happiness in our lives,
[02:09:45.960 --> 02:09:48.180]   but how it certainly isn't easy.
[02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:51.980]   And we take with us the empowerment and the humility
[02:09:51.980 --> 02:09:53.940]   and we express them, right?
[02:09:53.940 --> 02:09:57.420]   And if we're expressing empowerment and humility,
[02:09:57.420 --> 02:10:02.420]   we come to living through agency and gratitude.
[02:10:02.420 --> 02:10:05.420]   So here, both are active words.
[02:10:05.420 --> 02:10:07.380]   So agency, it's easier to see, right?
[02:10:07.380 --> 02:10:10.740]   It's an active word where I'm aware of my ability
[02:10:10.740 --> 02:10:13.780]   to project myself into the world around me.
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:16.780]   I know that I can't control everything, right?
[02:10:16.780 --> 02:10:19.820]   But I'm really trying to understand what can I control,
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:21.260]   right, how can I control it?
[02:10:21.260 --> 02:10:24.600]   What do my decisions now lead to in the future?
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:27.500]   So agency is very, very active, right?
[02:10:27.500 --> 02:10:30.060]   Gratitude is active too, right?
[02:10:30.060 --> 02:10:33.660]   We're bringing an active sense of gratitude,
[02:10:33.660 --> 02:10:36.620]   a sense of the amazingness that we're here
[02:10:36.620 --> 02:10:39.460]   and pride in ourselves and others for being here
[02:10:39.460 --> 02:10:42.660]   and trying to move forward as best we can.
[02:10:42.660 --> 02:10:44.580]   And then we bring that to our interactions.
[02:10:44.580 --> 02:10:47.380]   We're much more likely to have a kind gesture
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:49.300]   towards others instead of being angry.
[02:10:49.300 --> 02:10:51.560]   We're much more likely to have something compassionate
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:53.660]   to say, including to ourselves,
[02:10:53.660 --> 02:10:56.420]   than we are to have something angry to say.
[02:10:56.420 --> 02:10:59.260]   That gratitude accompanies agency.
[02:10:59.260 --> 02:11:03.260]   They're active words and they're active together.
[02:11:03.260 --> 02:11:06.660]   And if we're living life through agency and gratitude,
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:08.460]   I mean, there's a lot of wisdom about this.
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:10.580]   There's a lot that's been written and researched about this.
[02:11:10.580 --> 02:11:13.100]   And if you look at what is it telling us, right?
[02:11:13.100 --> 02:11:15.480]   Remember, things are getting simpler, right,
[02:11:15.480 --> 02:11:18.800]   as we're getting higher up the levels here, right?
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.780]   The unconscious mind is most complicated.
[02:11:20.780 --> 02:11:24.300]   Now we're at, hey, can we live our lives with agency
[02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:26.380]   and gratitude at the forefront?
[02:11:26.380 --> 02:11:28.140]   And what does it bring for us?
[02:11:28.140 --> 02:11:31.260]   And I think it brings what we are seeking,
[02:11:31.260 --> 02:11:33.180]   that we might say, okay, we're seeking happiness.
[02:11:33.180 --> 02:11:34.740]   And that can mean a lot of things,
[02:11:34.740 --> 02:11:35.900]   you know, a lot of different things.
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:37.140]   It can be a very active thing.
[02:11:37.140 --> 02:11:38.500]   Am I happy in the moment?
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:41.060]   And we can use happiness sometimes to distract ourselves.
[02:11:41.060 --> 02:11:43.160]   Like, happiness is important.
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:45.140]   But words, when people really think,
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:46.540]   like, what is it that they want
[02:11:46.540 --> 02:11:48.560]   or what is it that they have, right,
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.700]   if they're overjoyed to be alive?
[02:11:51.700 --> 02:11:54.660]   They're finding a sense of peace.
[02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:56.540]   They're finding contentment.
[02:11:56.540 --> 02:12:00.700]   They're finding delight, the ability to be delighted, right?
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:02.380]   This is what people want.
[02:12:02.380 --> 02:12:06.320]   Our human history and our searchings tell us this
[02:12:06.320 --> 02:12:09.000]   and our own experiences tell us this.
[02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:11.260]   And now it could lead a person to think,
[02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:12.600]   well, okay, what's going on?
[02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:14.560]   I mean, is this someone who's, you know,
[02:12:14.560 --> 02:12:16.260]   levitating at the top of a mountain?
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:17.960]   Like, is this just a state?
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:19.660]   Is this a state that people are in?
[02:12:19.660 --> 02:12:21.740]   And the answer is no.
[02:12:21.740 --> 02:12:23.580]   There'll be some times we could be in that state
[02:12:23.580 --> 02:12:24.820]   where we can feel peace.
[02:12:24.820 --> 02:12:27.260]   There's no tension inside of us, right?
[02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:28.700]   I could feel, I have times
[02:12:28.700 --> 02:12:30.260]   when I don't feel tension inside of me.
[02:12:30.260 --> 02:12:31.460]   There's contentment, there's peace.
[02:12:31.460 --> 02:12:34.460]   I don't have to drive towards anything, right?
[02:12:34.460 --> 02:12:37.600]   But it's not the passive experience of it
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:39.900]   because we are living life.
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:43.540]   It's that that feeling goes hand in hand
[02:12:43.540 --> 02:12:45.620]   with a drive within us,
[02:12:45.620 --> 02:12:48.640]   that when we're in this healthy place,
[02:12:48.640 --> 02:12:49.820]   we are living life.
[02:12:49.820 --> 02:12:51.400]   The decisions that we're making,
[02:12:51.400 --> 02:12:53.540]   what is putting the rubber to the road?
[02:12:53.540 --> 02:12:56.320]   It is a generative drive within us.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:58.740]   There is a drive to make things better,
[02:12:58.740 --> 02:13:01.120]   to understand, to explore.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:04.460]   And it's that drive that we access and cultivate.
[02:13:04.460 --> 02:13:09.000]   And synonymous with happiness is it's not just the state
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:11.440]   when people wanna be happy in that very, very general way.
[02:13:11.440 --> 02:13:16.440]   Yes, contentment, peace, delight,
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:19.420]   but they're happening as we're living life, right?
[02:13:19.420 --> 02:13:22.540]   As we're enacting a generative drive
[02:13:22.540 --> 02:13:25.300]   where we're looking at ourselves and the world around us
[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:26.900]   and we're interested in understanding.
[02:13:26.900 --> 02:13:29.920]   We're interested in making things better
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:32.480]   and that's the place that we're trying to get to.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:36.400]   I believe that with all my heart and my brain, right?
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:38.920]   My education, training, experience,
[02:13:38.920 --> 02:13:41.520]   and also experience living life.
[02:13:41.520 --> 02:13:45.000]   And for 20 years, doing this work with people
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:46.760]   tells me this is what we're seeking
[02:13:46.760 --> 02:13:51.240]   and it's an active way of experiencing ourselves
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:53.260]   and our place in life.
[02:13:53.260 --> 02:13:56.600]   - I love that because it merges both the nouns
[02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.580]   and the adjectives and the verbs, you know?
[02:13:59.580 --> 02:14:02.240]   And this notion of a generative drive to me
[02:14:02.240 --> 02:14:06.520]   is so compelling because I have the sense,
[02:14:06.520 --> 02:14:10.080]   and I hope I'm right, that we all have
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:12.360]   some sort of generative drive within us
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:14.160]   starting at an early stage.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:18.680]   Maybe it even starts as visual foraging
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:21.120]   or touching things with our hands as an infant
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.200]   and exploration of the world, right?
[02:14:23.200 --> 02:14:25.940]   Is what brings about the changes in the neural circuitry
[02:14:25.940 --> 02:14:28.640]   that allow us to engage even more
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:31.760]   and in progressively, on the one hand, narrower ways,
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:35.000]   but also with more richness and more detail.
[02:14:36.240 --> 02:14:38.400]   Could you tell us more about generative drive
[02:14:38.400 --> 02:14:42.040]   and how this shows up in different types of people?
[02:14:42.040 --> 02:14:44.280]   Is it always positive?
[02:14:44.280 --> 02:14:46.480]   Can there be too much of it?
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:47.820]   I certainly know a number of people
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:50.640]   who are addicted to work.
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:53.260]   Those of you listening, I'm raising my hand.
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:54.600]   But I would say nowadays,
[02:14:54.600 --> 02:14:56.480]   I'm not as addicted to work as I once was
[02:14:56.480 --> 02:14:59.280]   in the sense that I derive far more satisfaction
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:02.280]   from less work now,
[02:15:02.280 --> 02:15:05.200]   provided that the work is really in depth.
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:07.560]   I think that there were years in graduate school
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.440]   where I wanted to publish a bunch of papers
[02:15:09.440 --> 02:15:10.720]   and then quickly realized
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:15.200]   through the not so gentle persuasion of my mentors
[02:15:15.200 --> 02:15:18.240]   that like, let's just do the best possible work we can do.
[02:15:18.240 --> 02:15:20.560]   And there's so much more richness and experience
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.660]   and things to be gained from that.
[02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:27.660]   So I'm familiar with generative drive as I understand it,
[02:15:27.660 --> 02:15:29.020]   but maybe if you would,
[02:15:29.020 --> 02:15:31.640]   if you could flush out a bit of what generative drive is
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:36.160]   and does it arrive in parallel with or before
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:39.120]   we are able to access peace, contentment, and delight?
[02:15:39.120 --> 02:15:42.260]   Can it even be separated out from that?
[02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:46.440]   What is this generative drive?
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:50.000]   - Yeah, so drives are built into us.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:52.640]   So they're synonymous with our existence.
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:55.840]   Like if we exist, then we have the drive.
[02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:58.360]   I mean, that's how the drive is defined.
[02:15:58.360 --> 02:16:02.800]   And we understand going far back to psychodynamic
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:04.160]   and psychoanalytic roots
[02:16:04.160 --> 02:16:06.640]   and when people were really thinking hard
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:09.320]   about human beings and what's going on inside of us
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:12.160]   that we've sort of identified and then validated
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:14.460]   over the period of time since
[02:16:14.460 --> 02:16:17.100]   that we have aggressive drives within us
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:19.080]   and we have drives towards pleasure.
[02:16:19.080 --> 02:16:21.340]   Now, this often gets misunderstood that,
[02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:24.000]   so aggression can be,
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:26.680]   it can be active violent aggression, for example,
[02:16:26.680 --> 02:16:30.080]   but aggression can also be a sense of agency, right?
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:32.520]   The inaction of agency, like I want to do things,
[02:16:32.520 --> 02:16:33.720]   I want to change things,
[02:16:33.720 --> 02:16:36.720]   I want to make the world a different place, right?
[02:16:36.720 --> 02:16:39.400]   That all of that comes under this drive.
[02:16:39.400 --> 02:16:42.620]   So an aggressive drive is not a bad thing.
[02:16:42.620 --> 02:16:44.160]   If we had no aggressive drives,
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:45.520]   the thought is we would just lie down
[02:16:45.520 --> 02:16:47.040]   and nothing else would happen
[02:16:47.040 --> 02:16:49.040]   and then we'd all be gone, right?
[02:16:49.040 --> 02:16:51.360]   So there's a way in which this drive within us
[02:16:51.360 --> 02:16:52.940]   moves us forward, right?
[02:16:52.940 --> 02:16:54.880]   And of course, it's extremely complicated
[02:16:54.880 --> 02:16:57.560]   the ways we can manifest too much of it or too little of it
[02:16:57.560 --> 02:17:01.260]   or how our defense mechanisms can intertwine with the drive,
[02:17:01.260 --> 02:17:02.600]   but the drive is there.
[02:17:02.600 --> 02:17:06.860]   It's like it's fuel within us that comes with our existence
[02:17:06.860 --> 02:17:09.160]   and then how that fuel moves us forward,
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:11.120]   how much of it there is.
[02:17:11.120 --> 02:17:15.100]   That is determined by the meshing of the drive
[02:17:15.100 --> 02:17:17.640]   with how we're living life, right?
[02:17:17.640 --> 02:17:19.720]   And the same would be true of pleasure.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:21.800]   You know, the pleasure drive doesn't just mean
[02:17:21.800 --> 02:17:24.280]   that we all want to be hedonists, right, inside.
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:26.720]   It means that we want things that are gratifying, right?
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:28.040]   We want to feel good, right?
[02:17:28.040 --> 02:17:31.680]   This isn't just the drive towards physical pleasure,
[02:17:31.680 --> 02:17:35.080]   like a sex drive or eating food or having comfort.
[02:17:35.080 --> 02:17:37.000]   Like all of that can be part of it,
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:39.320]   but it's a drive for relief, right?
[02:17:39.320 --> 02:17:43.240]   The idea that we don't want to be white-knuckling life,
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:45.080]   right, searching for pleasure.
[02:17:45.080 --> 02:17:48.500]   So it's having aggression within us as we white-knuckle life
[02:17:48.500 --> 02:17:51.040]   and we search for some pleasure and relief, right?
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:54.040]   These drives within us can be healthy.
[02:17:54.040 --> 02:17:55.720]   They can be unhealthy.
[02:17:55.720 --> 02:17:57.840]   They can be anything, right?
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:02.840]   They're wellsprings within us that then fuel us forward.
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:06.040]   And there's controversy to the idea
[02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:07.900]   of is there a generative drive?
[02:18:07.900 --> 02:18:09.560]   And there's certainly parts of the field
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:11.880]   that do not think so, right?
[02:18:11.880 --> 02:18:14.400]   But there have been strong thinkers in the field
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:16.740]   that have thought we do have a generative drive,
[02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:21.740]   that it is within us to look around us to be curious,
[02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:26.240]   to be amazed, right, to think like how can I engage with this
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:28.200]   and make this better or happier?
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:30.720]   To think outside of ourselves, right?
[02:18:30.720 --> 02:18:33.920]   To think if I feel good and you're in pain,
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:35.900]   can I make you feel better, right?
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:37.960]   Having nothing to do with me, right?
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:40.700]   The idea of altruism, coming to the fore
[02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:44.160]   and having industriousness within us, right?
[02:18:44.160 --> 02:18:47.760]   And the idea that there is a generative drive,
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:51.400]   it's strengthened when you look at how humans behave
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:53.880]   when we're not struggling, right?
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.720]   That people are interested in learning.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:59.200]   You think about how much people give of themselves
[02:18:59.200 --> 02:19:01.280]   to learning, right, or to serving others.
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:03.640]   Like there's so much of this goodness
[02:19:03.640 --> 02:19:05.320]   in the world around us.
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:07.860]   Now, if we shut people away, right?
[02:19:07.860 --> 02:19:10.040]   They have no, imagine, God forbid,
[02:19:10.040 --> 02:19:11.720]   someone is in a solitary confinement
[02:19:11.720 --> 02:19:13.920]   from the moment they're born,
[02:19:13.920 --> 02:19:15.460]   then there's not an opportunity
[02:19:15.460 --> 02:19:17.880]   for the generative drive to thrive, right?
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:20.840]   And we see so many situations
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:23.800]   where it doesn't thrive enough, right?
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:25.760]   Violence in people's surroundings,
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:27.360]   lack of opportunities, right?
[02:19:27.360 --> 02:19:31.080]   That we can squelch a generative drive,
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:32.280]   anyone's generative drive,
[02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:34.400]   but if we give ourselves opportunities,
[02:19:34.400 --> 02:19:38.120]   if we're healthy, that we're not weighed down by trauma
[02:19:38.120 --> 02:19:40.080]   and illness and misperceptions of self,
[02:19:40.080 --> 02:19:42.220]   and we can live life in a way
[02:19:42.220 --> 02:19:44.960]   that brings us to agency and gratitude,
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:47.960]   now we're allying with the generative drive
[02:19:47.960 --> 02:19:50.760]   that I absolutely believe is within us.
[02:19:50.760 --> 02:19:54.160]   I think just look at life, look at human beings.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:57.380]   We observe that we have this drive within us,
[02:19:57.380 --> 02:19:59.960]   and if that drive is at the forefront,
[02:19:59.960 --> 02:20:02.320]   and that drive then naturally, of course,
[02:20:02.320 --> 02:20:05.840]   allies with agency and gratitude,
[02:20:05.840 --> 02:20:07.520]   then I think we're at the place
[02:20:07.520 --> 02:20:10.520]   that is the place we ultimately seek, right?
[02:20:10.520 --> 02:20:14.280]   And that we can find it for brief periods of time.
[02:20:14.280 --> 02:20:18.360]   So by really pursuing this and like really strongly
[02:20:18.360 --> 02:20:19.960]   in my own therapy and reflection
[02:20:19.960 --> 02:20:21.640]   and attempts to understand,
[02:20:21.640 --> 02:20:24.480]   I can have periods of time where I can feel that way.
[02:20:24.480 --> 02:20:28.380]   I can feel outward growth and interest in the world,
[02:20:28.380 --> 02:20:29.320]   and I feel good.
[02:20:29.320 --> 02:20:31.040]   I'm not trying to answer some question of like,
[02:20:31.040 --> 02:20:31.880]   why am I alive?
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:34.860]   Or like, I'm doing things that I feel good about,
[02:20:34.860 --> 02:20:38.140]   and I feel good about doing those things
[02:20:38.140 --> 02:20:40.280]   and about being in the world.
[02:20:40.280 --> 02:20:42.680]   And I think this is not uncommon.
[02:20:42.680 --> 02:20:45.080]   It may be far more common in societies
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:47.460]   that are allegedly less advanced, right?
[02:20:47.460 --> 02:20:49.460]   That have less distractions,
[02:20:49.460 --> 02:20:53.220]   or maybe less knowledge of all the awful things
[02:20:53.220 --> 02:20:54.460]   in the world that can happen to us
[02:20:54.460 --> 02:20:55.700]   that are constantly fed to us.
[02:20:55.700 --> 02:20:57.960]   Like there's a whole bunch of other questions
[02:20:57.960 --> 02:20:59.740]   and topics about it.
[02:20:59.740 --> 02:21:04.340]   But this absolute belief
[02:21:04.340 --> 02:21:06.120]   that there's this generative drive in us
[02:21:06.120 --> 02:21:09.260]   that wants to ally with agency and gratitude,
[02:21:09.260 --> 02:21:11.440]   and that we all have it within us
[02:21:11.440 --> 02:21:13.500]   to bring those to the forefront,
[02:21:13.500 --> 02:21:15.640]   and to find that thing that we seek,
[02:21:15.640 --> 02:21:17.600]   whether some of this person says it's nirvana,
[02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:21.040]   the other person says it's joy or happiness or peace
[02:21:21.040 --> 02:21:23.440]   or numbing, you know, whatever it is,
[02:21:23.440 --> 02:21:25.440]   there's something to it
[02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:28.400]   where we're not feeling the tension within us.
[02:21:28.400 --> 02:21:30.920]   We're not feeling the anxiety, the pressures,
[02:21:30.920 --> 02:21:33.080]   but we're feeling a sense of goodness.
[02:21:33.080 --> 02:21:36.000]   - The way you're describing it makes perfect sense
[02:21:36.000 --> 02:21:38.880]   why peace, contentment, and delight
[02:21:38.880 --> 02:21:42.760]   be so closely linked to this generative drive.
[02:21:42.760 --> 02:21:45.720]   You know, the word peace, as you alluded to,
[02:21:45.720 --> 02:21:50.720]   often brings to mind the idea of passivity,
[02:21:50.720 --> 02:21:54.640]   but generative drive and the inclusion of things
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:57.320]   like aggression and a drive for pleasure
[02:21:57.320 --> 02:21:59.600]   are anything but passive.
[02:21:59.600 --> 02:22:02.520]   So I think that's important for me
[02:22:02.520 --> 02:22:04.440]   and for everyone to understand
[02:22:04.440 --> 02:22:07.520]   that peace, contentment, and delight
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.160]   can really be action terms.
[02:22:09.160 --> 02:22:12.440]   Again, moving them from, you know,
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:15.180]   from the more typical conception of them
[02:22:15.180 --> 02:22:17.140]   to verb states.
[02:22:17.140 --> 02:22:20.460]   - So peace, contentment, and delight
[02:22:20.460 --> 02:22:22.540]   are not passive states.
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:25.040]   I mean, there can be periods of time
[02:22:25.040 --> 02:22:26.860]   where we can be just very peaceful
[02:22:26.860 --> 02:22:28.600]   and very much at rest,
[02:22:28.600 --> 02:22:33.000]   but those words are not synonymous with inaction, right?
[02:22:33.000 --> 02:22:35.840]   In fact, they're synonymous with action
[02:22:35.840 --> 02:22:37.760]   a lot of the time, right?
[02:22:37.760 --> 02:22:41.720]   If we are suffused with peace, contentment,
[02:22:41.720 --> 02:22:43.340]   the ability to delight,
[02:22:43.340 --> 02:22:45.920]   then what we're doing is we're raising up
[02:22:45.920 --> 02:22:47.000]   the generative drive.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.420]   We're making conditions that are permissive
[02:22:49.420 --> 02:22:53.000]   for the generative drive to come to the forefront, right?
[02:22:53.000 --> 02:22:55.720]   To be paramount over the aggressive
[02:22:55.720 --> 02:22:57.280]   and the pleasure drives, right?
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:22:59.940]   And remember, we're not trying to get rid of those drives,
[02:22:59.940 --> 02:23:02.640]   right, we just want the generative drive
[02:23:02.640 --> 02:23:04.560]   in us to be at the forefront.
[02:23:04.560 --> 02:23:07.460]   Then we'll be able to harness the aggressive drive
[02:23:07.460 --> 02:23:10.060]   through, for example, a strong sense of agency,
[02:23:10.060 --> 02:23:12.520]   fueling the sense of agency forward
[02:23:12.520 --> 02:23:15.900]   as opposed to destructive aggression, right?
[02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:17.280]   The search for pleasure,
[02:23:17.280 --> 02:23:19.880]   which sure can include physical pleasures
[02:23:19.880 --> 02:23:22.920]   in ways that are good and reasonable and healthy for us,
[02:23:22.920 --> 02:23:25.140]   but also the pleasure of learning, right?
[02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:27.640]   The pleasure that altruism brings,
[02:23:27.640 --> 02:23:30.000]   that we can take the aggressive drive
[02:23:30.000 --> 02:23:31.360]   that we know is in us
[02:23:31.360 --> 02:23:34.180]   and the pleasure drive that we know is in us
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:36.340]   and we can dial them to the right places.
[02:23:36.340 --> 02:23:37.800]   Like this gets very complicated
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:39.920]   and it's easy to dial that too far up
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:42.540]   and it's easy to dial it too far down, right?
[02:23:42.540 --> 02:23:46.560]   But if both are serving the generative drive,
[02:23:46.560 --> 02:23:49.520]   because we lift up the generative drive
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:51.440]   and we bring it to primacy
[02:23:51.440 --> 02:23:53.520]   by being able to handle our lives,
[02:23:53.520 --> 02:23:56.000]   to understand ourselves, to go back to those pillars
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:59.760]   and to build upon it the agency and the gratitude
[02:23:59.760 --> 02:24:03.800]   that then leads us to peace, contentment and delight,
[02:24:03.800 --> 02:24:05.320]   we can put all of this together
[02:24:05.320 --> 02:24:09.580]   and like we're really and truly living in an active way
[02:24:09.580 --> 02:24:11.720]   in the world that's good for us,
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:13.200]   good for the world around us
[02:24:13.200 --> 02:24:15.700]   and doesn't leave us with a sense of yearning
[02:24:15.700 --> 02:24:17.520]   or sense of tension within us.
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.240]   - Do you think it's also the case that generative drive
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:27.240]   has kind of a self amplification feature to it?
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:30.180]   What comes to mind as you're describing generative drive
[02:24:30.180 --> 02:24:32.720]   and its relationship to peace, contentment and delight
[02:24:32.720 --> 02:24:36.360]   is that approximately a half hour after I wake up,
[02:24:36.360 --> 02:24:39.540]   I start to feel more physically energized.
[02:24:39.540 --> 02:24:41.040]   I'm not somebody who just pops out of bed
[02:24:41.040 --> 02:24:43.740]   and is ready to go exercise or do mental work,
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:46.960]   but about 30 minutes or so after waking,
[02:24:46.960 --> 02:24:48.600]   my mind starts to wake up.
[02:24:48.600 --> 02:24:53.400]   And I've noticed that if I read a scientific paper
[02:24:53.400 --> 02:24:55.740]   or if I read a chapter in a book
[02:24:55.740 --> 02:25:00.320]   or if I do something that feels a little bit difficult,
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:02.860]   cognitively difficult in particular,
[02:25:02.860 --> 02:25:07.060]   that the sense of satisfaction that I get from that
[02:25:07.060 --> 02:25:09.100]   is immense.
[02:25:09.100 --> 02:25:11.260]   And it's not necessarily the case
[02:25:11.260 --> 02:25:12.980]   that I have to learn something that I'm going to use
[02:25:12.980 --> 02:25:17.160]   that day, but for me, learning and often learning
[02:25:17.160 --> 02:25:19.140]   and sharing what I learn with the world,
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:21.660]   whether or not they want to hear it or not,
[02:25:21.660 --> 02:25:24.940]   is part of my pleasure loop.
[02:25:24.940 --> 02:25:29.940]   And I've learned that if I don't capture some new knowledge
[02:25:30.620 --> 02:25:34.040]   in a way that's challenging in the morning time,
[02:25:34.040 --> 02:25:38.220]   I feel like the gears are still turning,
[02:25:38.220 --> 02:25:40.500]   but I start to lose energy.
[02:25:40.500 --> 02:25:44.100]   Whereas if I find something interesting in particular
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:46.980]   and write it down and I feel like I own it,
[02:25:46.980 --> 02:25:48.300]   that's what I enjoy so much about learning.
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:49.180]   It's like, it's in there,
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:51.420]   maybe it'll be useful at some point, maybe it won't,
[02:25:51.420 --> 02:25:54.020]   but it's like an animal finding a tool
[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:56.540]   that it can maybe use to forage more effectively
[02:25:56.540 --> 02:25:57.880]   later in life.
[02:25:57.880 --> 02:25:59.980]   I get such a sense of satisfaction
[02:25:59.980 --> 02:26:02.700]   that then I find that I have immense energy
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:04.420]   to do whatever is next.
[02:26:04.420 --> 02:26:06.420]   Like whether or not that's exercise or learn more
[02:26:06.420 --> 02:26:10.700]   or prepare a podcast or write a grant or working on a paper.
[02:26:10.700 --> 02:26:14.220]   And this feature of my mental life is so prominent
[02:26:14.220 --> 02:26:18.820]   that I almost have to force myself to do it each day.
[02:26:18.820 --> 02:26:21.340]   And there are so many distractions in the world nowadays
[02:26:21.340 --> 02:26:23.820]   that I've come to a place where I almost have to force
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:26.940]   myself to do what I know works for me.
[02:26:28.020 --> 02:26:33.020]   But when I do, it feels almost like a chemical rocket fuel.
[02:26:33.020 --> 02:26:35.440]   And it doesn't make me manic or crazy.
[02:26:35.440 --> 02:26:37.360]   I don't need to pick up the phone and call somebody
[02:26:37.360 --> 02:26:40.020]   or tell everybody about it or post it on social media.
[02:26:40.020 --> 02:26:43.060]   It's more of a deep sense of satisfaction
[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:45.500]   and I get energy from it.
[02:26:45.500 --> 02:26:47.180]   Is that the generative drive?
[02:26:47.180 --> 02:26:48.660]   - Well, it's great that that works for you.
[02:26:48.660 --> 02:26:51.540]   What you're saying is that for you,
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:54.740]   like you can prime your generative drive that way, right?
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:26:56.740]   And then you prime it, you prime the pump,
[02:26:56.740 --> 02:26:58.220]   it gets revved up, right?
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:02.540]   And then it's really manifesting itself inside of you.
[02:27:02.540 --> 02:27:05.300]   I mean, there's many different manifestations
[02:27:05.300 --> 02:27:07.980]   of the generative drive as there are people, right?
[02:27:07.980 --> 02:27:10.140]   So some things are gonna work for some person,
[02:27:10.140 --> 02:27:12.460]   other things are gonna work for a different person, right?
[02:27:12.460 --> 02:27:15.820]   But you're saying that, hey, I know this thing works for me
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:18.180]   and even though sometimes it's not easy to do,
[02:27:18.180 --> 02:27:22.060]   I do it and then look what it gets for me, right?
[02:27:22.060 --> 02:27:24.740]   And that's really healthy, right?
[02:27:24.740 --> 02:27:26.520]   It's like knowing that this thing works for you
[02:27:26.520 --> 02:27:27.980]   and then you become committed to it
[02:27:27.980 --> 02:27:29.660]   because your generative drive
[02:27:29.660 --> 02:27:32.940]   is really strongly supported by it, right?
[02:27:32.940 --> 02:27:35.460]   And then you have this sense of good feeling, right?
[02:27:35.460 --> 02:27:38.220]   So then you have the peace
[02:27:38.220 --> 02:27:42.960]   and you have just the overall sense of goodness, right?
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:45.300]   Peace and contentment and delight,
[02:27:45.300 --> 02:27:47.200]   you're getting that in learning and in teaching.
[02:27:47.200 --> 02:27:51.020]   So you're figuring out like, hey, this works for me, right?
[02:27:51.020 --> 02:27:52.380]   And again, you don't have to figure it out
[02:27:52.380 --> 02:27:53.280]   through this lens.
[02:27:53.280 --> 02:27:55.500]   It's if we find parts that aren't working,
[02:27:55.500 --> 02:27:58.140]   then we go back and we figure them out, right?
[02:27:58.140 --> 02:28:00.560]   Maybe a good example maybe is,
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:05.660]   so let's say you take someone who really enjoys gardening
[02:28:05.660 --> 02:28:07.440]   and get something out of gardening, right?
[02:28:07.440 --> 02:28:09.580]   So there are as many generative drives
[02:28:09.580 --> 02:28:11.800]   in how they're measured out as there are humans,
[02:28:11.800 --> 02:28:14.460]   but there can be common outcomes of them, right?
[02:28:14.460 --> 02:28:17.980]   So the enjoyment of fostering plants, growing a garden,
[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:20.180]   it's like that's not uncommon in humans, right?
[02:28:20.180 --> 02:28:24.780]   So imagine someone who hasn't been doing that, right?
[02:28:24.780 --> 02:28:26.600]   They really want to, they have a drive to do it.
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:28.160]   There's a plot of land in the back
[02:28:28.160 --> 02:28:29.940]   that they used to cultivate, right?
[02:28:29.940 --> 02:28:32.520]   So if they're not doing it, there are any number of reasons.
[02:28:32.520 --> 02:28:34.040]   Maybe they were depressed
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:35.660]   and they needed mental health treatment.
[02:28:35.660 --> 02:28:38.680]   Maybe they just got away from the path that they were on.
[02:28:38.680 --> 02:28:40.540]   Maybe their defense has shifted a little bit.
[02:28:40.540 --> 02:28:42.400]   Whatever the case may be,
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:46.660]   they go back to the pillars and they figure it out, right?
[02:28:46.660 --> 02:28:50.060]   And now they're in accord with themselves, right?
[02:28:50.060 --> 02:28:53.060]   And they're living through agency and gratitude
[02:28:53.060 --> 02:28:55.780]   and they feel like, right, I can go back out there
[02:28:55.780 --> 02:28:57.700]   and I can till that land.
[02:28:57.700 --> 02:28:59.240]   I can get the hoe out.
[02:28:59.240 --> 02:29:01.660]   I can make the plots.
[02:29:01.660 --> 02:29:02.680]   I'm gonna put the seeds in.
[02:29:02.680 --> 02:29:03.660]   I'm gonna nurture.
[02:29:03.660 --> 02:29:06.600]   I can go do that and I can do it even what?
[02:29:06.600 --> 02:29:08.180]   Even though I was depressed,
[02:29:08.180 --> 02:29:11.200]   even though somebody assaulted me five months ago,
[02:29:11.200 --> 02:29:12.420]   even though I lost my job,
[02:29:12.420 --> 02:29:14.620]   even though, even though, even though, right?
[02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:16.940]   They overcome the even-thos, right?
[02:29:16.940 --> 02:29:18.900]   And the sense of agency tells them, right,
[02:29:18.900 --> 02:29:21.100]   I can go do that, right?
[02:29:21.100 --> 02:29:22.460]   And the sense of gratitude.
[02:29:22.460 --> 02:29:27.420]   No one who's miserable and now is in such an awful position
[02:29:27.420 --> 02:29:30.000]   about life because they were attacked or lost their job
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:31.900]   or something bad happened, whatever it may be,
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.660]   or they're lost in cynicism.
[02:29:33.660 --> 02:29:35.460]   There's no gratitude there, right?
[02:29:35.460 --> 02:29:37.940]   It's a gratitude for being in life,
[02:29:37.940 --> 02:29:40.660]   for having the capability of going back
[02:29:40.660 --> 02:29:43.700]   and planting seeds in that garden.
[02:29:43.700 --> 02:29:46.900]   That's the alliance between agency and gratitude.
[02:29:46.900 --> 02:29:50.760]   And then the person goes and does that, right?
[02:29:50.760 --> 02:29:52.600]   So think of what's going on there.
[02:29:52.600 --> 02:29:53.480]   They do this thing.
[02:29:53.480 --> 02:29:54.920]   They feel good about this thing.
[02:29:54.920 --> 02:29:58.280]   They can look out at the garden, feel some peace, right?
[02:29:58.280 --> 02:29:59.600]   Feel some contentment to them.
[02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:01.160]   Be delighted by what they did.
[02:30:01.160 --> 02:30:03.760]   Remember how much they loved it before,
[02:30:03.760 --> 02:30:05.520]   how much it means to them.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:09.900]   So yes, that goodness comes, that goodness suffuses us,
[02:30:09.900 --> 02:30:12.080]   and it raises up the generative drive.
[02:30:12.080 --> 02:30:13.920]   That says, right, it's good.
[02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:16.240]   We breathe some life into it, right?
[02:30:16.240 --> 02:30:18.400]   Enough to get that garden done.
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:21.840]   Now the generative drive is further fostered forward
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:23.800]   by the goodness the person feels.
[02:30:23.800 --> 02:30:26.920]   So the example, the difference between the person
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:29.880]   who wants a garden, feels terrible about themselves,
[02:30:29.880 --> 02:30:30.720]   that they're not doing it,
[02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:33.320]   and they feel lousy every time they look out the window,
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:35.460]   and there they are looking out the window, right?
[02:30:35.460 --> 02:30:37.680]   The difference between that and having made a garden
[02:30:37.680 --> 02:30:39.440]   and looking out the window at it
[02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:42.040]   is a night and day difference.
[02:30:42.040 --> 02:30:45.360]   And the person who's looking out the window at the garden
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:47.960]   that they built overcoming whatever was inside of them
[02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:49.800]   because they went and addressed it
[02:30:49.800 --> 02:30:52.720]   and proved to themselves that they could,
[02:30:52.720 --> 02:30:54.600]   that's what we're after in life, right?
[02:30:54.600 --> 02:30:55.440]   We all know this.
[02:30:55.440 --> 02:30:56.720]   It doesn't look like somebody levitating
[02:30:56.720 --> 02:30:58.380]   at the top of a mountain, right?
[02:30:58.380 --> 02:30:59.620]   That's what it looks like.
[02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:01.800]   The person looking out the window at the garden
[02:31:01.800 --> 02:31:05.480]   and thinking about what they overcame to create the garden
[02:31:05.480 --> 02:31:07.880]   and seeing the goodness of it all.
[02:31:07.880 --> 02:31:09.900]   - Yeah, I'm glad you said the word creating
[02:31:09.900 --> 02:31:12.760]   because it seems it's about creating things,
[02:31:12.760 --> 02:31:16.420]   real tangible things, but that the process to get there
[02:31:16.420 --> 02:31:19.240]   is every bit as important as what's created.
[02:31:19.240 --> 02:31:22.040]   - When you create knowledge, that's tangible, right?
[02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:23.300]   Like you create knowledge.
[02:31:23.300 --> 02:31:26.460]   Maybe that person looks down the row of beautiful flowers
[02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:28.820]   and has the same sense of goodness inside of them
[02:31:28.820 --> 02:31:30.600]   that you do when you're aware like,
[02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:33.140]   right, I just went and learned something.
[02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:36.220]   - As you described that, I'm thinking, I certainly hope so,
[02:31:36.220 --> 02:31:40.700]   'cause for me, it's an incredible sense of satisfaction.
[02:31:40.700 --> 02:31:43.500]   And one that I enjoy so much
[02:31:43.500 --> 02:31:45.020]   that I almost don't want to look at it too much
[02:31:45.020 --> 02:31:49.780]   'cause to me, it sits in this rare domain of perfect.
[02:31:49.780 --> 02:31:52.580]   Like it's just, it just feels so good
[02:31:52.580 --> 02:31:57.580]   and that I can get back there is very comforting to me.
[02:31:57.580 --> 02:32:00.560]   - Right, and that's all of this, that it feels so good.
[02:32:00.560 --> 02:32:03.680]   That's what all this is, it's the generative drive, right?
[02:32:03.680 --> 02:32:06.860]   It's the gratitude, it's the contentment.
[02:32:06.860 --> 02:32:08.500]   It's like all that coming together.
[02:32:08.500 --> 02:32:10.900]   And it's interesting, we could contrast that
[02:32:10.900 --> 02:32:13.980]   to when you talked about a repeated cycle that's negative,
[02:32:13.980 --> 02:32:16.300]   right, then you're not feeling that, right?
[02:32:16.300 --> 02:32:19.100]   So think about the learning that can come from it, right?
[02:32:19.100 --> 02:32:22.200]   That you can achieve this and feel this
[02:32:22.200 --> 02:32:24.860]   and be in this state in one aspect of your life.
[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:27.500]   What can you learn from that to bring to the other place?
[02:32:27.500 --> 02:32:29.340]   And more, yes, that's important.
[02:32:29.340 --> 02:32:32.560]   It's more, it's often starting with what's going on
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.520]   in the place that's not doing well, right?
[02:32:34.520 --> 02:32:36.320]   Like is it, why the repetition, right?
[02:32:36.320 --> 02:32:40.060]   So this is how we can have what we're seeking
[02:32:40.060 --> 02:32:42.800]   in parts of our lives, even if we don't in others,
[02:32:42.800 --> 02:32:44.560]   but if we can have it in parts of our lives,
[02:32:44.560 --> 02:32:46.220]   we can have it in others too.
[02:32:46.220 --> 02:32:48.840]   And we can become role models for ourselves.
[02:32:48.840 --> 02:32:50.480]   We can learn from ourselves.
[02:32:50.480 --> 02:32:53.100]   We can learn from what brings the good,
[02:32:53.100 --> 02:32:56.040]   how to raise up the things about us
[02:32:56.040 --> 02:32:57.940]   and in our lives that aren't there yet.
[02:32:57.940 --> 02:33:03.160]   - I often get the question from the general public,
[02:33:03.160 --> 02:33:05.700]   how can I stop overthinking?
[02:33:05.700 --> 02:33:09.000]   You know, I have to imagine based on the fact
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:10.440]   that I get that question so often
[02:33:10.440 --> 02:33:12.220]   that there are a great number of people
[02:33:12.220 --> 02:33:15.880]   who sense their own generative drive.
[02:33:15.880 --> 02:33:17.960]   What are your thoughts on that?
[02:33:17.960 --> 02:33:20.040]   - Thinking can be wonderful
[02:33:20.040 --> 02:33:22.740]   if we're using thinking to learn, right?
[02:33:22.740 --> 02:33:24.080]   To figure things out.
[02:33:24.080 --> 02:33:27.360]   So when thinking is doing that, thinking is great,
[02:33:27.360 --> 02:33:30.480]   but a lot of thinking is just in the service
[02:33:30.480 --> 02:33:31.960]   of something else, right?
[02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:34.880]   And a lot of thinking works against us.
[02:33:34.880 --> 02:33:38.560]   So imagine the person making the garden, right?
[02:33:38.560 --> 02:33:39.840]   The person has to think about it.
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:41.180]   If you think about what seeds to make,
[02:33:41.180 --> 02:33:43.240]   they have to think about where the tools are.
[02:33:43.240 --> 02:33:44.520]   They have to think about what they're doing,
[02:33:44.520 --> 02:33:46.440]   when they're planting, when they're watering.
[02:33:46.440 --> 02:33:47.560]   There's a lot to do,
[02:33:47.560 --> 02:33:50.620]   but the beauty of it isn't in the thinking, right?
[02:33:50.620 --> 02:33:55.620]   The thinking is in the service of what is generative, right?
[02:33:55.620 --> 02:33:57.600]   So that's a different kind.
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:33:59.360]   It's just thinking in the service of something.
[02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:01.800]   But a lot of our thinking is that.
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:03.760]   You know, it's planning, it's projecting.
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:06.520]   We tend to glorify the planning and the projecting,
[02:34:06.520 --> 02:34:08.520]   and it can be great when we're learning,
[02:34:08.520 --> 02:34:10.200]   when we're figuring things out.
[02:34:10.200 --> 02:34:13.640]   But a lot of that is there so that we can do the things
[02:34:13.640 --> 02:34:15.060]   that are good for us to do, right?
[02:34:15.060 --> 02:34:17.220]   The planning and the projecting around making the garden
[02:34:17.220 --> 02:34:19.200]   where the point of it is the garden.
[02:34:19.200 --> 02:34:21.440]   It's not the thinking part, right?
[02:34:21.440 --> 02:34:23.880]   We can also use thinking against us.
[02:34:23.880 --> 02:34:26.780]   So much thinking is repetitive
[02:34:26.780 --> 02:34:30.800]   and not just unproductive, but harmful, right?
[02:34:30.800 --> 02:34:34.500]   That person who's looking out the window at the garden
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:35.720]   may be thinking.
[02:34:35.720 --> 02:34:37.940]   I mean, sometimes there's just pauses in our thinking,
[02:34:37.940 --> 02:34:40.520]   but, you know, a lot of times a person must be thinking.
[02:34:40.520 --> 02:34:43.260]   And what often goes on there
[02:34:43.260 --> 02:34:45.820]   is just repetitive, negative thinking.
[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:48.740]   It's, you know, gosh, I used to have a garden.
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:50.320]   I remember when that was beautiful,
[02:34:50.320 --> 02:34:55.320]   or remember before such and such a person passed away,
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:34:57.060]   and then we stopped making the garden,
[02:34:57.060 --> 02:34:59.580]   or I'll never be able to make a garden again,
[02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:01.460]   or gosh, it's too much.
[02:35:01.460 --> 02:35:02.780]   You know, it's just something
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:04.340]   that's negative and unproductive.
[02:35:04.340 --> 02:35:06.180]   I mean, what else is there to think?
[02:35:06.180 --> 02:35:07.720]   If the person's actually looking out the window
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:09.020]   at the garden, right,
[02:35:09.020 --> 02:35:10.840]   and they're in this sort of stuck state,
[02:35:10.840 --> 02:35:12.260]   they're not in a generative state,
[02:35:12.260 --> 02:35:15.360]   then the thinking becomes repetitive
[02:35:15.360 --> 02:35:17.120]   and it furthers all the negative, right?
[02:35:17.120 --> 02:35:18.700]   As you said, the more we further the negative,
[02:35:18.700 --> 02:35:20.540]   the more we take, if there's a four-lane highway
[02:35:20.540 --> 02:35:22.300]   that we want to atrophy,
[02:35:22.300 --> 02:35:24.620]   let's not make it into a six-lane highway, you know?
[02:35:24.620 --> 02:35:27.700]   But we do that when we have this repetitive thinking,
[02:35:27.700 --> 02:35:30.180]   which then can evolve into the narratives,
[02:35:30.180 --> 02:35:32.400]   the things that we say to ourselves, right?
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.700]   So, you know, thinking is wonderful.
[02:35:35.700 --> 02:35:39.460]   It's wonderful, but it can also just observe something else,
[02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:41.660]   and it can also be used against us.
[02:35:41.660 --> 02:35:44.880]   So what we're talking about here doesn't glorify thinking.
[02:35:44.880 --> 02:35:46.420]   I mean, it does if it's in the service
[02:35:46.420 --> 02:35:49.400]   of the generative drive, but it doesn't in and of itself.
[02:35:49.400 --> 02:35:55.080]   - I think many people set a time,
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:35:57.980]   say, you know, 9.30 a.m. or 10 a.m.
[02:35:57.980 --> 02:35:59.820]   when they are going to begin doing something
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:02.700]   that they want to do or know they should do
[02:36:02.700 --> 02:36:03.820]   that's a little bit challenging.
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:07.540]   It could be exercise, could be cognitively demanding work.
[02:36:07.540 --> 02:36:10.940]   And then 10 o'clock rolls around, they say, okay, 10.15.
[02:36:10.940 --> 02:36:14.620]   And they're distracted by often social media texting.
[02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:17.740]   These days, I think those are the main culprits, really.
[02:36:17.740 --> 02:36:19.300]   I don't know too many people that get distracted
[02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:22.540]   by exercise and reading books.
[02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:26.320]   Some do, and doing complex puzzles or math,
[02:36:26.320 --> 02:36:29.380]   but, you know, social media is a little bit
[02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:32.200]   like mental chewing gum, except that I would add to that,
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:35.600]   that it's the kind of chewing gum that really does
[02:36:35.600 --> 02:36:37.780]   sate the appetite in a way that prevents you
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:41.700]   from eating nutritious food, unless used correctly, right?
[02:36:41.700 --> 02:36:46.100]   And then people feel bad about themselves
[02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:48.860]   because the whole morning went by, now it's noon,
[02:36:48.860 --> 02:36:53.000]   then they require some food, like any typical person.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:54.740]   And they eat, then they might need a little nap
[02:36:54.740 --> 02:36:57.460]   for the gross perandial dip in energy.
[02:36:57.460 --> 02:37:00.040]   And then the afternoon, and then it goes on and on.
[02:37:00.040 --> 02:37:01.900]   I mean, I hear this all the time.
[02:37:02.240 --> 02:37:03.560]   I've experienced this before,
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:05.080]   so I'm not immune to this myself.
[02:37:05.080 --> 02:37:08.680]   That's why I try and capture that early wave of energy,
[02:37:08.680 --> 02:37:11.120]   whatever it might be, adrenaline, noradrenaline,
[02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:14.060]   some combination.
[02:37:14.060 --> 02:37:16.760]   The way you describe thinking and its potential relationship
[02:37:16.760 --> 02:37:20.560]   to generative drive, it seems to me it's so important
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.560]   that we capture those moments of potential creation,
[02:37:25.560 --> 02:37:29.740]   however small the action might be to remind ourselves
[02:37:29.740 --> 02:37:33.700]   that we are capable of moving things from point A to point B
[02:37:33.700 --> 02:37:35.860]   because in the description I just gave of the person
[02:37:35.860 --> 02:37:38.340]   that lets the morning escape,
[02:37:38.340 --> 02:37:42.720]   there's really no external barrier
[02:37:42.720 --> 02:37:44.080]   except these distractions.
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:47.680]   Put differently, all the tools exist within most all of us
[02:37:47.680 --> 02:37:49.420]   to be able to create what we want to create,
[02:37:49.420 --> 02:37:51.020]   or at least to create something.
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:58.820]   And yet many, many people just don't fulfill that right
[02:37:59.440 --> 02:38:01.920]   that they were, and that we've all been given.
[02:38:01.920 --> 02:38:05.400]   So let's think about what's going on there.
[02:38:05.400 --> 02:38:09.120]   So the person says, "I'm gonna exercise at 10 o'clock."
[02:38:09.120 --> 02:38:11.040]   Now they push it back to 10.15
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:12.520]   and they do something on social media,
[02:38:12.520 --> 02:38:14.320]   or they push it back to 10.30.
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:16.580]   It'll be okay, I'll get it all in.
[02:38:16.580 --> 02:38:19.240]   What they're doing is they're engaging
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:21.760]   in unhealthy defense mechanisms.
[02:38:21.760 --> 02:38:25.640]   So if we go back to the pillars, the structure of self,
[02:38:25.640 --> 02:38:28.960]   the function of self, there may be other reasons for it,
[02:38:28.960 --> 02:38:32.120]   but let's just identify the unhealthy defenses
[02:38:32.120 --> 02:38:34.800]   of avoidance and rationalization.
[02:38:34.800 --> 02:38:38.200]   And then there's no thinking going on about that.
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:40.880]   They're just unconscious processes and you kick it down.
[02:38:40.880 --> 02:38:43.400]   You kick it down the clock 15 minutes.
[02:38:43.400 --> 02:38:44.720]   They're not thinking about it.
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:47.280]   Thinking then is subserving something different.
[02:38:47.280 --> 02:38:49.480]   The thinking is subserving the avoidance.
[02:38:49.480 --> 02:38:52.100]   If I'm gonna go look on something, read a couple of things,
[02:38:52.100 --> 02:38:54.720]   reply, I'm thinking, I'm planning.
[02:38:54.720 --> 02:38:56.440]   I gotta get the, maybe I gotta get the phone out.
[02:38:56.440 --> 02:38:58.600]   I gotta tap my code into it.
[02:38:58.600 --> 02:38:59.820]   I gotta go to a certain website.
[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:02.000]   Like we're doing something that we're thinking about it.
[02:39:02.000 --> 02:39:03.840]   I think about what I'm gonna write back,
[02:39:03.840 --> 02:39:06.720]   but the thinking is all in the service
[02:39:06.720 --> 02:39:09.160]   of the unhealthy defenses, right?
[02:39:09.160 --> 02:39:12.060]   So then by understanding ourselves better,
[02:39:12.060 --> 02:39:16.560]   we can bring that to a healthier place.
[02:39:16.560 --> 02:39:17.400]   How?
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:20.520]   By actually using thinking for what helps us, right?
[02:39:20.520 --> 02:39:22.620]   So let's think of like, what, okay, what's going,
[02:39:22.620 --> 02:39:24.400]   let's say if you're doing that, okay,
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.040]   what's going on when you're doing that, right?
[02:39:27.040 --> 02:39:30.320]   So do you, you really want to exercise, right?
[02:39:30.320 --> 02:39:31.900]   But like, it's not easy to exercise.
[02:39:31.900 --> 02:39:33.480]   And sometimes it might be just problem solving.
[02:39:33.480 --> 02:39:34.600]   Are you doing a thing you like?
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:35.700]   Maybe something you like more,
[02:39:35.700 --> 02:39:37.520]   there's lower barrier, et cetera.
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:39.040]   But let's say we're just working
[02:39:39.040 --> 02:39:41.080]   within the psychological, right?
[02:39:41.080 --> 02:39:43.580]   Then you can come at that a couple of ways.
[02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:44.840]   Like, oh, I don't wanna do that thing.
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:46.160]   That thing's hard, right?
[02:39:46.160 --> 02:39:49.400]   I mean, I think that about things in my life sometimes,
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:53.420]   and it always makes me weighty and unhappy, right?
[02:39:53.420 --> 02:39:56.280]   I may as well put 20 pound weights on either side of me.
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:39:58.960]   Right, I mean, I can look at it that way, right?
[02:39:58.960 --> 02:40:01.360]   Or there's a different way of looking at it
[02:40:01.360 --> 02:40:03.460]   that actually fits much better,
[02:40:03.460 --> 02:40:06.080]   which is like, I'm not daunted by doing difficult things.
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:08.560]   And I can get out there and apply myself.
[02:40:08.560 --> 02:40:10.400]   And you know, and I feel good about that
[02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:11.940]   when I do difficult things.
[02:40:11.940 --> 02:40:13.460]   It's like part of my identity, right?
[02:40:13.460 --> 02:40:15.040]   It's like part of how I see myself.
[02:40:15.040 --> 02:40:16.880]   So right, I'm gonna go do this thing
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:18.360]   and I'm gonna feel good about it.
[02:40:18.360 --> 02:40:20.600]   And isn't it amazing that I get to do it, right?
[02:40:20.600 --> 02:40:22.980]   Like, look, here I am, I'm alive, I'm healthy, right?
[02:40:22.980 --> 02:40:24.160]   I can go do this thing.
[02:40:24.160 --> 02:40:27.040]   My health is good, but I wanna make it better, right?
[02:40:27.040 --> 02:40:28.980]   By working out or I'm at least alive.
[02:40:28.980 --> 02:40:31.800]   And if I lose a little bit of weight, I'll feel healthier.
[02:40:31.800 --> 02:40:33.960]   Like, come on, this is good, right?
[02:40:33.960 --> 02:40:36.560]   And then I'll feel different about that, right?
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:38.840]   And like the truth is one or the other.
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:40.040]   It's like, oh, both can be true.
[02:40:40.040 --> 02:40:42.800]   Now, what will be true is what you choose, right?
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:45.280]   And if you choose the negative, then yes,
[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:47.000]   the unhealthy defenses perpetuate.
[02:40:47.000 --> 02:40:48.440]   And even if you get yourself to do it today,
[02:40:48.440 --> 02:40:49.740]   it's harder to do it tomorrow.
[02:40:49.740 --> 02:40:51.280]   That's why sometimes I'll say to a person like,
[02:40:51.280 --> 02:40:52.680]   just take a look at it and decide
[02:40:52.680 --> 02:40:54.160]   if you wanna do it or not.
[02:40:54.160 --> 02:40:57.400]   If you don't wanna exercise, just decide you don't, right?
[02:40:57.400 --> 02:40:59.480]   And then, okay, there's a trade-off for everything.
[02:40:59.480 --> 02:41:01.080]   Maybe you're okay with the trade-off, right?
[02:41:01.080 --> 02:41:03.040]   But what am I trying to do there, right?
[02:41:03.040 --> 02:41:05.000]   Is bring to consciousness
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:07.200]   that that person is making a choice, right?
[02:41:07.200 --> 02:41:08.040]   Do you wanna do it?
[02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:11.700]   If you wanna do it, it's great to just do it, right?
[02:41:11.700 --> 02:41:13.680]   And if you don't, it's great to not do it.
[02:41:13.680 --> 02:41:15.640]   Then at least you're being honest and clear with yourself
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:17.040]   and you're not wasting all that time
[02:41:17.040 --> 02:41:21.400]   when you keep kicking it 15 minutes down the clock
[02:41:21.400 --> 02:41:22.720]   until it's too late.
[02:41:22.720 --> 02:41:23.960]   Does that make sense?
[02:41:23.960 --> 02:41:27.360]   That's, I think, how the structure here really does.
[02:41:27.360 --> 02:41:30.840]   It works because it's pulling together what we know
[02:41:30.840 --> 02:41:33.000]   from the biology to the psychology
[02:41:33.000 --> 02:41:34.720]   of like how to understand ourselves
[02:41:34.720 --> 02:41:37.160]   and how to understand when things aren't the way
[02:41:37.160 --> 02:41:38.200]   we want them to be
[02:41:38.200 --> 02:41:40.920]   so that we can make them the way we want them to be.
[02:41:40.920 --> 02:41:41.760]   It's not magic.
[02:41:41.760 --> 02:41:44.240]   It's following the sort of mathematical aspects
[02:41:44.240 --> 02:41:47.900]   of going to the factors, assessing them, making changes,
[02:41:47.900 --> 02:41:50.840]   and then, of course, we see the outcome we wanna see.
[02:41:50.840 --> 02:41:53.320]   The way you describe it does make sense.
[02:41:53.320 --> 02:41:57.240]   And I appreciate it because I think ultimately
[02:41:57.240 --> 02:42:00.080]   it seems to ratchet back to actions, to verbs,
[02:42:00.080 --> 02:42:03.440]   to bring us to these feeling states that, you know,
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:05.700]   I think are what people are seeking, you know?
[02:42:05.700 --> 02:42:07.400]   Peace, contentment, delight, you know,
[02:42:07.400 --> 02:42:10.040]   through agency, gratitude as active terms.
[02:42:10.040 --> 02:42:11.040]   - Right, yes.
[02:42:11.040 --> 02:42:13.920]   - You know, I think these are universal desires.
[02:42:13.920 --> 02:42:16.600]   And again, you're providing this wonderful roadmap
[02:42:16.600 --> 02:42:18.440]   for people to arrive there.
[02:42:18.440 --> 02:42:19.380]   - Thank you.
[02:42:19.380 --> 02:42:21.740]   I do have a question about some of the underpinnings
[02:42:21.740 --> 02:42:23.120]   of generative drive.
[02:42:23.120 --> 02:42:26.280]   In particular, this notion of aggressive drive.
[02:42:26.280 --> 02:42:30.560]   I've known people that seem to have a lot of this.
[02:42:30.560 --> 02:42:32.640]   They just have a lot of get up and go
[02:42:32.640 --> 02:42:35.320]   or a lot of drive to create in the world
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:37.280]   or to figure things out.
[02:42:37.280 --> 02:42:40.100]   They often do create great lives for themselves
[02:42:40.100 --> 02:42:42.580]   in work, in relationship, et cetera.
[02:42:42.580 --> 02:42:44.020]   I've also observed that these people
[02:42:44.020 --> 02:42:46.100]   often don't have the best relationship to themselves
[02:42:46.100 --> 02:42:49.520]   or that they run up against barriers or frankly,
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:52.000]   sometimes straight into brick walls
[02:42:52.000 --> 02:42:54.120]   in certain domains of their life,
[02:42:54.120 --> 02:42:55.840]   perhaps as a consequence of having too much
[02:42:55.840 --> 02:42:58.240]   of this generative or aggressive drive.
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:01.060]   And at the same time, I know that there are people
[02:43:01.060 --> 02:43:05.400]   in the world, many that have what seems
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:07.200]   to be a low generative drive.
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:08.660]   I don't know if that's the case or not,
[02:43:08.660 --> 02:43:13.120]   but that they seem to have a hard time engaging
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:16.780]   like in doing things and often you get the impression
[02:43:16.780 --> 02:43:19.840]   that they somewhat are completely given up.
[02:43:19.840 --> 02:43:22.220]   It's just like life is just too hard
[02:43:22.220 --> 02:43:24.540]   or sometimes it's even more subtle.
[02:43:24.540 --> 02:43:28.400]   Like I know someone who, they like their job,
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:33.080]   but they've come to the place that like it's just work,
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:35.860]   like it's a paycheck and that might be enough,
[02:43:35.860 --> 02:43:37.640]   but they're always talking about it.
[02:43:37.640 --> 02:43:39.220]   So I have to assume that it's not enough.
[02:43:39.220 --> 02:43:41.460]   They aren't able to slot their work into one domain
[02:43:41.460 --> 02:43:44.500]   and just focus on the other aspects of their life
[02:43:44.500 --> 02:43:45.340]   that are going well.
[02:43:45.340 --> 02:43:47.360]   It doesn't compensate for them to think
[02:43:47.360 --> 02:43:49.380]   about the other aspects of their life, that is.
[02:43:49.380 --> 02:43:53.060]   So is there a continuum of generative drives
[02:43:53.060 --> 02:43:53.900]   that exist in us?
[02:43:53.900 --> 02:43:55.260]   Are these intrinsic?
[02:43:55.260 --> 02:43:58.240]   I realize there are a near infinite number of conditions
[02:43:58.240 --> 02:44:01.100]   that could give rise to one or the other.
[02:44:01.100 --> 02:44:02.620]   It could be hardwired, it could be nature,
[02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:05.560]   it could be nurture, but what is the relationship
[02:44:05.560 --> 02:44:09.700]   between kind of, I want to say arousal
[02:44:09.700 --> 02:44:13.900]   or the potential for arousal and aggressive drive
[02:44:13.900 --> 02:44:17.140]   and these things that we're seeking?
[02:44:17.140 --> 02:44:18.260]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:44:18.260 --> 02:44:20.580]   So if it's okay, I'd like to start
[02:44:20.580 --> 02:44:23.360]   like the first principles of the drives, right?
[02:44:23.360 --> 02:44:26.300]   So the theory of drives came about
[02:44:26.300 --> 02:44:29.220]   when people were observing very closely
[02:44:29.220 --> 02:44:31.260]   like human beings and human behavior,
[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:34.940]   individuals, societies, cultures, right?
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:39.620]   And identifying that, hey, that you can boil a lot
[02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:44.620]   of things down to a drive that we call aggressive, right?
[02:44:44.620 --> 02:44:47.720]   There's something to like impose myself out there
[02:44:47.720 --> 02:44:49.300]   on the world around me, right?
[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:52.020]   It explains a lot of what people do, right?
[02:44:52.020 --> 02:44:56.460]   And then the other identified drive was pleasure, right?
[02:44:56.460 --> 02:44:58.420]   It was, you know, so enjoyment,
[02:44:58.420 --> 02:45:00.780]   even relief of unpleasantness, right?
[02:45:00.780 --> 02:45:02.820]   There's those, like you can describe a lot
[02:45:02.820 --> 02:45:06.580]   of human behavior and that to understand
[02:45:06.580 --> 02:45:08.620]   like what's going on inside of us,
[02:45:08.620 --> 02:45:10.980]   that means that we're here, right?
[02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:12.660]   You see that through the lens
[02:45:12.660 --> 02:45:15.700]   of aggressive and pleasure drives.
[02:45:15.700 --> 02:45:19.180]   And like, that's the answer to it, to how we survive.
[02:45:19.180 --> 02:45:22.200]   But I think that is not the answer to it,
[02:45:22.200 --> 02:45:26.700]   that if it were just aggressive drives and pleasure drives,
[02:45:26.700 --> 02:45:29.300]   there's not a value system around that.
[02:45:29.300 --> 02:45:33.100]   Like somebody who's very industrious can build or destroy,
[02:45:33.100 --> 02:45:35.600]   right, and we see this in historical figures,
[02:45:35.600 --> 02:45:37.780]   like being very intelligent and very industrious
[02:45:37.780 --> 02:45:39.300]   and this has nothing to do
[02:45:39.300 --> 02:45:41.980]   with whether you're building or destroying, right?
[02:45:41.980 --> 02:45:46.480]   So if it were just an aggressive drive and a pleasure drive,
[02:45:46.480 --> 02:45:49.500]   then we wouldn't be having this conversation, right,
[02:45:49.500 --> 02:45:53.380]   because the species would not have survived, right?
[02:45:53.380 --> 02:45:55.940]   So if you believe that, and I believe that,
[02:45:55.940 --> 02:45:57.800]   then you look for something else.
[02:45:57.800 --> 02:45:59.700]   You say, maybe we looked and we found two things
[02:45:59.700 --> 02:46:01.520]   and there are more things, right?
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:04.120]   And then we start thinking about learning for learning's sake,
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:07.000]   altruism, things that are not explained, right,
[02:46:07.000 --> 02:46:08.360]   unless there's a self-referential,
[02:46:08.360 --> 02:46:10.120]   well, you feel good doing something for someone else,
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:11.780]   so therefore it's selfish.
[02:46:11.780 --> 02:46:13.900]   Like there's a lot of gyrations around that.
[02:46:13.900 --> 02:46:17.360]   If you really observe humans, you do see altruism.
[02:46:17.360 --> 02:46:19.980]   You see learning for learning's sake.
[02:46:19.980 --> 02:46:21.940]   You see people being benign
[02:46:21.940 --> 02:46:24.400]   when everything about a situation would say
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:27.420]   that they could, would, or should under society's rules
[02:46:27.420 --> 02:46:28.900]   not be benign, right?
[02:46:28.900 --> 02:46:32.220]   And then we start to see that there is another drive,
[02:46:32.220 --> 02:46:34.220]   that how do you explain that we're here?
[02:46:34.220 --> 02:46:38.100]   Yeah, aggression, pleasure, and generativeness,
[02:46:38.100 --> 02:46:41.060]   or a generative drive, the drive to make things better.
[02:46:41.060 --> 02:46:43.100]   That's why we build more than we destroy.
[02:46:43.100 --> 02:46:44.820]   We destroy a lot, right?
[02:46:44.820 --> 02:46:47.020]   But we build more than we destroy,
[02:46:47.020 --> 02:46:49.140]   otherwise we wouldn't have clothes on our backs,
[02:46:49.140 --> 02:46:51.980]   let alone have the technology to sit here
[02:46:51.980 --> 02:46:53.780]   and to be able to do this.
[02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:58.140]   So it's the generative drive that is most realized
[02:46:58.140 --> 02:46:59.940]   in the healthy person, right?
[02:46:59.940 --> 02:47:04.100]   And the healthy person has the strong generative drive.
[02:47:04.100 --> 02:47:06.740]   Now, as you said, there are other factors,
[02:47:06.740 --> 02:47:08.260]   and this is sort of what you were asking about.
[02:47:08.260 --> 02:47:11.140]   They're probably, they're natural levels of aggression
[02:47:11.140 --> 02:47:13.060]   or pleasure-seeking or generativeness
[02:47:13.060 --> 02:47:14.540]   that differ across people, right?
[02:47:14.540 --> 02:47:18.500]   'Cause we're a product of the complexity of our genetics
[02:47:18.500 --> 02:47:21.040]   and all the complexities of nature and nurture.
[02:47:21.040 --> 02:47:24.960]   So we're gonna get to a place where some of us have more,
[02:47:24.960 --> 02:47:26.880]   some of us have less, right?
[02:47:26.880 --> 02:47:30.640]   The conclusion though is for all of us,
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:34.160]   the generative drive being at the helm
[02:47:34.160 --> 02:47:38.460]   is what leads us to live good lives, right?
[02:47:38.460 --> 02:47:40.380]   To live to the things that we aspire to,
[02:47:40.380 --> 02:47:42.160]   the peace and contentment, right?
[02:47:42.160 --> 02:47:46.560]   So we want the generative drive to rule the day, right?
[02:47:46.560 --> 02:47:48.280]   Whether a person is studying neuroscience
[02:47:48.280 --> 02:47:49.480]   or growing gardens, right?
[02:47:49.480 --> 02:47:52.520]   The importance is about being generative.
[02:47:52.520 --> 02:47:57.380]   Then aggression and pleasure can subserve
[02:47:57.380 --> 02:47:58.820]   the generative drive, right?
[02:47:58.820 --> 02:48:01.260]   And then the question you're asking, I think, which is,
[02:48:01.260 --> 02:48:02.880]   well, what if there's too much aggression,
[02:48:02.880 --> 02:48:04.460]   too little aggression, right?
[02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:07.300]   Or too much pleasure-seeking, too little pleasure-seeking,
[02:48:07.300 --> 02:48:10.500]   that's when we can see problems, right?
[02:48:10.500 --> 02:48:12.820]   And the problems then lead us back to the pillars
[02:48:12.820 --> 02:48:14.180]   to figure out the problems.
[02:48:14.180 --> 02:48:19.180]   So too much aggression ultimately becomes envy, right?
[02:48:19.520 --> 02:48:23.320]   Too much aggression means like I want to impose myself
[02:48:23.320 --> 02:48:25.600]   on the world around me more than I can,
[02:48:25.600 --> 02:48:26.880]   more than is reasonable,
[02:48:26.880 --> 02:48:30.760]   more than I can do without impinging upon others, right?
[02:48:30.760 --> 02:48:33.960]   That what you end up doing is taking from others, right?
[02:48:33.960 --> 02:48:37.220]   Too much aggression becomes destructive, right?
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:40.000]   Maybe a person destroys, tears something down, right?
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.040]   Takes from others, says the nasty comment
[02:48:44.040 --> 02:48:46.640]   when it wasn't necessary and now everyone feels bad, right?
[02:48:46.640 --> 02:48:51.640]   But there's that too much aggression becomes envy, right?
[02:48:51.640 --> 02:48:55.160]   And envy is destructive, right?
[02:48:55.160 --> 02:48:57.260]   The same thing with too much pleasure-seeking.
[02:48:57.260 --> 02:48:59.820]   If I say, okay, I want my fair share of pleasure
[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:01.740]   and relief of distress and all that,
[02:49:01.740 --> 02:49:04.680]   but if I rely on that too much, right?
[02:49:04.680 --> 02:49:06.220]   We're now, instead of aggression,
[02:49:06.220 --> 02:49:08.260]   eclipsing the generative drive,
[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:10.300]   now it's pleasure eclipsing the generative drive.
[02:49:10.300 --> 02:49:12.880]   Then I want more pleasure and more pleasure and more pleasure
[02:49:12.880 --> 02:49:15.220]   and how long before I want your pleasure, right?
[02:49:15.220 --> 02:49:17.340]   So then it's not healthy, right?
[02:49:17.340 --> 02:49:18.940]   What it becomes is envious, right?
[02:49:18.940 --> 02:49:20.320]   It becomes destructive
[02:49:20.320 --> 02:49:22.860]   because then I become covetous of your pleasure
[02:49:22.860 --> 02:49:26.540]   or if I can't get it, but I could bring you down,
[02:49:26.540 --> 02:49:28.160]   then I'll feel better about myself.
[02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:29.600]   That's envy, right?
[02:49:29.600 --> 02:49:33.520]   So too much aggression eclipsing the generative drive,
[02:49:33.520 --> 02:49:37.160]   too much of pleasure seeking, pleasure drive
[02:49:37.160 --> 02:49:38.920]   eclipsing the generative drive,
[02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:43.580]   and we end up in places of envy and envy is destructive.
[02:49:43.580 --> 02:49:45.380]   And now we're in trouble.
[02:49:45.380 --> 02:49:47.580]   - I've never thought before about the relationship
[02:49:47.580 --> 02:49:50.280]   between aggression, pleasure, and envy,
[02:49:50.280 --> 02:49:52.480]   but as you're describing it,
[02:49:52.480 --> 02:49:55.440]   comes to mind the movie "American Psycho"
[02:49:55.440 --> 02:49:58.260]   where Christian Bale plays this,
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:01.540]   well, basically an '80s yuppie
[02:50:01.540 --> 02:50:03.060]   working in finance in New York.
[02:50:03.060 --> 02:50:05.140]   And for anyone that's seen it,
[02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:08.980]   it can only be described as a violent parody
[02:50:08.980 --> 02:50:10.800]   of '80s yuppie culture.
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:12.180]   And it's meant to be- - As dark a comedy
[02:50:12.180 --> 02:50:13.020]   as there's going to be, right?
[02:50:13.020 --> 02:50:14.580]   - Yeah, it's as dark a comedy as it could be,
[02:50:14.580 --> 02:50:16.700]   and don't let your young children watch it
[02:50:16.700 --> 02:50:20.060]   because it's very gruesome and like very sexual.
[02:50:20.060 --> 02:50:25.060]   But the aggressive features within the character
[02:50:25.060 --> 02:50:28.980]   that Bale plays are immediately apparent in the movie.
[02:50:28.980 --> 02:50:31.780]   Like, you know, violent aggression, sexual aggression,
[02:50:31.780 --> 02:50:36.420]   seeking money, seeking wealth all the time,
[02:50:36.420 --> 02:50:39.060]   a narcissism too, an obsession with like everything
[02:50:39.060 --> 02:50:42.860]   from his skincare routine to his eight-pack abs
[02:50:42.860 --> 02:50:44.620]   and like, it's ridiculous.
[02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:48.700]   But also an interesting window into some milder forms
[02:50:48.700 --> 02:50:50.020]   of those features that still exist
[02:50:50.020 --> 02:50:51.460]   in many people today, right?
[02:50:51.460 --> 02:50:55.500]   But the envy component starts to reveal itself
[02:50:55.500 --> 02:50:56.820]   a little bit later into the movie
[02:50:56.820 --> 02:50:59.160]   where the scene I recall is one around
[02:50:59.160 --> 02:51:01.220]   where someone hands him a business card
[02:51:01.220 --> 02:51:02.940]   and then you hear the narrative in his own mind
[02:51:02.940 --> 02:51:06.940]   about how much nicer that guy's business card is than his
[02:51:06.940 --> 02:51:08.300]   and how he hates him so much.
[02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:10.860]   He ends up killing the guy in very violent
[02:51:10.860 --> 02:51:11.940]   and sadistic fashion.
[02:51:11.940 --> 02:51:14.140]   - That's aggression over generousness, right?
[02:51:14.140 --> 02:51:17.280]   - Right, and so, and the whole movie is about
[02:51:17.280 --> 02:51:21.300]   this one aspect of culture at that time's ability
[02:51:21.300 --> 02:51:25.740]   to impose their will on everyone at their whim.
[02:51:25.740 --> 02:51:27.420]   You know, basically Bale just does whatever
[02:51:27.420 --> 02:51:28.980]   the hell he wants at any point.
[02:51:28.980 --> 02:51:30.780]   Goes, returns, videotapes in between.
[02:51:30.780 --> 02:51:33.020]   And you know, and there's so much woven into it
[02:51:33.020 --> 02:51:37.440]   and that is relevant and so much that's woven into it
[02:51:37.440 --> 02:51:40.680]   that's just purely for people's kind of sick entertainment.
[02:51:41.620 --> 02:51:45.180]   But that, I believe it was Brent Easton Ellis
[02:51:45.180 --> 02:51:46.140]   that wrote that and you know,
[02:51:46.140 --> 02:51:48.540]   is tapping into the aggression component,
[02:51:48.540 --> 02:51:51.100]   the pleasure component, but the envy component
[02:51:51.100 --> 02:51:53.940]   is really what resonates as you come to the end of the movie
[02:51:53.940 --> 02:51:56.480]   is like, there's no satisfying this guy.
[02:51:56.480 --> 02:51:58.980]   He could kill or sleep with as many people as he wants
[02:51:58.980 --> 02:52:02.340]   in the movie and he can have as much wealth as he wants.
[02:52:02.340 --> 02:52:03.700]   He can have entire buildings.
[02:52:03.700 --> 02:52:05.700]   In fact, I think he's living in an entire building
[02:52:05.700 --> 02:52:06.540]   at some point.
[02:52:06.540 --> 02:52:08.340]   He takes over people's apartments after he kills them.
[02:52:08.340 --> 02:52:10.660]   It's wild and disgusting.
[02:52:11.660 --> 02:52:14.180]   But it really speaks to the extent to which envy
[02:52:14.180 --> 02:52:17.860]   is woven into aggression and pleasure seeking.
[02:52:17.860 --> 02:52:21.140]   And it's not something that had really sunk in for me
[02:52:21.140 --> 02:52:22.980]   until you describe it now.
[02:52:22.980 --> 02:52:25.740]   Because I think for most people, they imagine,
[02:52:25.740 --> 02:52:29.900]   okay, when somebody has X number of millions
[02:52:29.900 --> 02:52:32.180]   or billions of dollars that they'll reach this place
[02:52:32.180 --> 02:52:34.040]   of peace, contentment, and delight, right?
[02:52:34.040 --> 02:52:35.500]   They'll have enough.
[02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:38.540]   And in the movie Wall Street, there's that one scene
[02:52:38.540 --> 02:52:40.020]   where someone says, you know, what's your number?
[02:52:40.020 --> 02:52:41.320]   Like at what point is it enough?
[02:52:41.320 --> 02:52:42.620]   And the guy says, more.
[02:52:42.620 --> 02:52:45.200]   That says all sorts of things about the dopaminergic system
[02:52:45.200 --> 02:52:47.500]   of reward systems in the brain, et cetera.
[02:52:47.500 --> 02:52:50.620]   But I think it says a lot more about envy.
[02:52:50.620 --> 02:52:51.460]   - Absolutely.
[02:52:51.460 --> 02:52:56.000]   - And what a pit of despair envy is for everybody involved.
[02:52:56.000 --> 02:52:56.940]   - Right, right.
[02:52:56.940 --> 02:52:59.940]   Look, envy may not be the root of all evil,
[02:52:59.940 --> 02:53:02.800]   but envy plus natural disasters may be.
[02:53:02.800 --> 02:53:08.620]   So much evil and destruction arises from envy.
[02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:12.860]   And it may be that it's at the root of all of it.
[02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:15.260]   And we so under appreciate that, right?
[02:53:15.260 --> 02:53:18.900]   We so under appreciate why people are destructive, right?
[02:53:18.900 --> 02:53:21.060]   Which is why the roots aren't always in trauma,
[02:53:21.060 --> 02:53:26.060]   but a significant aspect of where envy arises from
[02:53:26.060 --> 02:53:31.020]   can often be trauma, creating a sense of guilt
[02:53:31.020 --> 02:53:32.740]   and shame and vulnerability.
[02:53:32.740 --> 02:53:35.180]   But wherever a person may come by it,
[02:53:35.180 --> 02:53:37.180]   and it's a larger discussion of envy
[02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:41.140]   and where it may come from, is it drives destruction.
[02:53:41.140 --> 02:53:45.140]   And if the aggressive drive is greater
[02:53:45.140 --> 02:53:47.700]   than the generative drive, or if the pleasure drive
[02:53:47.700 --> 02:53:49.380]   is greater than the generative drive,
[02:53:49.380 --> 02:53:52.840]   or if both are greater than the generative drive,
[02:53:52.840 --> 02:53:54.320]   it will drive destruction.
[02:53:54.320 --> 02:53:58.380]   And that destruction, the vast majority of times,
[02:53:58.380 --> 02:54:01.700]   if you look deep enough, you find at its roots envy.
[02:54:01.700 --> 02:54:04.700]   That envy may arise from guilt and shame within the person,
[02:54:04.700 --> 02:54:07.180]   but as soon as it becomes about another, right?
[02:54:07.180 --> 02:54:10.060]   I feel guilt and shame and inadequacy inside of me,
[02:54:10.060 --> 02:54:12.660]   but then I feel envy of those around me.
[02:54:12.660 --> 02:54:15.260]   It drives the vast majority of destruction.
[02:54:15.260 --> 02:54:17.840]   - Do you think that's what's happening
[02:54:17.840 --> 02:54:22.320]   when we see these sadly ever more frequent examples
[02:54:22.320 --> 02:54:25.620]   of active shooters and school shootings,
[02:54:25.620 --> 02:54:26.700]   things of that sort?
[02:54:26.700 --> 02:54:30.660]   - Yes, there are other people who have life, right?
[02:54:30.660 --> 02:54:33.480]   And that person doesn't feel that they do.
[02:54:33.480 --> 02:54:37.380]   So they wanna go and take it away from them, right?
[02:54:37.380 --> 02:54:40.180]   That's why as long as we have human tribulation
[02:54:40.180 --> 02:54:42.940]   and a lot of guns, it's gonna happen.
[02:54:42.940 --> 02:54:47.420]   It's a logical conclusion of enough people
[02:54:47.420 --> 02:54:48.920]   being in places of despair
[02:54:48.920 --> 02:54:51.760]   and how envy can be cultivated within us.
[02:54:51.760 --> 02:54:55.060]   And then ultimately how it blinds people,
[02:54:55.060 --> 02:54:58.220]   it creates such a desire for destruction
[02:54:58.220 --> 02:55:01.220]   that then people will take life away from others.
[02:55:01.220 --> 02:55:04.260]   And often to be able to sometimes take their own life,
[02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:07.140]   which I think really brings to the forefront
[02:55:07.140 --> 02:55:08.900]   that that person doesn't feel that they have a life,
[02:55:08.900 --> 02:55:10.920]   certainly not a life worth preserving.
[02:55:10.920 --> 02:55:14.260]   So they're then going to take the lives of others.
[02:55:14.260 --> 02:55:18.220]   And I think we're seeing that is as stark
[02:55:18.220 --> 02:55:24.620]   a portrait of where envy can lead.
[02:55:24.620 --> 02:55:27.040]   I think as we can find on a one-person basis,
[02:55:27.040 --> 02:55:29.460]   we can look at wars and their destruction
[02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:30.620]   on a societal basis.
[02:55:30.620 --> 02:55:34.180]   But I think that's the ultimate in understanding
[02:55:34.180 --> 02:55:35.780]   where envy can drive a person.
[02:55:35.780 --> 02:55:39.780]   - What about the other end of the spectrum
[02:55:39.780 --> 02:55:44.320]   when aggression and pleasure seeking are too low?
[02:55:44.320 --> 02:55:48.920]   - The other side of the spectrum is demoralization, right?
[02:55:48.920 --> 02:55:51.940]   So imagine very, very low aggression,
[02:55:51.940 --> 02:55:55.300]   so low self-assertion, low agency.
[02:55:55.300 --> 02:56:00.120]   There comes a place where the person is not then
[02:56:00.120 --> 02:56:02.680]   imposing themselves or believing that they can
[02:56:02.680 --> 02:56:06.440]   in much of any way on the outside world.
[02:56:06.440 --> 02:56:09.440]   And that creates a sense of isolation understandably, right?
[02:56:09.440 --> 02:56:12.680]   A sense of powerlessness and vulnerability and isolation.
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:15.040]   And that then becomes demoralizing,
[02:56:15.040 --> 02:56:16.600]   which is not the same as depression.
[02:56:16.600 --> 02:56:19.440]   I mean, we know depression is a...
[02:56:19.440 --> 02:56:21.720]   There's a neurochemical imbalance, right?
[02:56:21.720 --> 02:56:24.180]   Whether that imbalance came purely biologically
[02:56:24.180 --> 02:56:27.440]   or came psychologically or because of external events,
[02:56:27.440 --> 02:56:29.600]   there's a neurochemical imbalance.
[02:56:29.600 --> 02:56:32.600]   Here, we're not talking about an illness state
[02:56:32.600 --> 02:56:34.840]   as identified by modern psychiatry.
[02:56:34.840 --> 02:56:37.820]   There's not a number in the book of diagnoses
[02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:40.900]   that goes along with being demoralized, right?
[02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:41.740]   But why?
[02:56:41.740 --> 02:56:44.160]   Because it's a state that humans can be in
[02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:47.240]   and too low of an aggressive drive, right?
[02:56:47.240 --> 02:56:49.120]   And all the things that come of that,
[02:56:49.120 --> 02:56:51.480]   it's isolating and it's demoralizing.
[02:56:51.480 --> 02:56:55.100]   The same with too low of a pleasure drive.
[02:56:55.100 --> 02:56:59.820]   So an example that may be relatable to some people
[02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:02.900]   is knowing someone who has had a couple
[02:57:02.900 --> 02:57:04.540]   of really bad breakups and then says,
[02:57:04.540 --> 02:57:05.380]   "Oh, I'm not, you know what?
[02:57:05.380 --> 02:57:06.200]   I'm done with that.
[02:57:06.200 --> 02:57:07.180]   There's no more romance.
[02:57:07.180 --> 02:57:08.220]   I'm gonna be single," right?
[02:57:08.220 --> 02:57:10.700]   And you know like that person has a drive in them.
[02:57:10.700 --> 02:57:12.420]   Like, you know, they're an interconnected person.
[02:57:12.420 --> 02:57:13.580]   Like they want romance.
[02:57:13.580 --> 02:57:15.380]   So these are things that are important to them,
[02:57:15.380 --> 02:57:17.460]   but they make a decision.
[02:57:17.460 --> 02:57:20.000]   I'm not gonna have that in my life.
[02:57:20.000 --> 02:57:22.600]   What would be called in some psychodynamic sense
[02:57:22.600 --> 02:57:24.020]   is inviting death into life,
[02:57:24.020 --> 02:57:27.060]   a little bit of death by swearing off something
[02:57:27.060 --> 02:57:29.140]   that the person has a drive towards, right?
[02:57:29.140 --> 02:57:32.780]   The pleasure drive of companionship and of romance, right?
[02:57:32.780 --> 02:57:35.860]   That then becomes demoralizing as well.
[02:57:35.860 --> 02:57:36.860]   So sure, those things,
[02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:40.100]   demoralization can predispose to depression,
[02:57:40.100 --> 02:57:42.980]   but demoralization is a thing in and of itself
[02:57:42.980 --> 02:57:45.020]   is where then there's a sense of hopelessness.
[02:57:45.020 --> 02:57:49.220]   There's a sense of the goodness then isn't accessible anymore
[02:57:49.220 --> 02:57:52.460]   and that's the other side of envy.
[02:57:52.460 --> 02:57:54.700]   Can low levels of aggression
[02:57:54.700 --> 02:57:57.780]   and the resulting demoralization
[02:57:57.780 --> 02:58:01.160]   be coupled with high levels of pleasure seeking?
[02:58:01.160 --> 02:58:05.620]   So I'm thinking about the person that is like very overweight,
[02:58:05.620 --> 02:58:08.980]   clearly headed for health issues
[02:58:08.980 --> 02:58:10.740]   if they don't already have them
[02:58:10.740 --> 02:58:15.220]   and perhaps would like to remove that weight,
[02:58:15.220 --> 02:58:17.100]   would like to feel more vigorous,
[02:58:17.100 --> 02:58:20.980]   doesn't want type 2 diabetes and an early death,
[02:58:20.980 --> 02:58:22.820]   but at some level they've given up
[02:58:22.820 --> 02:58:24.900]   because the pleasure of eating
[02:58:24.900 --> 02:58:26.300]   is something they really enjoy.
[02:58:26.300 --> 02:58:29.980]   They really love it and yet it has a component to it
[02:58:29.980 --> 02:58:33.500]   in their life where they either self-soothe with it
[02:58:33.500 --> 02:58:35.500]   or they're just trying to hit baseline levels
[02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:36.740]   of satisfaction with it
[02:58:36.740 --> 02:58:41.740]   and they allow themselves to effectively be sedentary
[02:58:41.740 --> 02:58:45.580]   and then the other sorts of troubles start to show up,
[02:58:45.580 --> 02:58:47.740]   sleep apnea from carrying excessive weight
[02:58:47.740 --> 02:58:49.300]   and then they're feeling tired during the day
[02:58:49.300 --> 02:58:51.260]   and then who can exercise when they're too tired
[02:58:51.260 --> 02:58:53.300]   when you got to work and maintain other life demands
[02:58:53.300 --> 02:58:56.420]   and you can kind of see where this could rise
[02:58:56.420 --> 02:58:57.820]   and makes perfect sense.
[02:58:57.820 --> 02:59:00.020]   You can also see where
[02:59:00.020 --> 02:59:03.460]   if there were just a little bit more aggression,
[02:59:03.460 --> 02:59:05.820]   it could all be turned around, but they don't have it.
[02:59:05.820 --> 02:59:07.560]   So is the scenario described something
[02:59:07.560 --> 02:59:08.740]   that you've seen clinically?
[02:59:08.740 --> 02:59:11.380]   I certainly observe it in my nonclinical stance
[02:59:11.380 --> 02:59:13.220]   out there in the world a lot.
[02:59:13.220 --> 02:59:16.260]   - Right, well, I think the most important thing
[02:59:16.260 --> 02:59:20.300]   you're pointing out is that aggression and pleasure
[02:59:20.300 --> 02:59:25.100]   on the high end, we know can trump the generative drive,
[02:59:25.100 --> 02:59:28.340]   but that this can also happen on the low end.
[02:59:28.340 --> 02:59:29.820]   So you're describing a situation,
[02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:31.020]   so this is a great example,
[02:59:31.020 --> 02:59:33.340]   but it's not uncommon in the world around us.
[02:59:33.340 --> 02:59:36.500]   So the aggression, meaning the fuel to put oneself
[02:59:36.500 --> 02:59:40.180]   out there in the world, to utilize the sense of agency.
[02:59:40.180 --> 02:59:42.860]   So this is gonna be a person who's low agency,
[02:59:42.860 --> 02:59:45.960]   the aggressive drive has as little fuel
[02:59:45.960 --> 02:59:47.340]   than to give the sense of agency,
[02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:51.540]   it's further squelched by negative sense of self
[02:59:51.540 --> 02:59:52.960]   and negative self-talk.
[02:59:52.960 --> 02:59:57.500]   Now you find where the aggressive drive is too low
[02:59:57.500 --> 03:00:01.200]   and too low can also trump the generative drive.
[03:00:01.200 --> 03:00:03.180]   Because then that person can't take care of themselves.
[03:00:03.180 --> 03:00:04.580]   A generative drive would say,
[03:00:04.580 --> 03:00:05.840]   there's a lot of life to live
[03:00:05.840 --> 03:00:07.140]   and there can be great things in life
[03:00:07.140 --> 03:00:08.840]   and take better care of yourself.
[03:00:08.840 --> 03:00:10.380]   And by the way, they're like people that you love
[03:00:10.380 --> 03:00:12.860]   and people that love you, or if not,
[03:00:12.860 --> 03:00:15.020]   there's an animal or a garden you love.
[03:00:15.020 --> 03:00:18.380]   So the generative drive is saying that, right?
[03:00:18.380 --> 03:00:21.900]   But it's not winning the day because the aggression
[03:00:21.900 --> 03:00:24.500]   or aggression is one word we could put to that drive.
[03:00:24.500 --> 03:00:26.940]   You could call it an assertion drive,
[03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:28.220]   we call it an agency drive,
[03:00:28.220 --> 03:00:30.680]   but we're using agency in a different way,
[03:00:30.680 --> 03:00:32.900]   but that thing is too low.
[03:00:32.900 --> 03:00:35.480]   So it wins out over the generative drive.
[03:00:35.480 --> 03:00:36.920]   And then in the example you gave,
[03:00:36.920 --> 03:00:40.120]   it's not surprising that the pleasure drive
[03:00:40.120 --> 03:00:40.980]   goes the other way.
[03:00:40.980 --> 03:00:43.680]   Maybe there's a predisposition to that genetically,
[03:00:43.680 --> 03:00:45.260]   maybe it's just reinforced
[03:00:45.260 --> 03:00:47.980]   because a person in that place could say,
[03:00:47.980 --> 03:00:52.520]   well, think of what the self-conception would be, right?
[03:00:52.520 --> 03:00:56.460]   I'm in this terrible place, it means I'm a terrible person,
[03:00:56.460 --> 03:00:57.800]   I can't make myself better,
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:00:59.840]   or I'm not good enough to get better,
[03:00:59.840 --> 03:01:02.460]   no one cares about me, I can't make anything right.
[03:01:02.460 --> 03:01:05.620]   So therefore, I don't matter,
[03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:07.140]   there's no reason to take care of myself,
[03:01:07.140 --> 03:01:11.200]   so why would I not do if I eat that one thing that I enjoy
[03:01:11.200 --> 03:01:12.620]   and it gives me pleasure,
[03:01:12.620 --> 03:01:14.080]   even if it gives me pleasure for two minutes,
[03:01:14.080 --> 03:01:16.560]   then I'll eat another one, like in a sense, so what?
[03:01:16.560 --> 03:01:18.580]   Well, 'cause I don't feel that I'm worth preserving
[03:01:18.580 --> 03:01:20.300]   or that I can preserve myself, right?
[03:01:20.300 --> 03:01:22.060]   There's a nihilism to it
[03:01:22.060 --> 03:01:24.420]   that then kind of makes it make sense
[03:01:24.420 --> 03:01:26.160]   to overindulge the pleasure drive,
[03:01:26.160 --> 03:01:28.660]   whether it's biologically predisposed
[03:01:28.660 --> 03:01:30.740]   or one is just arriving there,
[03:01:30.740 --> 03:01:33.820]   but the reason all that is bad
[03:01:33.820 --> 03:01:37.020]   is because the aggressive drive is too low
[03:01:37.020 --> 03:01:38.260]   and in fact, it's low enough
[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:39.820]   that it's outweighing the generative drive,
[03:01:39.820 --> 03:01:41.940]   then the pleasure drive is gonna come into,
[03:01:41.940 --> 03:01:42.940]   one place or another.
[03:01:42.940 --> 03:01:44.740]   If it's also really low,
[03:01:44.740 --> 03:01:46.800]   the person does not much of anything and wastes away,
[03:01:46.800 --> 03:01:49.840]   which tragically happens a lot in our society, right?
[03:01:49.840 --> 03:01:51.980]   Or if the pleasure drive is high,
[03:01:51.980 --> 03:01:54.060]   maybe that person overindulges in things
[03:01:54.060 --> 03:01:55.880]   that provide short-term gratification
[03:01:55.880 --> 03:01:57.900]   and then that causes a different set of problems,
[03:01:57.900 --> 03:02:00.420]   but what's deterministic there
[03:02:00.420 --> 03:02:03.620]   is whether aggression or assertion,
[03:02:03.620 --> 03:02:05.600]   again, we could put different words to that drive,
[03:02:05.600 --> 03:02:07.740]   but what we've been calling the aggressive drive
[03:02:07.740 --> 03:02:11.940]   and the pleasure drive is one or the other or both
[03:02:11.940 --> 03:02:14.500]   high enough to trump the generative drive
[03:02:14.500 --> 03:02:17.180]   or low enough to trump the generative drive
[03:02:17.180 --> 03:02:19.820]   and I think all problems that we see,
[03:02:19.820 --> 03:02:22.800]   like everything fits into this model
[03:02:22.800 --> 03:02:24.980]   because it honors what we know, right?
[03:02:24.980 --> 03:02:26.840]   It honors what we know about human behavior
[03:02:26.840 --> 03:02:29.420]   and insights into human behavior over hundreds of years,
[03:02:29.420 --> 03:02:30.620]   right, over thousands of years,
[03:02:30.620 --> 03:02:32.560]   like the wisdom that we bring forward
[03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:34.660]   and it honors the science
[03:02:34.660 --> 03:02:36.940]   and that's why it fits together
[03:02:36.940 --> 03:02:40.120]   because I think it honors who we are as,
[03:02:40.120 --> 03:02:42.900]   what our species is, what we are
[03:02:42.900 --> 03:02:46.020]   and what it's like, what life is like
[03:02:46.020 --> 03:02:49.060]   as we try and engage with it.
[03:02:49.060 --> 03:02:54.320]   - Yeah, I've seen cases of demoralized people
[03:02:54.320 --> 03:02:58.320]   where they simply disappear.
[03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:02.600]   They hide, they isolate, they slow down,
[03:03:02.600 --> 03:03:04.540]   they take terrible care of their health
[03:03:04.540 --> 03:03:08.540]   and sadly, I've known several people like this
[03:03:08.540 --> 03:03:11.740]   in my lifetime, one of whom killed himself,
[03:03:11.740 --> 03:03:14.780]   the other who just has an immense number of health problems
[03:03:14.780 --> 03:03:17.900]   related to overeating and inactivity
[03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:20.220]   and knows it and talks about it
[03:03:20.220 --> 03:03:23.540]   but nothing seems to change despite multiple interventions
[03:03:23.540 --> 03:03:26.900]   from a caring standpoint, from friends, et cetera.
[03:03:26.900 --> 03:03:29.540]   I've also seen examples of people who are demoralized
[03:03:29.540 --> 03:03:33.760]   who seem to band with other demoralized people,
[03:03:33.760 --> 03:03:36.540]   sort of try to recalibrate the standard
[03:03:36.540 --> 03:03:39.320]   that they feel oppresses them.
[03:03:39.320 --> 03:03:42.340]   And this isn't necessarily just in the realm
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:44.420]   of physical fitness, this is also in the realm
[03:03:44.420 --> 03:03:45.960]   of like school demands.
[03:03:45.960 --> 03:03:48.820]   I went to a very demanding high school
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:50.980]   as I've talked about before on a couple of podcasts,
[03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:52.460]   I barely finished high school,
[03:03:52.460 --> 03:03:54.220]   I was not an attentive student.
[03:03:54.220 --> 03:03:57.080]   My aggressive and pleasure drives
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:04:00.980]   went into non-academic endeavors and I regret that.
[03:04:00.980 --> 03:04:04.520]   I had so much making up of learning to do
[03:04:04.520 --> 03:04:08.620]   by time I fortunately got to college, eventually caught up.
[03:04:08.620 --> 03:04:13.620]   But my experience of high school was that there were these,
[03:04:13.620 --> 03:04:16.140]   kids scoring perfectly on the SAT
[03:04:16.140 --> 03:04:17.640]   and the early admission to Harvard
[03:04:17.640 --> 03:04:20.100]   and early admission to Yale and all these places
[03:04:20.100 --> 03:04:22.900]   and then there was a distribution in the middle
[03:04:22.900 --> 03:04:25.620]   and then there was a collection of kids
[03:04:25.620 --> 03:04:29.260]   who were not doing well, knew they weren't doing well
[03:04:29.260 --> 03:04:31.460]   and kind of banded together around the idea
[03:04:31.460 --> 03:04:32.860]   of not doing well.
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:35.940]   I didn't consider myself part of that group
[03:04:35.940 --> 03:04:38.380]   because I frankly wasn't there that often
[03:04:38.380 --> 03:04:41.420]   and I was focused on other things as I mentioned,
[03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:45.820]   but what came of that group was actually quite tragic,
[03:04:45.820 --> 03:04:48.420]   not just for them, but for a lot of other people.
[03:04:48.420 --> 03:04:51.100]   They eventually engaged it,
[03:04:51.100 --> 03:04:52.980]   it wasn't a school shooting type scenario,
[03:04:52.980 --> 03:04:56.220]   but they eventually set off explosives
[03:04:56.220 --> 03:04:59.820]   on the school campus, this was after they had graduated.
[03:04:59.820 --> 03:05:01.060]   I don't know where they are nowadays,
[03:05:01.060 --> 03:05:03.140]   but things did not go well for them
[03:05:03.140 --> 03:05:08.140]   and they exerted a lot of destruction
[03:05:08.140 --> 03:05:10.180]   to other people around them.
[03:05:10.180 --> 03:05:11.540]   But before they did that,
[03:05:11.540 --> 03:05:14.420]   there was this kind of banding together around there,
[03:05:14.420 --> 03:05:16.100]   the fact that they didn't fit in that they,
[03:05:16.100 --> 03:05:18.060]   and they weren't bullied as I recall,
[03:05:18.060 --> 03:05:19.720]   that I could be wrong about this,
[03:05:19.720 --> 03:05:22.120]   but I've seen this in other forms too.
[03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:24.800]   Like, if you can't meet the standard,
[03:05:24.800 --> 03:05:28.380]   band up with other people and change the standard,
[03:05:28.380 --> 03:05:31.260]   and then you don't feel as demoralized perhaps.
[03:05:31.260 --> 03:05:34.100]   I can understand, I can rationalize
[03:05:34.100 --> 03:05:37.220]   why this would be a reasonable approach,
[03:05:37.220 --> 03:05:40.880]   but I'm seeing this more and more.
[03:05:40.880 --> 03:05:43.520]   I'm also seeing, by the way,
[03:05:43.520 --> 03:05:44.480]   the other end of the spectrum,
[03:05:44.480 --> 03:05:46.620]   people are overly aggressive and pleasure seeking
[03:05:46.620 --> 03:05:49.340]   and things of that sort, but for the moment,
[03:05:49.340 --> 03:05:53.900]   I'd like your thoughts on how demoralization
[03:05:53.900 --> 03:05:56.620]   can split off into different expressions,
[03:05:56.620 --> 03:05:59.140]   depending on how people feel
[03:05:59.140 --> 03:06:00.720]   and who else they're relating to.
[03:06:00.720 --> 03:06:02.180]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:06:02.180 --> 03:06:05.540]   Well, I think the place I would start is to say,
[03:06:05.540 --> 03:06:08.540]   our society rushes headlong forward
[03:06:08.540 --> 03:06:10.600]   in a way that causes our society
[03:06:10.600 --> 03:06:12.940]   to trample people who are vulnerable.
[03:06:12.940 --> 03:06:15.300]   And vulnerable people are demoralized people,
[03:06:15.300 --> 03:06:18.180]   demoralized people are vulnerable people,
[03:06:18.180 --> 03:06:20.020]   and our society often tramples them
[03:06:20.020 --> 03:06:21.720]   and then they're not here with us any longer
[03:06:21.720 --> 03:06:24.160]   and that is tragic.
[03:06:24.160 --> 03:06:26.280]   But at times they don't get trampled,
[03:06:26.280 --> 03:06:27.760]   they get cast aside, right?
[03:06:27.760 --> 03:06:29.320]   They're injured, right?
[03:06:29.320 --> 03:06:30.980]   And cast aside.
[03:06:30.980 --> 03:06:34.640]   And from that place, tragic things happen, right?
[03:06:34.640 --> 03:06:36.560]   People then stay isolated.
[03:06:36.560 --> 03:06:39.960]   I think it's a tragedy that we don't all band together
[03:06:39.960 --> 03:06:41.500]   and go door to door, right?
[03:06:41.500 --> 03:06:45.420]   To seek people who aren't coming out of doors, right?
[03:06:45.420 --> 03:06:48.600]   In the sense of we let people be so isolated
[03:06:48.600 --> 03:06:52.820]   and oftentimes that's the tragic end of someone's story.
[03:06:52.820 --> 03:06:57.960]   Sometimes people do engage, right?
[03:06:57.960 --> 03:07:01.440]   Either demoralized, but they can engage
[03:07:01.440 --> 03:07:04.560]   in ways that involve an affiliative defense.
[03:07:04.560 --> 03:07:07.820]   So sometimes people who are demoralized can affiliate,
[03:07:07.820 --> 03:07:10.860]   they can band together in ways,
[03:07:10.860 --> 03:07:12.080]   as I think you were alluding to,
[03:07:12.080 --> 03:07:14.020]   that can make things better.
[03:07:14.020 --> 03:07:15.760]   So if people are demoralized,
[03:07:15.760 --> 03:07:19.440]   because say they're a group in society
[03:07:19.440 --> 03:07:22.540]   that is chronically very mistreated, right?
[03:07:22.540 --> 03:07:24.740]   Then it can be very powerful to band together,
[03:07:24.740 --> 03:07:27.480]   both because there's what's called an affiliative defense,
[03:07:27.480 --> 03:07:29.520]   that if I feel bad about myself about something
[03:07:29.520 --> 03:07:31.560]   and I'm alone, it's highly likely
[03:07:31.560 --> 03:07:33.360]   I'm gonna continue feeling bad about myself
[03:07:33.360 --> 03:07:34.800]   about that thing, right?
[03:07:34.800 --> 03:07:37.200]   But if you feel bad about yourself about the same thing
[03:07:37.200 --> 03:07:38.920]   and then we're together, right?
[03:07:38.920 --> 03:07:40.320]   We help each other feel better.
[03:07:40.320 --> 03:07:42.060]   We don't feel so lonely, alone.
[03:07:42.060 --> 03:07:43.160]   We don't feel so isolated.
[03:07:43.160 --> 03:07:44.920]   We don't feel so ashamed, right?
[03:07:44.920 --> 03:07:48.880]   So an affiliative defense can help people to say,
[03:07:48.880 --> 03:07:50.400]   wait a second, like I'm not,
[03:07:50.400 --> 03:07:51.280]   there's nothing wrong with me
[03:07:51.280 --> 03:07:53.720]   and I'm not gonna take this line down or something, right?
[03:07:53.720 --> 03:07:55.520]   And then, and to make assertions
[03:07:55.520 --> 03:07:58.920]   that create better rights in the world around us.
[03:07:58.920 --> 03:08:03.220]   So very good things can happen from affiliation
[03:08:03.220 --> 03:08:05.440]   in the context of demoralization,
[03:08:05.440 --> 03:08:07.920]   but very bad things can happen too, right?
[03:08:07.920 --> 03:08:09.880]   Because people can also affiliate
[03:08:09.880 --> 03:08:11.880]   around things that are very destructive.
[03:08:11.880 --> 03:08:14.460]   I mean, if I am hateful of society
[03:08:14.460 --> 03:08:16.760]   and I would like to be destructive and I'm alone,
[03:08:16.760 --> 03:08:18.820]   okay, I could do destructive things alone,
[03:08:18.820 --> 03:08:20.940]   but if I band together with a couple other people
[03:08:20.940 --> 03:08:23.920]   who feel that way, now I'm empowered to feel that way, right?
[03:08:23.920 --> 03:08:26.040]   Instead of maybe I feel that way
[03:08:26.040 --> 03:08:28.020]   or there's racism or prejudice
[03:08:28.020 --> 03:08:30.120]   and I don't feel like I can say that, right?
[03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:32.060]   But then when it's permissive, right?
[03:08:32.060 --> 03:08:35.800]   Because other people are in the same place,
[03:08:35.800 --> 03:08:39.420]   then people can accentuate the hatred within them.
[03:08:39.420 --> 03:08:43.160]   So affiliation is very, very powerful
[03:08:43.160 --> 03:08:46.160]   and part of society rushing so headlong forward
[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:48.360]   and either trampling or marginalizing people
[03:08:48.360 --> 03:08:50.680]   is that we then don't pay attention
[03:08:50.680 --> 03:08:51.920]   or not enough attention
[03:08:51.920 --> 03:08:54.960]   to what happens with the affiliative groups, right?
[03:08:54.960 --> 03:08:58.360]   How do you guide people towards being able to affiliate
[03:08:58.360 --> 03:08:59.380]   in ways that are productive?
[03:08:59.380 --> 03:09:02.160]   How do you give them routes of being productive, right?
[03:09:02.160 --> 03:09:04.400]   How do you try and protect against the ways
[03:09:04.400 --> 03:09:07.760]   that affiliation can lead to destructive behavior?
[03:09:07.760 --> 03:09:09.720]   So I think a lot of this is,
[03:09:09.720 --> 03:09:12.300]   these are the natural things that happen within us,
[03:09:12.300 --> 03:09:14.700]   but a lot of what we're talking about now
[03:09:14.700 --> 03:09:19.040]   gets impacted a lot by society and societal standards,
[03:09:19.040 --> 03:09:21.240]   which we, of course, all together, you know,
[03:09:21.240 --> 03:09:24.080]   determine, right, and arise from us,
[03:09:24.080 --> 03:09:26.600]   but they start to sort of transcend
[03:09:26.600 --> 03:09:29.040]   because it's now people interacting
[03:09:29.040 --> 03:09:31.020]   with a whole social system.
[03:09:31.020 --> 03:09:34.900]   - Going back to the other end of the spectrum,
[03:09:34.900 --> 03:09:38.160]   excess aggression in particular.
[03:09:38.160 --> 03:09:41.540]   I was in a conversation with somebody recently,
[03:09:41.540 --> 03:09:43.280]   who's very successful,
[03:09:43.280 --> 03:09:46.800]   like beyond most people's comprehension
[03:09:46.800 --> 03:09:48.820]   of successful, financially successful,
[03:09:48.820 --> 03:09:52.540]   and seems to just have checked off their goals
[03:09:52.540 --> 03:09:55.820]   one box at a time, you know, from go,
[03:09:55.820 --> 03:10:01.620]   but who described his underlying psychology
[03:10:01.620 --> 03:10:06.520]   and emotional state as one in which much of what he does
[03:10:06.520 --> 03:10:09.720]   on a day-to-day basis is driven by aggression.
[03:10:09.720 --> 03:10:13.660]   In fact, he volunteered an anecdote about the fact
[03:10:13.660 --> 03:10:17.120]   that he hates early morning meetings on Zoom,
[03:10:17.120 --> 03:10:20.940]   but he shows up to them as sort of like an F-you
[03:10:20.940 --> 03:10:23.320]   towards somebody that might not even be on the meeting.
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:24.160]   - Right.
[03:10:24.160 --> 03:10:26.720]   - And so there's a friction point for him
[03:10:26.720 --> 03:10:28.500]   that allows him to engage in a way
[03:10:28.500 --> 03:10:30.240]   that he wouldn't otherwise be able to engage,
[03:10:30.240 --> 03:10:32.920]   and he channels that towards productivity,
[03:10:32.920 --> 03:10:34.720]   and clearly it's worked for him.
[03:10:34.720 --> 03:10:38.580]   You know, I don't know if he's done
[03:10:38.580 --> 03:10:41.220]   the sort of introspective deep dive.
[03:10:41.220 --> 03:10:43.320]   I imagine no, through the structure of self
[03:10:43.320 --> 03:10:45.440]   and function of self, but you know,
[03:10:45.440 --> 03:10:48.140]   what are we to make of that sort of example?
[03:10:48.140 --> 03:10:50.520]   I mean, I like the idea that if someone
[03:10:50.520 --> 03:10:53.780]   has a strong, aggressive drive,
[03:10:53.780 --> 03:10:55.280]   that they would channel it toward good.
[03:10:55.280 --> 03:10:57.720]   I mean, I have no reason to think this person
[03:10:57.720 --> 03:10:59.600]   is doing anything but good in the world
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:00.800]   for themselves and others.
[03:11:00.800 --> 03:11:02.720]   They're certainly not harming anyone,
[03:11:02.720 --> 03:11:04.320]   at least not to my knowledge,
[03:11:05.580 --> 03:11:08.900]   but that seems like a rough place to live.
[03:11:08.900 --> 03:11:10.640]   For me, it seems like a rough place to live.
[03:11:10.640 --> 03:11:13.200]   And at the same time, I'll offer a very brief anecdote
[03:11:13.200 --> 03:11:14.880]   that, you know, at one point in my career,
[03:11:14.880 --> 03:11:16.800]   namely when I was a postdoc,
[03:11:16.800 --> 03:11:19.560]   I was in a position by virtue of having left a laboratory
[03:11:19.560 --> 03:11:21.200]   in the nature of the field at the time
[03:11:21.200 --> 03:11:24.060]   where the work I wanted to do was directly pitted
[03:11:24.060 --> 03:11:28.560]   against the work of another very powerful laboratory,
[03:11:28.560 --> 03:11:32.160]   except that I was alone postdoc working in a laboratory,
[03:11:32.160 --> 03:11:33.480]   essentially on my own on this problem.
[03:11:33.480 --> 03:11:35.700]   And I remember going to my postdoc advisor,
[03:11:35.700 --> 03:11:37.300]   the late Ben Barrus, and saying, you know,
[03:11:37.300 --> 03:11:40.240]   I think it might just move to a different problem
[03:11:40.240 --> 03:11:43.820]   because I don't really want to go up against this Goliath.
[03:11:43.820 --> 03:11:48.560]   And he said, you know, this is the best, you know,
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:49.820]   I can capture Ben's voice.
[03:11:49.820 --> 03:11:51.200]   He said, "Absolutely not.
[03:11:51.200 --> 03:11:52.960]   Like, there's no way you love this stuff.
[03:11:52.960 --> 03:11:54.500]   You have to do it because you love it."
[03:11:54.500 --> 03:11:55.760]   And he kept telling me how much I love it.
[03:11:55.760 --> 03:11:58.700]   And he reminded me that indeed I did love the questions.
[03:11:58.700 --> 03:12:01.160]   And once I was able to tap back into the love for
[03:12:01.160 --> 03:12:04.320]   and the curiosity around the questions,
[03:12:04.320 --> 03:12:07.300]   I was able to push aside the concerns enough
[03:12:07.300 --> 03:12:10.560]   that we did well in publishing certain papers.
[03:12:10.560 --> 03:12:13.820]   They did well, but those five years, frankly,
[03:12:13.820 --> 03:12:17.880]   were a lot less pleasureful than they could have been,
[03:12:17.880 --> 03:12:20.800]   I think, because much of the script in my head
[03:12:20.800 --> 03:12:24.240]   was that I was in friction with this, like, you know,
[03:12:24.240 --> 03:12:26.480]   at least in my mind, this oppressive force.
[03:12:26.480 --> 03:12:27.960]   It was purely competitive.
[03:12:27.960 --> 03:12:29.560]   And I truly believe that we can't be
[03:12:29.560 --> 03:12:32.200]   in our most creative state when we are competing
[03:12:32.200 --> 03:12:33.720]   with someone else by definition,
[03:12:33.720 --> 03:12:36.620]   because then you're creating against a standard
[03:12:36.620 --> 03:12:38.920]   as opposed to raw creation.
[03:12:38.920 --> 03:12:42.280]   So in both cases, a lot of aggressive drive,
[03:12:42.280 --> 03:12:46.160]   frankly, I have some of that and I had that,
[03:12:46.160 --> 03:12:50.560]   but a desire for revenge, a component of friction
[03:12:50.560 --> 03:12:55.560]   mixed in, you know, or integrated with this aggressive drive
[03:12:55.560 --> 03:12:58.680]   like this picture, like, even as I describe it as,
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:01.320]   you know, causing the release of a little bit of adrenaline,
[03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:03.840]   it's not a comfortable state.
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:06.440]   It can't be a state of happiness, right?
[03:13:06.440 --> 03:13:08.600]   So as you said, people can do good in the world,
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:09.560]   they can do not good in the world.
[03:13:09.560 --> 03:13:10.840]   Like, we're not making a value judgment
[03:13:10.840 --> 03:13:12.400]   about what the person is doing,
[03:13:12.400 --> 03:13:15.080]   because that's not what the question is about, right?
[03:13:15.080 --> 03:13:17.440]   Like, how are they feeling, how are they doing, right?
[03:13:17.440 --> 03:13:19.480]   What's going on inside of them, right?
[03:13:19.480 --> 03:13:21.500]   And that can't be happy, right?
[03:13:21.500 --> 03:13:24.440]   That can't be happy because if you're built
[03:13:24.440 --> 03:13:27.160]   to be pretty good at competition, right?
[03:13:27.160 --> 03:13:29.480]   So you can size up what are the factors,
[03:13:29.480 --> 03:13:30.920]   you know, you can strategize, right?
[03:13:30.920 --> 03:13:34.000]   So if prison is built to be really good at competition,
[03:13:34.000 --> 03:13:36.440]   then, you know, it sounds pretty good
[03:13:36.440 --> 03:13:38.440]   to make everything a competition, right?
[03:13:38.440 --> 03:13:41.160]   Because you have the highest winning percentage, right?
[03:13:41.160 --> 03:13:45.380]   And that's good to achieve some end, right?
[03:13:45.380 --> 03:13:47.560]   That doesn't have any feeling
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:50.100]   intrinsically associated with it, right?
[03:13:50.100 --> 03:13:53.200]   And if all you're doing is a series of competitions
[03:13:53.200 --> 03:13:55.680]   and what you're doing then is winning, right?
[03:13:55.680 --> 03:13:57.800]   And like winning is something like, you know,
[03:13:57.800 --> 03:14:00.480]   winning is like, I won, I beat you, whatever that is,
[03:14:00.480 --> 03:14:02.900]   like that can be part of happiness,
[03:14:02.900 --> 03:14:04.200]   but it doesn't have to be, right?
[03:14:04.200 --> 03:14:06.060]   That's not happiness, right?
[03:14:06.060 --> 03:14:10.520]   So yes, that kind of, I'm really built to compete well,
[03:14:10.520 --> 03:14:13.480]   and I'm gonna just see a series of competitions
[03:14:13.480 --> 03:14:18.140]   in front of me that's for expedient forward progress, right?
[03:14:18.140 --> 03:14:19.920]   That's very effective, but again,
[03:14:19.920 --> 03:14:24.340]   expedient forward progress is nothing to do with peace,
[03:14:24.340 --> 03:14:27.700]   contentment, delight, like it's not, you know,
[03:14:27.700 --> 03:14:28.760]   it doesn't have anything to do with that,
[03:14:28.760 --> 03:14:31.760]   nor does it have anything to do with doing good or bad,
[03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:32.600]   right?
[03:14:32.600 --> 03:14:34.640]   And I think the example you gave in your own,
[03:14:34.640 --> 03:14:37.680]   in your career is like, it's such a good example, right?
[03:14:37.680 --> 03:14:40.080]   Because, you know, if you think about it,
[03:14:40.080 --> 03:14:43.120]   when the way that you were sort of framing it inside
[03:14:43.120 --> 03:14:45.480]   is like, there's a question I'm asking,
[03:14:45.480 --> 03:14:47.880]   there's a question they're asking, right?
[03:14:47.880 --> 03:14:50.600]   And there's a competition, right?
[03:14:50.600 --> 03:14:53.580]   And again, it has to be two to compete, right?
[03:14:53.580 --> 03:14:56.600]   So there's almost an automaticity, right?
[03:14:56.600 --> 03:14:58.760]   That like, they're studying the same thing.
[03:14:58.760 --> 03:15:00.280]   Maybe, you know, they feel competitive
[03:15:00.280 --> 03:15:01.640]   or certain people there too.
[03:15:01.640 --> 03:15:04.400]   - They were and are definitely competitive.
[03:15:04.400 --> 03:15:05.240]   They know who they are.
[03:15:05.240 --> 03:15:07.480]   They're extremely competitive and very successful.
[03:15:07.480 --> 03:15:11.720]   - Okay, so then you're like, okay, I'm in a competition.
[03:15:11.720 --> 03:15:14.520]   Now again, but you never decided to be in a competition,
[03:15:14.520 --> 03:15:15.440]   right?
[03:15:15.440 --> 03:15:17.160]   But automatically, right?
[03:15:17.160 --> 03:15:18.000]   I mean, it's interesting, right?
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:20.280]   To understand you're acting as if you're in a competition,
[03:15:20.280 --> 03:15:22.160]   who is, I don't want this competition, right?
[03:15:22.160 --> 03:15:23.240]   Because like, they're bigger than me,
[03:15:23.240 --> 03:15:24.280]   it's gonna be unpleasant,
[03:15:24.280 --> 03:15:25.980]   it's gonna take you away from really thinking
[03:15:25.980 --> 03:15:27.700]   about what you wanna do, right?
[03:15:27.700 --> 03:15:31.060]   It's gonna make it harder to do the job you wanna do, right?
[03:15:31.060 --> 03:15:33.060]   'Cause now you're embroiled in, you know,
[03:15:33.060 --> 03:15:36.660]   something that's, you know, that has aggression behind it,
[03:15:36.660 --> 03:15:37.500]   right?
[03:15:37.500 --> 03:15:41.420]   So you choose, no, I don't, I choose not to do that, right?
[03:15:41.420 --> 03:15:44.940]   And then Ben Barres reframes it to the truth
[03:15:44.940 --> 03:15:48.060]   and says, well, this is not a competition
[03:15:48.060 --> 03:15:50.920]   because you're not choosing to compete, right?
[03:15:50.920 --> 03:15:53.200]   'Cause Ben pointed out what was important to you,
[03:15:53.200 --> 03:15:54.900]   was the questions, right?
[03:15:54.900 --> 03:15:56.700]   So it's like almost as if Ben reminds you,
[03:15:56.700 --> 03:15:59.040]   no, no, no, no, this is not through the aggressive drive,
[03:15:59.040 --> 03:16:00.520]   look at it through the generative drive,
[03:16:00.520 --> 03:16:02.400]   that's what wins out in you, right?
[03:16:02.400 --> 03:16:05.880]   And then you go and apply yourself to it.
[03:16:05.880 --> 03:16:08.320]   - Yeah, and bless him for doing it
[03:16:08.320 --> 03:16:10.280]   because from that point forward,
[03:16:10.280 --> 03:16:15.280]   I've made it my firm mission to always do things
[03:16:15.280 --> 03:16:19.260]   from a place of what I always think about as delight,
[03:16:19.260 --> 03:16:20.520]   you know, curiosity, delight,
[03:16:20.520 --> 03:16:22.000]   that the things that give me energy
[03:16:22.000 --> 03:16:25.000]   and that give me more energy from doing them.
[03:16:25.000 --> 03:16:26.920]   It wasn't a coincidence, I believe,
[03:16:26.920 --> 03:16:29.060]   that in those five years when I was operating
[03:16:29.060 --> 03:16:31.520]   from a mix of generative drive
[03:16:31.520 --> 03:16:33.800]   and the competition would then resurface
[03:16:33.800 --> 03:16:36.520]   and, you know, I couldn't hold it constant,
[03:16:36.520 --> 03:16:41.520]   that I was absolutely exhausted by the end of that phase.
[03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:46.080]   I just, in a way that sucked a lot of the pleasure out of it,
[03:16:46.080 --> 03:16:49.040]   I still derived some pleasure, but then, as I mentioned,
[03:16:49.040 --> 03:16:52.440]   fortunately, I was able to pivot back
[03:16:52.440 --> 03:16:54.240]   to doing things out of love, you know,
[03:16:54.240 --> 03:16:57.840]   and getting back to peace, contentment,
[03:16:57.840 --> 03:16:59.280]   and especially delight.
[03:16:59.280 --> 03:17:00.120]   - Right, right.
[03:17:00.120 --> 03:17:04.140]   And I absolutely make a value judgment about that, right?
[03:17:04.140 --> 03:17:06.980]   That what you did is better, right?
[03:17:06.980 --> 03:17:09.380]   So what if you were different?
[03:17:09.380 --> 03:17:10.220]   So think about it.
[03:17:10.220 --> 03:17:12.120]   If we talk about it through this accurate lens,
[03:17:12.120 --> 03:17:15.120]   what if you were different at that time
[03:17:15.120 --> 03:17:17.120]   and the aggressive drive in you
[03:17:17.120 --> 03:17:19.720]   was greater than the generative drive in you, right,
[03:17:19.720 --> 03:17:21.920]   which would be an unhealthy state to be in,
[03:17:21.920 --> 03:17:24.200]   but let's say you were in that unhealthy state,
[03:17:24.200 --> 03:17:27.160]   then you probably would have still done what you did,
[03:17:27.160 --> 03:17:29.280]   but you would have done it through the lens of aggression.
[03:17:29.280 --> 03:17:30.400]   Like, I'm gonna get them, right?
[03:17:30.400 --> 03:17:31.600]   Now you're competitive with them.
[03:17:31.600 --> 03:17:33.080]   There's anger in you.
[03:17:33.080 --> 03:17:35.220]   There's, you know, there's aggression, right,
[03:17:35.220 --> 03:17:37.800]   that you're enacting and fantasy as you're,
[03:17:37.800 --> 03:17:38.980]   you know, you're thinking about them
[03:17:38.980 --> 03:17:39.920]   and how you're gonna win.
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:42.140]   Like, all sorts of things go on inside of us,
[03:17:42.140 --> 03:17:44.660]   and I would say there's no way on Earth
[03:17:44.660 --> 03:17:47.540]   you could have done the science as well as you did, right?
[03:17:47.540 --> 03:17:51.580]   It couldn't be because all that stuff is distracting, right?
[03:17:51.580 --> 03:17:53.860]   It's, you know, that kind of negative affect
[03:17:53.860 --> 03:17:56.320]   pools for energy and time from you,
[03:17:56.320 --> 03:17:59.280]   and also, what seeds would you have planted
[03:17:59.280 --> 03:18:01.940]   in the microcosm that you operated, right?
[03:18:01.940 --> 03:18:03.980]   More competition, right?
[03:18:03.980 --> 03:18:06.580]   More competitiveness, more badness, right?
[03:18:06.580 --> 03:18:08.300]   So let's look at what you did do, right,
[03:18:08.300 --> 03:18:10.380]   because you're healthy,
[03:18:10.380 --> 03:18:13.140]   or this particular question about this particular thing,
[03:18:13.140 --> 03:18:15.700]   we know for sure, because your generative drive
[03:18:15.700 --> 03:18:17.940]   eclipses the aggressive drive,
[03:18:17.940 --> 03:18:19.860]   then you set yourself to the work
[03:18:19.860 --> 03:18:22.420]   in a way that's gonna be more effective, right?
[03:18:22.420 --> 03:18:23.580]   Your brain isn't clouded.
[03:18:23.580 --> 03:18:26.340]   You're not wasting energy, you know, plotting some revenge
[03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:27.420]   or plotting what you're gonna do
[03:18:27.420 --> 03:18:29.060]   if they come take something from your lab.
[03:18:29.060 --> 03:18:30.700]   I mean, whatever it is, you know,
[03:18:30.700 --> 03:18:32.580]   like, you're not living in any of that,
[03:18:32.580 --> 03:18:34.020]   so you're gonna do a better job
[03:18:34.020 --> 03:18:36.660]   at what's so important to you to do,
[03:18:36.660 --> 03:18:39.180]   and what seeds are you sowing then, right?
[03:18:39.180 --> 03:18:42.060]   You're sowing seeds of collaboration, right?
[03:18:42.060 --> 03:18:43.700]   And even then, if someone could say,
[03:18:43.700 --> 03:18:45.900]   well, what does even that matter, right?
[03:18:45.900 --> 03:18:47.180]   Say, well, it doesn't matter,
[03:18:47.180 --> 03:18:49.180]   because what you're doing then,
[03:18:49.180 --> 03:18:51.300]   we just follow forward the math of it, right,
[03:18:51.300 --> 03:18:53.220]   is contributing to understanding
[03:18:53.220 --> 03:18:55.580]   that's contributing to human health, right?
[03:18:55.580 --> 03:18:57.820]   And the better understanding we have of human health,
[03:18:57.820 --> 03:19:00.720]   the more people stay alive and the more people stay healthy,
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:02.380]   which could mean any one of us,
[03:19:02.380 --> 03:19:04.900]   just like any one of us could be the vulnerable person
[03:19:04.900 --> 03:19:06.880]   that society tramples or casts aside.
[03:19:06.880 --> 03:19:08.100]   We all have it in us to be that,
[03:19:08.100 --> 03:19:10.860]   or have been that at stages of our lives, right?
[03:19:10.860 --> 03:19:15.060]   We also all have it in us to be the opposite of that, right?
[03:19:15.060 --> 03:19:17.920]   We have it in us to be generative.
[03:19:17.920 --> 03:19:19.500]   We have it in us to make good.
[03:19:19.500 --> 03:19:22.780]   We have it in us to contribute to health, to survival,
[03:19:22.780 --> 03:19:26.620]   and that I place a value judgment upon.
[03:19:26.620 --> 03:19:29.180]   It's why doing good is better than doing bad,
[03:19:29.180 --> 03:19:31.580]   why creating is better than destroying,
[03:19:31.580 --> 03:19:34.040]   and why ultimately it's the generative drive
[03:19:34.040 --> 03:19:35.900]   that has to trump the other drives,
[03:19:35.900 --> 03:19:38.860]   and when it does, we're happy, we're healthy,
[03:19:38.860 --> 03:19:40.700]   we make the world a better place.
[03:19:40.700 --> 03:19:43.540]   We ally with and are suffused with.
[03:19:43.540 --> 03:19:46.480]   The gratitude and agency in us are fully active,
[03:19:46.480 --> 03:19:50.040]   and we're suffused with peace, contentment, delight.
[03:19:50.040 --> 03:19:52.320]   As you said, that's the place to be.
[03:19:52.320 --> 03:19:55.860]   From that place, we get this thing that we want,
[03:19:55.860 --> 03:19:57.860]   and we help to make the world a better place,
[03:19:57.860 --> 03:19:59.940]   which helps us to keep the thing we want.
[03:19:59.940 --> 03:20:05.480]   - It sounds so simple, because as you pointed out,
[03:20:05.480 --> 03:20:09.900]   the manifestations of looking at the right things
[03:20:09.900 --> 03:20:13.580]   and doing the right things are so simple, right?
[03:20:13.580 --> 03:20:16.740]   It's a list, really, and again, we have a PDF
[03:20:16.740 --> 03:20:20.680]   that includes this list and the structure of the pillars
[03:20:20.680 --> 03:20:22.280]   and how they flow up to this list,
[03:20:22.280 --> 03:20:26.840]   but ultimately it's peace, contentment, and delight,
[03:20:26.840 --> 03:20:30.140]   undergirded by agency and gratitude as active terms.
[03:20:30.140 --> 03:20:32.280]   I mean, very simple at some level.
[03:20:32.280 --> 03:20:36.060]   And yet for many people, including myself
[03:20:36.060 --> 03:20:41.060]   at certain times in life, the excess or lack
[03:20:41.060 --> 03:20:45.620]   of aggressive drive or excess or lack of pleasure drive
[03:20:45.620 --> 03:20:47.940]   can interfere with people's ability to access
[03:20:47.940 --> 03:20:52.940]   these simple but incredibly powerful being states.
[03:20:52.940 --> 03:20:55.380]   - Because it's nature and nurture, right?
[03:20:55.380 --> 03:20:59.500]   So you might be built with a greater or lesser
[03:20:59.500 --> 03:21:02.380]   natural amount of one drive than I am, right?
[03:21:02.380 --> 03:21:03.820]   But then we've had life experience
[03:21:03.820 --> 03:21:06.580]   that creates a delta around that, right?
[03:21:06.580 --> 03:21:08.860]   So you say, okay, we're built with different amounts
[03:21:08.860 --> 03:21:09.860]   of all these drives.
[03:21:09.860 --> 03:21:11.580]   Yes, yes, we are, right?
[03:21:11.580 --> 03:21:14.760]   But we also have control, right, through our decisions,
[03:21:14.760 --> 03:21:17.920]   through how we handle our lives to modulate them, right?
[03:21:17.920 --> 03:21:19.740]   So that makes sense, because the thought could be,
[03:21:19.740 --> 03:21:21.460]   well, the drive is what the drive is,
[03:21:21.460 --> 03:21:23.080]   and it varies across people.
[03:21:23.080 --> 03:21:24.860]   No, there's a range the drive is in,
[03:21:24.860 --> 03:21:26.220]   and that range can be very broad.
[03:21:26.220 --> 03:21:28.260]   I mean, people can do all sorts of things
[03:21:28.260 --> 03:21:30.620]   to cultivate the better.
[03:21:30.620 --> 03:21:31.860]   We all can, right?
[03:21:31.860 --> 03:21:34.700]   So if we look at it as an unlimited upside, right,
[03:21:34.700 --> 03:21:36.500]   then what we see is I want to know,
[03:21:36.500 --> 03:21:38.140]   where are they at in me now, right?
[03:21:38.140 --> 03:21:39.220]   What's going on inside of me?
[03:21:39.220 --> 03:21:41.020]   What are all those other factors, right?
[03:21:41.020 --> 03:21:42.820]   Because I want to cultivate the good.
[03:21:42.820 --> 03:21:44.700]   I want to cultivate that generative drive,
[03:21:44.700 --> 03:21:46.860]   and I want to make sure the aggression and the pleasure
[03:21:46.860 --> 03:21:48.780]   aren't out of balance one way or another.
[03:21:48.780 --> 03:21:51.940]   Like, we can actively look at that and manage it.
[03:21:51.940 --> 03:21:55.300]   And I think that's, like, so what we're striving for,
[03:21:55.300 --> 03:21:58.340]   because there's nothing here that we don't have
[03:21:58.340 --> 03:22:00.380]   some control over, right?
[03:22:00.380 --> 03:22:02.100]   And the higher we get up, right,
[03:22:02.100 --> 03:22:04.700]   the simpler it gets, the more we have control over it.
[03:22:04.700 --> 03:22:08.580]   - And for people who feel like the ideals
[03:22:08.580 --> 03:22:10.580]   that we're providing a roadmap toward
[03:22:10.580 --> 03:22:13.140]   are not accessible for whatever reason,
[03:22:13.140 --> 03:22:16.020]   maybe they're feeling a little bit or a lot demoralized,
[03:22:16.020 --> 03:22:19.740]   overly aggressive and not ending up where they want to go
[03:22:19.740 --> 03:22:20.900]   or ending up where they want to go
[03:22:20.900 --> 03:22:23.520]   and not experiencing deep satisfaction,
[03:22:23.520 --> 03:22:25.100]   peace, contentment, and delight,
[03:22:25.100 --> 03:22:27.780]   where should they look?
[03:22:27.780 --> 03:22:30.480]   In this framework that includes these pillars
[03:22:30.480 --> 03:22:33.060]   at the deep levels of structure of self, function of self,
[03:22:33.060 --> 03:22:36.580]   that give rise to empowerment, humility,
[03:22:36.580 --> 03:22:40.340]   agency, gratitude, peace, contentment, delight, you,
[03:22:40.340 --> 03:22:42.900]   if someone should find themselves unmotivated
[03:22:42.900 --> 03:22:46.520]   or stuck, metaphorically speaking,
[03:22:46.520 --> 03:22:48.620]   staring out the window into the garden that could be
[03:22:48.620 --> 03:22:49.960]   and that they want so very much,
[03:22:49.960 --> 03:22:51.300]   but that they're not creating,
[03:22:51.300 --> 03:22:53.700]   again, that should translate to whatever domain of life
[03:22:53.700 --> 03:22:55.760]   you're seeking or not even in touch
[03:22:55.760 --> 03:22:57.060]   with what you really want.
[03:22:57.940 --> 03:23:01.260]   Infinitely confused about what to do in relationship,
[03:23:01.260 --> 03:23:03.840]   school, work, life,
[03:23:03.840 --> 03:23:06.680]   and thinking about all the oppressive forces in the world,
[03:23:06.680 --> 03:23:11.680]   like the political chasm and the pandemics and lockdowns
[03:23:11.680 --> 03:23:14.140]   and all the stuff and all the things
[03:23:14.140 --> 03:23:15.740]   that are weighing down on us.
[03:23:15.740 --> 03:23:19.340]   What should that person,
[03:23:19.340 --> 03:23:21.540]   in other words, what should we all do at that moment?
[03:23:21.540 --> 03:23:23.640]   Stop and what?
[03:23:23.640 --> 03:23:26.820]   - Each pillar has five cupboards.
[03:23:26.820 --> 03:23:30.420]   Look in all five and follow the clues that you find there.
[03:23:30.420 --> 03:23:32.980]   That's the answer.
[03:23:32.980 --> 03:23:36.760]   - So go back to structure of self, function of self,
[03:23:36.760 --> 03:23:40.260]   ask questions about and engage in practices
[03:23:40.260 --> 03:23:42.460]   that bring about more self-awareness,
[03:23:42.460 --> 03:23:46.680]   practices that draw our attention to what's salient for us.
[03:23:46.680 --> 03:23:49.540]   Ask ourselves, what am I thinking about internally?
[03:23:49.540 --> 03:23:51.300]   What is my internal script?
[03:23:51.300 --> 03:23:53.940]   What am I focusing on externally?
[03:23:53.940 --> 03:23:56.240]   Am I spending all day on Twitter looking at accounts
[03:23:56.240 --> 03:23:58.840]   that I know I hate because it activates something in me,
[03:23:58.840 --> 03:24:00.300]   et cetera, et cetera.
[03:24:00.300 --> 03:24:02.100]   I might've revealed something about myself.
[03:24:02.100 --> 03:24:02.940]   I'm just kidding.
[03:24:02.940 --> 03:24:03.760]   That's not my behavior,
[03:24:03.760 --> 03:24:05.520]   but I see a lot of other people doing it.
[03:24:05.520 --> 03:24:07.240]   What are my behavioral choices?
[03:24:07.240 --> 03:24:12.460]   What could bring about more hopefulness and strivings?
[03:24:12.460 --> 03:24:13.300]   Do I have that right?
[03:24:13.300 --> 03:24:15.360]   - Right, and there's so much of this that say,
[03:24:15.360 --> 03:24:16.880]   one could do on one's own, right?
[03:24:16.880 --> 03:24:19.500]   'Cause we can think about ourselves and we can learn things.
[03:24:19.500 --> 03:24:21.540]   If we say, well, I don't really know that much
[03:24:21.540 --> 03:24:22.800]   about defense mechanisms.
[03:24:22.800 --> 03:24:25.300]   Okay, look, we could read about it, right?
[03:24:25.300 --> 03:24:27.720]   We can do a lot of this on our own
[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:31.440]   and we can get so much from talking to other people,
[03:24:31.440 --> 03:24:34.580]   people in our lives who are close to us, who love us, right?
[03:24:34.580 --> 03:24:38.100]   We can talk with them about what's going on inside of us.
[03:24:38.100 --> 03:24:41.520]   And that is such an amazing mechanism of learning.
[03:24:41.520 --> 03:24:43.220]   And there are also professional resources.
[03:24:43.220 --> 03:24:45.900]   I mean, like the good therapy should encompass,
[03:24:45.900 --> 03:24:48.340]   like this should be what it's doing, right?
[03:24:48.340 --> 03:24:50.920]   It might come out of through one lens or another lens
[03:24:50.920 --> 03:24:52.920]   and 'cause everybody's different
[03:24:52.920 --> 03:24:54.300]   and we can bring different modalities,
[03:24:54.300 --> 03:24:57.640]   but ultimately that's what good therapy is doing, right?
[03:24:57.640 --> 03:24:59.380]   It's looking in all 10 of those cupboards
[03:24:59.380 --> 03:25:01.160]   and it's seeing where is the issue?
[03:25:01.160 --> 03:25:02.260]   Let's follow the clues.
[03:25:02.260 --> 03:25:04.300]   Like it's a spirited inquiry, right?
[03:25:04.300 --> 03:25:05.820]   Whether we're doing it on our own
[03:25:05.820 --> 03:25:08.460]   or we're doing it with other people in our personal lives
[03:25:08.460 --> 03:25:10.460]   or we're doing it with someone professionally,
[03:25:10.460 --> 03:25:13.380]   it's a spirited inquiry to follow the clues
[03:25:13.380 --> 03:25:16.460]   because if we follow the clues, there are answers, right?
[03:25:16.460 --> 03:25:17.780]   And if we have the answers,
[03:25:17.780 --> 03:25:20.380]   then we can bring things into better alignment
[03:25:20.380 --> 03:25:21.560]   and then we're in a better place.
[03:25:21.560 --> 03:25:23.120]   Those pillows are more stable
[03:25:23.120 --> 03:25:25.380]   and we can build on top of them
[03:25:25.380 --> 03:25:26.860]   what we wanna build on top of them
[03:25:26.860 --> 03:25:29.300]   and the drives come better into line,
[03:25:29.300 --> 03:25:33.220]   that we can do that and it can be an iterative process of,
[03:25:33.220 --> 03:25:35.920]   you know, if we attain some better state of mind
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:38.400]   and like life is better and like we're happy,
[03:25:38.400 --> 03:25:39.580]   like this happens to people.
[03:25:39.580 --> 03:25:41.300]   There's a lot of contentment and peace
[03:25:41.300 --> 03:25:42.580]   and if things are going well
[03:25:42.580 --> 03:25:44.740]   and now something isn't as much,
[03:25:44.740 --> 03:25:46.620]   go back and look again, right?
[03:25:46.620 --> 03:25:48.840]   It's a process we can use over and over
[03:25:48.840 --> 03:25:53.740]   because it works because it fits with the truths
[03:25:53.740 --> 03:25:57.820]   and the reality as we have understood, learned them,
[03:25:57.820 --> 03:25:59.020]   you know, our education,
[03:25:59.020 --> 03:26:02.900]   this learning about humans across hundreds of years
[03:26:02.900 --> 03:26:03.840]   tells us this.
[03:26:03.840 --> 03:26:07.420]   - It makes very good sense to me
[03:26:07.420 --> 03:26:10.520]   in the way that you have mapped it out for us.
[03:26:10.520 --> 03:26:13.140]   So much sense, in fact,
[03:26:13.140 --> 03:26:17.340]   that I'm just struck by how divergent it is
[03:26:17.340 --> 03:26:19.960]   from what I think most people think of
[03:26:19.960 --> 03:26:21.040]   when they think of therapy
[03:26:21.040 --> 03:26:24.400]   or that some of the risks of going to a psychiatrist,
[03:26:24.400 --> 03:26:28.000]   which I think it's only fair to consider.
[03:26:28.000 --> 03:26:29.680]   In particular, the way that,
[03:26:29.680 --> 03:26:35.280]   at least from my outside nonclinical understanding,
[03:26:35.280 --> 03:26:38.280]   these sorts of situations of high levels of demoralization
[03:26:38.280 --> 03:26:39.240]   or excessive aggression,
[03:26:39.240 --> 03:26:41.260]   or just people not being in the place
[03:26:41.260 --> 03:26:45.760]   or being able to exert their actions in the world
[03:26:45.760 --> 03:26:48.440]   the way they want or not get the results they want is
[03:26:48.440 --> 03:26:51.080]   they'll start asking questions like,
[03:26:51.080 --> 03:26:52.840]   you know, maybe I have a chemical imbalance
[03:26:52.840 --> 03:26:55.160]   or maybe they'll go to a clinician,
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:26:59.260]   maybe a cognitive behavioral therapist or psychiatrist.
[03:26:59.260 --> 03:27:02.880]   And more often than not, it seems they'll get,
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:05.020]   you know, a prescription for X number of milligrams
[03:27:05.020 --> 03:27:10.020]   of some serotonergic agonist or a dopaminergic agonist.
[03:27:10.020 --> 03:27:12.120]   And of course, as a neurobiologist,
[03:27:12.120 --> 03:27:16.760]   I applaud the exploration of underlying brain mechanisms
[03:27:16.760 --> 03:27:18.480]   and the involvement of neuromodulators
[03:27:18.480 --> 03:27:19.880]   like dopamine and serotonin.
[03:27:19.880 --> 03:27:23.440]   But what you're describing today is very different,
[03:27:23.440 --> 03:27:28.440]   I think, than what most people can expect
[03:27:28.440 --> 03:27:31.780]   if they go to the typical psychiatrist
[03:27:31.780 --> 03:27:33.800]   or typical psychologist,
[03:27:33.800 --> 03:27:36.160]   which is part of the reason we're having this conversation.
[03:27:36.160 --> 03:27:38.060]   But I'd love your thoughts on that.
[03:27:38.060 --> 03:27:41.400]   And I don't want to make this about me.
[03:27:41.400 --> 03:27:44.620]   I only offer this anecdote as a way to round out
[03:27:44.620 --> 03:27:46.360]   a little bit of the earlier discussion.
[03:27:46.360 --> 03:27:48.560]   I'll never share this publicly,
[03:27:48.560 --> 03:27:50.040]   but when I was a postdoc and going through
[03:27:50.040 --> 03:27:53.440]   that very hard phase of competition that I didn't want
[03:27:53.440 --> 03:27:55.300]   and having a hard time staying in touch with that,
[03:27:55.300 --> 03:27:57.080]   and there were some other developmental things
[03:27:57.080 --> 03:27:59.200]   starting to resurface just by virtue of moving back
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:01.320]   to the town I grew up in, et cetera,
[03:28:01.320 --> 03:28:04.680]   I recall getting to the stairway of the building
[03:28:04.680 --> 03:28:06.400]   I was working in at the time,
[03:28:06.400 --> 03:28:08.360]   which is the same one where my laboratory exists now,
[03:28:08.360 --> 03:28:11.880]   actually, and realizing I couldn't go up the stairway.
[03:28:11.880 --> 03:28:16.720]   I've always been reasonably fit and just being so exhausted.
[03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:19.360]   And then driving home that day on 280
[03:28:19.360 --> 03:28:23.200]   and thinking, you know, like, none of this matters.
[03:28:23.200 --> 03:28:24.780]   Like, what am I doing?
[03:28:24.780 --> 03:28:25.880]   Like, none of it matters.
[03:28:25.880 --> 03:28:27.680]   I could have been exhausted, I don't know what it was,
[03:28:27.680 --> 03:28:29.880]   but what that ultimately resulted in
[03:28:29.880 --> 03:28:32.760]   was me talking to a psychiatrist who gave me a low dose
[03:28:32.760 --> 03:28:37.760]   of a serotonergic antidepressant.
[03:28:38.320 --> 03:28:40.920]   I took that low dose of serotonergic antidepressant,
[03:28:40.920 --> 03:28:42.000]   I don't recall which one it was,
[03:28:42.000 --> 03:28:44.420]   maybe it was citalopram, would that make sense?
[03:28:44.420 --> 03:28:48.040]   And spent that evening staring at my plate of Thai noodles
[03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:49.460]   for about two hours.
[03:28:49.460 --> 03:28:52.360]   It hit me really hard and I hated that feeling
[03:28:52.360 --> 03:28:54.820]   and then just stopped taking the drug.
[03:28:54.820 --> 03:28:57.720]   Now, I'm not, this is no knock on citalopram
[03:28:57.720 --> 03:29:00.320]   or the use of serotonergic agents in the proper context,
[03:29:00.320 --> 03:29:02.960]   they've saved lives, so the problematic too,
[03:29:02.960 --> 03:29:05.600]   but I just, you know, that wasn't the route
[03:29:05.600 --> 03:29:07.280]   that eventually got me out of it.
[03:29:07.280 --> 03:29:11.640]   It was mainly talk therapy and self-care,
[03:29:11.640 --> 03:29:15.000]   but I just offer that because I, you know,
[03:29:15.000 --> 03:29:17.600]   even as a neurobiologist, I perhaps,
[03:29:17.600 --> 03:29:19.040]   especially as a neurobiologist,
[03:29:19.040 --> 03:29:20.680]   I thought, okay, here's the solution, right?
[03:29:20.680 --> 03:29:23.720]   It's going to shift some internal modulatory system
[03:29:23.720 --> 03:29:26.080]   and I'm going to feel okay about the situation I'm in.
[03:29:26.080 --> 03:29:29.480]   And thank goodness it didn't work, even for a short while,
[03:29:29.480 --> 03:29:33.340]   because while I didn't do all the things
[03:29:33.340 --> 03:29:35.840]   that you're describing here of exploring the function
[03:29:35.840 --> 03:29:38.000]   of self because no one has ever laid this out for me,
[03:29:38.000 --> 03:29:41.320]   I took the route of talk therapy,
[03:29:41.320 --> 03:29:44.600]   which I find immensely beneficial.
[03:29:44.600 --> 03:29:47.200]   It takes time, but immensely beneficial.
[03:29:47.200 --> 03:29:50.040]   So what are your thoughts on the current strategies
[03:29:50.040 --> 03:29:54.440]   for diagnosis, where those succeed, where they fall short,
[03:29:54.440 --> 03:29:58.700]   and the role of medication in navigating this, you know,
[03:29:58.700 --> 03:30:01.720]   simple and yet complex landscape?
[03:30:01.720 --> 03:30:05.840]   We are so dramatically over reductionist, you know,
[03:30:05.840 --> 03:30:10.040]   it's almost to the point of unbelievable, right?
[03:30:10.040 --> 03:30:12.520]   I mean, think about getting a medicine,
[03:30:12.520 --> 03:30:17.600]   getting some say, citalopram, because of what happened, right?
[03:30:17.600 --> 03:30:20.720]   It can't possibly work, right?
[03:30:20.720 --> 03:30:23.520]   Now, maybe a judiciously chosen medicine
[03:30:23.520 --> 03:30:26.080]   could provide a little more distress tolerance
[03:30:26.080 --> 03:30:27.520]   and you could sort of think about it more
[03:30:27.520 --> 03:30:28.720]   and you could find your way through it,
[03:30:28.720 --> 03:30:31.480]   but clearly it was an issue of self, right?
[03:30:31.480 --> 03:30:33.960]   Like you're in a situation that was high stress
[03:30:33.960 --> 03:30:35.920]   and are you gonna have to have this competition or not?
[03:30:35.920 --> 03:30:36.960]   Is it gonna be good for you?
[03:30:36.960 --> 03:30:39.760]   And, you know, you don't want that, but can you avoid it?
[03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:41.080]   Like there's something going on
[03:30:41.080 --> 03:30:43.800]   that makes you not be able to walk up those stairs, right?
[03:30:43.800 --> 03:30:46.320]   So again, I'm not criticizing, I don't know what the person,
[03:30:46.320 --> 03:30:48.560]   what kind of conversations you had about it with the person,
[03:30:48.560 --> 03:30:51.720]   but the idea that a pill will fix that is like,
[03:30:51.720 --> 03:30:53.840]   that's insane, right?
[03:30:53.840 --> 03:30:56.000]   Now, medicines can help smooth the way.
[03:30:56.000 --> 03:30:59.440]   So let's say you initially went
[03:30:59.440 --> 03:31:00.960]   and the first time you see someone and they say,
[03:31:00.960 --> 03:31:02.160]   okay, we have to talk about this, right?
[03:31:02.160 --> 03:31:03.920]   Like what's going on in your life?
[03:31:03.920 --> 03:31:06.880]   'Cause normally you can walk upstairs and go to work, right?
[03:31:06.880 --> 03:31:08.080]   Why can't you now?
[03:31:08.080 --> 03:31:10.760]   Like we need to think about that when you talk about that.
[03:31:10.760 --> 03:31:11.880]   Let's say you start doing that
[03:31:11.880 --> 03:31:13.960]   and you're having a lot of trouble with it,
[03:31:13.960 --> 03:31:16.000]   or you're just having really high levels of anxiety.
[03:31:16.000 --> 03:31:17.480]   You might say, look, medicine can kind of
[03:31:17.480 --> 03:31:19.440]   take the temperature down a little bit,
[03:31:19.440 --> 03:31:21.440]   give you a little more distress tolerance,
[03:31:21.440 --> 03:31:25.200]   and then you can think about it better inside of you
[03:31:25.200 --> 03:31:26.600]   and we can talk about it better,
[03:31:26.600 --> 03:31:29.160]   but it's medicine in the service of understanding.
[03:31:29.160 --> 03:31:31.480]   Now, sometimes medicines are doing things
[03:31:31.480 --> 03:31:34.920]   like medicines that can help prevent bipolar episodes, right?
[03:31:34.920 --> 03:31:37.760]   Like they're doing something that is purely biological,
[03:31:37.760 --> 03:31:40.840]   but we use so many medicines for things
[03:31:40.840 --> 03:31:43.160]   that are not biological, they're psychological,
[03:31:43.160 --> 03:31:45.360]   but we're so over reductionist
[03:31:45.360 --> 03:31:47.120]   that we could actually over reduce
[03:31:47.120 --> 03:31:49.160]   the problem that you said, right?
[03:31:49.160 --> 03:31:51.400]   Like a clear, wow, that's fascinating, right?
[03:31:51.400 --> 03:31:53.360]   Like how many times have you gone up those stairs
[03:31:53.360 --> 03:31:54.520]   and now you can't?
[03:31:54.520 --> 03:31:56.200]   It's so interesting, the idea of like,
[03:31:56.200 --> 03:31:57.600]   let's just give you a pill.
[03:31:57.600 --> 03:31:59.880]   I mean, it really makes no sense,
[03:31:59.880 --> 03:32:01.960]   but if we're over reductionist enough,
[03:32:01.960 --> 03:32:04.960]   you could see how that's the logical end point
[03:32:04.960 --> 03:32:07.200]   of an illogical process, right?
[03:32:07.200 --> 03:32:08.640]   And I'll give you another example,
[03:32:08.640 --> 03:32:12.600]   and this is really, it's a true story of a young woman
[03:32:12.600 --> 03:32:15.000]   comes into the emergency room and she says she can't sleep
[03:32:15.000 --> 03:32:19.080]   and she looks anxious and she feels very, very anxious
[03:32:19.080 --> 03:32:21.880]   by her description and that's why she can't sleep
[03:32:21.880 --> 03:32:23.800]   and she gets a sleeping medicine.
[03:32:24.360 --> 03:32:26.840]   And she goes home and then she comes back.
[03:32:26.840 --> 03:32:28.400]   She comes back a couple of days later
[03:32:28.400 --> 03:32:30.720]   and she's very, very anxious and she can't sleep
[03:32:30.720 --> 03:32:32.480]   and she looks like she did before,
[03:32:32.480 --> 03:32:33.840]   like nothing seems to be different
[03:32:33.840 --> 03:32:35.320]   and she hasn't gotten any sleep at all.
[03:32:35.320 --> 03:32:38.840]   So the doctor in charge gives her a higher dose
[03:32:38.840 --> 03:32:40.840]   of the sleeping medicine.
[03:32:40.840 --> 03:32:45.000]   Then she goes home and then she comes back yet again
[03:32:45.000 --> 03:32:46.960]   and nothing is any different.
[03:32:46.960 --> 03:32:49.360]   She's still not sleeping, she's still anxious.
[03:32:49.360 --> 03:32:52.440]   And then the doctor concludes that she's drug seeking
[03:32:52.440 --> 03:32:56.040]   because she wants more and more of the sleeping medicine.
[03:32:56.040 --> 03:32:59.760]   Okay, what was actually going on
[03:32:59.760 --> 03:33:03.200]   was she was getting hurt at home.
[03:33:03.200 --> 03:33:05.440]   She was terrified to go home.
[03:33:05.440 --> 03:33:07.600]   Of course she couldn't sleep, right?
[03:33:07.600 --> 03:33:10.640]   Like bad things were happening, right?
[03:33:10.640 --> 03:33:12.720]   But no one asked the question, right?
[03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:16.000]   They thought she cannot sleep, we'll give sleeping medicine
[03:33:16.000 --> 03:33:18.680]   instead of asking why, right?
[03:33:18.680 --> 03:33:20.680]   And then she gets home, she's sent home
[03:33:20.680 --> 03:33:22.640]   and when the medicine doesn't work,
[03:33:22.640 --> 03:33:25.920]   well, now there's something wrong with her, right?
[03:33:25.920 --> 03:33:28.560]   And if you put that label on her, now she's drug seeking,
[03:33:28.560 --> 03:33:31.440]   right, then she's not going to get any help, right?
[03:33:31.440 --> 03:33:33.680]   So I'm not against medicines.
[03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:37.080]   I mean, I use psychopharmacology as part of my practice
[03:33:37.080 --> 03:33:39.680]   and I think from a biologically based perspective
[03:33:39.680 --> 03:33:41.000]   about many things.
[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:43.480]   But we have to know what something is the answer for
[03:33:43.480 --> 03:33:46.240]   and what something is not the answer for.
[03:33:46.240 --> 03:33:49.480]   And in the overly reductionist world of throughput
[03:33:49.480 --> 03:33:52.600]   in healthcare systems, people are even being trained
[03:33:52.600 --> 03:33:54.560]   these days that don't know any different, right?
[03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:57.520]   And I'm trying to be overly critical of practitioners
[03:33:57.520 --> 03:33:58.840]   because often practitioners are working
[03:33:58.840 --> 03:34:02.520]   in impossible situations where the goal is throughput
[03:34:02.520 --> 03:34:05.560]   and that's more efficient in the short term, right?
[03:34:05.560 --> 03:34:07.120]   It's more efficient today, right?
[03:34:07.120 --> 03:34:11.000]   But it's of course not good in anything but the today term.
[03:34:11.000 --> 03:34:12.800]   And it's interesting because it's never good
[03:34:12.800 --> 03:34:14.040]   for the person even today.
[03:34:14.040 --> 03:34:16.920]   It's like never good for the people in it, right?
[03:34:16.920 --> 03:34:19.280]   But often these decisions are being made
[03:34:19.280 --> 03:34:20.720]   based upon business and money.
[03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:24.440]   And I understand business and money, I'm a capitalist,
[03:34:24.440 --> 03:34:25.560]   I'm interested in these things.
[03:34:25.560 --> 03:34:28.640]   But the way that we have let things get,
[03:34:28.640 --> 03:34:31.240]   the business and money with a short-sighted,
[03:34:31.240 --> 03:34:33.720]   short-term perspective then bonds
[03:34:33.720 --> 03:34:37.720]   with the over reductionist ways that we approach medicine
[03:34:37.720 --> 03:34:40.840]   and then we have these bizarre things happen
[03:34:40.840 --> 03:34:44.160]   and these kinds of bizarre things end lives, right?
[03:34:44.160 --> 03:34:45.840]   It changed the courses of lives.
[03:34:45.840 --> 03:34:49.280]   Like fortunately you got what you needed
[03:34:49.280 --> 03:34:51.800]   and you figured things out but if you hadn't,
[03:34:51.800 --> 03:34:53.080]   would you have the career you have?
[03:34:53.080 --> 03:34:54.200]   Like we don't know, right?
[03:34:54.200 --> 03:34:56.840]   Or if someone else hadn't realized like,
[03:34:56.840 --> 03:34:59.720]   let's talk to that woman and see what's going on.
[03:34:59.720 --> 03:35:00.760]   Would she have survived?
[03:35:00.760 --> 03:35:02.640]   I mean, we don't know.
[03:35:02.640 --> 03:35:06.120]   But the point of that is like lots of bad things happen,
[03:35:06.120 --> 03:35:06.960]   right?
[03:35:06.960 --> 03:35:09.120]   We're rolling the dice too many times with too many people
[03:35:09.120 --> 03:35:11.000]   and it doesn't have to be that way.
[03:35:11.000 --> 03:35:12.280]   And the way that we're doing it now
[03:35:12.280 --> 03:35:16.120]   is not only inefficient financially, right?
[03:35:16.120 --> 03:35:18.520]   The thing that we seem to be caring about most,
[03:35:18.520 --> 03:35:22.000]   it leads to bad outcomes and it also makes no sense, right?
[03:35:22.000 --> 03:35:24.480]   We're looking at it through this sort of bizarre lens
[03:35:24.480 --> 03:35:28.200]   then we may find within us the strength to change that
[03:35:28.200 --> 03:35:30.360]   and to change it in a way that actually fits the science
[03:35:30.360 --> 03:35:32.520]   and fits the common sense.
[03:35:32.520 --> 03:35:34.200]   - I have to imagine that both for people
[03:35:34.200 --> 03:35:38.520]   who require medication in order to cope,
[03:35:38.520 --> 03:35:42.320]   in order to manage their way through these questions
[03:35:42.320 --> 03:35:44.760]   about function of self and how they are in the world,
[03:35:44.760 --> 03:35:47.360]   what they're paying attention to, et cetera.
[03:35:47.360 --> 03:35:49.820]   And for people who don't require medication
[03:35:49.820 --> 03:35:52.100]   to do this exploration,
[03:35:52.100 --> 03:35:56.400]   that this very same exploration is the roadmap
[03:35:56.400 --> 03:35:59.800]   to feeling agency, gratitude, peace,
[03:35:59.800 --> 03:36:01.560]   contentment and delight.
[03:36:01.560 --> 03:36:02.960]   - Medicines may have a role.
[03:36:02.960 --> 03:36:06.040]   So if, for example, we go look at the pillars
[03:36:06.040 --> 03:36:08.200]   and things are not going so well
[03:36:08.200 --> 03:36:10.040]   and you see that whenever that person
[03:36:10.040 --> 03:36:12.200]   has a bipolar manic episode,
[03:36:12.200 --> 03:36:14.360]   well, things get really, really damaged
[03:36:14.360 --> 03:36:15.960]   and it's very, very hard.
[03:36:15.960 --> 03:36:17.840]   They can't recover from that in the ways they want to.
[03:36:17.840 --> 03:36:20.320]   Then we'd say, well, we're gonna use medicine
[03:36:20.320 --> 03:36:21.200]   to help this, right?
[03:36:21.200 --> 03:36:22.840]   Now, of course, there are other things too.
[03:36:22.840 --> 03:36:25.320]   You use behavioral changes, for example, right?
[03:36:25.320 --> 03:36:28.340]   But there's a clear biological role,
[03:36:28.340 --> 03:36:30.680]   just like we use medicine to stop seizures, right?
[03:36:30.680 --> 03:36:31.900]   But people also have to make sure
[03:36:31.900 --> 03:36:33.560]   they're not super sleep deprived.
[03:36:33.560 --> 03:36:35.000]   There's another part to it too.
[03:36:35.000 --> 03:36:37.360]   We can use medicine to prevent bipolar episodes
[03:36:37.360 --> 03:36:40.160]   but there's another part of self-care involved too.
[03:36:40.160 --> 03:36:42.260]   But it's a role of medicine, right?
[03:36:42.260 --> 03:36:45.480]   Just as if anxiety levels aren't coming down too much,
[03:36:45.480 --> 03:36:47.800]   say for the person to get at the trauma, right?
[03:36:47.800 --> 03:36:49.240]   They know there's a trauma.
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:51.360]   They've talked around it for 20 years.
[03:36:51.360 --> 03:36:52.520]   They know it's been impacting them.
[03:36:52.520 --> 03:36:53.760]   They're not sure how.
[03:36:53.760 --> 03:36:54.880]   It's hard to go there.
[03:36:54.880 --> 03:36:56.240]   They're with a trusted therapist,
[03:36:56.240 --> 03:36:58.240]   but it's still, it's hard to put words to it.
[03:36:58.240 --> 03:37:00.960]   And now they're maybe having a panic attack, right?
[03:37:00.960 --> 03:37:02.680]   They think, okay, we can use medicines
[03:37:02.680 --> 03:37:04.000]   to take the temperature down
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:07.080]   to sort of ease that person's way forward
[03:37:07.080 --> 03:37:09.420]   so that they can understand something, right?
[03:37:09.420 --> 03:37:12.160]   That then provides a resolution in that part of the pillar
[03:37:12.160 --> 03:37:14.800]   and then, you know, things are set in a better place.
[03:37:14.800 --> 03:37:18.500]   So the biological aspect, you know,
[03:37:18.500 --> 03:37:20.280]   specifically here we're talking about medicines,
[03:37:20.280 --> 03:37:23.420]   has its place, but the idea that medicines
[03:37:23.420 --> 03:37:28.420]   are a substitute for understanding just makes no sense.
[03:37:28.420 --> 03:37:31.920]   Well, you've provided us an incredible framework.
[03:37:31.920 --> 03:37:33.140]   Thank you.
[03:37:33.140 --> 03:37:36.840]   You know, this framework really speaks to all of us, right?
[03:37:36.840 --> 03:37:39.760]   You know, that the components that make us who we are,
[03:37:39.760 --> 03:37:43.120]   you know, as you put it, the structure of the self,
[03:37:43.120 --> 03:37:44.920]   you know, everything from the unconscious mind,
[03:37:44.920 --> 03:37:46.440]   conscious mind, defense mechanisms,
[03:37:46.440 --> 03:37:49.960]   character structure, self, and the functions of self.
[03:37:49.960 --> 03:37:53.320]   You know, these components of self-awareness,
[03:37:53.320 --> 03:37:56.360]   defense mechanisms, reaching up from that iceberg
[03:37:56.360 --> 03:37:59.320]   under the water, what we pay attention to,
[03:37:59.320 --> 03:38:03.120]   our behaviors and hopefully our strivings and sense of hope
[03:38:03.120 --> 03:38:05.120]   and how those two pillars flow up
[03:38:05.120 --> 03:38:09.080]   into empowerment, humility, agency, and gratitude,
[03:38:09.080 --> 03:38:11.820]   again, as action terms, as active terms,
[03:38:11.820 --> 03:38:15.280]   and eventually to peace, contentment, and delight
[03:38:15.280 --> 03:38:18.080]   in this notion of generative drive,
[03:38:18.080 --> 03:38:21.400]   as well as some of the pitfalls and challenges
[03:38:21.400 --> 03:38:23.480]   that can pull down on generative drive
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:25.620]   or occlude generative drive.
[03:38:25.620 --> 03:38:29.160]   And you very clearly pointed us to where we should all look
[03:38:29.160 --> 03:38:32.120]   in terms of understanding ourselves better
[03:38:32.120 --> 03:38:36.480]   and where we could do better and be better in the world.
[03:38:36.480 --> 03:38:37.680]   Because this is a series,
[03:38:37.680 --> 03:38:39.240]   we have the wonderful opportunity
[03:38:39.240 --> 03:38:41.560]   to have you tell us even more
[03:38:41.560 --> 03:38:44.360]   about how this structure plays out,
[03:38:44.360 --> 03:38:46.440]   both in terms of its healthy expression
[03:38:46.440 --> 03:38:49.120]   and in terms of its unhealthy expression,
[03:38:49.120 --> 03:38:51.360]   you know, in different pathologic conditions
[03:38:51.360 --> 03:38:53.480]   that, you know, most of us are familiar with,
[03:38:53.480 --> 03:38:54.720]   at least in name.
[03:38:54.720 --> 03:38:57.300]   And I'm sure you're going to tell us more about,
[03:38:57.300 --> 03:39:00.920]   you know, what the real both underpinnings and expressions
[03:39:00.920 --> 03:39:03.140]   of things like narcissism and, you know,
[03:39:03.140 --> 03:39:05.840]   extreme and mild form, you know,
[03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:08.640]   anxiety and its extreme and mild forms,
[03:39:08.640 --> 03:39:12.320]   and also some of the names and diagnoses
[03:39:12.320 --> 03:39:14.940]   that we're more familiar with hearing about,
[03:39:14.940 --> 03:39:16.560]   such as, you know, bipolar disorder,
[03:39:16.560 --> 03:39:19.200]   obsessive compulsive things of that sort,
[03:39:19.200 --> 03:39:22.760]   but that all relate back to and really are nested
[03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:25.720]   in this structure and function of self
[03:39:25.720 --> 03:39:26.740]   and where it can all go.
[03:39:26.740 --> 03:39:30.700]   So first of all, I want to say thank you,
[03:39:30.700 --> 03:39:34.860]   really an immense thank you for defining the structure
[03:39:34.860 --> 03:39:37.660]   and making it so clear to me and to everybody else.
[03:39:37.660 --> 03:39:40.380]   And as you said, it has its complexity.
[03:39:40.380 --> 03:39:42.880]   There's in fact immense complexity down there at the bottom,
[03:39:42.880 --> 03:39:46.880]   but that flows up from complex to very simple ideals
[03:39:46.880 --> 03:39:48.700]   and a roadmap to get there.
[03:39:48.700 --> 03:39:51.020]   And again, the PDF is available to people
[03:39:51.020 --> 03:39:53.420]   as a link in the show note captions,
[03:39:53.420 --> 03:39:55.860]   should they want to see this in visual form.
[03:39:55.860 --> 03:39:58.420]   I also want to thank you for assembling the structure,
[03:39:58.420 --> 03:39:59.560]   not just as a tutorial,
[03:39:59.560 --> 03:40:02.500]   but because at least to my knowledge,
[03:40:02.500 --> 03:40:06.940]   no such structure or summary of these structures,
[03:40:06.940 --> 03:40:08.900]   it exists anywhere in the world.
[03:40:08.900 --> 03:40:11.760]   And certainly not in any form that the non-clinician
[03:40:11.760 --> 03:40:14.440]   and not, you know, highly trained psychiatrist
[03:40:14.440 --> 03:40:15.940]   could ever access or understand.
[03:40:15.940 --> 03:40:18.980]   So this is both an immense resource
[03:40:18.980 --> 03:40:21.180]   and an immense gift to us all.
[03:40:21.180 --> 03:40:22.620]   Thank you so very much.
[03:40:22.620 --> 03:40:24.980]   - You're so welcome and thank you for having me here,
[03:40:24.980 --> 03:40:26.220]   which is a gift.
[03:40:26.220 --> 03:40:30.340]   - Well, to be continued in the next episode, thank you.
[03:40:30.340 --> 03:40:32.620]   Thank you for joining me for this first episode
[03:40:32.620 --> 03:40:35.580]   of our series on mental health with Dr. Paul Conte.
[03:40:35.580 --> 03:40:37.080]   And I encourage you to keep an eye out
[03:40:37.080 --> 03:40:39.020]   for the second episode in the series,
[03:40:39.020 --> 03:40:40.060]   which is going to be about
[03:40:40.060 --> 03:40:41.920]   how to improve your mental health.
[03:40:41.920 --> 03:40:43.640]   I'll just remind you that all episodes

[03:41:18.340 --> 03:41:20.220]   I do read all the comments.

[03:41:22.380 --> 03:41:24.420]   I am Huberman Lab on all platforms.
[03:41:24.420 --> 03:41:27.640]   So that's Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, Threads, and Facebook.
[03:41:27.640 --> 03:41:29.300]   And on all those platforms,
[03:41:29.300 --> 03:41:31.340]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[03:41:31.340 --> 03:41:32.980]   some of which overlap with the content
[03:41:32.980 --> 03:41:34.300]   of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:41:34.300 --> 03:41:36.380]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[03:41:36.380 --> 03:41:37.660]   of the Huberman Lab podcast.
[03:41:37.660 --> 03:41:40.840]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media channels.
[03:41:40.840 --> 03:41:42.080]   Not on today's episode,
[03:41:42.080 --> 03:41:44.560]   but on many previous episodes of the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:41:44.560 --> 03:41:45.940]   we discussed supplements.
[03:41:45.940 --> 03:41:48.080]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[03:41:48.080 --> 03:41:50.020]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[03:41:50.020 --> 03:41:52.440]   for things like enhancing sleep, for hormone support,
[03:41:52.440 --> 03:41:53.780]   and for focus.
[03:41:53.780 --> 03:41:55.360]   If you'd like to see the supplements discussed
[03:41:55.360 --> 03:41:56.500]   on the Huberman Lab podcast,
[03:41:56.500 --> 03:41:58.960]   you can go to Live Momentus, spelled O-U-S.
[03:41:58.960 --> 03:42:01.900]   So it's livemomentus.com/huberman.
[03:42:01.900 --> 03:42:04.120]   If you haven't already subscribed to our newsletter,
[03:42:04.120 --> 03:42:05.700]   it is a zero-cost newsletter
[03:42:05.700 --> 03:42:07.400]   called the Neural Network Newsletter.
[03:42:07.400 --> 03:42:09.240]   And in the Neural Network Newsletter,
[03:42:09.240 --> 03:42:12.020]   you get free podcast summaries as well as toolkits.
[03:42:12.020 --> 03:42:14.140]   The toolkits are brief PDFs
[03:42:14.140 --> 03:42:16.900]   that list off the specific science-backed protocols
[03:42:16.900 --> 03:42:19.260]   for things like improving your sleep, improving focus,
[03:42:19.260 --> 03:42:21.700]   optimizing dopamine, deliberate cold exposure.
[03:42:21.700 --> 03:42:24.180]   We have a complete summary of our fitness series.
[03:42:24.180 --> 03:42:26.300]   Again, all available, completely zero cost.
[03:42:26.300 --> 03:42:29.140]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu,
[03:42:29.140 --> 03:42:30.220]   scroll down to newsletter,
[03:42:30.220 --> 03:42:32.000]   and provide your email to sign up.
[03:42:32.000 --> 03:42:34.400]   We do not share your email with anybody.
[03:42:34.400 --> 03:42:36.660]   Thank you once again for joining me for today's discussion,
[03:42:36.660 --> 03:42:38.680]   which is the first episode in our series
[03:42:38.680 --> 03:42:41.260]   about mental health with Dr. Paul Conte.
[03:42:41.260 --> 03:42:43.300]   And last, but certainly not least,
[03:42:43.300 --> 03:42:45.140]   thank you for your interest in science.
[03:42:45.140 --> 03:42:47.720]   [upbeat music]
[03:42:47.720 --> 03:42:50.300]   (upbeat music)
