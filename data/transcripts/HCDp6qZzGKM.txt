[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Continuing our conversation from the last two episodes, episode 274 and 275,
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.520]   does this digital revolution and the abundance of Bible apps that we have
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.760]   access to today, does this undermine our need for Bible memorization? So if I know
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.440]   there's an important verse in the Bible about a vine and a branch, but I can't
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.160]   remember the details, I don't need to memorize the details because I can just
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.440]   pull out my app and do a quick search just for those two key words and in a
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.040]   moment the verse appears. Do you think, Pastor John, that digital Bible access
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:41.800]   will undermine Bible memory and should it? Absolutely not. That argument would
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.440]   proceed on the assumption that the only or the chief motive for memorizing
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.760]   Scripture is the functional availability to use in some context. Well, that's a
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:01.360]   good motivation. It's just not the only one or I would say not the main one. The
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:09.680]   main one is what happens to your mind when it is structured and here I think
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:16.120]   things go very deep, Tony. I don't know, I'm not a neuroscientist. I don't
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:24.080]   know how the synapses and chemicals and electricity in the brain work, but I
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.000]   know enough to know that the memorizing of anything or the habituation of the
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.680]   mind to anything is a physiological and a spiritual phenomenon and the mind is
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.640]   being shaped. So when Paul said, "Do not be conformed to this world, but be
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.320]   transformed by the renewing of your mind," that's amazing. I mean, that's one of
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.600]   those powerful statements in the world, that your mind that God has given you is
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.480]   to be renewed, and I would say the primary way that happens is immersion in
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.680]   the mind of God, and one of the primary ways immersion in the mind of God
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.960]   happens is through memorizing the Scriptures. And back to the practical
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:25.000]   part, it is far more powerful. I've seen this again and again, Tony. I've seen it
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.240]   in worship, I've seen it at the Lord's table, I've seen it at the hospital bed,
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.080]   I've seen it in the counseling room. If, as you're chatting with somebody or as
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.560]   you're leading in the Lord's table or as you're standing at a bedside, the Lord
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:47.160]   brings to mind a precious part of the Bible, and you can look a dying man right
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.200]   in the face and recite to him the last five verses of Romans 8, there isn't
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.440]   anything more powerful than if you...it's just so much more powerful than if you
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.320]   say, "Well, let me reach in here and get my phone, click, click, click, click, click." At
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.720]   that moment, that just feels so distant, so artificial, but if it's brimming
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.880]   within you with power because God has put it there, he's woven it into your
[00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:15.160]   brain, then there's a kind of authenticity and power in the delivery.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.880]   In the hospital bed or, I said, at the communion table. I remember one time at
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   the communion table, I recited all of Isaiah 53 from memory. One of the
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.800]   pastor's wives came up to me afterwards, so moved, and she said, "I love that
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.040]   chapter, and it has never had such power for me as when you simply looked at me
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.160]   and said the whole thing." And I know that's true. When I'm around somebody
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.840]   who can look at me and exhort me eye-to-eye with the Scripture, there's
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.560]   more there than if he is reading it to me. So my answer is no. The digital
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:09.200]   revolution will not, God please, will not replace memorization. Yes, that's wise
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.720]   counsel. Thank you, Pastor John. And this conversation reminds me of a previous
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.120]   Ask Pastor John episode we recorded titled, "Bible Memory as Ministry to
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.920]   Others," which was episode number 131, and you can find that in the archives.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.600]   Tomorrow I'll ask you, Pastor John, a question we get from time to time. Why is
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.080]   John Piper's preaching so intellectual and sometimes so hard to understand? I
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.040]   look forward to hearing what you have to say, Pastor John. Until then, I'm your
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.680]   host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening.
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.340]   you
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.400]   you
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:52.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
