[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.520]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.720]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.340]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.340]   My name is Joshua Sheets.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.820]   Today we continue our How to Buy a Car series.
[00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.560]   This is episode 3 in that series.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.820]   Episode 1, we talked about deciding whether you should buy a car or not, and I encouraged
[00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.780]   you that if possible, most people should avoid owning a car from a financial perspective,
[00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.880]   but many of us from a lifestyle perspective will choose to buy a car.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.040]   But you should decide and think carefully about the things you would give up by even
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.840]   buying a car in the first place, while also considering the reasons why a car could be
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.820]   a really important part of your life assets.
[00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.080]   In episode 2, we talked about deciding what kind of car you should buy.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.960]   We talked about analyzing your needs, your wants, the size of the car, the specific capabilities,
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.520]   the features, the fanciness, the image, etc. and even your needs now and later.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.400]   I walked you through so hopefully you have some ideas of deciding what kind of car would
[00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.440]   be appropriate for you.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.920]   In today's episode, I want to talk to you about step 3, which is decide how much you
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.520]   should spend on a car.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.320]   We want to do this before we go to the market to look at what is available.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.400]   We want to decide how much you should spend on a car.
[00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:53.280]   I want you to come up with a specific number that will be appropriate for you to spend
[00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.200]   on a car.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.960]   Quick reminder, why does this matter?
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:03.960]   Very simply, a car is a big purchase that will go down in value.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.480]   Again, slight caveat, over the last couple of years it has been a wacky market, cars
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:16.060]   have not gone down in value the way they traditionally have, but I think it is very obvious that
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.840]   this is a temporary aberration and we will quickly return if we haven't already returned
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:28.120]   to a normal market with cars, where cars go down in value.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   This matters a lot when you think about growing your finances.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.400]   Cars are not usually the biggest expense that people make.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.520]   For example, a house is usually the biggest expense that most normal people make, but
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.600]   purchasing a house is a good way to increase your net worth.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.840]   Houses generally go up in value.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.800]   Cars generally go down in value.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.160]   There are other large expenses that we know are pure consumption items.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.440]   For example, if you plan an elaborate and expensive vacation this year, you will go
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.560]   into that knowing that I am spending money on something that I want to spend money on
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.640]   and there is no sense of financial return to it.
[00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.760]   People look at cars as having utility value, I have to have one, it is something that I
[00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760]   need.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.440]   If you are going to be losing money on something that has utility value, you want to make sure
[00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.520]   that the amount of money that you lose is not going to sink you.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.400]   We make lots of purchases of things that go down in value.
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.680]   You might go out and buy the latest $1,000 iPhone and that iPhone will lose half or more
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.080]   than half of its value in the first year of ownership.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.440]   But that amount of financial loss isn't going to sink most people.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.720]   It might sink someone who is very young or who has very low wages, but that decrease
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.680]   in value of a $1,000 iPhone losing $500 of depreciation is not going to sink most people's
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:52.680]   finances.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:04:00.440]   But if we compare the $1,000 iPhone to a $50,000 car, we are in a very different situation.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:06.600]   A $50,000 car that loses 15% of its value in a year, which is the normal rate of depreciation
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:13.000]   of vehicles, will lose $7,500 of value this year.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.760]   That's too much money to lose until you're rich.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.360]   Remember, I often compare this to something like fully funding a retirement account.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:30.160]   If you fully fund a Roth IRA, that simple annual contribution, instead of losing $7,500
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.820]   on vehicle depreciation, you choose to put the money into a retirement account.
[00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.800]   That decision alone, doing that every year, can make you a millionaire in the fullness
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.280]   of time.
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.320]   So that's too much money to lose until you're rich, especially when we're talking about
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.360]   depreciation alone.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:49.280]   Remember that depreciation is not the only expense.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.640]   The rest of your car expenses will generally be proportionate to the purchase price of
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.880]   your car.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.380]   Buy a more expensive car that's newer, you'll generally have a higher cost of insurance.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:06.400]   Buy a more expensive car that's newer, you're more likely to spend extra money modifying
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.160]   it and getting it accessorized just the way that you want.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.720]   Even buy a new car and you're going to spend more money on car washes and car washing equipment,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.720]   etc.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.000]   Now, these aren't always perfectly proportional.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.960]   There are often ways that you can look at this and argue the opposite.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:29.280]   For example, an older car might actually not save you that much on insurance if it is an
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   unsafe car.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.380]   Because remember that there are two components to purchasing auto insurance.
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.440]   There is your liability component and then also your comprehensive and collision insurance,
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.920]   which is based upon the value of the car.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:50.040]   But if you're just maintaining liability insurance on your vehicle and you are seeking to carry
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:06:00.420]   -- you're maintaining liability insurance on the vehicle, then your risk -- my brain
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:06.900]   totally froze up -- your risk is going to be based upon the risk of injury to inhabitants
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.640]   of that vehicle in many cases.
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.240]   So sometimes an older car doesn't actually save you that much money on the liability
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.240]   component.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.360]   But generally, you're going to have cheaper insurance with an older car.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:21.400]   You can often drop your comprehensive and collision coverage on an older car where you
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.200]   wouldn't do that with a newer car, etc.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:28.440]   So prices and costs and expenses on a car are generally proportionate to the purchase
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.440]   price.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:33.200]   A car is a big purchase that will go down in value.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:39.960]   And so we want to minimize the losses to an amount that is acceptable based upon our current
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.680]   net worth and our ambitions for wealth building.
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:47.200]   So how much should you spend on a car?
[00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.280]   I'm going to give you three suggestions.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:55.840]   The first suggestion is you should spend the amount of money that you have.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.680]   And what I mean is you should limit your purchase to the amount of money that you have saved.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.400]   I'll talk in a separate episode about the advisability of financing cars versus paying
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.760]   cash.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:11.560]   There are a few scenarios in which it can make sense to finance a car, which I'll deal
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.120]   with separately.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:19.640]   But in virtually all other scenarios, you're better off simply paying cash.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.640]   And you should limit yourself to the amount of money that you have saved.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:28.720]   Here I'm specifically targeting people who are younger in their wealth building journey.
[00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:34.380]   If you've got $5,000 saved in a bank account and you want to go and buy a car, don't go
[00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.780]   out and start shopping for $20,000 cars.
[00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:41.400]   Shop for $4,000 and under cars.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.920]   Always limit yourself to the amount of money that you have saved.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:49.300]   Car payments are a seductive thing.
[00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.140]   Car payments are the sign and stigma of poor people.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:59.200]   You can raise your income to the point where, "Yeah, I've got a car payment.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:00.440]   It's no big deal."
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:05.280]   There are lots and lots and lots of multi-millionaires out there who have a couple thousand dollars
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.600]   a month in car payments, and it's no big deal.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:09.240]   They take advantage of a 0% financing.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:12.040]   They like driving new cars, and it's no big deal.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:17.680]   But most people who have large car payments are broke.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.080]   They're not broke because they borrowed money.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:22.360]   They're broke because they borrowed too much money.
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.240]   They're broke because they didn't obey the rules that I'm going to get to in a moment.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.800]   One simple way of avoiding disaster is simply limiting yourself to the amount of money that
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.680]   you have.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:40.000]   This simple rule is astoundingly effective because it causes you to think very carefully
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.480]   about the value of a car.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:43.320]   Let me give you an example.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.440]   Let's say that you're 25 years old.
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.000]   You've been a diligent saver.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.300]   You've saved $50,000.
[00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:56.440]   Would you really go out and freely spend $50,000 on a car in that scenario?
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:01.860]   Most people who were diligent enough to save and accumulate $50,000 would not do that.
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:06.240]   They would recognize that they saved the money for a reason, and they would focus on finding
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.700]   an investment for the money that could allow it to grow more.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.040]   But there are many people who will go out, and because there's lower friction of having
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:20.920]   car payments, easily buy a $50,000 car with a series of timed payments.
[00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:21.920]   You want to avoid that.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:26.560]   Rule number one is limit yourself to the amount of money that you have, the amount of money
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.800]   that you have saved.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:30.760]   It's a good rule of thumb.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:38.800]   The next limitation is don't ever spend more than somewhere between 10% to 50% of your
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:46.240]   annual income on cars or cumulatively vehicles.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:48.400]   You'll notice that's a very broad range.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.440]   10% to 50% is a big range.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:10:00.320]   Your decision on how much to spend on a vehicle will come down to some of the other factors
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.200]   that we've talked about.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:05.840]   If you never go more than 50%, you're going to be fine.
[00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:10.560]   But if you really care about wealth building, I would encourage you to focus on about a
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.160]   10% of your annual income.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:18.840]   Again, the reason this is important is it keeps your money available to you to invest
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.440]   in the things that are going up in value.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.160]   Let me talk about these ranges of numbers.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:31.560]   The 10% rule I owe to many years ago, a blog post by the financial blogger Financial Samurai.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.720]   This was 10 years ago.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.840]   I came across his original blog post on the subject and I thought, "That makes sense."
[00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:43.720]   Prior to that, I had no personal rule for the amount of car to buy.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.720]   Most people don't.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:50.440]   If you go and you ask a random person on the street, "How much should you spend on a car?"
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.200]   Most people don't have any rule.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.200]   They will say, "As much as you can afford," but how would you know what you can afford?
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:01.360]   Or they'll say, "As much as you have," or you need some rule.
[00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:07.440]   When I found the 10% rule, it resonated with me because 10% is such a low amount of money
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:13.920]   that it always keeps huge amounts of your money available for investing.
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:15.280]   Let's go through some numbers.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.720]   If you're earning $30,000 a year, that means that you should buy a car that's worth about
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:22.160]   $3,000.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.480]   To me, that feels right.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.400]   Somebody making $30,000 a year desperately needs to save money.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.760]   They can't afford to take a bunch of depreciation.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.360]   $3,000 car will go down by 15%, which means that it will lose about $450 a year.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:38.360]   That's reasonable.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:43.160]   That person will have a $1,000 iPhone and a $30,000 car will lose $1,000 between the
[00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   two of them.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.160]   Good to go.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:53.200]   But if a person making $30,000 goes out and buys a $30,000 car, again, that $30,000 car
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.440]   will lose 15% of its value this year.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:57.960]   That'll be $4,500.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:05.080]   That is a huge percentage of income to be losing.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:10.800]   If someone's making $100,000 a year, they can go and buy a $10,000 car.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:15.120]   When we get to those numbers, it starts to feel a little bit stranger because most people's
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.920]   lives are not optimized towards wealth accumulation.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:22.120]   Say, $100,000, you should buy more than a $10,000 car.
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:27.400]   If you care about being wealthy, you'll stick to the 10% rule or something near it.
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:33.600]   A $10,000 car will lose 15% of its value, which means you'll lose $1,500 this year on
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.160]   depreciation.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.400]   That's a reasonable amount of money to lose in depreciation if you're earning $100,000.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:47.040]   But if the person earning $100,000 goes out and buys a $50,000 car, again, that's $7,500
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:50.400]   of depreciation lost this year on a $50,000 car.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.760]   That feels excessive to me.
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:57.560]   To lose 7.5% of your income to depreciation on an automobile, that's too much.
[00:12:57.560 --> 00:13:02.640]   You're not going to get wealthy losing that much on silly expenses if you can avoid it.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:09.180]   Someone making $300,000 a year, well now $300,000 a year, 10%, means that you can go out and
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:12.200]   you can purchase a $30,000 car.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.080]   Here's where the numbers start to get a little bit more unglued.
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.200]   I think that you can follow that 10% rule all the way up.
[00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:22.320]   Want to have a $100,000 car?
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:24.600]   Make sure you're earning a million dollars a year.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.960]   That feels right in many circumstances.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.840]   But the problem is that you start to get into a lifestyle disparity.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.200]   Someone's making half a million dollars a year buying a $50,000 car.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:44.320]   Because the numbers are so much larger, I think there you could tilt it up and still
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:46.360]   be fine.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:53.720]   Someone earning $500,000 a year could go and purchase a $200,000 car.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:57.680]   That would be a lot, but you could do it.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:02.840]   A $200,000 car would have a depreciation this year of $30,000.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:10.520]   If the person earning $500,000 a year is also saving $150,000 to $200,000, that person is
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.840]   going to be wealthy no matter what happens.
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.340]   You can follow the 10% rule all the way up.
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.200]   Can you change on the 10% rule?
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:19.200]   Can you adjust it?
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.800]   Well, I think you can.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:26.880]   If becoming rich fast is not your number one goal, there'll be times in life where you
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.560]   look around and you say, "I can't quite accomplish what I need on this budget."
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:39.280]   I imagine a father with a few children, three children, wants to go buy a minivan, looking
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:45.360]   around and saying, "I'm making $50,000 or $60,000 a year, but the minivans in the $5,000
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:49.160]   space, that's not quite what I want.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:52.720]   I'd like to have something that's a little bit newer that I can own for longer.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.680]   I want to have something that's more comfortable, long road trips, et cetera, all the reasons
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   we always give for buying new cars."
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:00.680]   Can you go a little higher?
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.480]   Well, I think you can.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:10.600]   My number is the absolute maximum ceiling should be 50% of your annual income, 50%.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:17.760]   That 50% number needs to not just be for one car, but the 50% number needs to go for all
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:24.720]   of the vehicles or all of the stuff in your life that is depreciating assets, depreciating
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:30.880]   rolling stock, cars, motorcycles, boats, campers.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:35.480]   Anything like that that goes down in value needs to be limited to 50% of your annual
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   income.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:42.160]   Here, I want to credit Dave Ramsey as the loudest proponent of this rule, and I think
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:43.440]   he's right.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:49.240]   If you think about the financial space, let's say that you have a household income of $50,000.
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:56.360]   If you have a household income of $50,000 and you have up to $25,000 in vehicles, $25,000
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.600]   going down at 15% per year this year, that would be $3,750.
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:07.320]   That's quite a lot of money for someone making $50,000 to lose, but it's probably not going
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.880]   to sink that person.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.880]   There's still going to be enough other money available.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:14.440]   As you go up, the numbers make even more sense.
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:18.760]   $150,000 household, okay, $75,000, that's not unreasonable.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:26.040]   Let's say you have two cars, two $30,000 cars and a $15,000 camper, things like that, $15,000
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.000]   boat, two $30,000 cars.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.280]   You can put it together however you want.
[00:16:30.280 --> 00:16:31.760]   That's not unreasonable.
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:35.120]   It's still a significant amount of money in depreciation.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:43.000]   $75,000 of vehicles would be a loss of $11,250 this year in depreciation, but at least you're
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   okay.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.400]   It's not too high.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:51.640]   My answer to you, if you can't find something that you need at 10% is, you can go anywhere
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.680]   from 10% to as high as 50% if you need to.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:17:00.180]   If you're serious about wealth building, focus on 10%.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:04.720]   If you're not so serious about wealth building, you just want to be generally prudent, you
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:07.240]   can go as high as 50%.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:15.640]   But if you have more than 50% of your annual income in the total value of cars, vehicles,
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:21.880]   etc., then you should limit those expenses and consider changing something.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.800]   In a moment, I want to talk about what do you do if you wake up and you have too much,
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.160]   but let's go on to the third rule.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:30.880]   Here again, I want to credit Financial Samurai.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.680]   What's the net worth rule?
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:37.660]   What if you are someone who has $5 million in the bank, but you just have some dividend
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:41.420]   stocks that are paying you some money and you don't spend a lot of money, you live debt
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:48.160]   free, you own all your assets, you're doing fine, you spend say $100,000.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:52.440]   You have $5 million of assets, but you have $100,000 of income that you're living on.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:55.280]   Does that mean that you should only drive a car worth $10,000?
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.240]   Well, here I think we can move to a net worth rule.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.040]   Financial Samurai's math, which again I'll link both of his excellent blog articles on
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:09.200]   this topic, Financial Samurai's math is 5% of your net worth.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.740]   So if you think about a net worth rule, you can always go and spend 5% of your net worth
[00:18:14.740 --> 00:18:16.340]   on a vehicle.
[00:18:16.340 --> 00:18:20.960]   If you have $100,000 net worth, you can buy a $5,000 car.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.400]   Most people with $100,000 net worth are not calculating their wealth based upon their
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.640]   net worth, they're calculating their net worth based upon their income.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:34.520]   But if you have a $5 million net worth, you could go and you could spend 5% of your net
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:37.120]   worth on vehicles, $250,000 total.
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:43.080]   Now if you think about it, that ratio feels really good to me.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:49.360]   And again, this is not just for a car, this is for all of your, what I call rolling stock,
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:50.360]   right?
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:54.600]   All of your cars, all your trucks, all your tractors, all of your boats, your motorcycles,
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   etc.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:57.960]   Even airplanes, whatever it is that you have.
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:04.560]   $5 million, $250,000 of stuff going down in value, that seems to me really reasonable.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.640]   You can fit in plenty of toys on that.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:12.560]   You would have a depreciation of $37,500 on a $5 million net worth.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:14.480]   That's not going to sink you, right?
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:21.560]   If your income, if your assets increase by 5%, they're going to increase by $250,000.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:25.160]   So you're still going to be building wealth over time.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.800]   $37,500 of depreciation is not going to sink you.
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:34.740]   And that still allows you with enough money for you to be able to go and purchase the
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:37.980]   kinds of toys that you might like to have.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:38.980]   Could you go higher?
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:40.200]   You can.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.240]   And so if you choose to, you can.
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:51.480]   There is going to come a time in which having more assets is not so significant for you
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:56.400]   as much as consuming those assets and using them for their purpose, the reason you saved
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:58.160]   them in the first place.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.880]   So if you make the conscious decision at some point to stop growing your net worth, then
[00:20:03.880 --> 00:20:08.640]   you can spend up to the amount of your net worth that you have in income.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.480]   You can spend up to your income in depreciating assets, and you could choose at some point
[00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:15.380]   to go ahead and start consuming assets.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:19.320]   But if you want to continue growing your net worth and you're looking for a good round
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:25.880]   target to target, the number is 5% of your net worth.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:27.040]   So those are the three rules.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.920]   Number one, limit yourself to the amount of money that you have saved.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:33.160]   Don't go into debt for stuff.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:34.320]   Don't go into debt for cars.
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.360]   Don't go into debt for boats.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:37.720]   Don't go into debt for that stuff.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:41.440]   I'm not 100% on that, but I'm 98%.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:45.000]   I'll lay out in a separate show the exceptions to that.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:50.160]   But my entire lifetime, I have watched people, when times are good, they say, "I'm going
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.240]   to go into debt."
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.440]   Times are not always good.
[00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:57.080]   And so there's a benefit to being conservative and avoiding payments.
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:21:02.440]   Years ago, I knew a guy, very wealthy guy, and his comment to me was, "I always avoid
[00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:05.760]   payments because then no matter what happens, I'm fine.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:10.520]   I can go get a job as a bagger at a grocery store and I can be fine because I don't have
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   payments.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:12.520]   My life isn't going to collapse."
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.600]   And to me, that's always been something very attractive.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.400]   There are a few situations in which I think it makes sense to take payments on, but they're
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:22.080]   very, very limited.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.080]   And the vast majority of the time, you should limit yourself to the amount of money that
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:26.080]   you have saved.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.840]   It will allow you to make good decisions.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:35.040]   Second rule is spend no more than 50% of your annual income and target, if you're serious
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:40.320]   about building well, spending no more than 10% of your annual income on a vehicle.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.200]   And if you're wealthy and you're living based on assets and you don't have an income that
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.040]   you're going to calculate on, you can spend up to 5% of your net worth on things that
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:53.420]   are going down in value like cars.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:59.760]   Are there counter arguments as to why you should spend more?
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.520]   Of course there are.
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.480]   People who want to spend their money will always find ways to justify spending their
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:05.480]   money.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:09.800]   But I think the counter arguments as to why you should spend more, given the guidelines
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:13.600]   that I've given, can always be negated.
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.080]   The primary argument that people will give is, "I don't want an old car that's going
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.080]   to break down all the time."
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:28.320]   That kind of comment reflects basically a 1980s mentality.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:34.560]   There was a period in car history in which if you had an older car, you could expect
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:37.440]   it to be breaking down all the time.
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:42.320]   But after the revolution of Japanese automobiles in the 1980s, followed up by Japanese and
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:49.080]   Korean and just amazing improvements in quality across the board on practically all manufacturers,
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.140]   we're at a point now where any car can be reliable.
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:58.520]   Reliability is much more a function of your carefully choosing a make and model that is
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:05.280]   known for reliability and carefully choosing a vehicle that has a known history, more than
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.040]   it is a function of the age of the car.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:16.440]   On virtually any budget, you can find a very reliable automobile on virtually any budget
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.840]   following those rules.
[00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:25.720]   Making $50,000 a year, you can find all day long reliable $5,000 vehicles.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:30.260]   The one that is more persuasive to me has to do with safety.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.140]   Can I get a safe car based upon those numbers?
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.700]   I've taken a lot of pride over the years of finding cheap cars.
[00:23:37.700 --> 00:23:39.720]   I've told this story, but I'll say it again.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:46.160]   One of the best deals I found one of the years ago was I was going along and I found a friend
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:50.680]   of mine who was selling an old Toyota Corolla and she sold it to me.
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.920]   She didn't want to drive anymore.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:54.480]   She sold it to me for $500.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:58.860]   It was a fair price and the car was basically the perfect cheap car.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:04.560]   It was a little four cylinder car, manual transmission, manual windows, manual door
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:06.600]   locks, nothing to go down, nothing to break down.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.640]   It was a 1998 Toyota Corolla.
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:11.440]   The engine will run until about a half a million miles.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:13.560]   It's a completely bulletproof car.
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:15.160]   I bought it for $500.
[00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.360]   I fixed up a couple of things, cosmetic, I don't even remember at this point in time,
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.520]   but I had virtually no money in the car and I just kept it as a little beater that I could
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.240]   lend out to people or if my car went broke, broke, went broke.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:30.160]   If my car broke down, I could use it, et cetera.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:35.320]   I was driving it one time and I thought to myself, Joshua, why are you driving this?
[00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:40.600]   This is not worth it because for all of the frugality benefits of that car, it is not
[00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:41.600]   a safe car.
[00:24:41.600 --> 00:24:48.000]   I was driving along at 70 miles an hour on I-95 and I thought to myself, I do not want
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.160]   to get in an accident in this car.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.780]   Yes, it has an airbag, but I do not want to get in an accident in this car.
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:55.780]   I decided to get rid of it.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:58.600]   I sold it to a friend of mine and that friend is still driving.
[00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.420]   It's still doing fine.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.880]   Never breaks down because there's nothing that can break on it.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:09.280]   It's a perfectly reliable, perfectly useful car that was unsafe.
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:14.560]   But that doesn't mean I need to go and spend $30,000 on a vehicle.
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:18.060]   To get a safe car, I don't need to spend $30,000.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:25.240]   If you will shop based upon safety on almost any budget, again, $5,000 to $10,000, you
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:30.880]   can find cars that are very well regarded for safety.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:37.600]   Years ago, I bought a $5,000 minivan, five-star crash rating minivan, all of the airbags,
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:41.240]   all of the stuff around the side curtain, the front, everything, et cetera.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.120]   I went and watched the crash tests.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:47.000]   Perfectly safe, perfectly reliable, $5,000.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   If you're at least in that range of $5,000 to $10,000, you can find cars that are safe.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.080]   What about image?
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:59.400]   Image is one where you will often have a hard time.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.820]   If by image you mean a new car or a certain brand of a car, you will often have a hard
[00:26:04.820 --> 00:26:11.680]   time getting a car that fits those rules, especially if you're trying to tend towards
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.880]   the luxury brand schedule.
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.640]   A BMW, a Mercedes, with a few exceptions on the models, they're just not going to be as
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.640]   reliable.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.440]   You buy an older one, it's not going to be as reliable.
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:26.720]   It may still be very pleasurable, but it's not as reliable as a '98 Toyota Corolla in
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:28.720]   terms of breaking down.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:36.320]   What you can do is if your budget limits you to an amount that is below what many people
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:44.420]   are doing, you can often find one of those hard to categorize vehicles that I mentioned
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:46.140]   in the previous episode.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:54.180]   You might find a great 1970s Jeep Grand Wagoneer that has all this classic style.
[00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.760]   It's not super reliable, but it's not expensive.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.900]   You might find vehicles that shift through.
[00:26:59.900 --> 00:27:05.840]   For example, Land Rovers have horrible value.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.340]   They depreciate like crazy.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.140]   That's because they're pretty unreliable.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.780]   If you need a Land Rover, you can often buy something like that that's cheaper.
[00:27:15.780 --> 00:27:21.260]   It's not going to be reliable, but your image needs where those vehicles are perceived to
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:23.260]   be prestige brands.
[00:27:23.260 --> 00:27:28.020]   Minivans, SUVs, et cetera, those kinds of vehicles that break through the mold, you
[00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:32.700]   can often find something that fits those budgets.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:37.460]   Don't automatically take an excuse and say, "I'm limited to a certain amount.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.380]   I can't get the car that I want."
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:47.020]   Exercise your creative juice and find a vehicle that fits your needs.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.580]   Last question, what do you do if you have too much car?
[00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:57.140]   What if you wake up today and you have 80% of your annual income in cars?
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:27:59.620]   It's probably something that you should change.
[00:27:59.620 --> 00:28:01.940]   The numbers here will vary.
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:09.980]   If you say, "Joshua, I've got 59% of my annual income is in vehicles, but I was strategic
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:12.460]   and careful about the vehicles that I chose."
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:15.020]   I find this most of the time with young families.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:16.020]   They say, "We wanted a minivan.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.580]   We went out and bought a brand new minivan.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:18.980]   We're planning to have it for a long time.
[00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.740]   Yeah, we paid $55,000.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:23.540]   We got a household income of $85,000."
[00:28:23.540 --> 00:28:26.100]   I would say it's too much money.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:32.100]   If I were advising you before the sale, I would advise you not to do it.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:36.500]   But that doesn't necessarily mean you should just dump the car today.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.980]   You should probably, in that situation, just keep it.
[00:28:39.980 --> 00:28:47.220]   If you own too much of a car, your first way out is just keep the vehicles until they depreciate
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.740]   down to a lower amount and then be more thoughtful the next time around.
[00:28:51.740 --> 00:28:58.820]   The best way for you—I need to be careful with my words—a very good, reliable way
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:03.960]   to eliminate the problems of buying too much vehicle is to keep your vehicle for a very
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.740]   long time.
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:12.160]   Remember, depreciation is an annual number based upon the current value.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:19.620]   So that $50,000 car that declines in value this year by $7,500, this next year it's
[00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:22.220]   worth $42,500.
[00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:28.540]   And then it'll receive a 15% depreciation, which means it'll lose $6,375.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.720]   And in the second year, it'll be down to $35,000.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:39.340]   So your car today that is too much for your income will very quickly be worth less.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:45.420]   If you keep it, you can enjoy the benefits, the reasons that you bought the car in the
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:51.660]   first place, and enjoy them for a long time by just committing to keep the car.
[00:29:51.660 --> 00:29:57.580]   Because cars depreciate in value so much, very quickly your car will be down into the
[00:29:57.580 --> 00:29:59.780]   ratio where it makes sense.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:06.660]   And now that you know the ratio, you can avoid going out and simply making another big mistake.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.020]   I think financially a very good argument can be made that the person that goes out and
[00:30:11.020 --> 00:30:18.500]   buys a brand new vehicle today, spends $60,000 for a wonderful loaded minivan, and keeps
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:24.260]   it for 20 years, will probably be ahead of the person that's constantly trading out a
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:29.860]   vehicle every three or four years and trying to keep frugal purchases by following the
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:32.660]   numbers and buying $15,000 vehicles.
[00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:35.360]   I think there's a good argument to be made for that.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.540]   If you bought it new, you know the history of the car.
[00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:44.960]   If you bought a car that was a good vehicle, that was known for reliability and for good
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:49.080]   ownership costs, you can own it from new, you can make sure that all the maintenance
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:53.980]   is taken care of, you can get your real money's worth out of accessories, modifications, things
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:54.980]   like that.
[00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:59.660]   The car can serve you, be a wonderful part of your lifestyle, and it can just be, it
[00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:02.360]   pays off when you keep it for a long time.
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:07.340]   So in most cases, I think the best thing is just keep your vehicles that you have and
[00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:13.060]   own them until they're insignificant in terms of your overall financial situation.
[00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:20.140]   Where that advice is not appropriate is if the numbers are radically out of whack, or
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:23.940]   if you've got a radically inappropriate vehicle.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:30.540]   You're making $50,000 a year and you've got a $100,000 car that you got on payments and
[00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:35.040]   you're just barely making it and you've got a huge amount of money left that you owe on
[00:31:35.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   it.
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.180]   Well in those kinds of situations, you're so radically out of balance that you have
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:40.260]   to get rid of it.
[00:31:40.260 --> 00:31:46.880]   You will never get ahead financially making $50,000 a year with a $100,000 car.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.380]   You have to change it.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:54.540]   And in today's world, it's remarkably not unheard of to have some of those numbers.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.980]   You can have a loaded out pickup truck or a loaded out SUV that approaches $100,000
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:04.220]   and if you finance the car and you had a big down payment and you stretched the payment
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.500]   out over 72 months, etc., that may have been considered affordable and they lent you the
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.500]   money for it.
[00:32:09.500 --> 00:32:12.380]   But you'll never get ahead financially owning that much vehicle.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.220]   So if the numbers are radically out of whack, then you should sell the car.
[00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:22.060]   If you have payments on a vehicle, then you should very seriously consider selling the
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.060]   car.
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:28.420]   I will devote an entire episode to the scenario of, "Hey Joshua, I've got a big car payment
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:30.860]   and I owe more on it than it's worth and I have no money.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:31.860]   What do I do?"
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.620]   This is a very difficult situation that many people wind up in because people who are in
[00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:42.980]   the habit of buying new cars frequently roll negative equity from vehicle to vehicle to
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.300]   vehicle to vehicle and they wind up upside down having a car that's worth $40,000 and
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:53.340]   they have a car note of $52,000 and there's nothing they can do because if they sold the
[00:32:53.340 --> 00:32:58.380]   vehicle, not only would it sell for $40,000, they would have to come up with $12,000 out
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:33:05.740]   of pocket to pay off the note in order to get the title so they can accomplish the sale.
[00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:08.580]   And worse than that, they would still have to come up with the money out of pocket to
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:10.820]   go and pay for another car.
[00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.820]   So this is a very difficult situation.
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:19.340]   But in some cases, if you can effectuate the sale, just simply amputating cars can free
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:23.660]   up enough money that you can clean up other messes, etc.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:32.780]   In closing, you decide how much money you're going to spend on a car and decide it before
[00:33:32.780 --> 00:33:35.500]   you go shopping.
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:43.100]   You may find after shopping that you need to adjust your budget in some regard.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:50.300]   But don't start by going out to the car market and kind of wandering around because as soon
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:58.060]   as you do that, you will be quickly and easily enticed by low monthly payments, easy financing,
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:03.420]   you'll be quickly enticed by the wonderful new car smell, how shiny it is, how beautiful
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.500]   it is, how comfortable it is.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   Then you'll start justifying to yourself a whole long list of very practical justifications.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.700]   "I'm going to buy this car because it's safer for my children and after all, my children
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.380]   are my number one most valuable possession and aren't they worth it to protect?
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.180]   I'm going to buy this car because it has a really great MPGs and after all, gas prices
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.660]   are really high right now.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.180]   I'm going to buy this car because it's going to impress the world and it's going to give
[00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:29.100]   them the image that I need to portray to them.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.380]   I'm going to buy this car and I'm going to keep it for a really long time.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:36.340]   That way, my mistake of buying too much car and spending too much on it isn't going to
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.340]   actually pay off."
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.340]   You'll justify it.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:39.340]   We all do.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:41.260]   All of us justify it to ourselves.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:47.220]   So come up with your rule for the reasons that make sense to you and stick to your rule
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:52.420]   and understand what your numbers are before you go to the car marketplace.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.500]   These are my suggestions.
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:57.260]   Number one, don't spend more money than you have saved that you can just simply write
[00:34:57.260 --> 00:34:59.580]   a check for and buy the car.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:04.860]   Number two, limit your total vehicle ownership to 10% of your annual income, annual household
[00:35:04.860 --> 00:35:05.860]   income.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:11.060]   If you can't do it on 10% and you're willing to have a slower path to wealth, you can go
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:17.160]   above 10% to a maximum of 50%, never more than 50%.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:21.100]   But if it's 15%, okay, and you're willing to give it up, that's fine.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:27.220]   Or if you're wealthy, then limit your vehicle exposure to 5% of your net worth.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:31.980]   If you follow those rules, you'll have the vehicle that you need and that you want, and
[00:35:31.980 --> 00:35:38.780]   you'll continue to build wealth, which makes the vehicle far more enjoyable.
[00:35:38.780 --> 00:35:43.940]   I have made a lot of financial mistakes in my life.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:48.260]   One of the few mistakes that I have avoided is having a car payment.
[00:35:48.260 --> 00:35:50.840]   I've never had a car payment.
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:56.620]   And having lived my entire adult life free of car payments, you can't get me to go and
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   change that.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.900]   I'm telling you, it is the best feeling in the world to know that you have control of
[00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:03.180]   your money.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:10.180]   If you avoid car payments, virtually anything else that you want is within your reach.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.940]   I'm not opposed to borrowing money for assets that are going up in value.
[00:36:14.940 --> 00:36:21.500]   Houses, businesses, investments, those are all good uses of borrowed money.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:26.820]   But cars are not a good use of borrowed money.
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:29.420]   Boats are not a good use of borrowed money.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.100]   RVs are not a good use of borrowed money.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:36.380]   Because when you wind up out there in the thing, you're always thinking about how much
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.180]   it costs you, and you can't ever enjoy it.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:46.780]   So if I want something that is more than I have, I use that as motivation.
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:50.100]   If you're earning $100,000 a year and you say, "Josh, you're telling me I can only spend
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.420]   $10,000 on a car?"
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:54.260]   You have two choices.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:58.820]   Choice A is throw the advice out the window and go spend more money on a car and wind
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.420]   up less wealthy.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:06.140]   If you become wealthy, it's a much slower process, not in 10 years, or maybe even wind
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.340]   up broke like many people do.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:18.060]   Or choice B is use your desire for stuff as motivation to work and say, "I want a $100,000
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:19.060]   car.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:22.180]   Okay, 10x your income."
[00:37:22.180 --> 00:37:26.180]   And for me, I've always found those goals incredibly persuasive.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:27.300]   You want something?
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.300]   Awesome.
[00:37:28.300 --> 00:37:32.020]   Set yourself the rule of what you're going to do, and when you do this, you're going
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:33.620]   to go and buy it.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:39.460]   And making that deal with yourself and saying, "I want this consumption item, so therefore
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.300]   I am going to work my tail off."
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:46.540]   That's a good thing, because then you wind up getting the thing and still getting richer
[00:37:46.540 --> 00:37:50.820]   along the way, which means you enjoy the thing a whole lot more.
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.180]   Don't borrow money for cars.
[00:37:52.180 --> 00:37:53.180]   Stick to these rules.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.680]   You'll become wealthy.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:38:00.100]   And then finally, in line with the show, remember how to live a rich and meaningful life now
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:04.620]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:09.660]   How does avoiding this allow you to live rich now?
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:16.940]   If you free up the money in car depreciation costs, you can often spend that on other things.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:21.100]   I know a lot of people that travel a lot.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:28.460]   And one of the things that seems very consistent is people who travel simply make the intentional
[00:38:28.460 --> 00:38:35.700]   choice that they prefer traveling to driving an expensive car.
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:44.620]   Remember, the depreciation on a $50,000 car, a 15% this year, is $7,500.
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:49.740]   If you avoid the depreciation, if you choose not to save that money, you choose to spend
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:55.060]   it, you can travel a lot on $7,500.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.340]   So think carefully before you go and sign up for something that's going to wind up just
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:02.260]   sucking money out every year.
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.700]   New cars always become used cars.
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:10.900]   Things that inspire that lust and desire quickly become, eh, they're old, they're scratched,
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.500]   they don't inspire that lust and desire.
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.980]   The older I get, the more amazed I am to watch this process.
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:19.340]   I remember in high school, I would go to car dealerships and get all their physical paper
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:23.420]   catalogs and I'd take them home and I'd dream about them and study them and look through
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.420]   them.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:29.020]   These are the cars that were my dream cars when I was in high school, the brand new ones
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.180]   that I just dreamed about.
[00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:38.540]   They all look like junky, white trash, poor people vehicles.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:41.980]   And you see them out and I think, wow, what was wrong with me?
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:46.100]   Why was I so enamored with that thing?
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:50.880]   So build some financial formulas that will allow you to have the things that you need
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:57.380]   but protect you from the regret of buying cars that keep you poor and broke.
