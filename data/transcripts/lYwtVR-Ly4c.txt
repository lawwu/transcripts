[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.160]   Our next question comes from currently over excited.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.960]   Who asks, how do you tame post shutdown over excitement?
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.960]   All right, so he or she elaborates, suppose you are working on a problem you really like,
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.880]   you have a plan to solve it.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880]   But it is complicated.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.480]   So it'll take weeks, possibly months, you are optimistic, you may be able to solve it
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.240]   as a big deal, because it's important stuff.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.080]   Does it happen to you that you're not able, really able to shut down even to the point
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.800]   where sleeping becomes difficult?
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.800]   He or she adds, I'm fully aware that this is a great problem to have.
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.320]   Yes, this is a problem.
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.960]   I suffer from this problem.
[00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.320]   When you're working on exciting things, and in particular things that are intellectually
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.920]   demanding, and you're starting to make progress.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.720]   So you're getting that neurochemical high that comes from some of the pieces starting
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:02.560]   to click together, right, which is a very appealing sensation.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.800]   It's also something that really can drag your attention towards what you're trying to solve
[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.040]   and very hard to rinse your attention away from.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.640]   It can be hard to say, okay, now I'm going to go do something else.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.440]   Now I'm going to go just enjoy a quiet evening, reading the newspaper.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.400]   Now I'm going to try to sleep, it is a problem.
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.160]   Now for me, it was actually this problem, which I began to experience pretty strongly
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.720]   during graduate school, that led to the innovation of some of the ideas that I still push today.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:34.440]   I mean, I've talked about this before, but it's been a while, that as I was approaching,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.120]   my memory is my dissertation.
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.000]   I was starting to have these overexcitement issues because at the time there were some
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.080]   proofs that weren't working.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.000]   So it was sort of negative overexcitement.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.040]   I wasn't like, yeah, making progress, I love it.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.840]   It's wait a second, I don't think this proof, this proof might not be working.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.440]   My whole dissertation needs this to work.
[00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.720]   And it was very hard to let that go.
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.120]   So I remember that very clearly.
[00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.760]   The other thing that was happening during grad school, I remember this very clearly,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.600]   is I was having a lot of ideas about the deep life, how I wanted to live my life.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.680]   There was a lot of really fundamental thinking happening, what's important to me, what's
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.680]   not.
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.620]   And I didn't know what to do with those thoughts.
[00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:12.880]   That was also a source of overexcitement.
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.680]   It was just always there, always bouncing around.
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.160]   I was worried I would forget them.
[00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.460]   I was worried there's so much possibility that I was missing options.
[00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.480]   Both were causing overexcitement.
[00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.760]   It was in that context that I innovated my shutdown routine.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.360]   That is where schedule shutdown complete came from.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.360]   Users of my time block planners, readers of deep work, readers of my newsletter all know
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.760]   about my shutdown routine, which is pretty rigorous.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.180]   You really close all the open loops, you make a plan for the next day, you get everything
[00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.180]   out of your head.
[00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:48.120]   And then you say a phrase to indicate, I am done thinking about work for the day.
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.480]   That was innovated in that grad school context for me.
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.680]   So if I was very worried about a proof or something like this, I, during my shutdown
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.640]   routine could capture all my thoughts.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.480]   Okay, here's where I'm stuck.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.800]   Here's what I'm gonna work on tomorrow.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.280]   I have three angles I'm going to try.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.140]   I'm going to start at first thing.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.400]   There's my plan.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.400]   Shutdown complete.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.080]   My mind could trust there is a plan.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.920]   You don't have to think about this now.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.440]   Progress will happen the next day.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.880]   This was also when I innovated the Moleskine idea notebook, that capture mechanism of always
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.480]   having this Moleskine with me that I began to use for formally capturing thoughts about
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.080]   my life and having a set time once a month is what I did back then, which I would review
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.680]   this notebook.
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.520]   So I could capture thoughts in there that arose and release them.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.200]   That if I was watching a documentary and got really excited about, you know, I just have
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.480]   this insight from this documentary that this is what I need in my life, more of x more
[00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.480]   of y, I could write them in that notebook, and know that that notebook was going to be
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.320]   reviewed like clockwork at the end of each month, I wasn't going to forget that idea,
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:50.040]   I did not have to expend a lot of energy keeping that in my head or worrying about forgetting
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   it.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.200]   Those two innovations, shutdown routine for my work, a capture system for big ideas about
[00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.120]   my life, those two systems actually did greatly reduce issues with over excitement around
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.120]   ideas.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.680]   Right, all that still being said, yes, I still suffer from it.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.720]   When you're working on cool things, it is hard to shut down.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720]   It's hard to let things go.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.880]   I mean, I face this a lot.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.480]   I think working for the New Yorker, this has become more acute, because there's typically
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.600]   a faster pace of things and more going on and things will pop up in the evening.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.520]   You're hear back from a source for an article or there's feedback on coming back from it,
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.120]   or there's a lot of things that happen.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.680]   Things are coming together, and it's hard to shut down.
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.120]   I had this issue last night, we're closing an article, there's just a lot of things happening
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.720]   that night, we're trying to get it together real quick, and it's hard to let that go.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.480]   I get this way with book writing too.
[00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.560]   When I'm working on proposals, like the proposals I'm working on right now, the ideas fester.
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:57.200]   I was like, "This isn't quite right," because I'm trying to get the ideas just right.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.760]   I spend months and months working on just a high level framework and ideas that eventually
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:02.760]   will become the book.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.280]   That can really stick in my mind, and I can't let it go.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.440]   This happened to me most recently, I think it was on one of the High Holy Days, maybe
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.560]   on Yom Kippur.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:20.040]   There's an angle on the deep life book I was working on, and I couldn't let it go because
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.440]   it wasn't working.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.960]   I was coming back to it again and again, and all day long it was just obsessively festering
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   and I couldn't let it go.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.760]   It still happens to me with book ideas too.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.160]   If it's not quite right or starting to come together but it doesn't quite work, I have
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.160]   a hard time letting it go.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.360]   We've got good news and bad news.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   Here's my summary.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.240]   The good news is structure and routine help.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.460]   Shutdown routines really help.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.120]   Good capture systems help, where you can get the information and ideas in a place where
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   you know they will be reviewed.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.120]   You won't forget them.
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:49.440]   That helps your mind forget them.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   That all helps.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.280]   The bad news is if you're working on exciting stuff, you're not going to completely get
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   rid of the problem.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.760]   As you said, it's not a bad problem to have.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.000]   If you can just blunt its impact a little bit, having a few nights where you have a
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.560]   hard time getting to sleep because there's something so cool you're working on probably
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.440]   is a fair price to pay for working on things that are cool.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   [music]
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:09.440]   [music]
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   [music]
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.440]   [music]
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.440]   [music]
