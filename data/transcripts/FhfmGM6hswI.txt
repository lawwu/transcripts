[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]   In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.
[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:04.260]   Winning is not enough.
[00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.100]   - The following is a conversation with Hodger Gracie,
[00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.480]   widely considered to be the greatest
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.400]   jiu-jitsu competitor of all time.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.360]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.440]   To support it, please check out our sponsors
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.680]   in the description.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.300]   And now, dear friends, here's Hodger Gracie.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.600]   Let's start with possibly the greatest match
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600]   in jiu-jitsu history, your second match
[00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.960]   against Buchecha.
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.320]   Let's go through the details.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.620]   Let's go through the whole thing.
[00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.920]   So the walk leading up to it.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.160]   You always do this walk, this epic walk.
[00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.740]   You post that on Instagram.
[00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.840]   Hanzo posted on Instagram this calm walk
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.920]   towards the mat.
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.480]   Well, let's go to that match in particular.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.460]   What was going through your mind?
[00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.820]   You've been away from competition,
[00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.500]   facing probably one of the greatest,
[00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.560]   and at that time, many people considered
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.860]   the greatest jiu-jitsu competitor of all time in Buchecha.
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.040]   Here's the old man, the old timer,
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:02.480]   getting back out there.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:03.760]   What were you thinking?
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.840]   - Yeah, I think that's the first time
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.640]   since probably I got my black belt
[00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.720]   that I wasn't the favorite to walk into a fight,
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.840]   I have to say.
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.320]   Like a lot of people thought,
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.640]   consider him the favorite.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.360]   I mean, understandable.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.000]   You know, I was out of competition for a while.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.760]   He was just winning everything.
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.160]   So, you know, you're saying about the walk,
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.120]   like for me, you know, the fight starts way before
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.000]   the referee say go, you know.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.160]   It's all the focus and concentration
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.320]   that I think is very important for me to start before.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.440]   Like, you know, I almost walk blind to the mat.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.400]   Many times I pass, like great friends,
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.920]   and I couldn't see anyone.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.120]   You know, they're trying to talk to you,
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.000]   and I'm like, I'm 100% focused on my opponent already,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.560]   even though that I cannot even see him in front of me.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.240]   So I think that's for me was always very important
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.760]   to try to clear my mind out from everything.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.200]   - Are you visualizing the opponent,
[00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.040]   or are you just clearing?
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.640]   - Not at that time.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.560]   - Right, is there, what's in your head?
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.840]   Is it like a calm river with birds chirping?
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.840]   - It's blank, just blank.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.680]   - Darkness.
[00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.600]   - Yeah, darkness.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.160]   - Okay, and that's what we see in that calmness,
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.040]   is just blankness.
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.240]   How hard is it to achieve that blankness?
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.520]   - It's difficult to say because I think I don't remember
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.600]   when I'll say probably as a black belt,
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.880]   I try to focus like that, not to think,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.200]   because it's probably something you learn,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.080]   is the more you think, the more nervous you get.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.240]   And there's nothing that you're gonna gain
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.600]   by thinking of the fight or the possibilities,
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.680]   what you can do, what can go wrong, what can go right,
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.640]   because it's unpredictable.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.560]   You have absolutely no idea.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.080]   It's impossible to predict the fight.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.360]   - And you discover that if you just let those nerves
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.520]   and those feelings go and empty your mind,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.840]   it actually is pretty effective.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.800]   - It is, it makes you feel better.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.280]   It's, you know, you kind of control your emotion,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.360]   control the adrenaline on your body up to a level.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.440]   So it absolutely helps you focus in the fight.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.040]   - I've learned that in jiu-jitsu and in general in life,
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.800]   that whenever something feels really shitty,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.200]   you can just like take that thought and not think about it.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.440]   Like I do that on long runs or like a fast run or,
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.760]   yeah, in jiu-jitsu, especially when I'm getting older,
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.280]   out of shape, like that feeling of exhaustion,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.400]   well, you can always get to the feeling of exhaustion.
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.880]   You can just not think about it,
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.080]   not think about being exhausted.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.360]   Just, and that somehow relaxes you.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.560]   I think maybe in the face of exhaustion,
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.360]   all the fears start to creep in,
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:39.680]   maybe your muscles tighten up.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.520]   I don't know.
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.400]   This is for the amateur jiu-jitsu person.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:49.040]   But it's kind of funny how you can just take that thought
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.040]   and let go of it.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.800]   So you get, as a black belt competitor,
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.440]   you get used to, you get good at letting go of any thoughts.
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.280]   - Yeah.
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.160]   When you mentioned to exhaustion is,
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.440]   I mean, that's another good example of it.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.040]   It's, you know, there's a lot of times in the fight,
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.320]   you're getting tired and you're getting pretty tired.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.040]   So it's like the last thing you want to think of it
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.520]   is how tired you are.
[00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.280]   It doesn't matter because it doesn't.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:14.880]   What are you going to do, quit?
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.560]   I mean, it doesn't matter.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.840]   It's how tired you are.
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:18.680]   It's-
[00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:19.520]   - Yeah, there's no value thinking about it.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.360]   - There's no value.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.760]   You just have to go through it.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.720]   - So when you're like, you know, many minutes into the match
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.240]   and you're slowly moving, as you sometimes do,
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.640]   tying your belt, catching your breath,
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:31.640]   you're not thinking about anything.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.880]   You're trying to let go of thinking.
[00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:38.840]   - I'm trying to like to save everything to the fight.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.240]   Like nothing goes to waste.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.400]   It's, you know, every move unnecessary,
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.760]   it's just going to make you more tired
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.600]   or it's going to take something out of you.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.480]   Like, you know, I try to calculate every single move I make,
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.600]   save as much energy as I can,
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.960]   so I can fully, you know, be focused 100% in the fight
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.120]   with no waste, especially energy-wise.
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.600]   - And that's instinctual, like minimizing the amount of moves.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.240]   You're not like explicitly thinking,
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.200]   should I do this or not?
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.480]   It's just, don't move unless it's absolutely required.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.840]   - Yeah, because fight, you cannot really,
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.840]   there's not really time to think much, you know?
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:20.840]   So it's just, your instincts are playing.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.200]   It's like, it's, you know, you already have your,
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.320]   you know, your weapons, let's say, you know,
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.880]   the things that you do,
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:31.480]   it's just to wait for the perfect moment.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.960]   The beauty of it is, you know,
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.720]   there's the right moment to everything.
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.560]   If you feel one second too late, doesn't work,
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.480]   or you get messy.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.440]   So it's, you know, you're trying to catch that moment.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:44.040]   That's, you know, and for that,
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.560]   you have to be fully focused in what you're doing
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:50.000]   because one second, you're out, it won't work.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.160]   - But you're not exactly known as somebody
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.120]   that moves super quickly.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.120]   So the moment, it's not about how quickly you move,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.880]   it's about the right moment.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   So you move slowly. - The right moment, yeah.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.560]   Yeah, it's not like, speed,
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.200]   it's not like you have to move at the speed of light.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.200]   It's the move itself or the precise moment.
[00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.080]   It doesn't have to be super fast
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.880]   because your opponent's not moving super fast, you know.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.760]   So it's a combination of moving between you and him.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.080]   - I mean, the same thing happens in judo
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.600]   and the movement can be really small.
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.440]   - Yeah.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.280]   - It's just--
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.680]   - Judo is a bit more explosive, you know,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.400]   it's just the moves are slightly faster.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.480]   So it does require a bit more explosiveness in judo.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:39.960]   - But even just the right timing for an off balance.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.840]   - Yeah.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.560]   - Just a little tough. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:44.560]   - It's not that, you know, moving,
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.720]   the speed is not gonna count that much.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.560]   - Yeah.
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.480]   - It's the timing that you initiate that move.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.680]   - You see that with foot sweeps.
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.880]   There's nothing more beautiful than like
[00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.840]   a Olympic level athlete going at it in the Olympics
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.960]   and a perfect foot sweep. - Somebody whoosh.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:02.600]   - And it's just, and you see one man's life
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.720]   flash before his eyes and realize,
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.960]   like I'm supposed to be the top three person in the world,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.600]   that I just find, they have this look on their face,
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.400]   like, I don't know what just happened.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.240]   It's beautiful to see.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:15.640]   You don't see that, I guess you see that in boxing,
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.000]   knockouts and stuff like that.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.440]   You don't know what the hell just happened.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.500]   - Yeah, it's that precise moment of movement
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:23.480]   that you get caught.
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.880]   Like it's that one split second, that's it.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:29.200]   - Do you get that in jiu-jitsu at all?
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.680]   'Cause judo has, because of the explosiveness,
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.840]   because of the point scoring system,
[00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:37.280]   that incentivizes these giant throws,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:40.120]   has these moments where everything
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.640]   just turns in a single moment.
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:42.640]   Do you have that in jiu-jitsu too?
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:45.080]   - Not really, because then it's points.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.480]   Yes, you get like two points.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.720]   So it's, because I think regarding the submission,
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.840]   it's not just one precise movement that changes everything.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.720]   I think judo is the takedown that counts as a submission,
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.320]   like Ippon, fight over.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:03.160]   Jiu-jitsu don't have that.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.280]   So you will score points,
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.880]   but I think in terms of submission,
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:12.680]   you need to get to a dominant position first,
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.000]   and then the submission will come slowly.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:15.840]   - It's a process.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.000]   - Yeah.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.680]   - Okay, let's go back to that guy with his mind.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.840]   So actually in the weeks leading up to it,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.680]   in the days, in the hours, in the minutes,
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.220]   is there some fear in you leading up to this?
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.320]   - I mean, I'm not gonna say that I'm fearless,
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.960]   because everybody fears something.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.360]   The fear is there, but it's like,
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.120]   how much you let that control you.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:43.080]   I think I was a lot more confident than fearful,
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:45.640]   for sure, walking into that fight.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.800]   Like I was pretty confident that I could beat him.
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:52.640]   - What was the source of that confidence?
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.640]   - My beliefs on me.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.560]   - Yes, okay.
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:08:57.280]   - I can take the world.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.360]   - Not, you can take anyone in the world,
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.680]   but is there a specific strategic,
[00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:04.720]   like, you know, talking to Donahair,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.840]   he believes that there's no such thing as confidence,
[00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:12.700]   or rather, the way you get confidence is through data,
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:16.880]   like that you have proven yourself effective
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.620]   in previous situations, but with Buchecha,
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.720]   you don't have much data.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:25.480]   It was a very, the first time you faced him
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.960]   was a very tough, that was also one of the greatest matches
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.080]   of all time, it was very tough.
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.520]   So doesn't that creep in, like that doubt,
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.960]   because you don't have enough data
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:36.840]   to be confident based on that?
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:44.320]   - Yeah, I mean, okay, if I never have fought before,
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:47.720]   you know, suddenly walk into a fight with someone like that,
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   then would I be that confident?
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.800]   I mean, probably no.
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.280]   You know, so that history of what, you know,
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:55.920]   what we've been doing, what we've been achieving
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.560]   does gives you confidence.
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.960]   If that was my first fight ever,
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.120]   I wouldn't, probably I wouldn't be that confident.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.400]   - But the time off?
[00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:05.520]   - It doesn't matter.
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.040]   - Doesn't matter.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:07.880]   - Doesn't matter.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:11.080]   - You don't have the fear or the actual physical experience,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.760]   the psychological experience of being rusty,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:14.600]   of being out of the competition.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.140]   - That will come on training.
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:19.400]   - So you, okay, so you simulate some aspect of that
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.240]   in the training.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:22.840]   - Yeah, I mean, the training will tell you how you are.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.840]   - Okay, did you increase the intensity of the training
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.040]   leading up to this?
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.340]   - Yeah, I mean, I train normal.
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.280]   Let's say compared to the first fight,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:32.960]   the second was a lot more confidence
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.120]   because, you know, like I say on training,
[00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.400]   the training for the first fight, it was terrible.
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.640]   - So what do you mean?
[00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.720]   - I think I was focusing on MMA for a while,
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.560]   for a couple of months,
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:47.040]   and I wasn't really focusing the gi,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:48.760]   and, you know, by the time I accept the fight
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.560]   and start training,
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.400]   like all my responses on training were off.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.320]   Like all my training partners that I used to train with
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.000]   that I destroyed.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.800]   I mean, now they're like, they're beating me.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.200]   You know, it's like I cannot beat them
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.960]   the way I was used to.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.200]   But, you know, so I knew something was not right
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:09.880]   for the first fight.
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:12.640]   But then it's, you know, no points,
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:14.720]   it's submission or draw.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:16.040]   - So, yeah, for people who don't know,
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.800]   it was in Matamoros, which is a 20 minute match,
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.560]   submission only, so there's no,
[00:11:20.560 --> 00:11:22.120]   the winner is determined only by submission,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.560]   otherwise it's a draw.
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:27.280]   - So physically I wasn't myself on that fight.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.500]   I was tired, my body wasn't responding.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:33.080]   Anyway, so the confidence was different
[00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:34.120]   from the first, the second.
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.960]   I think I was confident enough
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:38.200]   that I wouldn't get tapped out on the first,
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:39.880]   that I was still gonna fight,
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.360]   because he has to tap me out to beat me.
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.160]   And I trust on my defense.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.720]   I'm confident enough on my defense
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.720]   that he will not tap me out.
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:51.440]   But in terms of winning, you know,
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.240]   walking to the second fight,
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:55.880]   I was a lot more confident.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.160]   - What can you say about that feeling
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:58.920]   when something's not right?
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:00.240]   Isn't that a thing that breaks people?
[00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:01.960]   - It breaks, it's weird.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:03.840]   Like people crack, they give up.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:07.280]   You know, it's a big test,
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.640]   because it's like being really tired.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   It's the same thing.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.100]   It's like a lot of people crack
[00:12:13.100 --> 00:12:15.800]   because they just feel they cannot give in more.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.920]   They have nothing more to give.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.720]   So they just like give up.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.000]   It's too hard.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.840]   - So what do you do?
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.860]   Just again, take the thoughts out?
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:25.660]   - There's no giving up.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:28.700]   I mean, I don't care.
[00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:31.440]   Like just giving up is not an option.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.280]   It's not.
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.140]   - That's always the way you thought of all jiu-jitsu?
[00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:35.980]   - Yeah.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:37.480]   I've never gave up.
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:38.600]   I mean, I tapped.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.440]   It's, you know, not giving up is not tapping.
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.300]   That's just stupid.
[00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:44.880]   Especially, you know, doing training.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   Like it's, I get caught, I tap.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:51.080]   I've never, ever hurt myself by not tapping.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.600]   I get, you get angry, you know,
[00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.880]   it's train hard, you know, improve,
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:56.520]   make yourself better.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.360]   You'll go caught.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.200]   Except that you made a mistake, give up, tap,
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.640]   then try harder.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.860]   So, you know, the not tapping,
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:08.120]   it's you're sacrificing your body and, you know,
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.280]   you will never be the same.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.200]   Like if you let your elbow popped,
[00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.880]   the elbow will never, ever be the same, ever.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:17.500]   You let yourself go to sleep, your resistance drops.
[00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:21.520]   So it's, everybody has a limit of resistance until they,
[00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.100]   you know, to resist a choke before you pass out.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.400]   The moment that you go to sleep,
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:30.540]   that resistance will drop.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.000]   - I've never heard anyone say, "Oh, that's awesome."
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:33.840]   So that's true.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.360]   So tap, so that's the reason,
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.000]   'cause people usually say it's, you can--
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.520]   - No, it's the same way you're getting knocked out.
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.200]   You get knocked out the first time,
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.280]   your resistance dropped, your jaw gets weaker.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.400]   So-- - Just for the record,
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.960]   I've never gone to sleep again.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.120]   (laughing)
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:50.440]   Which means my resistance is high, right?
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.720]   I don't know. - Yeah, must be.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.160]   Oh, your defense is pretty good.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.000]   (laughing)
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.400]   - I don't know about that.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:59.360]   Because it doesn't make sense to me,
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:03.360]   or maybe, in my case, I think my understanding
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:06.400]   of when I'm screwed is pretty good.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.960]   - Yeah. - Like, there's no--
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.920]   - You know you're in trouble.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.760]   - Yeah.
[00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.120]   One of the things I regret the most
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:16.560]   about my jiu-jitsu journey is not having given enough time
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:20.560]   to being in really bad positions.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:23.520]   Like, the better I got, I think the less I started
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:25.800]   being in bad positions, which is terrible.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.320]   - Because you spar.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.400]   That's like, that is how you train.
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:30.240]   - Yeah.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.520]   - Because you used to just spar.
[00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:34.240]   When you spar, like, it's difficult
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:36.880]   to be in bad positions a lot.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.440]   You train with better people, but, I mean,
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.640]   let's say five, six minute rows,
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:43.520]   how long you gonna be in a really bad position?
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.360]   Not long, right?
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.920]   So you don't really have time to develop.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:50.240]   That's why people, they don't, you know,
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.160]   they don't train being bad positions,
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.080]   'cause you have to start there over and over again
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:57.440]   to be used to it.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.560]   - Yeah, or put yourself there.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:00.720]   I just didn't have that mindset, I think.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.560]   I think you start, I mean, part of the fun of jiu-jitsu
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.080]   is as you get better and better,
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.440]   you have certain people you go with,
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.320]   you have these puzzles that you've figured out
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.160]   that you're playing very specific details,
[00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:14.680]   you're working out, you're trying to improve your main,
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:16.120]   like, techniques and so on.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:18.480]   But yeah, just the percentage of time you spend
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.760]   being submitted or being, or trying,
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.040]   even going against lower ranks,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.400]   trying to escape basic submissions is low.
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.400]   I don't know if that's true for most people.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:28.520]   Probably is, right?
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.160]   - Most people have very bad defense.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.000]   - Yeah.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.400]   - Because they don't allow themselves to be there,
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.560]   because, I mean, who wants to get tapped?
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.160]   Because you will, until you, you know,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:41.200]   to work on your defense, of course you're gonna get tapped,
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:42.560]   or, you know, you're not gonna escape,
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:44.440]   you're gonna struggle to escape.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.280]   So people, they don't want to be there.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.800]   I regret it most because of the effect it clearly had
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.020]   on how I competed.
[00:15:54.020 --> 00:15:57.840]   It was clear that my competition
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:02.360]   was constantly driven by conservative thinking.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:04.360]   Like, don't take risks.
[00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:07.440]   I think because of a weak defense, honestly.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.000]   And I think a lot of the, any of the fear,
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:14.760]   like, for example, exhaustion was accompanied by fear
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.720]   because of weak defense, I think.
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.560]   If I were to psychoanalyze myself,
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.820]   and I regret it, I regret it a lot.
[00:16:20.820 --> 00:16:25.380]   But speaking of which,
[00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:29.920]   I don't think anyone's ever submitted you in competition.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.760]   So you're--
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.760]   - Well, I was a juvenile, yes.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.880]   - Yes, so when you were a young person.
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:37.720]   - Yeah, six.
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:39.480]   - Does that still haunt you?
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:40.320]   - I don't know.
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:44.720]   First I was winning that fight, by and large.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.120]   I mean, I think by six points,
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:48.200]   or four, something like that.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.040]   But I was like, I was going--
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.480]   - You still remember it, though, huh?
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.600]   - By the details.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.840]   (laughing)
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.920]   - That's funny.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.760]   - Yeah.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:58.840]   - You ever beat him again?
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.160]   - He never competed again.
[00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:02.400]   (laughing)
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:07.520]   - Whoever you are, please, let's do a podcast.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.360]   - I know, I know.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.320]   - We'll talk shit about Hadji the whole time.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.120]   No, but what do you attribute that to?
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.840]   You're saying you're confident,
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:17.280]   you're confident that the top of the world,
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.460]   the number one, Bouchescu would not submit you.
[00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:23.160]   So where is that confidence grounded,
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.200]   and what do you attribute the fact
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.960]   that nobody was able to submit you?
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.280]   - First, it comes from training.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.720]   I train a lot bad position.
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:37.920]   My defense is good because I practice over and over again.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:40.880]   That's as much as I practice all my offensive position.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.720]   So you have to train both equally,
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.440]   not just being a good position.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:48.120]   You have to be in bad.
[00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:50.720]   So I think that's a very strong part of my game.
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:56.800]   To be a complete fighter, a complete martial artist,
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.440]   you have to be good in every single position,
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:01.760]   every single one.
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.400]   Those are the you're not, you have a weakness.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.840]   So to be complete, you should have no weakness.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.320]   So that was always my,
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:13.440]   I was always very particular on that,
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:15.640]   like it's where my weakness,
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:17.520]   where I don't feel good at it.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.240]   If you put me in a position to struggle,
[00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:20.800]   how do I escape, how do I get out?
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.800]   Everything, any submission locked,
[00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.360]   penny position, back mount, everything.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:30.040]   It doesn't matter which position I'm at,
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.920]   I practice over and over again.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.320]   So if I get there in a fighting situation,
[00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:37.400]   I will know how to get out.
[00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:39.880]   At least I'll have a direction.
[00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.560]   I will know this is my way out.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:45.480]   - Do you practice both escaping the bad position
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.480]   and the transition into the bad position, avoiding it?
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:53.480]   Because that's how it happens.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:57.320]   Jiu-jitsu, you start in a neutral position.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.640]   - No, the transition then becomes the fight itself.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:02.840]   It's being there is most important.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.680]   It's when you're there,
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.920]   then you have to know how to get out.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.080]   That's your weakness.
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:12.080]   Stopping the person getting there is something different.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.440]   They're two different things.
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.920]   Either you practice one or the other.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.760]   - So both are important, I guess.
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.560]   But stopping the person is easier to practice
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:24.000]   'cause that comes naturally in training.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.880]   What was the actual process?
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:28.640]   Like what was your biggest weakness throughout your,
[00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.840]   like just remembering what was annoying to you
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:33.200]   to figure out?
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:35.600]   - I mean, side control is always--
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.440]   - Bottom of side control.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.560]   - Bottom.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:41.080]   Regardless how much you practice, it's not ever easy.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.800]   You'll never be easy.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:43.680]   But--
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:44.520]   - It's so annoying.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.720]   It makes no sense.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:47.000]   - Yeah, someone pins you down.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.200]   He doesn't wanna move much.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.360]   He's a big and strong guy.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:51.960]   Regardless of who, it's not gonna be easy to escape.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.360]   So some situations are just hard.
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:56.320]   - That must be the, sorry to interrupt.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.560]   I'm interrupting Haja Grace.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.880]   He's discussing Jiu-jitsu.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.820]   But you just made me realize,
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:05.000]   if you're really good,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.720]   if you're going against like the perfect Jiu-jitsu competitor
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:12.920]   probably side control might be one of the hardest positions.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:14.480]   Is it the hardest position to escape?
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:15.480]   - It's one of them.
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.040]   If the person doesn't wanna progress,
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.160]   he's just concerned about--
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.800]   - So if they're stalling.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:21.480]   Like the best pinners in the world.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.080]   I mean, partially because I've just seen Judo people
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.720]   that know how to pin.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:26.560]   They--
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:27.800]   - They go escape their side control.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:29.240]   It's a nightmare.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.080]   It's a nightmare.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.560]   Doesn't matter how much you practice.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.160]   It's a nightmare.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.860]   - And it's also just frustrating.
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:39.040]   I think, I guess it is also frustrating
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:41.120]   because a lot of people in that position
[00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:44.480]   will be about maintaining control, not progressing.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:46.880]   And usually people when they're in back control
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:50.320]   are usually trying to progress towards the submission,
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:52.520]   which opens up opportunities for escape.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:58.520]   So what's the actual process of just time and time again
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.880]   putting yourself in a bottom side control?
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.560]   - Yeah, over and over again.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:06.400]   Starting there, escape, get back, escape, get back.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.340]   If it mount you, get back.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:10.520]   Any situation outside that, stop, start again,
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.040]   stop, start again.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:15.600]   And it has to be, I'll say five minutes
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:17.920]   because it's the repetition that will teach you.
[00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:20.360]   You know, if you train like three minutes on top,
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:24.040]   you have time to, you know, one thing and then time out.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.320]   It's the repetition that over and over again,
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.560]   you know, when you try the same move over and over again,
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:30.820]   then you'll see what can go wrong.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:34.200]   - And is it understanding the details of the movement
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:36.700]   or actually doing the movement and feeling it?
[00:21:36.700 --> 00:21:37.960]   - It's both.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.880]   First you have to understand the movement and then practice.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:47.220]   But most important thing is defense.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.540]   Escape coming second.
[00:21:48.540 --> 00:21:52.120]   Because, you know, he's attacking you.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.060]   The one thing is if he's not trying to submit you,
[00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:55.120]   but the other one, if it is,
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.920]   let's say if a person is very good, has a very good attack,
[00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.680]   the first thing is defense, not just escape.
[00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:05.000]   And expose yourself to an even worse position
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.160]   because that is very risky.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:09.120]   When you're trying to escape,
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:12.100]   you'll always expose yourself to a worse position.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:13.880]   So avoiding that, it's, you know,
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:16.320]   first is defense, not getting caught.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.700]   And then when you're escaping,
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.560]   don't be in a worse position than you are.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.720]   - So defense in jiu-jitsu, when you're wearing a gi,
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.040]   what does defense entail?
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:26.400]   Is it mostly grips?
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.440]   Is it mostly the positioning of your hips and legs?
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.380]   - It's everything together
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:32.880]   because it's a whole body movement.
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.400]   It's constantly moving your arms, legs, body.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:41.420]   They have to, everything works together.
[00:22:41.420 --> 00:22:44.980]   - Going back to the mind of that guy,
[00:22:44.980 --> 00:22:51.020]   so confident, no fear at this point.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:53.240]   Is there a bit of ego in there too?
[00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.320]   - Yes.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.040]   Like I say, I'm not gonna say I'm fearless.
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:22:59.940]   Of course there's concerns.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:03.480]   That fight, I would have to say,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.640]   was probably the fight that I got nervous the most,
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:11.080]   walking in, because I knew what that meant, that fight.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:16.080]   It meant everything for me, all my legacy was on the line.
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   Because if I lost that fight,
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.480]   forever I would be number two, forever.
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:27.480]   And I mean, Boucher is a great guy, great competitor.
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:31.280]   Jiu-jitsu is very good, but I'm better than him.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:32.120]   I knew that.
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.160]   - But he's competing nonstop at that point.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.200]   - He's a great competitor, taking nothing out of him.
[00:23:38.200 --> 00:23:41.840]   He's super tough, very tough, very good.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.760]   He's probably the best competitor in jiu-jitsu.
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.200]   He won 13 times the world championship, I won 10.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:52.200]   So as a competitor, he has more titles than I do.
[00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:56.960]   But in terms of analyzing the game,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.720]   I consider technically better than him.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.280]   So knowing all that, everything that I build,
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:07.520]   all my legacy, it's if I lose--
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.080]   - All's riding on this match.
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.320]   - If I lose this fight, I'm forever number two.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.800]   - And none of that is going through your mind at all.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.080]   - No, I knew, I mean, it's not at that moment.
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:20.760]   I already knew that.
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.640]   I remember just before, the curtains open,
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.360]   I'm standing in before they call my name.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.360]   And I mean, my legs were like,
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:32.760]   I feel the adrenaline kicking on my legs.
[00:24:32.760 --> 00:24:35.280]   And I'm like, I'm hitting the legs.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.920]   I'm like, wake up, get the adrenaline off me.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.120]   So it was intense, it was intense.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.640]   - And this was in Rio.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:45.840]   - That was in Rio.
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:48.160]   So-- - My hometown.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:50.600]   - So this is, I mean, and you know,
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:55.600]   Rio is not exactly known for its calmness in its fans.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:59.600]   So this is like, wow, wherever they hosted the Olympics
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:01.960]   the year before.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.240]   So this is like, I mean, this,
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.520]   like the whole basically martial arts community
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.520]   is watching this. - Watching that fight.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:13.040]   (Lex laughing)
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.840]   - I mean, is there some, was Hanzo there?
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.280]   - Yeah. (Lex laughing)
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.120]   Yeah, he was there.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:20.240]   - So people are just, I mean, there's a tension.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:23.760]   It's also, I mean, I don't know if you felt that in part,
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:26.200]   but you're also fighting for the Gracie name.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.040]   - Yeah.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:29.800]   In our hometown.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:30.640]   - The greatest--
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:32.120]   - Where the Gracie really established.
[00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:34.000]   - Gracie competitor of all time,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.360]   arguably in the hometown.
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.160]   - Yeah. - I mean, okay.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:41.920]   - All my family, my best friends, my friends,
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:44.040]   everybody watching, everybody there.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:46.360]   There was a lot of pressure, a lot.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.560]   - And then were you thinking
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.360]   that you would be able to submit him?
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.320]   - No, it's at that point,
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:56.280]   like I don't predict how the fight will go.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   That I never did because it isn't predictable.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:03.600]   It's, I never tried to set any strategy for any fight.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.440]   I think, oh, okay, that I did,
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.560]   but that was the only time
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.120]   that I set any strategy into a fight.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.880]   There was a 15 minutes fight there.
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:18.440]   And I said, first five minutes, I'm gonna play defense.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:20.440]   He's bigger, stronger, younger.
[00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:21.640]   I don't wanna play his game.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.520]   And I know he comes in very fast.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:27.320]   Every single fight he had, he comes very aggressive.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:29.760]   So my strategy walk into the fight,
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:32.280]   I say five minutes, I'm gonna play defense.
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.520]   I'm not gonna try to attack.
[00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.320]   I'm not gonna try to match his pace.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.040]   I already expected, maybe I'm gonna start losing the fight
[00:26:39.040 --> 00:26:41.640]   because if he comes in, there's a risk of me
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:44.840]   maybe getting takedown or something happen.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:48.600]   I'm like, I'm gonna stick to the game plan.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:51.440]   Five minutes, I'm gonna start picking up the pace
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:52.560]   'cause then it's 10 minutes to go,
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.760]   which 10 minutes is a long fight.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:55.200]   So I don't need to start fast,
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.040]   but I'm gonna start being more aggressive
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.000]   and then try to take him down or pull guard.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.720]   By then I'm like, that's as far as strategy goes.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.240]   - So no specific stay in the feed.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:09.360]   Were you comfortable being both bottom and top
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.200]   in this strategically?
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:12.800]   - Yeah, I'm always comfortable being bottom or top.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:17.800]   I prefer to be on top because being in the bottom,
[00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.360]   the person on top dictates the pace of the fight
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.120]   'cause he's on top over you.
[00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:23.840]   So I always prefer to be on top
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:25.320]   'cause I can dictate the pace.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:27.720]   I can implement my own pace.
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   And being the bottom, they can slow me down.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.120]   So it's harder.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:36.040]   So if I can choose, I will always be on top.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.200]   But I think by then I was like,
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.960]   it's five minutes, hit it.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:42.880]   I'm like, he's pretty big and strong.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:45.680]   I'm gonna spend a lot of energy taking him down.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.120]   I pull guard.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.200]   - How did it feel?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.880]   So here you're stepping in, by the way, puzzle math,
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:54.240]   this is old school, as old school as it gets.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.800]   So calm and relaxed here for people just listening.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:01.640]   We're watching the early minutes of the match.
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.720]   So just feeling it out.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.840]   He seems pretty calm too.
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:05.120]   He must be nervous too.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   I wonder how, do you ever talk to him?
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:07.480]   You guys are friends.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.000]   - Yeah, we're friends.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.800]   - Did he ever say how nervous he was?
[00:28:10.800 --> 00:28:13.200]   - No, we never spoke about that fight.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:14.040]   No.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:21.360]   - He probably lays late at night thinking about it.
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.840]   - Maybe, I don't know.
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:24.280]   - That SOB.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.120]   - Yeah.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:26.760]   - I mean, so you see the first five minutes,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.440]   you know, he kept,
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.240]   I knew what he was going to do.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:31.880]   And I studied his game.
[00:28:31.880 --> 00:28:34.920]   His stand up is most basic,
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:39.920]   is basic in takedowns, leg attacks, double leg.
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:43.280]   So he goes single, double, and he charges in.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:46.320]   That is pretty much his stand up game.
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.800]   - So you would try, you get a grip.
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:50.720]   - Yeah, but we got penalized.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:54.520]   - So do you like to use the,
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.480]   do you like to pose with your left?
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.080]   You have a right foot forward usually.
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.320]   You're a righty, right?
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:01.880]   - I'm a righty, but I know he wants my leg.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:06.000]   So I'm playing my stance just because of his game.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.120]   All my grips, the first five minutes
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.160]   was to kind of try to neutralize his attacks.
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:13.560]   - So he wants to get your left leg.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:14.400]   - Yeah.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.480]   - Yeah, right there.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.320]   - Yeah.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.240]   - So how hard is that to stop that?
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.440]   - I mean, he felt pretty strong coming in.
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.960]   So I'm pushing the head down,
[00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.560]   trying to play with his balance.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:29.000]   - Yeah, wow.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.640]   - If you see that there was a pause, go back there.
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:36.680]   He charged in, there's a pause,
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.760]   me standing in front of him.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.600]   - Yeah.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.560]   - I did that on purpose.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:43.080]   - What do you mean?
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:45.240]   - Just to, just in front of him,
[00:29:45.240 --> 00:29:49.000]   'cause he tried, and I'm like, you fail, I'm here.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.960]   - There's a, okay.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.160]   So you could feel the frustration.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.680]   - I could feel his frustration
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.440]   not be able to take me down.
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.760]   - Okay, so now, and this is just psychological battle.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.480]   - And you see me walking straight into the middle of the mat
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:08.280]   and he's circling out.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:09.120]   - Yeah.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:11.720]   - See, I'm going very slow, I'm recovering.
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:13.560]   - And he's computing like shit.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:14.400]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.920]   - Because he just made an effort,
[00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:18.640]   tried to take me down, he needs to recover.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.920]   And I mean, you need to recover,
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:22.960]   the other guys, they're waiting for you.
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.520]   - Yeah, and do I go for another takedown?
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.240]   'Cause this one failed.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.080]   - Yeah.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:30.600]   - Do I need to recalculate the strategy?
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:32.880]   - Yeah, and he kept trying over and over again
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.720]   and keep failing.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.600]   I think that frustrate him a lot on that fight.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:42.400]   I felt him kind of slowing down suddenly
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.000]   because he was getting nowhere.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.720]   - So we're five minutes in.
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.880]   Yeah, he keeps, so he never got that takedown
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:53.560]   in the early, no.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:54.920]   - Yeah.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:01.160]   Let's see, so at this point, do you pull guard?
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.960]   - So that's when I felt like he's,
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:11.640]   mentally he's worried now.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.200]   - Did you try to pull close guard here?
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.040]   - No, I knew he was gonna bring Danny in.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.640]   - Okay, 'cause that's the defense
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.800]   against pulling close guard?
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:20.720]   - Yeah, but I like that.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:26.240]   I like people bringing Danny between my legs
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:30.080]   'cause see, I'm gonna close my guard even with his leg in.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.080]   - Okay, he's stopping the, well, this is awkward, but--
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.880]   - Because I was holding his arm, that's why he fell.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.360]   He had no hand to post.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.560]   - Got it.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.120]   But still, it puts a leg in,
[00:31:43.120 --> 00:31:45.200]   but you're able to close your guard.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.480]   So you're okay with that?
[00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:47.480]   - I do that really well.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.200]   I sweep people from that position a lot.
[00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:50.560]   - What's the sweep?
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:52.440]   - I guess it's just pushed.
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:53.280]   - Okay.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.120]   - It's just a push.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:54.960]   - Like to your left side?
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:55.800]   - Yeah.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.440]   - Okay, because he has no, oh, it's almost like a,
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.760]   you mean you're basically around his back a little bit,
[00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:01.600]   like a drag situation.
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:02.480]   - Yeah, and he knew that,
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.600]   like I swept a lot of people with that sweep,
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:09.000]   so you see he kept leaning to his left, to my right.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:09.840]   - Yeah.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.800]   - So I wanna push them to my left,
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:14.400]   so you see him leaning over to my right a lot.
[00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.480]   - What's the right answer for him,
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:16.560]   to like roll or something?
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:17.680]   - No, I mean, he's stuck.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.200]   He's stuck there.
[00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:21.040]   - He's got no grip.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.520]   - But the one thing he did, he kept off me completely.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.760]   See that he's leaning, like he's too afraid of my attack now
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.520]   because he should lean on me.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:32.360]   - Yep.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:34.440]   - You know, you should bring the fight to me.
[00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:36.400]   So when I fell him, you know,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.200]   I knew he was like, he's too worried about my attacks now.
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:42.640]   - Oh yeah, that's right, so he can't,
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.040]   if he comes back to the center, he has no--
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.280]   - So he's not engaging now.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:49.240]   That time he's 100% just defending.
[00:32:49.240 --> 00:32:51.840]   So I felt that, I'm like, he doesn't wanna engage.
[00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:58.240]   And he's looking, I knew at that point, he wants my foot.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:01.200]   'Cause our first fight, I had the exact the same position.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:04.480]   I wasn't holding his arm and he went to attack my foot,
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:05.320]   which he did, you know, he got into attack.
[00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:06.960]   - Like a toe hold or what?
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:07.800]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:10.440]   - Yeah, so I knew he's looking at my foot.
[00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:12.680]   - Which foot, sorry, your right foot?
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.400]   - Yeah, my right foot.
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:15.560]   - Okay.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:16.400]   - But I'm holding his arm.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:17.240]   - You're hiding it?
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:18.640]   - I'm holding his arm.
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:19.840]   - And now you're going to the back
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.160]   as an arm drag type of thing.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.480]   - So the moment that I came off,
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.920]   now I'm holding his arm so he cannot come up.
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.080]   So I'm holding his left arm,
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:31.760]   so he cannot post a hand on the floor and come up.
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:34.160]   - And he's holding your right to try to get you,
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:37.840]   basically to prevent you from attacking.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:38.680]   - Yeah.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.840]   - Oh, that's interesting, and he rolls.
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:45.360]   - Yeah, he tried to get me off balance.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.480]   So see, now I'm switching, I switched the grip on his arm.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.760]   So I can free my left arm.
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.520]   - Can I ask you a question?
[00:33:52.520 --> 00:33:56.960]   Like, was there a chance he sweeps you here?
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.360]   - I mean, there's always a chance, but very hard.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:33:59.200]   - Like that?
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.440]   - Yeah, but see, my left arm is free.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.360]   - Oh, so you can post.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.600]   - Yeah.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.680]   - Why was your left arm free?
[00:34:04.680 --> 00:34:06.000]   Oh, 'cause you were using it, you got it.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.240]   - I got it.
[00:34:07.240 --> 00:34:08.080]   - Okay.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.120]   - So I tried the hook, now you will see.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:14.280]   - Still got your arm.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:18.840]   - Yeah, but when I knew, he's panicking,
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:23.000]   because he did a move that he completely opened himself up.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.360]   Like, I'm holding his left arm, so by holding the arm,
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.360]   that prevents him from defending the hook on that side,
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.680]   because his arm is being held across.
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.200]   So the arm cannot block the hook.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.120]   And I mean--
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:39.640]   - The hook with your left leg?
[00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:41.920]   - Yeah, so you'll see when he come up.
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.840]   But I would say, I mean, that's my guess,
[00:34:43.840 --> 00:34:48.840]   but Boucher, he's a big guy, he's like 110 kilos,
[00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.000]   112, something like that.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:51.840]   - Which is?
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:52.680]   - 245.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:53.680]   - Yeah, all right.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:56.640]   So what were you at the time?
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.720]   - Less, 220, yeah, 220.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:03.600]   - A nice slim 100 kilo, okay.
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   - So his defense are not amazing.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.840]   He's good, but he's not known to have amazing defense.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.280]   So by being the big guy in the room when you train,
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.480]   you used to get out of situation because of your size.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:21.240]   You shake people off.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.840]   It's because of your size, you shake them off,
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.920]   you get off some bad positions.
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:28.480]   You can, I mean, I could feel in the first fight,
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:32.240]   I'm side control, suddenly he explode out.
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:35.680]   So I've seen him doing that a few of his fights.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:40.520]   Not in the most technical way, just I'm getting out.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.720]   And he did because of his size.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.320]   So, and he did the same thing,
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.680]   like he tried to stood up when I'm on his back.
[00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:50.160]   He completely opened up the hooks.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:52.880]   You will see the next move, his head gonna come up
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.720]   and he gonna try to get off the floor.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.600]   - So basically come up, shake you off kind of strategy.
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:35:58.800]   - There was no defense for the hooks.
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:01.360]   I put both hooks in straight away.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:03.360]   - Oh, his arm is--
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:04.560]   - Yeah, I'm off balance, yeah.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:07.760]   See, I didn't bring him up, he came up.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   - Yeah.
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:12.600]   - And now I'm attacking his neck
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.280]   and he's worried about the hooks.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:17.040]   That's fatal mistake.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.840]   That's like defense always come first.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.080]   Remember what I just said now?
[00:36:21.080 --> 00:36:21.920]   - Yeah.
[00:36:21.920 --> 00:36:23.640]   - Defense first, escape second.
[00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:27.120]   So he's not worried more about the points than his neck.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.600]   So it was like a progression of mistakes.
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.760]   That's why I think he got frustrated
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.520]   when he couldn't take me down.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:37.800]   And then when I pull guard,
[00:36:37.800 --> 00:36:41.440]   he was frustrated that the fight wasn't going his way.
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:43.360]   You know, he's very good about taking down.
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360]   He try over and over again for five minutes.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:47.120]   - And here he was frustrated about the hooks.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:49.800]   So he's like, it's almost like the frustration,
[00:36:49.800 --> 00:36:51.840]   things like, no, no, no, these hooks shouldn't be here.
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:54.240]   - Like I pull guard on the grips that I want.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.880]   He's not comfortable inside my guard.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.760]   He's not in a position that he wants to be.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.960]   He's over leaning to his left, you know,
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.160]   he's not engaging or trying to pass.
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:06.520]   He's trying to get the foot, but his arm is trapped.
[00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:08.320]   He's gonna get nowhere.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:09.960]   And then when I swept him,
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.520]   some of his words start collapsing.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.760]   You know, he couldn't take me down.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:15.400]   I pull guard, I'm swept.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:17.240]   He tried to roll me over.
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:20.120]   No, he didn't get me anywhere.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.400]   The first movement that he tried to escape,
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:23.720]   I'm on his back.
[00:37:23.720 --> 00:37:25.440]   I mean, now he's lost.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.920]   - Yeah.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:29.920]   That, if you just go back to him standing up.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:33.720]   - See, both hook goes in no difference.
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.760]   Like there was nothing on the way of those hooks.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.440]   Because he tried to come up.
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:43.400]   - As he's coming up, you're high enough on him
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.880]   to where the weight was just probably immense.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:49.480]   It just felt too heavy.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   I mean, you're already going for the choke.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:55.240]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:56.440]   There's no time to lose.
[00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.680]   - Look at that.
[00:37:58.680 --> 00:37:59.520]   - Yeah.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:01.480]   - So you're not like worried I'm gonna get shaken off.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.320]   You're going for the choke.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:03.160]   Okay, you got your right hand on his foot now.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.360]   - No, he's not shaking me off.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.480]   I'm on your back now.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.520]   We're in this together.
[00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.400]   - And your right hand is opening up the lapel.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.320]   - My right hand is holding his arm.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.160]   I'm still holding the sleeve.
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:15.000]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.600]   You're holding the sleeve, but--
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:19.760]   - Holding the sleeve and I'm already going for the neck.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:21.160]   Because it's timing.
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   - At which point do you let go of the sleeve
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.240]   and open up, help with the lapel, or do you not need it?
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.440]   - No, I did that.
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:30.840]   But first I wanna try to make a grip.
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.880]   Like then I need to establish control
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:34.120]   before I let go of his arm.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:34.960]   - Got it.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:39.400]   - So I kept holding that a bit longer.
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:40.840]   And then when I fell, okay,
[00:38:40.840 --> 00:38:43.400]   I have a good control over the back, then I let go.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:49.560]   - Do you, okay, so you have like a light grip on his lapel,
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:50.520]   but you're thinking--
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.040]   - No, I need to adjust that.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.880]   - You need to adjust that.
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.600]   But you're like holding it there,
[00:38:54.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   and you're thinking, okay, at some point I need to adjust.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.840]   - All I need, all I want is to get under his chin.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.000]   Then I know, I mean, now I can go for it.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:03.760]   'Cause if it's over, there's no choke, right?
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.000]   - The wrist needs to be under.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.200]   - Can you choke Bucescu over the--
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.040]   - No, I can't.
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.360]   That's just not right.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:12.760]   - Okay, it's not right or it doesn't work?
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.040]   - Both, it's not right and it doesn't work.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.120]   I mean, would you tap to choke on your chin?
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.280]   No, it's just pressure.
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:21.400]   You hurt, but it's not gonna choke you out.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:22.960]   - I don't know, I don't know.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.360]   Let me argue this, I love this.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.160]   Arguing with Roger Gracie about chokes, this is great.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:30.400]   Okay, like clock choke, it was always interesting to me,
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:33.480]   'cause in judo it's illegal to have the gi around the,
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.240]   the face, and so it was kind of liberating for me
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:41.040]   to be allowed to have a gi around the face.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:41.880]   No, it's just--
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:43.280]   - Liberating.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:45.240]   - No, you don't have to worry about it.
[00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:47.000]   Of course, it's more effective to go under the chin,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.880]   but I'm surprised just because the amount of pressure.
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:51.600]   - It's all about how much you can take it.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.560]   You can take a lot.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:53.720]   - But it feels like--
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:54.840]   - No, it doesn't feel comfortable.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.080]   I mean, sometimes on your mouth, it cuts your mouth,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.360]   now you're bleeding, it feels horrible.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:40:00.000]   - No, but it feels, that's not the feeling.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.520]   The feeling, it might not be a choke,
[00:40:01.520 --> 00:40:04.360]   but the feeling like, it's a pressure
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.160]   that everything's just closing in.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.520]   - But it doesn't take you anywhere.
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:08.920]   Like, you're not gonna go to sleep.
[00:40:08.920 --> 00:40:10.000]   - You might not go to sleep.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.660]   - So it's just pressure.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:13.480]   - Yes.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:16.160]   - So pressure, it hurts, it's uncomfortable,
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.680]   but it's not gonna break your face,
[00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:20.160]   and it's not gonna put you to sleep.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.880]   So if I don't get the neck, I don't go for the gi.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:27.840]   I'm like, I'm holding his collar,
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.060]   but my wrist is almost under.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.560]   I'm trying to kind of dig in.
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.240]   If I can't dig in, then I would adjust the collar,
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.480]   but first I need to dig in.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.280]   - Dig in first, then adjust.
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:43.120]   Can you do all that with one hand or no?
[00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.960]   - I did.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.200]   - So you can tighten the choke with just one hand?
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:51.560]   - No, I need the second one to open the lapel.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:53.160]   - But you're like digging in with one hand.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.680]   - I'm digging in under the chin.
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.520]   - Under the chin.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:57.320]   - Under, now I need to go deeper.
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.040]   - But that, the going deeper requires the second hand.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:00.880]   - It does.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.700]   - Okay.
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:02.540]   - It does.
[00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:04.800]   - But that requires you letting go of the other hand.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.600]   - Yeah, I have to let go eventually.
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:08.440]   Yeah, see?
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.260]   - All right.
[00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:10.360]   Well, that's over.
[00:41:10.360 --> 00:41:12.920]   - Yeah, because I'm already under his,
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:15.640]   like the first hand got under the chin.
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:18.120]   - Do you need the hand on the second lapel?
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.520]   - Of course, otherwise he turns, and he's out.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.800]   - That's to control the turning
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:23.560]   versus the tightening of the choke?
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:25.040]   - Yeah, it does both.
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:29.680]   It helps tight the collar and stop the person rolling out.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:41.400]   - Were you feeling pretty good about this position?
[00:41:41.400 --> 00:41:42.240]   - Yes.
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:46.120]   I just felt it's getting tighter, tighter, tighter, tighter
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:49.720]   because it wasn't super tight from the beginning.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.200]   It wasn't like the perfect choke.
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.520]   So we're still, I mean, I knew it was like,
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:56.680]   he's very close to the end, but I still need to adjust.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:58.880]   There was still the risk of maybe escaping.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:01.560]   - Is it possible for his head to slip out?
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:02.800]   - It's possible, yes.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.480]   But I'm closing that gap.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:08.640]   - Right here.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:12.920]   What did that feel like, relief?
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:15.800]   - Relief, like awesome.
[00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:16.640]   Amazing.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.960]   (laughing)
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:19.720]   - Somebody on Reddit asked,
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.200]   ask him about the cross grip he used
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:25.600]   to sweep followed with a genius grip switch
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:26.880]   when Bucescia was inverted.
[00:42:26.880 --> 00:42:29.120]   Did you use a cross grip when you sweeped?
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:31.240]   - I guess the cross grip in the arm, that must be it.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.800]   - Oh, that's the cross grip.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:34.280]   Okay.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.920]   What's the genius behind that?
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.080]   Or was that just the, do you like that kind of grip?
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:42.960]   - Yeah, because I always like close guard
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.360]   and no one wants to be in anyone's close guard, right?
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.680]   It's open guard, it's the step to pass.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.240]   So everybody, when you try to close the guard,
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.000]   they bring their knee in the middle.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.520]   Like if you're not standing,
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:59.280]   if you're lower on the ground and they're open guard,
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:01.680]   if you're close to me, you need that knee between.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.160]   So it's a must.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.000]   That's when I start developing the attack.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:07.720]   You know, I managed to have long legs
[00:43:07.720 --> 00:43:10.960]   to close my legs around people even with that.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.480]   And then I just developed that sweep.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.720]   - When did you start developing that?
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:19.240]   - I don't remember when, but I would say before black belt.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   - Okay, so your answer to that is not to figure out
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:26.120]   how to prevent them from putting the knee in.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.240]   Is there an answer to that?
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.080]   - No.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.320]   - The good guys will always try to get the knee in.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:32.880]   - Remove the leg out of the way.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:33.840]   That's not possible.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:35.960]   - Well, maybe off balance them enough to where it's not.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.280]   - No.
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.720]   I mean, you can try, but like it's hard.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.320]   If you can off balance, you sweep them.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:43.200]   - Right.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:44.880]   So that knee's gonna, so you have to solve that.
[00:43:44.880 --> 00:43:46.680]   - That's a full sweep, yeah.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:51.440]   - Because that's, it's extremely common to have that.
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:54.680]   I mean, if I'm on your guard, open guard,
[00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:55.800]   you know, if you have your legs,
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:58.160]   if I'm between both of your legs in the open guard,
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.400]   my knee will be between your legs.
[00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.880]   'Cause it's a must.
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:02.440]   My knee cannot be on the floor.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:06.040]   - Since Henzo was there, what did he tell you before?
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:08.120]   - I think just motivate you.
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:12.000]   I think that's, Henzo always did that fantastically well
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:16.160]   to motivate me, like before in fight or match.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.760]   I think that, you know, the confidence,
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.360]   you know, his energy being around you,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:24.640]   I think that's the, is the great thing
[00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:25.720]   to have Henzo in your corner.
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.080]   It is the motivation that he gives you.
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:29.840]   - What did you learn about jiu-jitsu in life
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:31.600]   from Henzo Gracie?
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:33.680]   We got to hang out with him in Vegas a little bit.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.000]   He's a character.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.280]   He's one of the historic coaches and jiu-jitsu competitors,
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:42.160]   but also personalities in the martial arts world,
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:43.480]   in the world in general.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.640]   There's very few like him.
[00:44:44.640 --> 00:44:47.360]   - Henzo is a fantastic person.
[00:44:47.360 --> 00:44:51.400]   It's, you know, what I've learned most from him
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.080]   is like, it's, you know, you can take any challenge.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.440]   It's, you know, it doesn't matter when, where,
[00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.800]   what, you know, who, it's, you know, you have to be ready.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.480]   And, you know, with that warrior spirit that he has,
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:08.600]   he, you know, he always took any challenge,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:09.680]   ready or not ready.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:13.720]   - Was it you that said it, or he said it,
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.720]   where not until you go in, you know,
[00:45:18.720 --> 00:45:22.040]   to do something difficult,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.800]   do you discover the strength that you have?
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:27.000]   So like, if you really think about it,
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:30.720]   you might think that you don't, you're not good enough.
[00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:33.080]   You don't have the strength to take on something difficult.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:33.920]   - I fully agree.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:37.360]   I think we are measured not when we're on the strongest,
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:39.560]   but when we are on the weakest.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.520]   That's when we truly measure ourselves, our character,
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.800]   who we are, not when we're in a position of power,
[00:45:45.800 --> 00:45:47.520]   or when we're in a position of weakness.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.400]   - Have you surprised yourself, like how damn good you are?
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:55.880]   Like, is this really how good I am in this situation?
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.360]   Where in retrospect, you might think,
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.000]   how the hell was I able to accomplish this?
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   - Not how good I am, because otherwise I wouldn't be there.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.080]   So, you know, being there in the first place,
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:10.480]   it's already not a great thing.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:15.120]   But I say, you know, every single time I found myself there,
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:19.000]   I was super proud that I've never cracked.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Like, I've never gave up, ever, any second, any fight, never.
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.040]   - Never been broken in competition.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:26.880]   - Never.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.440]   Even, it's not about winning or losing,
[00:46:29.440 --> 00:46:31.560]   it's about you giving up.
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:32.960]   I've never doubted myself.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.520]   I always fought to the very end, always.
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:38.400]   That I'm most proud of.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.040]   'Cause there was moments, you know,
[00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:44.080]   it's in a terrible position, you know,
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:47.000]   mainly like there was moments that I was super tired,
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:51.520]   but like, exhaustive tired, when it was easy to give up.
[00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:56.240]   Like, I had nothing more to give, but I pushed.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:47:00.600]   I took energy out of my soul, I would have to say,
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.960]   'cause when my body had zero,
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.400]   my spirit, my soul, pull it out.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:10.120]   - Is that in part just not allowing yourself
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:14.600]   to have, to ever, ever quit?
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.120]   - Yeah.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.040]   - I have one other thing I regret.
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:21.400]   I remember like a blue belt match.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.600]   I remember, I'm not gonna say who it was against,
[00:47:24.600 --> 00:47:28.840]   but I remember it was just being extremely exhausted
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:32.280]   and just constantly fighting.
[00:47:32.280 --> 00:47:35.160]   A guy was really good mount, really good guard passing.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   And I just remember him passing my guard eventually.
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:43.800]   So it was just like a finals of one of the IBJJF tournaments
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:48.800]   and then right away going to mount and just,
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.320]   I don't know, the level of frustration,
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.480]   I mean, I quit at that point.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:57.440]   So I remember that still.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:47:59.480]   It's not about winning or losing,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:04.400]   but I just remember I was like teary-eyed frustrated.
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:07.600]   And then I knew there was a lot of fights still left
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:09.720]   in there somewhere and I quit.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.680]   And I regret that to this day.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:13.880]   'Cause I think the reason I regret that
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.880]   is 'cause it gave me an option to now quit
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.760]   in every other aspect of life.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:21.120]   This is an option.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.580]   - Yeah, it is.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:24.320]   - It sucks.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:28.040]   - Yeah, it teaches you, you know?
[00:48:28.040 --> 00:48:30.040]   It makes us stronger.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.680]   - It's like you said. - I think it made you stronger.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:34.240]   - Yeah, it makes you stronger that you did that
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.180]   to learn that don't do that again.
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:41.020]   But still, like you said, just going to sleep and training,
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:43.320]   I do think it made me weaker.
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:45.720]   It did make me weaker in the rest of my life too.
[00:48:45.720 --> 00:48:48.480]   Those, you know, I've quit a few times in my life
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   on small things and you realize,
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.200]   okay, it's not that big of a deal, it's fine.
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:54.040]   Who cares?
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.960]   But what you learn over time is that voice always comes there
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:02.120]   like obviously, maybe it does for you too,
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.940]   even at the highest level of like,
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:05.000]   it's not that big of a deal.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.740]   Like, it's okay to quit here.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:10.200]   Like, it makes sense, everybody would understand.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:15.640]   You know, in some sense, like, you're, you know,
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:18.200]   many people would say you're past your prime in this match
[00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.120]   with the Bouchesha, like, it makes sense.
[00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:22.480]   You've been focusing on MMA, makes sense.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:23.320]   - Yeah.
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.420]   - Makes sense to lose.
[00:49:25.420 --> 00:49:28.200]   Yeah, I don't know, that's a weird voice.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:32.040]   And in some sense, it's that voice and a voice that says,
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.220]   like, why are you doing this?
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.940]   Like, this is silly, this doesn't make any sense,
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:38.700]   just stop, just stop, just stop.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.960]   (laughing)
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.380]   And shutting that voice down
[00:49:43.380 --> 00:49:44.620]   and never allowing yourself to quit,
[00:49:44.620 --> 00:49:45.560]   that's a really powerful thing.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.880]   Like, everybody I've met, everybody that's successful,
[00:49:49.880 --> 00:49:55.020]   yeah, down to the, even engineers, CEOs,
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:57.340]   Elon Musk, just never quitting.
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:50:01.500]   Like, when everybody around you says quit, never quitting.
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:03.140]   It's weird, I don't know what that is.
[00:50:03.140 --> 00:50:04.900]   Might be genetic.
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.300]   It might be like using the stubbornness
[00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:12.300]   to just never allow yourself to develop that,
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.800]   it's basically developing a calluses
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:17.740]   to that voice that tries to tell you to quit.
[00:50:17.740 --> 00:50:19.380]   You never quit, huh?
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:21.460]   What would you attribute that to?
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:25.540]   - It's like how much you want to get
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.480]   to the destination you chose.
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.420]   Like, you know, it's how badly you wanna get there.
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.900]   And if you quit, you're never gonna get there.
[00:50:33.900 --> 00:50:34.940]   - And you always wanted to.
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:35.980]   - I always wanted to.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:40.620]   - Is there some thing you remember from that match,
[00:50:40.620 --> 00:50:42.300]   some things that happened before and after
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:44.820]   that stand out to you, just since in Rio?
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:46.580]   - Yeah, there was an interview, you know,
[00:50:46.580 --> 00:50:50.060]   like prior to the fight, you know, there was a big fight.
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:52.480]   We were doing like media every day before.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:53.500]   We were meeting, you know, me and him,
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:55.380]   we were meeting for media.
[00:50:55.380 --> 00:50:59.900]   And like five days before, you know, five, six days before,
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:02.220]   I'm quite chatty, it's, you know,
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:05.100]   the closer we get to the fight, the more focus I get,
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   the less I start joke around playing, you know, with people.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:12.100]   But I remember, I think it was maybe three
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:15.660]   or four days before we were doing an interview together.
[00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.180]   I think my cousin, Kira, was there,
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:20.260]   she was doing one of the interviews with us.
[00:51:20.260 --> 00:51:24.940]   And I don't remember exactly what we were talking about,
[00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:26.700]   but I just remember, we were talking about the fight,
[00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.220]   of course, and then it was, you know,
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:32.180]   we were standing beside each other and I'm like,
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:34.300]   and then I, you know, suddenly I chop him,
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:35.940]   I grab him by the neck.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:37.820]   I say, "I'm gonna tap you by the neck."
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:40.020]   And then he's like, you know, very shy.
[00:51:40.020 --> 00:51:40.940]   And then I let go, I said,
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:43.340]   "No, I'm gonna grab, tap you by the arm."
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:46.700]   And I could feel he was like, he wasn't comfortable,
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.900]   you know, with being there.
[00:51:47.900 --> 00:51:50.620]   It was, you know, me saying that I'm gonna tap him out,
[00:51:50.620 --> 00:51:54.280]   there was like, I was so relaxed joking about it,
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:56.300]   but I'm joking that I'm gonna tap him out
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:51:58.820]   in a fight that we're gonna have in four days time.
[00:51:58.820 --> 00:52:03.820]   And yeah, I felt he was like, not comfortable at all.
[00:52:03.820 --> 00:52:05.900]   - Do you think you got in his head a little bit?
[00:52:05.900 --> 00:52:06.740]   - Yeah, I did.
[00:52:06.740 --> 00:52:07.620]   - It gave you a little bit of confidence?
[00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:08.460]   - Yeah.
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:10.260]   - You've said that jiu-jitsu is a reflection
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:11.260]   of your personality.
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:13.220]   So both your jiu-jitsu and your personality,
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.340]   there's a calmness.
[00:52:14.340 --> 00:52:15.180]   What is that?
[00:52:15.180 --> 00:52:16.380]   Why are you so calm?
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:19.300]   Is there like an ocean underneath that's boiling?
[00:52:19.300 --> 00:52:21.260]   Is this developed or is this your personality?
[00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.580]   Are you basically leveraging who you are already
[00:52:24.580 --> 00:52:26.820]   to develop a game around the jiu-jitsu
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:29.380]   or did jiu-jitsu make you calm?
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.540]   - I think both.
[00:52:30.540 --> 00:52:32.860]   I was always very calm since I was a kid,
[00:52:32.860 --> 00:52:34.500]   you know, since very young.
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:37.180]   I was never very, you know, fiery person.
[00:52:37.180 --> 00:52:39.220]   So that is a reflection, you know,
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:41.500]   you reflected on my jiu-jitsu, my life,
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.380]   on my fights, the way I fight.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.500]   So it's a direct influence of my personality.
[00:52:46.500 --> 00:52:49.660]   And I think it's also in the day, you know,
[00:52:49.660 --> 00:52:52.740]   you develop the more you practice,
[00:52:52.740 --> 00:52:55.820]   you know, the more you fight, it's like, you know,
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.500]   you don't want to get nervous.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:58.500]   You don't want that adrenaline.
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:02.780]   And so you just learn how to shut that off from your mind.
[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:04.660]   So the less I thought about it, you know,
[00:53:04.660 --> 00:53:07.420]   it's like how many times I fought, you know,
[00:53:07.420 --> 00:53:09.220]   let's say the week before the fight,
[00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:13.460]   that's when you start more, when you're concerned the most,
[00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:15.020]   because now it's getting very close.
[00:53:15.020 --> 00:53:16.740]   Before it's just far away.
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:19.140]   You know, it's normal to think of the tournament,
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:21.980]   you get a bit nervous, but it goes away quick.
[00:53:21.980 --> 00:53:23.860]   But the fight, you know, the week before,
[00:53:23.860 --> 00:53:26.820]   now you're constantly thinking of that day.
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:29.100]   And every time you think, adrenaline pumps in,
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:31.820]   your heart accelerate, you know, it doesn't,
[00:53:31.820 --> 00:53:34.420]   you know, it makes it, it's like, why am I feeling this?
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:35.620]   What difference will it make?
[00:53:35.620 --> 00:53:38.060]   So you're kind of, you're shutting that thought
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:40.340]   out of your mind, because you don't want to feel
[00:53:40.340 --> 00:53:42.700]   the adrenaline, your heart accelerating.
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:44.620]   It's not going to add you anything.
[00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:48.020]   So it's, you know, it's the practice also that I think I,
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:50.980]   it helped me to shut that off my mind.
[00:53:50.980 --> 00:53:52.700]   - Has that helped you in regular life?
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.980]   - Yeah, of course.
[00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:57.700]   It's, you know, it's suddenly when you go into any,
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:00.380]   any situation that might be stressful, you know,
[00:54:00.380 --> 00:54:03.660]   like an important meeting, you know, super, whatever it is,
[00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:06.860]   it's like, how much would you worry about that before?
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:08.660]   Worry is not going to help you anywhere.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:10.020]   It's the opposite.
[00:54:10.020 --> 00:54:11.420]   Just going to make you more nervous,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:14.220]   your heart will accelerate, your ability to think clearly
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:16.820]   is going to be damaged by that.
[00:54:16.820 --> 00:54:21.740]   So it's like, the more calm, the more relaxed you are,
[00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:23.940]   the better you can think of.
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:25.300]   - Do you ever get angry?
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.340]   - Yeah.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:28.060]   - Like in traffic?
[00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:31.300]   Do you ever get like, not calm, just like you're screaming?
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:33.900]   - Not in a screaming situation, no.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.740]   - But just angry?
[00:54:34.740 --> 00:54:35.580]   - Yeah.
[00:54:35.580 --> 00:54:36.420]   - What does angry look like?
[00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:37.340]   Is it still calm?
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.540]   - Yeah, like, you know, a few seconds of complaining,
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:42.820]   but then it goes away.
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:44.660]   - Have you ever like thrown a cell phone at a wall
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.260]   or something like that of anger?
[00:54:46.260 --> 00:54:49.420]   - No, I never get that angry.
[00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.340]   'Cause that's just silly.
[00:54:50.340 --> 00:54:54.300]   It's like, if I would have done that,
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:57.500]   I would not be able to control my emotions prior to a fight.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:55:00.500]   There would be a lot of reflection.
[00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:02.060]   - Letting yourself lose--
[00:55:02.060 --> 00:55:06.540]   - Yeah, losing control that will reflect other times.
[00:55:06.540 --> 00:55:11.500]   - Do you think it has, in part,
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:14.500]   made you more emotionally closed off from the world?
[00:55:14.500 --> 00:55:17.740]   Like it's harder for you to be vulnerable to others?
[00:55:17.740 --> 00:55:19.500]   - Probably, yeah.
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.540]   But I heard that a few times.
[00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.860]   I'm emotionally closed.
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:25.860]   It's, yeah, maybe.
[00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:27.940]   I think that influenced it, yeah.
[00:55:27.940 --> 00:55:29.740]   - Have you ever cried in a movie?
[00:55:29.740 --> 00:55:31.820]   - Yeah, not for many years,
[00:55:31.820 --> 00:55:33.700]   but for, I think, maybe I'm getting older.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:34.540]   - Do you remember the movie?
[00:55:34.540 --> 00:55:36.700]   - Something, it's a silly movie.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:38.140]   I mean, it's, no, I mean--
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.180]   - Is it "The Notebook"?
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:40.700]   (laughing)
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.980]   - No, I mean, I would say the last few years
[00:55:43.980 --> 00:55:46.780]   I've been crying more than before for some reason.
[00:55:46.780 --> 00:55:47.620]   I don't know why.
[00:55:47.620 --> 00:55:48.460]   Like silly movies,
[00:55:48.460 --> 00:55:51.700]   like nothing suddenly brings tears to my eyes.
[00:55:51.700 --> 00:55:54.100]   - Yeah, well, I've already just,
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:56.100]   having met you and interacted with you,
[00:55:56.100 --> 00:55:58.900]   I can see that you're kind of opening your heart
[00:55:58.900 --> 00:56:00.180]   and mind to the world.
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:01.780]   You could see like,
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:06.780]   here's this historically great athlete.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:09.220]   Now, like, the wars have been fought
[00:56:09.220 --> 00:56:11.420]   and you're now like waking up to the world.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.380]   It's cool to see.
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:14.020]   - Probably I'm bringing my guard down now.
[00:56:14.020 --> 00:56:16.020]   I don't have to kick it up all the time.
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:16.860]   (laughing)
[00:56:16.860 --> 00:56:17.700]   - You don't have to fight.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:20.820]   You can even do some podcasts.
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:23.460]   You said you watched like movies beforehand sometimes.
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:24.660]   Mentioned "Braveheart."
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:25.500]   What were you doing?
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.020]   Did you watch something beforehand, like the day before?
[00:56:28.020 --> 00:56:28.860]   - I used to, yeah.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:33.860]   I was like, I think "Braveheart" and "Gladiator."
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:37.780]   I mean, there's a few others
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:39.780]   that I've always watched the day before.
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:41.540]   'Cause the day before I used to do nothing.
[00:56:41.540 --> 00:56:43.980]   I just wanna be at home in bed, watching TV,
[00:56:43.980 --> 00:56:47.460]   like saving energy, stretching by myself.
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:49.860]   So it's like, I just wanna save energy.
[00:56:49.860 --> 00:56:52.980]   I don't wanna waste my energy going out, going around.
[00:56:52.980 --> 00:56:56.300]   So, those are the movies that I always like to watch.
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:00.380]   Kind of trying to bring some hyper excitement.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:02.620]   It's like, I'm getting ready to war tomorrow.
[00:57:02.620 --> 00:57:05.260]   So I'm like, let me watch some movies
[00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.340]   that like brought that warrior spirit into me.
[00:57:09.340 --> 00:57:10.740]   - Yeah, what is that about human nature?
[00:57:10.740 --> 00:57:13.700]   "Braveheart" I love even more.
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:16.220]   Should you put your life on the line
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:20.580]   for a thing that matters or run away just so you can live?
[00:57:20.580 --> 00:57:23.020]   It's like, running you may live,
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.580]   but like years from now, when you look back at this moment,
[00:57:26.580 --> 00:57:31.260]   would you trade all the days just to come back
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:32.500]   to this moment?
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:34.500]   - And tell the English.
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:37.780]   - You can take our lives, but you can't take our freedom.
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:40.380]   I mean, oh man.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.300]   What is that about human nature?
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:46.580]   Is there some aspect of like the glory
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:50.060]   you were able to achieve being more important
[00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:51.860]   than anything else?
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.660]   There's some aspect of that, that's greatness.
[00:57:55.660 --> 00:57:58.300]   - Yeah, I never pursued glory.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:02.260]   So it just came, you know, it came with it,
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.180]   but that was never my goal.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:07.100]   I never cared for glory.
[00:58:07.100 --> 00:58:09.860]   - Were you able to experience like,
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:13.140]   like I'm at the height of this thing?
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:16.260]   Whatever humanity is able to achieve in various things,
[00:58:16.260 --> 00:58:18.300]   holy shit, I'm flying.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:23.300]   - I felt like no one can touch me.
[00:58:23.300 --> 00:58:26.500]   I can destroy people, yeah.
[00:58:26.500 --> 00:58:29.160]   - Prolonged periods of time or just momentarily?
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:36.140]   - I always knew, you know, from before I got to Black Belt,
[00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:40.180]   like, you know, I can be great because my, you know,
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:42.100]   I used to train with the best in the world.
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:44.100]   I used to, you know, for many years,
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:48.140]   and I used to see my progression with, and everybody else.
[00:58:48.140 --> 00:58:51.260]   So I knew I was getting somewhere.
[00:58:51.260 --> 00:58:54.220]   I knew I could be the best.
[00:58:54.220 --> 00:58:57.340]   And that was always my goal since very, very young.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:59:00.980]   And I always believed that I could be.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.860]   And that, over the years,
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:05.580]   that kept telling me over and over again,
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.660]   because I'm getting better and better,
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:11.020]   faster than everybody else.
[00:59:11.020 --> 00:59:14.060]   So I just need to carry on with what I'm doing.
[00:59:14.060 --> 00:59:17.380]   - But I think you've said that you wanted to,
[00:59:17.380 --> 00:59:20.580]   and maybe you thought you could be the greatest of all time,
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:24.920]   like at the very beginning, like when you sucked.
[00:59:24.920 --> 00:59:26.500]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:28.540]   Yeah, not the greatest of all time,
[00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:31.940]   because I never really thought about that.
[00:59:31.940 --> 00:59:34.060]   But I thought I'm gonna be the best in the world
[00:59:34.060 --> 00:59:36.060]   when I sucked, when I sucked.
[00:59:36.060 --> 00:59:37.580]   - So, okay, so what is that,
[00:59:37.580 --> 00:59:42.380]   what is that, like that self-belief?
[00:59:42.380 --> 00:59:44.620]   Is there a component to that self-belief
[00:59:44.620 --> 00:59:46.260]   being a prerequisite?
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:47.460]   - It's difficult to say,
[00:59:47.460 --> 00:59:50.300]   because that was a decision, I think.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:53.940]   Like, why did I believe that I could be?
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:56.380]   I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know.
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.660]   - But you think you decided to be.
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.500]   - I decided to be, and I believed I could.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.980]   - You think there was like a day somewhere,
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.420]   when you were young, where you're like,
[01:00:04.420 --> 01:00:06.740]   huh, you're sitting on a couch eating Cheetos.
[01:00:06.740 --> 01:00:11.020]   - I don't think it was a day, like a moment,
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:15.580]   because for many years,
[01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:17.620]   I wasn't really training much as a child.
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:21.900]   I used to train and then stop, done a bit of Judo.
[01:00:21.900 --> 01:00:24.020]   Never stay away from it much,
[01:00:24.020 --> 01:00:29.020]   but until, you know, like from 10 to 14,
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.740]   I barely trained Jujitsu much.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:33.980]   I used to, there was no Jiu-Jitsu school
[01:00:33.980 --> 01:00:35.940]   near where I used to live.
[01:00:35.940 --> 01:00:38.900]   And I was doing, there was a Jiu-Jitsu, a Judo school.
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.140]   I used to go twice a week.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.260]   I went to a Jiu-Jitsu tournament.
[01:00:43.260 --> 01:00:45.380]   I lost in five seconds, left crying.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:48.620]   The guy, he pwned me in five seconds.
[01:00:48.620 --> 01:00:52.660]   Anyway, so when I was 14,
[01:00:52.660 --> 01:00:56.500]   I went to the south of Brazil to see my uncle, Helium,
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.900]   to spend summer holidays.
[01:00:57.900 --> 01:01:00.020]   I was there for like four weeks, I think.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:01.020]   And when I got there,
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.740]   my cousin Hollis was living with him.
[01:01:02.740 --> 01:01:05.420]   Hollis, like bigger than me.
[01:01:05.420 --> 01:01:08.140]   It was, I think it's four years, four years older.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:11.900]   So I was 14, I was already 18, 17, 18.
[01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:13.900]   Purple belt competitor.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:16.780]   And I think that was the first time in my life
[01:01:16.780 --> 01:01:20.460]   that I felt what it meant to be a Gracie
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:25.340]   in terms of having a school, teaching, training,
[01:01:25.340 --> 01:01:27.700]   you know, living that, you know, Jiu-Jitsu lifestyle,
[01:01:27.700 --> 01:01:29.340]   what a Gracie meant to be.
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.780]   And I've just, I've loved that.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:33.420]   I was out of shape.
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:34.620]   My uncle was like, you know,
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:38.380]   was incentivizing me to lose weight, to train.
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:39.620]   But you're not training, why?
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.860]   You know, it's like, you're out of shape, you need to diet.
[01:01:41.860 --> 01:01:44.140]   So I used to run every day.
[01:01:44.140 --> 01:01:45.460]   I was eating super well.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:48.060]   I start, you know, I start, that when I start changing.
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:49.140]   So when I go back to Rio,
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:53.140]   I was super motivated to follow up, carry on.
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:55.900]   And he, you know, he invited me to go back there
[01:01:55.900 --> 01:01:58.460]   to live with him, but I couldn't.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.580]   It was too soon to change schools and everything.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:04.460]   My mom say, no, but maybe next year, if you wanna go,
[01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:05.660]   you can.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:06.820]   So I kept that in my mind.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:11.020]   Next year, I moved to the South to live with him.
[01:02:11.020 --> 01:02:11.860]   I was 15.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:17.060]   And it was him, my uncle, Hylian, and my uncle, Carlin.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:18.820]   They both used to live very close to each other.
[01:02:18.820 --> 01:02:21.260]   They used to have their own schools close to each other.
[01:02:21.260 --> 01:02:23.260]   So I was with both.
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:25.100]   And I stayed there for almost a year.
[01:02:25.100 --> 01:02:26.620]   I mean, I was the youngest in the academy.
[01:02:26.620 --> 01:02:30.740]   There was some, you know, blue, purple belts, normal guy,
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.500]   but they were already competing, training ahead of me.
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:36.660]   And I just joined the group of training.
[01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.180]   I didn't compete while I was there
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.380]   'cause there was no competition back then.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:42.380]   And I wasn't really ready, but it's not about competing.
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:44.140]   It's more about the training.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:46.740]   And I start training every day, start improving.
[01:02:46.740 --> 01:02:49.580]   And a year after that, when I came back to Rio,
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:50.860]   I was already on a mission.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.540]   I was like, I love this.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:55.900]   I'm just carry on training every day with my uncle, Carlos.
[01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:57.580]   Carlos Gracie Jr., Gracie Barra.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.820]   And when I got there,
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:01.460]   I was training a little bit there before,
[01:03:01.460 --> 01:03:03.580]   but I just 14, 15.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.220]   But when I got there, there was a, you know,
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:08.700]   there was one of, that was one of the most competitors,
[01:03:08.700 --> 01:03:11.660]   one of the biggest Jiu-Jitsu schools at the time.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:15.060]   There was so many high-level world champions,
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:17.860]   competitors in every single belt.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:22.100]   And so, and I've kind of joined in with that.
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:23.260]   And I've carried on.
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:24.300]   I don't remember when,
[01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:27.820]   but I remember, you know, looking and saying,
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.700]   I'm going to be the best in the world.
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:33.060]   But I used to be, I was at the bottom of the stairs.
[01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:34.380]   You know, no one really believed me.
[01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:36.980]   I didn't shout, you know, to the skies,
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.460]   but, you know, I told a few people,
[01:03:38.460 --> 01:03:40.500]   I'm like, I'm going to be the best.
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:43.940]   And that's, I think I was just losing,
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.300]   but I've never, ever doubt.
[01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:50.420]   I've never diverged from that mission, I would say.
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.060]   - Did anyone believe you when you said you could be great?
[01:03:53.060 --> 01:03:53.900]   - Nobody.
[01:03:53.900 --> 01:03:54.740]   - It didn't matter?
[01:03:54.740 --> 01:03:55.660]   - It didn't matter.
[01:03:55.660 --> 01:03:56.860]   I don't care, I don't need.
[01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.620]   - Even people that like love you?
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:02.060]   - Everybody, my mom, my dad, I mean, no one thought,
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:05.620]   no one in my family thought I was going to be here today.
[01:04:05.620 --> 01:04:08.900]   Nobody, because I just started late.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:12.140]   You know, I've never had any start that people,
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:13.980]   oh, that kid's going to be really good.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:17.740]   No, I was a chubby kid that didn't barely train.
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:18.980]   I mean, people used to look at me,
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:22.940]   he's just another grace, this, you know, what more?
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:24.180]   - What do you learn from that?
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:29.060]   Do you think most people lose that self-belief?
[01:04:29.060 --> 01:04:31.860]   They quit when everyone around them doesn't believe?
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:36.860]   - Yeah, I think if those that need approval, yes.
[01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:39.460]   - I see you shouldn't have approval.
[01:04:39.460 --> 01:04:41.940]   - I never need approval from anyone.
[01:04:41.940 --> 01:04:43.980]   I don't care if you believe me or not,
[01:04:43.980 --> 01:04:46.820]   if you're not my problem.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:48.700]   - It's tough, it's tough.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:50.440]   I don't need approval, but,
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:56.860]   you're surrounded by people older, wiser, better than you,
[01:04:56.860 --> 01:05:00.140]   and they're kind of directly or indirectly saying,
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.300]   you stop being silly, kid.
[01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:03.620]   - No, no one ever told me that,
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.860]   because that was not something
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:07.700]   that I used to say all the time.
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.780]   I maybe say it just very, very few times.
[01:05:10.780 --> 01:05:13.020]   - I just thought, you know, maybe that's the secret.
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.860]   - Of course, I mean, if you start shouting,
[01:05:14.860 --> 01:05:16.260]   then you're just being silly.
[01:05:16.260 --> 01:05:18.180]   Then it's not what you really want.
[01:05:18.180 --> 01:05:20.380]   Then you're saying that for another reasons,
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.580]   if you say it over and over again,
[01:05:22.580 --> 01:05:23.820]   because you shouldn't.
[01:05:23.820 --> 01:05:24.900]   I mean, why?
[01:05:24.900 --> 01:05:26.540]   - Well, to push back,
[01:05:26.540 --> 01:05:28.700]   one of the reasons you might want to say it
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.900]   is to find the right people that believe in you.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:33.420]   - Yeah, but no, if you say it over and over again,
[01:05:33.420 --> 01:05:36.400]   then it's just, then you're just bragging.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.340]   - Sure.
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:40.260]   - 'Cause one thing is to say it,
[01:05:40.260 --> 01:05:42.580]   but the other one is to do it.
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.380]   So it's, you know, you say it once or very few times,
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.860]   but now you have to do it saying
[01:05:47.860 --> 01:05:50.380]   it's not helping you getting there.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.460]   - Was there sacrifices you had to make?
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.420]   - Everything, everything.
[01:05:54.420 --> 01:05:56.180]   That was my priority in life.
[01:05:56.180 --> 01:05:57.860]   Everything was secondary.
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:01.900]   - Like social life, career paths.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.060]   - Yeah, everything.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:06.820]   - And is it from 14, 15, 16,
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:09.420]   as you get better and better and better and better,
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:13.140]   it was just becoming sharper, the focus on this thing.
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:15.460]   - Yeah, it's just over and over again,
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.540]   over and over again.
[01:06:16.540 --> 01:06:19.620]   It's, you know, it's just training, training, training.
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:24.620]   And I mean, how many times I lost, I have no clue.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.700]   - So on the mat, you were getting beat up.
[01:06:27.700 --> 01:06:30.100]   - I'm getting smashed by everybody.
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:33.860]   People my age, I was chubby, I was physically weak.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:36.300]   I mean, I'm tall, but physically,
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.180]   I'm not physically strong.
[01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:39.860]   I'm normally strong for my size,
[01:06:39.860 --> 01:06:44.740]   but physically, if you wanna measure strength, I'm weak.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:46.980]   Because, you know, we can measure strength,
[01:06:46.980 --> 01:06:49.500]   living weight, I'm weak.
[01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:53.500]   I don't lift, I lift weight same as people
[01:06:53.500 --> 01:06:54.820]   much lighter than me.
[01:06:54.820 --> 01:06:57.980]   Everybody my weight, lives heavier weight than me.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:59.060]   - And the people that train with you
[01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:00.460]   often talk about how--
[01:07:00.460 --> 01:07:02.100]   - They're super strong.
[01:07:02.100 --> 01:07:04.140]   Because I generate a lot of strength.
[01:07:04.140 --> 01:07:08.540]   I can create, I put myself in the right angles.
[01:07:08.540 --> 01:07:12.020]   So then I can be strong, I'm not strong.
[01:07:12.020 --> 01:07:16.660]   And the only person who I listen to saying that
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:19.220]   is Compreto, one guy that I fought,
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:22.780]   Rodrigo Medeiros, I fought him a few times.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.580]   And he's the only one that I heard saying about me,
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.380]   that's like, "No, Roger's not strong.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.980]   "He's not, he's technical and he can create strength,
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:33.020]   "but he's not strong."
[01:07:33.020 --> 01:07:35.100]   - He meant that as a compliment?
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.740]   - Yeah, I think so.
[01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:40.220]   No, I think he was honest, because I think he's
[01:07:40.220 --> 01:07:41.620]   the only one who could see that.
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:42.460]   - Yes.
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:43.700]   - So I think that's a compliment.
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:45.420]   - So he's technically really strong,
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:47.740]   so you had an incredible match with him.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.580]   - Yeah.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:54.580]   - Is there insight you have about how you went
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:59.420]   from a person who was not very good,
[01:07:59.420 --> 01:08:04.020]   but had a dream, a confident dream,
[01:08:04.020 --> 01:08:07.900]   a vision to somebody that was actually good?
[01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:10.620]   Was there something to the practice sessions?
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.940]   Were you getting reps on specific techniques?
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:15.700]   - I'd never done anything special,
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:18.860]   because I'm in a gym training equally with everybody else.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:21.500]   So I've never did anything on the side
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:23.260]   different than anybody else.
[01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:25.900]   So I was in the school training
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:27.820]   the exact same way as everybody else.
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.340]   - Wow, in terms of schedule, yes.
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:32.300]   But what was, can you reverse engineer
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:33.860]   what was going through your mind?
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:35.180]   'Cause there's so many different ways
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.460]   to actually mentally approach
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:37.820]   the same exact training session.
[01:08:37.820 --> 01:08:40.460]   - I'm gonna try to beat you.
[01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:43.340]   - Okay, so in some part it's competitive.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:44.180]   - Yeah.
[01:08:44.180 --> 01:08:47.740]   - But at the core of it is I want to be better
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.420]   than these particular people.
[01:08:49.420 --> 01:08:50.380]   - You're gonna keep beating me.
[01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:52.300]   I'm gonna keep coming back at you.
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:54.420]   - And to do that I have to solve problems.
[01:08:54.420 --> 01:08:55.980]   I have to figure out how to do stuff well.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:59.060]   - You catch me once, I'm gonna keep on coming,
[01:08:59.060 --> 01:09:02.660]   trying to not get caught in that.
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:05.020]   - At which point did you develop a game
[01:09:05.020 --> 01:09:08.700]   that was basically the famous white belt game
[01:09:08.700 --> 01:09:12.180]   of the very basics, the very fundamentals of jiu-jitsu?
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:16.460]   Like saying I'm going to beat you.
[01:09:16.460 --> 01:09:19.820]   - Never, there was never a conscious decision
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:22.780]   to try to have a basic jiu-jitsu.
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:26.940]   First, I think there's a big misconception there.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:28.260]   - Okay, what's the misconception?
[01:09:28.260 --> 01:09:29.100]   - My jiu-jitsu's not basic.
[01:09:29.100 --> 01:09:31.020]   - Mr. Roger Gracie, it's not, you're right.
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:32.940]   - It's not basic, it's not old school.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.300]   I think people, they just don't see that.
[01:09:35.300 --> 01:09:40.020]   It's extremely complex in a way that
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:42.420]   people, they cannot copy.
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:47.420]   I teach people, I can teach you the cross-collar choke.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.940]   But the one thing that people, they don't realize
[01:09:49.940 --> 01:09:54.260]   is not the move, is you need to practice the move
[01:09:54.260 --> 01:09:55.900]   until you learn.
[01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:58.340]   It's the practice over and over again.
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:01.180]   Like it took me years.
[01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:05.220]   When I say years, I'm like years after I was a black belt,
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.740]   I was able to choke people out
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:10.020]   with a cross-collar choke in the mouth, effectively.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:11.580]   Years after I got my black belt.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:15.140]   So that's something that you learn first day, first week.
[01:10:15.140 --> 01:10:18.100]   So I can't teach you, it makes no difference.
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:22.100]   You know the theory, but until you apply it in,
[01:10:22.100 --> 01:10:23.140]   I mean, it will help you, of course,
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:25.460]   the more details you learn,
[01:10:25.460 --> 01:10:27.100]   the more tools you have to practice,
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:29.420]   but it's still very complex
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.900]   because it's not about the move itself,
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.540]   it's about how can you control the movement
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.300]   of the other person.
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:38.100]   He's resisting, you're blocking,
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.420]   you cannot predict what he would do
[01:10:39.420 --> 01:10:42.340]   and he's doing a whole bunch of moves to block you.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:44.420]   Every single move you do, step of the way,
[01:10:44.420 --> 01:10:49.420]   because it's a progression of move from beginning to end
[01:10:49.420 --> 01:10:51.300]   till I apply the choke.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.700]   It's a progression of move
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.980]   and there's not one way to get that, there's many ways,
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:58.700]   because how many ways can you block?
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.540]   You can put your arm in every single angle,
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:02.460]   we have both arms, you can bridge.
[01:11:02.460 --> 01:11:04.180]   So it's dealing with all that,
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:09.180]   that is the complexity of the position.
[01:11:09.900 --> 01:11:11.020]   But that goes for everything,
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:16.020]   like every single move, my strong moves, I would say,
[01:11:16.020 --> 01:11:19.820]   it took me years developing them, years.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:22.660]   So it's, and you're gonna tell me that's basic,
[01:11:22.660 --> 01:11:23.900]   so go try and do it.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.380]   What the other person is defending, that's the thing,
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:29.540]   because most of the things that I do,
[01:11:29.540 --> 01:11:31.260]   I've been doing them for years
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.500]   and they know that I'm gonna do
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:37.500]   and I can still get it most of the times.
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.460]   That's the hardest, is when they know what's coming
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:42.420]   and you can still do it.
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:46.260]   - And you said that the way you're able to do that,
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.300]   you just have to do it right.
[01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.780]   - Yeah.
[01:11:49.780 --> 01:11:54.140]   - What do you learn by doing all the steps along the way?
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:55.460]   And just for people who don't know,
[01:11:55.460 --> 01:11:57.720]   cross-collar choke from the mount.
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:00.900]   So Jiu-Jitsu starts in a neutral place,
[01:12:00.900 --> 01:12:01.980]   there's people on their feet
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:05.100]   and then you either, then you get to the ground somehow
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.460]   and then there's the person on top and on bottom
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:09.140]   and then there's a guard with the legs
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:12.580]   between the two people and then you can get past the guard.
[01:12:12.580 --> 01:12:14.340]   As you get past the guard and you,
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.580]   into side control and so on,
[01:12:16.580 --> 01:12:19.540]   you get more and more and more dominant positions.
[01:12:19.540 --> 01:12:21.460]   And so mount is considered to be
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.900]   one of the most dominant positions,
[01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.660]   it's when you're past their legs,
[01:12:25.660 --> 01:12:27.360]   sitting on top of their stomach,
[01:12:27.360 --> 01:12:30.060]   putting pressure on them
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:33.060]   and cross-collar choke is using their jacket to,
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:35.300]   how would you explain that?
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:36.140]   To choke them with their--
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:39.020]   - You have the collars, I put my both hands on your collars
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:43.260]   and when I squeeze, you press your neck
[01:12:43.260 --> 01:12:45.140]   so it blocks the vein, you go to sleep.
[01:12:45.140 --> 01:12:48.020]   So it's a, you choke people with your hands and the wrist,
[01:12:48.020 --> 01:12:50.140]   you put them, you grab the collar
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.220]   so you got the wrist around people's neck and you squeeze.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:55.500]   - Yeah, the discovery of that is fascinating.
[01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:57.060]   I mean, 'cause it's interesting.
[01:12:57.060 --> 01:13:01.020]   It's like, you can imagine there's all kinds of ways
[01:13:01.020 --> 01:13:03.380]   to choke a human being.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:07.260]   What animals do it with their mouth, right?
[01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.220]   They put their jaws around the,
[01:13:10.220 --> 01:13:13.020]   and the fact that you can discover this methodology
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:14.360]   of the right kind of positioning
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:15.900]   and then it becomes an art form,
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:20.260]   of why this, why not this, right?
[01:13:20.260 --> 01:13:22.540]   Or why not this or something?
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:23.380]   To figure all that out--
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.540]   - I think we practice, that will come easy.
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:27.900]   - Over time you figure out what works and what not
[01:13:27.900 --> 01:13:31.740]   and then more further and further details
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:33.520]   and subtleties start to emerge.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:36.660]   Anyway, on that process of beating,
[01:13:36.660 --> 01:13:39.020]   of being able to beat some of the best people in the world
[01:13:39.020 --> 01:13:40.780]   and the thing they know is coming,
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:45.020]   what's the difference between the White Belt doing that
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.420]   and Hodge and Gracie doing that?
[01:13:46.420 --> 01:13:48.340]   The thing that's so hard to explain.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.220]   What do you think you're picking up?
[01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:53.460]   Is it some tiny, tiny details of muscle movements?
[01:13:53.460 --> 01:13:56.300]   - It is, it's many tiny details
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:59.900]   because it's the whole movement itself,
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:03.100]   it's the perception from beginning to end.
[01:14:03.100 --> 01:14:05.160]   Like every step of that movement,
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:07.300]   it's important and precise.
[01:14:07.300 --> 01:14:12.020]   So it's, you miss one detail on the way, you collapse.
[01:14:12.020 --> 01:14:13.900]   So when I say that with the Black Belt,
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:16.260]   the Black Belt has no control over the whole movement.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:19.420]   He's thinking beginning and end.
[01:14:19.420 --> 01:14:21.900]   So he goes straight to your neck,
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.900]   regardless he cannot read the other person.
[01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:28.820]   If it's time to let go, if it's the time to go for a neck,
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:31.780]   should I be pushing here before I get my hand in?
[01:14:32.660 --> 01:14:34.380]   Is this the right time to go deep
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:37.260]   or should I deal with this first before the second hand?
[01:14:37.260 --> 01:14:39.780]   - That's at the beginning, so it's at the White Belt,
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:41.620]   at the very beginning of the journey.
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:44.300]   - Yeah, the White Belt, you just think, finish.
[01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.140]   - Yeah.
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.380]   (laughing)
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:49.020]   And then as you get progress,
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:53.060]   you see that there's like this giant tree of possibilities
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:56.060]   that you're almost feeling your way down.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.060]   I mean, would you be able to teach?
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:02.460]   Do you even know what you're doing?
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:03.780]   - By the details.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:04.780]   - Okay.
[01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:07.620]   But it's hard to convert into words probably.
[01:15:07.620 --> 01:15:08.780]   - No.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:09.620]   - It's possible.
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:10.540]   - Then you don't know what you're doing.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.380]   - Okay.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:14.300]   (laughing)
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:18.340]   So what is the most important details
[01:15:18.340 --> 01:15:22.100]   that you could say, maybe positioning of the hand,
[01:15:22.100 --> 01:15:24.980]   the gripping, is it the positioning of your body,
[01:15:24.980 --> 01:15:27.180]   the posture, is there some interesting insights--
[01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:31.100]   - It's a combination because first you have to put your body
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:33.460]   in a very strong position that you don't require
[01:15:33.460 --> 01:15:35.900]   your hands to hold the mount.
[01:15:35.900 --> 01:15:40.740]   So the choke is that first because I cannot use my hands
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.740]   on the floor to stop you escaping.
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:43.580]   - Yeah.
[01:15:43.580 --> 01:15:46.660]   - So if I have to, my body has to handle that.
[01:15:46.660 --> 01:15:49.500]   The way I position myself, I have to do it in a way
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:52.420]   that don't require my hands for balance.
[01:15:52.420 --> 01:15:55.300]   - Okay, why is the mount such a dominant position?
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:56.540]   Doesn't make any sense, right?
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:58.940]   Like you're just sitting on top of the stomach of a person.
[01:15:58.940 --> 01:15:59.780]   - It makes all sense.
[01:15:59.780 --> 01:16:03.700]   If you think, forget fighting, forget jujitsu.
[01:16:03.700 --> 01:16:05.340]   Like you've never trained.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:10.300]   What's the one position, the most dominant position
[01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:12.420]   you can get over another human being?
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:14.620]   One, the most.
[01:16:14.620 --> 01:16:16.460]   For you, which one it is?
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:19.780]   Like the most dominant position
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:22.660]   that you can get over another human being.
[01:16:22.660 --> 01:16:25.100]   - So if we were just, 'cause the way I think about it
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:28.900]   is putting myself in like a six, seven, eight year old self
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:30.860]   without knowing any martial arts
[01:16:30.860 --> 01:16:34.500]   and I had an older brother who would beat the shit out of me.
[01:16:34.500 --> 01:16:36.060]   Yeah, it probably was mount.
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.060]   What?
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:39.980]   (laughs)
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:43.420]   But, well, yes, okay, so we both didn't know.
[01:16:43.420 --> 01:16:46.420]   But if we knew something, it'd probably be back control.
[01:16:46.420 --> 01:16:48.580]   - If in the back control, you're under the other person,
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:50.820]   do you think being under is the most dominant position
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:52.380]   you can be over another person?
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:55.620]   - You mean like a back control?
[01:16:55.620 --> 01:16:56.860]   - If I'm on your back.
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:57.700]   - Oh, like that.
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.300]   - I can move, you can roll, I cannot stop you rolling.
[01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:02.980]   Maybe you can even stand up.
[01:17:02.980 --> 01:17:04.460]   How dominant is that?
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:07.180]   - Yeah, but if we're the same size, both untrained.
[01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.820]   - If, doesn't matter.
[01:17:08.820 --> 01:17:11.100]   - Have you seen kids, they do that, okay.
[01:17:11.100 --> 01:17:15.380]   Mount looks and feels like dominance
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.780]   when you're two eight year olds fighting.
[01:17:17.780 --> 01:17:20.300]   Okay, I don't know why it feels that way.
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:21.940]   It could be some animalistic thing.
[01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:23.580]   Maybe it is actual dominance, I don't know.
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.700]   But it feels like if you're untrained,
[01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.700]   you can just buck your way out of it.
[01:17:27.700 --> 01:17:28.860]   It feels unstable.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:30.780]   It feels unstable to hold mount
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:32.860]   unless you know what you're doing, right?
[01:17:32.860 --> 01:17:33.700]   No?
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:35.580]   - If you're mount, you put both of your hands on the floor.
[01:17:35.580 --> 01:17:36.580]   - Yeah.
[01:17:36.580 --> 01:17:37.740]   - Just your hands.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.300]   You think it's easy to take somebody off?
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:41.500]   - Yeah, maybe not.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.740]   - You think it's easy to remove the hand and bring them out?
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:48.020]   The hands on the floor, arm straight, I'm leaning in.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:48.860]   - Yeah, you're right.
[01:17:48.860 --> 01:17:50.060]   - It's hard.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.380]   I mean, you don't need to know fighting
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:53.020]   to hold yourself there.
[01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:54.100]   - Yeah.
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:56.580]   - But you're right, when you take the arms off
[01:17:56.580 --> 01:17:58.860]   and balancing, then it gets tricky.
[01:17:58.860 --> 01:18:01.020]   'Cause when you're trying to,
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:04.540]   I think what happens, I'm thinking back to eight year old.
[01:18:04.540 --> 01:18:06.660]   'Cause my brother's five years older than me
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:09.860]   and he would do the usual stop hitting yourself thing.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:11.860]   I think he would be in mount,
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.560]   like hitting me with my own hands.
[01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:17.260]   Out of place of love, of course.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:20.140]   I love him deeply and it was very formative
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.140]   and a positive experience for me.
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:26.340]   - Okay, I think, yeah, the weakness is when he takes,
[01:18:26.340 --> 01:18:29.840]   well, when the person who has the amount
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:32.380]   takes their arms off to do something.
[01:18:32.380 --> 01:18:34.420]   - But even if you keep your hands up in the air,
[01:18:34.420 --> 01:18:36.020]   when I'm falling.
[01:18:36.020 --> 01:18:36.860]   - Yeah, you can.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.660]   - When I'm falling, so.
[01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.880]   - I'm speaking about untrained people.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:42.620]   I feel like they get greedy.
[01:18:42.620 --> 01:18:43.860]   They try to do stuff.
[01:18:43.860 --> 01:18:46.100]   - The other day I watched my nine year old daughter.
[01:18:46.100 --> 01:18:46.940]   - Yeah.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:48.860]   - We're in a friend's house.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:51.260]   There's a whole bunch of kids there, they're playing.
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:54.220]   And when I looked, she's mounting a boy,
[01:18:54.220 --> 01:18:57.580]   her age, her size, he cannot escape.
[01:18:57.580 --> 01:18:59.460]   - Wow, she probably has seen some footage.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.620]   - No, she's been training for, I'll say, a year and a half.
[01:19:02.620 --> 01:19:03.460]   - Okay.
[01:19:03.460 --> 01:19:04.280]   - But she's not much.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.860]   I mean, she's a nine year old daughter, a girl over a boy.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:07.980]   - Has she seen footage of you?
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:08.820]   Maybe she picked up from that.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:11.320]   - No, but she's been training for a year and a half,
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:13.620]   so she has an idea what mount is.
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:16.640]   But, I mean, in terms about skills,
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:19.020]   I don't never taught her the mount.
[01:19:19.020 --> 01:19:23.980]   She has lessons at the academy, like any other kid.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:25.260]   - Did she make him cry, or?
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:26.700]   - No, but he couldn't escape.
[01:19:26.700 --> 01:19:31.500]   Which other position would she be able to hold the boy?
[01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:35.100]   In the back, he would roll it out.
[01:19:35.100 --> 01:19:35.940]   - That's true.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:38.060]   - Like, he couldn't come out from underneath her.
[01:19:38.060 --> 01:19:39.940]   She's, they're kids.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:42.140]   Like, there is no other most dominant position
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:43.620]   that you can pin the other person.
[01:19:43.620 --> 01:19:47.120]   - Couldn't you argue, from that perspective, sight control?
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:48.020]   - No.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:48.860]   - No?
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:51.860]   - In sight control, you have to hold the other person.
[01:19:51.860 --> 01:19:53.820]   And it's, you're not free.
[01:19:53.820 --> 01:19:56.860]   You cannot release them.
[01:19:56.860 --> 01:20:00.780]   - But in sight control, your hips are not on top of theirs.
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:05.780]   So, they can't buck you off, right?
[01:20:05.780 --> 01:20:08.140]   Could you, if you're holding them a little bit,
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:10.580]   and you can hit them with one hand, like slap 'em.
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:12.220]   - His head is here.
[01:20:12.220 --> 01:20:14.540]   You're gonna hurt him here.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:15.740]   By the time you're doing that,
[01:20:15.740 --> 01:20:17.580]   but then he has his arms free,
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:19.980]   and if you turn towards your legs,
[01:20:19.980 --> 01:20:21.700]   then he's away from your arms.
[01:20:21.700 --> 01:20:23.960]   He not even has the perfect angle.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:25.340]   I mean, it is a good position.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:27.420]   You can hit, you can dominate,
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:32.420]   but it's not the best position to be over the other person.
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:34.620]   He can knee you in the head.
[01:20:34.620 --> 01:20:35.620]   At the same time you punch him,
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:38.340]   then there's a knee coming to your head.
[01:20:38.340 --> 01:20:40.420]   - I love playing devil's advocate with Roger Gracie
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.860]   about two eight-year-olds fighting.
[01:20:42.860 --> 01:20:45.820]   - And your head is closer to his head.
[01:20:45.820 --> 01:20:48.060]   Maybe he can throw you a punch.
[01:20:48.060 --> 01:20:48.900]   - All right, thank you.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:52.100]   - Would you choose to be in side control over mount?
[01:20:52.100 --> 01:20:53.140]   Getting in the head?
[01:20:53.140 --> 01:20:55.500]   - Well, for a person who in competition
[01:20:55.500 --> 01:20:57.580]   prefers knee on belly over mount,
[01:20:57.580 --> 01:20:59.620]   but that's my weakness.
[01:20:59.620 --> 01:21:01.900]   That's my failure as a human being.
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.020]   Holding mount can be tricky.
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.780]   - It's very hard.
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.420]   Of course it's hard.
[01:21:07.420 --> 01:21:08.740]   But what is easy?
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:09.580]   Tell me easy.
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:11.140]   - Side control and knee on belly is easier.
[01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:11.980]   But to submit--
[01:21:11.980 --> 01:21:14.100]   - Knee on belly is easy?
[01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:15.120]   - Easier.
[01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.780]   I'm not saying black belt level.
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:18.860]   I'm saying, well maybe even black belt level.
[01:21:18.860 --> 01:21:19.860]   - Easier for what?
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.800]   To hold somebody?
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:24.220]   - To make them squirm and hurt,
[01:21:24.220 --> 01:21:26.060]   to create openings.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.900]   - Yeah, but go to there with a big guy.
[01:21:27.900 --> 01:21:28.740]   - Yeah, you can't.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:29.580]   - You can't.
[01:21:29.580 --> 01:21:33.340]   He's gonna push you back and come up.
[01:21:33.340 --> 01:21:35.340]   In the mount he can't sit up.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:36.820]   Not when you're mounted him.
[01:21:36.820 --> 01:21:38.140]   - The thing is also about mount
[01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:41.260]   is people on the bottom of mount panic more.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:42.100]   So they fight harder.
[01:21:42.100 --> 01:21:43.820]   - Of course they panic.
[01:21:43.820 --> 01:21:45.820]   They expose.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:48.880]   It's the most exposure you have.
[01:21:48.880 --> 01:21:50.800]   Because the person's arms are free.
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:52.580]   You cannot touch him.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:54.080]   His head is too high.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:55.880]   There's nothing he can do.
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:21:57.640]   His legs won't get you anywhere.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:59.040]   He might touch your lower back.
[01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.720]   It's like nothing.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:04.020]   You're most exposed being in the mount.
[01:22:04.020 --> 01:22:07.440]   I read you holding side control a thousand times
[01:22:07.440 --> 01:22:09.200]   the amount of me having to look up
[01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.840]   for your fist come down on me.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:12.680]   - Yeah.
[01:22:12.680 --> 01:22:14.780]   - So I hug you, you cannot hurt me.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:19.060]   Okay, you hold me, but I'm hugging you.
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:22.060]   If I hug you tight, what can you do against me?
[01:22:22.060 --> 01:22:22.900]   Hold.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:25.780]   - It seems maybe it's just from,
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:28.340]   and again I'm arguing just for the fun of it.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:33.340]   But it seems like a more difficult skill to learn
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:39.260]   to apply a huge amount of pressure and weight from mount.
[01:22:39.260 --> 01:22:41.780]   - You don't have to apply pressure and weight from mount?
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:45.000]   - Not apply pressure, but be heavy.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:45.840]   Right?
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:46.880]   - You don't necessarily need to be heavy.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:48.560]   - You don't?
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:49.400]   - No.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.320]   - Why do you, as people say, you feel extremely heavy?
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:56.200]   - If I'm being heavy, I cannot attack.
[01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:59.800]   I have to choose.
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:04.800]   I can be heavy just to pin them,
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:08.480]   take the energy out to make them suffer.
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:10.720]   But the moment that I decide to attack,
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:13.540]   I can only be heavy if I'm sitting up straight.
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:15.920]   That's when all my weight drops down.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:18.260]   If I'm high, then I'm sitting on your chest
[01:23:18.260 --> 01:23:20.080]   and on your solar plexus.
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:23.000]   That's the worst position to be sitting on the person
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:24.580]   'cause that's where he breathes.
[01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.960]   So in a high mount, sitting up straight,
[01:23:27.960 --> 01:23:29.720]   that's when you can, I can be very heavy.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:34.220]   I can make people feel my weight and be very uncomfortable,
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:35.720]   but I'm not in a position to attack.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:38.580]   The moment that I wanna attack, my body has to lean forward.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:41.600]   I have to approach the neck or the arms.
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:45.020]   The moment that I do that, my weight comes off my hips.
[01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.840]   It goes to my knees, the weight is off you.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:49.560]   - But at that point, if you have--
[01:23:49.560 --> 01:23:52.540]   - Now I'm attacking, I'm no longer heavy on you.
[01:23:52.540 --> 01:23:54.160]   - But you want to be at that point
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.960]   to remove any of the defenses they have
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.480]   or some of the defenses by getting their elbows--
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:01.360]   - Now I'm like either getting, trying to get your call
[01:24:01.360 --> 01:24:03.680]   or bringing your elbow across or tuck the armlock.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.720]   - So what are some interesting details along the way
[01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:08.320]   that are tough to get to figure out?
[01:24:08.320 --> 01:24:10.420]   What were the big leaps for you
[01:24:10.420 --> 01:24:14.240]   from white belt to the best in the world?
[01:24:14.240 --> 01:24:16.560]   - It's you trying to attack the neck,
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.200]   putting one hand in the collar,
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:21.280]   you're priving yourself that hand to pace it on the floor.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.760]   So now you're vulnerable to get bridged, to get rollover,
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:26.000]   'cause if your hands are free trying to roll you over,
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.120]   you're stopped.
[01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:29.700]   The moment that you put your hand in the person's collar,
[01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:33.120]   now you have to be very careful with your body positioning,
[01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.560]   very careful. - The distribution
[01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:38.200]   of the weight. - Yeah, and how high you sit,
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.240]   how tall your upper body goes.
[01:24:41.240 --> 01:24:43.760]   And then the biggest challenge comes
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.280]   as you're trying the second hand.
[01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:48.580]   That's the, for the choke, that's the biggest challenge,
[01:24:48.580 --> 01:24:51.560]   the second hand, because you already have,
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:54.120]   you already don't have one hand.
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:57.160]   Now you are trying the second hand
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:02.160]   and if one of my hand is in, you as a,
[01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:05.260]   defending yourself, you have two hands.
[01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:07.280]   One hand is already on one side.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.480]   This side is getting attack.
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:11.600]   You have two hands blocking that.
[01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:12.880]   I have one hand.
[01:25:12.880 --> 01:25:14.880]   There's no help for that hand.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.880]   I cannot remove anything.
[01:25:16.880 --> 01:25:18.640]   That's the biggest challenge, getting,
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:23.640]   one hand getting past you and not getting rollover.
[01:25:23.640 --> 01:25:27.000]   - But I also have two hands on bottom,
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:28.720]   I have two hands and can also turn
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.600]   and do all kinds of stuff. - Yeah.
[01:25:31.600 --> 01:25:33.360]   - And my whole mind and everything
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:34.840]   is focused on that second hand.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:36.720]   - Yeah, it's a big challenge.
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:38.600]   - It's hard, very hard.
[01:25:38.600 --> 01:25:41.040]   - Is there an art to getting the first hand
[01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:43.000]   into a place where you--
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.960]   - It's less of an art because it's easier.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.120]   I'll say most times I get my first hand in
[01:25:49.120 --> 01:25:51.160]   is when you're trying some move.
[01:25:51.160 --> 01:25:53.640]   You're trying to escape, you're pushing.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:56.720]   I get the first hand in as an opportunity.
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:25:59.200]   - And it's gonna sit there for a while.
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.320]   And now-- - And I go as deep as I can
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:04.880]   so the first hand, because the second hand is the hardest,
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:06.520]   I have to compensate the first hand
[01:26:06.520 --> 01:26:08.600]   to be as deep as I can.
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:11.360]   If I cannot get the first hand in deep,
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:13.320]   I won't try the second.
[01:26:13.320 --> 01:26:15.720]   I need that first hand deep, then I go for the second.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.600]   - And it's deep and everything is super tight?
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:19.680]   - Super tight.
[01:26:19.680 --> 01:26:21.560]   The first hand has to be super tight,
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:24.640]   otherwise the chance of failing is very big.
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:26.760]   - Okay, does the opponent usually feel
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:28.280]   like they're screwed at that point also?
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:30.680]   - Not as you put in the first hand in.
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:33.520]   The moment that I position myself
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.280]   just prior to attempt the second hand,
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:38.840]   I think the way my body is positioned,
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:41.240]   the way I'm collapsing with my weight
[01:26:41.240 --> 01:26:45.520]   and they feel it's like it's, you know, this is terrible.
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:47.000]   - Yeah, how long did it take you to figure out
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:50.600]   how to reposition your weight once the first hand is in?
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.880]   - Very quickly, because we get breached out.
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:56.120]   - Okay, so there's a good feedback loop there.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:58.440]   - Because one mistake you're out.
[01:26:58.440 --> 01:27:02.440]   Like, one off positioning, you're out.
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:03.560]   - But you still have to do that against
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.000]   the best people in the world.
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.640]   Where's the way out for most people?
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:10.760]   Like, if you were in Mount against Bouchacha,
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.120]   what are some of the best defenses in the world?
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.640]   - The way out is to, obviously, is to defend themselves
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:21.920]   and prevent the first hand to get deep.
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:26.720]   And I'll say the best thing that they could do
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:31.440]   is try to change my positioning on the Mount
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:34.640]   in a way that, you know, push me to a very low Mount.
[01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:37.920]   You know, try to change the way I'm dominating you,
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:40.320]   not to be, you know, to get me off the high Mount,
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.160]   pretty much.
[01:27:41.160 --> 01:27:43.720]   - Are you always, is it a slow, is it a fast thing
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.880]   to go from low to fast Mount?
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.720]   - Slow, slow, slow.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:47.560]   - A high Mount?
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:48.400]   - Slow, very slow.
[01:27:48.400 --> 01:27:49.220]   Because I need to beat your arms,
[01:27:49.220 --> 01:27:50.320]   'cause you're holding me down.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:51.920]   - And the arms need to come out.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.080]   - It's a slow process.
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:56.720]   - Okay, and you just, is there like a--
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:28:00.320]   - Yeah, so I use my legs against your arms.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:03.600]   So it's my legs pushing your arms.
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.480]   - But how do you get 'em,
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.960]   how do you get your legs into the elbows?
[01:28:06.960 --> 01:28:09.400]   - As long as it's, you know, it has to come
[01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:10.960]   under the tip of your elbow,
[01:28:10.960 --> 01:28:14.040]   'cause now the legs will start forcing your arms up.
[01:28:14.040 --> 01:28:16.880]   - So your legs aren't like spread out, they're in?
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:19.440]   - Your elbow cannot get inside my leg,
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:22.900]   because that means I'm in a very low Mount.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:26.760]   And then I cannot attack, 'cause I cannot ignore that.
[01:28:26.760 --> 01:28:28.040]   'Cause the moment that I attack,
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:31.120]   that will, it will start pushing my leg to push me up.
[01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:34.700]   - What's the secret to getting the second hand in?
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:38.640]   - There's two ways, either you go four fingers inside,
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:39.480]   which is the hardest,
[01:28:39.480 --> 01:28:42.720]   because the moment that your two hands are defending,
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:46.600]   you'll be blocking the way.
[01:28:46.600 --> 01:28:50.680]   And I cannot clear and attack two hands against one.
[01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:54.840]   So I go thumb in, I go behind the ear.
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.520]   So my grip goes, because for you to defend,
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:29:00.680]   you need to get there.
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.920]   And when you get there, you elevate your elbow,
[01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:04.120]   you expose the arm lock.
[01:29:04.120 --> 01:29:06.120]   So it's hard.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:10.840]   - So you put the thumb in, and then there's the dreaded,
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:14.080]   like the other person just waits for you to loop
[01:29:14.080 --> 01:29:15.640]   the arm over.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:17.720]   - Yeah, but that, it's over.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:21.360]   - Once you get the thumb in, it's over.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:22.200]   Okay.
[01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:25.480]   But when I'm there, it's, if I get the,
[01:29:25.480 --> 01:29:27.760]   'cause they're bridging, you know, they're trying.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:30.040]   I'm not using the hand to pose.
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:31.520]   - Now your head is--
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:32.920]   - My head is very close to the floor,
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:34.000]   when I've tried to bridge,
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:35.600]   and you know, my forehead would touch the floor,
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.800]   that would be used as a hand.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:38.000]   - But it's not on the floor.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:39.040]   - Not necessarily.
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.720]   Because if it's on the floor, my body's collapse over you.
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:45.720]   So there's no place for my hand,
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:46.760]   for me to work on your neck.
[01:29:46.760 --> 01:29:48.800]   So I need some space between us.
[01:29:48.800 --> 01:29:49.640]   So I don't completely collapse.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:51.120]   - And maybe you can bob up and down,
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.360]   kind of like a bob's bob.
[01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.120]   - I try to keep a gap between us.
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.960]   - So that pursuit, that takes many, many, many, many years.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:02.480]   I don't know if you've seen "Jiro Dreams of Sushi."
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:07.040]   The, doing the simple thing,
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:09.680]   that's not so simple, but it kind of looks simple,
[01:30:09.680 --> 01:30:11.520]   of the over and over and over and over and over,
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:13.200]   and presumably getting much better--
[01:30:13.200 --> 01:30:14.280]   - It becomes very simple.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:15.240]   - It becomes very simple.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.480]   But you're picking up details probably along the way.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:19.360]   There's wisdom along the way.
[01:30:19.360 --> 01:30:20.200]   What is that?
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:24.480]   - That there's like lessons
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:27.120]   that you just kind of accumulate over time.
[01:30:27.120 --> 01:30:30.920]   Like one training session, you'll see maybe
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:36.280]   like the positioning of the thumb,
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.360]   like this detailed positioning of the thumb
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:39.480]   or something like this.
[01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:42.320]   And then you like, okay, you like load that in.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:44.480]   - That will be very basic
[01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:46.960]   because there is not that many different ways.
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:48.720]   Maybe one, two.
[01:30:48.720 --> 01:30:50.080]   I just do one.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.520]   Any other is not as strong
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:55.840]   because it's about getting a strong grip on your collar.
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:59.040]   I mean, the thumb is, it's, the thumb goes inside,
[01:30:59.040 --> 01:31:01.800]   is it the thumb in or four fingers in,
[01:31:01.800 --> 01:31:04.640]   but it's getting a strong grip on the collar
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:09.360]   as long as this is just holding and feeling strong.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.480]   - So that's just two options.
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.200]   So it's the dynamic stuff along the way.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:16.000]   And then some of that is timing too.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:17.000]   - It's timing.
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:20.360]   - Are you also like making people, like faking them out,
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.720]   making them think about something else?
[01:31:21.720 --> 01:31:22.920]   - No, not at that point.
[01:31:22.920 --> 01:31:26.760]   That's not, because I cannot fake anything else
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.280]   at that point.
[01:31:28.280 --> 01:31:30.960]   Because I will have to change my positioning to,
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:32.880]   maybe to fake an arm lock.
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:35.160]   Then I have to move out from that.
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:37.560]   So then I will lose the control I have.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:39.600]   - So what's the process towards mastery?
[01:31:39.600 --> 01:31:41.080]   If you were to convert that to something
[01:31:41.080 --> 01:31:43.560]   that generalizes beyond jiu-jitsu,
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.560]   how can you get that good at a simple thing?
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.400]   - Practice.
[01:31:48.400 --> 01:31:50.680]   That simple.
[01:31:50.680 --> 01:31:53.400]   - The same exact thing over and over.
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:56.720]   - It's just a matter of how long it would take you.
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.960]   - So all, (laughs)
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.640]   that's true, that's true.
[01:32:00.640 --> 01:32:03.800]   - I mean, like I said, look how long it took me.
[01:32:03.800 --> 01:32:05.240]   People give up along the way.
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:11.440]   - There is intricacies to that journey towards perfection.
[01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:15.920]   There's a lot of people that do jiu-jitsu for decades
[01:32:15.920 --> 01:32:17.480]   and don't get better.
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:19.400]   - No, 'cause they don't train the way they should.
[01:32:19.400 --> 01:32:22.160]   They don't train to get better, they train to get tough.
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.840]   That's a big difference.
[01:32:23.840 --> 01:32:26.960]   Most people, they train to get tough, so they are tough.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:28.840]   You know, like we were talking before,
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.480]   they don't practice their weakness.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:34.080]   You wanna be good at, you wanna be really good at jiu-jitsu,
[01:32:34.080 --> 01:32:38.960]   you have to practice your weakness, not your strength.
[01:32:38.960 --> 01:32:40.080]   You have to practice everything,
[01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.800]   but you have to be equally strong in every position.
[01:32:42.800 --> 01:32:44.520]   They all act the same.
[01:32:44.520 --> 01:32:46.520]   You know, your guard, top, bottom,
[01:32:46.520 --> 01:32:49.840]   side control, top, bottom, turtle, half guard,
[01:32:49.840 --> 01:32:53.520]   mount, back, I mean, you pick, take down.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:59.200]   And then you get into details of escaping triangle,
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:03.320]   applying the triangle, escaping arm lock,
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:07.040]   different scenarios of, you know,
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.480]   the one thing is defending the arm lock
[01:33:08.480 --> 01:33:11.600]   when you have your arms very close to your body.
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.040]   The other thing is to defend the arms
[01:33:13.040 --> 01:33:15.800]   when your arm is almost getting,
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.600]   and then when you got your arm.
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:21.600]   So there's so many things to practice
[01:33:21.600 --> 01:33:24.040]   that you need to repeat them over and over again
[01:33:24.040 --> 01:33:26.280]   until you're confident enough that when you get there,
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:27.440]   you have a chance.
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:28.680]   - And you can do the same kind of thing
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:32.080]   for even the final stages of a cross choke from mount.
[01:33:32.080 --> 01:33:32.960]   - Everything.
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:36.840]   I mean, of course, like you don't practice
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:39.560]   escaping the arm lock with a full arm straight
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.600]   because, you know, that's gone.
[01:33:42.600 --> 01:33:45.040]   I mean, you practice, you know,
[01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:46.480]   you practice escaping the arm lock
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:49.720]   when he takes your arm, you have, you know,
[01:33:49.720 --> 01:33:51.280]   you have a chance of trying to escape,
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:52.600]   but you don't practice.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.080]   You know, okay, take my arm.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:56.120]   When I say go, go, I mean, you got, you know,
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.760]   you pop the arm.
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.960]   That is like, you get injured doing that.
[01:33:59.960 --> 01:34:03.920]   Escaping the cross collar choke, it's,
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:06.720]   I mean, escape not letting the person get there.
[01:34:06.720 --> 01:34:09.320]   You can escape, you can practice escaping triangles
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:10.960]   because, you know, it's like,
[01:34:10.960 --> 01:34:14.360]   it's you have a way better chance of escaping triangle
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:17.960]   than, okay, mount on me, put both hands in my neck.
[01:34:17.960 --> 01:34:21.160]   I mean, it's over, you know, don't be there.
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:23.520]   - What's the best submission in Jiu Jitsu?
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:25.200]   - A choke, I would say.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:26.400]   - From which position?
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   If I gave you a billion dollars to start in a position
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:39.520]   like in a submission and you only get the billion,
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:41.760]   if you get the submission, which one would you start?
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.080]   - Cross collar choke on the mount.
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.600]   - Cross collar choke on the mount, not from the back.
[01:34:46.600 --> 01:34:49.360]   - No, you have a better chance escaping from the back.
[01:34:49.360 --> 01:34:51.760]   - Really? - Yeah.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:52.880]   - Even with the hooks?
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:53.720]   - Even with everything.
[01:34:53.720 --> 01:34:56.000]   - Do you think some people will disagree with you?
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:34:56.840]   - I don't care.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:58.560]   I have a better escape, I have a better chance
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:00.520]   escaping from the back than if you mount on me,
[01:35:00.520 --> 01:35:02.040]   put my hands on my neck.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.880]   - So, if you were facing yourself,
[01:35:04.880 --> 01:35:07.280]   and I would give you a billion dollars to escape,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:10.280]   you would pick?
[01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:11.560]   - From the back.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:13.080]   Thousand times over.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.560]   Like, no comparing.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:16.960]   - You have like, with hooks, with like a triangle?
[01:35:16.960 --> 01:35:19.320]   - It doesn't matter, you can do whatever you want.
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:20.280]   - Like a body triangle?
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:22.680]   Okay, okay.
[01:35:22.680 --> 01:35:24.880]   - Like a thousand times over, like no questions.
[01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:27.120]   - So, to you, the mount is a super controlling position,
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:28.200]   it's not just...
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.800]   - Because cross collar choke in the mount,
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:33.560]   the moment that you put both hands on my neck,
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:37.120]   your arms need to be very close to your body to attack.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:41.320]   So that means there's very little space between us.
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:45.040]   So that means there's very little space
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:47.080]   for you to work on your escape.
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:49.360]   And the moment that you cannot bridge,
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:51.760]   let's suppose I have, you know, the person has a good mount
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:53.880]   so you cannot bridge him off, what else?
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:57.960]   You don't have space to try to work on your defense.
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:36:01.520]   Being in the back, I have all the space around me
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:03.840]   to work on my defense, so my arms,
[01:36:03.840 --> 01:36:06.280]   I have the mobility to bring them anywhere.
[01:36:06.280 --> 01:36:10.280]   So I, because of that, it gives you and me
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.440]   a much better chance.
[01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:16.400]   And you cannot, I can move my body.
[01:36:16.400 --> 01:36:20.800]   If you're on my back, you cannot pin me.
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:22.680]   I cannot take you off my back,
[01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.400]   first I need to defend the choke,
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:27.560]   but you have no control over my body.
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.880]   So that means there's still a lot of movement
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:32.880]   that I can try to use to escape.
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:34.600]   In the mount, there's no movement.
[01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:36.800]   I'm pinned down, I cannot move,
[01:36:36.800 --> 01:36:39.880]   and I have no space between us to escape.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:42.680]   - Well, the argument against that, this is great,
[01:36:42.680 --> 01:36:47.680]   is that on the bottom of mount, I do have my hands between,
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:50.760]   so you're saying they're pinned, there's nothing.
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:51.600]   - Between where?
[01:36:51.600 --> 01:36:53.680]   - I mean, you could get them in theory,
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:56.120]   you could somehow, you could--
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:36:58.640]   - But there's no, you can, but then there's no space.
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.560]   They will be squeezed between our bodies.
[01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:03.120]   - If it's an incredible mount.
[01:37:03.120 --> 01:37:06.680]   - No, it's not mount, like how, standing.
[01:37:06.680 --> 01:37:08.320]   If I put both hands on your neck,
[01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:10.480]   if I'm gonna go for the cross collar choke,
[01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:12.640]   after I get my hands in, the next step
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:14.280]   is to pull you close to me.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:16.280]   So it's this, my arms needs to be close to me.
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.960]   - But I can put, there's the hands that could do something.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:23.680]   - They can come in, but they are very limited space
[01:37:23.680 --> 01:37:24.520]   between us.
[01:37:24.520 --> 01:37:26.160]   - Yes, yes, no, I mean to push your body away,
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.000]   to decrease the power of the choke.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.800]   - If we're standing, not if your back is against the floor.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:33.240]   - Okay, the argument against the mount,
[01:37:33.240 --> 01:37:35.480]   or the argument for back controls
[01:37:35.480 --> 01:37:37.120]   being the most dominant position,
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:38.600]   is even though I have hands,
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:41.440]   I can't really use them effectively, as effective.
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.020]   - Not in the mount.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:43.860]   There's no space.
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:44.680]   - In the mount, there's no space.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:45.800]   - There's no space.
[01:37:45.800 --> 01:37:48.680]   You can try, I mean, you can squeeze your hand in.
[01:37:48.680 --> 01:37:51.680]   I mean, there's still things that you could do,
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:53.160]   but they're so limited.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:58.160]   - So if you polled the 100 best competitors of all time,
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.720]   what do you think they would answer to that?
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:02.680]   Do you think most would agree with you?
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:05.240]   (laughing)
[01:38:05.240 --> 01:38:06.060]   - I don't care.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:13.680]   It will show me their skills, their ability to see.
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.160]   - Okay, so the perfect mount
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.840]   versus the perfect back control.
[01:38:16.840 --> 01:38:17.680]   - There's no question.
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:18.960]   - Okay, there's no question.
[01:38:18.960 --> 01:38:22.920]   - For me, I mean, argue with me, like show me,
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:25.840]   'cause I'm not being stubborn, because I'm being--
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.080]   - I'm scientific.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:31.600]   - Exactly, so explain it to me why the back,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:34.900]   it would be harder, it would be better to your position
[01:38:34.900 --> 01:38:36.040]   to finish than mount.
[01:38:36.040 --> 01:38:41.040]   If you can explain it to me why, I might change my mind.
[01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.920]   - I was trying to, but I don't have the cred.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:51.680]   I'm like a middle school science student
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:53.320]   trying to talk to Einstein here.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.640]   Okay, besides you, who do you think is the greatest
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:58.520]   jiu-jitsu competitor of all time?
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:02.760]   Can you make the case for some of them?
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:06.880]   Marcelo, Bucesha, Leandro Lowe?
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:08.640]   - I'll have to go with Bucesha,
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:11.240]   because look at how many titles he has.
[01:39:11.240 --> 01:39:15.120]   I mean, he has by far more than Marcelo.
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:16.480]   Marcelo stopped quite early.
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:21.280]   Leandro Lowe has eight, but Bucesha is better than him.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:23.880]   - What do you think makes Bucesha so good?
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:26.600]   - He's a heavyweight that moves like a lightweight.
[01:39:26.600 --> 01:39:30.200]   He moves very fast, but he's very agile for his size.
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:35.400]   - So the agility combined with aggression.
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.800]   - Yeah, so it's very hard to control him,
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:42.800]   because he moves fast, and he's 112 kilos,
[01:39:42.800 --> 01:39:46.440]   115 sometimes, or 110, I'm not sure,
[01:39:46.440 --> 01:39:50.640]   but he's about around that, so 240 in pounds.
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:55.240]   So when you're agile, 240 pounds,
[01:39:55.240 --> 01:39:57.960]   that makes it very hard to control you.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:40:00.040]   - What about making the case for some others?
[01:40:00.040 --> 01:40:00.960]   What about the little guys?
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:02.880]   What about Marcelo, if you were to make the case
[01:40:02.880 --> 01:40:04.200]   for him being the strongest?
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.920]   What makes Marcelo good?
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:08.080]   - Marcelo Garcia is extremely technical.
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:12.440]   I mean, I think he's one of my favorite jiu-jitsu fighters,
[01:40:12.440 --> 01:40:15.840]   because in a technical way,
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:18.360]   I think he's probably one of the best.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:21.040]   - 'Cause raw technique in a bunch of different positions,
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:21.880]   for submissions.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:25.600]   - He's not very powerful.
[01:40:25.600 --> 01:40:27.680]   Physically, he's not very strong,
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.720]   but he can make himself very strong,
[01:40:29.720 --> 01:40:32.080]   and his technique is very, very high level.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:34.120]   - Have you ever trained with him?
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:35.360]   - No, I fought him twice.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:37.640]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[01:40:37.640 --> 01:40:39.360]   - But he's much smaller than me.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:40.800]   - What happened in those matches?
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:44.200]   - The first fight, I tapped him, I think, five minutes.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:45.320]   - In which submission?
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:47.000]   - Choke from the back.
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.400]   Collar choke from the back.
[01:40:48.400 --> 01:40:51.120]   And the second time, I beat him by points,
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.720]   but a very large, I think 12-2.
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:40:59.200]   - Actually, just to continue,
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:03.640]   I wonder if John Donahue would agree with you
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:05.120]   about mountain back.
[01:41:05.120 --> 01:41:08.240]   I can't wait to, this is a bear versus lion conversation.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:10.840]   I'm looking, there's statistics about,
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:13.720]   I'm not letting this go.
[01:41:13.720 --> 01:41:15.280]   There's statistics about,
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.880]   oh, look at that, Hodger.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.800]   What do you know, looking at Hodger Gracie's statistics
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:24.760]   for most successful submissions,
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:27.720]   choke from the back is the most.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.240]   So how do you explain that, Mr. Scientist?
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:32.640]   - Because people panic when I'm out.
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:34.760]   They turn their back, I choked them out.
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.480]   - That's one explanation.
[01:41:36.480 --> 01:41:38.600]   But for people, it is interesting that,
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:39.880]   of course, this doesn't capture,
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:42.520]   but this captures a lot of your major matches,
[01:41:42.520 --> 01:41:44.640]   and we should say that you've submitted
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:45.800]   most of your opponents,
[01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:47.360]   so you rarely win on points.
[01:41:47.360 --> 01:41:49.520]   You usually win submissions.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:52.400]   Choke from back is most of them,
[01:41:52.400 --> 01:41:54.080]   then cross choke from mount.
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:55.440]   Arm bar is a lot, too.
[01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:59.160]   So 18 from choke from back, 12 cross choke,
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:03.600]   10 arm bar, five RNC rear naked is for no gi.
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:07.600]   - So in 2000, Ezekiel's very powerful.
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:09.880]   I choke, he's a strong weapon.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.320]   - Yeah, also from mount.
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:12.280]   - Also from mount.
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:15.960]   - Oh, that's when you can't get the one hand in.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:20.160]   - No, because the Ezekiel most times I use against people
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:25.160]   is the attack that as soon as I get to the mount,
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.440]   when they're trying to escape, they open up,
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:28.480]   and I get them.
[01:42:28.480 --> 01:42:31.840]   It has to be at that initial timing.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.120]   - So it's not a thing you use to bother them
[01:42:34.120 --> 01:42:34.960]   in order to create--
[01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:36.800]   - Either I get it right away,
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:39.520]   or I don't bother trying much.
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:42.680]   Because you need to keep one hand behind the head,
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:46.040]   and you're naturally on that position
[01:42:46.040 --> 01:42:48.240]   as soon as you mount, most of the times.
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:50.440]   And the moment that you mount someone,
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:51.760]   no one accept that they go mount,
[01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:53.160]   and they're gonna explode to get out.
[01:42:53.160 --> 01:42:57.480]   So holding the head, it gives you a better way
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:01.840]   to dominate them initially, to deal with that explosiveness
[01:43:01.840 --> 01:43:04.760]   on the initial, on the beginning.
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:07.240]   And then, but then you have to let go to try it.
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:09.080]   You're very limited holding the head.
[01:43:10.520 --> 01:43:13.480]   - In terms of goats, Shonji,
[01:43:13.480 --> 01:43:17.640]   I feel like he doesn't get enough credit that he deserves.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.760]   He had an extremely dominant performance in competition.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:23.080]   What about Salo and Shonji Hibero?
[01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.520]   What are your thoughts about what makes them so good?
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:29.080]   He had a bunch of tough matches with Shonji and Salo.
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:29.920]   - Eight times.
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:33.120]   Yeah, I fought eight times, Shonda.
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:34.480]   I fought Salo once.
[01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.600]   (laughing)
[01:43:39.600 --> 01:43:41.480]   I think I'm bringing up a sore point.
[01:43:41.480 --> 01:43:47.720]   Oh, did Shonji tap when you, or did the time run out?
[01:43:47.720 --> 01:43:50.960]   And that was the last time you guys faced each other?
[01:43:50.960 --> 01:43:52.400]   - Yeah, 2008.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.440]   - That was incredible to watch also.
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:59.720]   I think you pulled guard with one minute left,
[01:43:59.720 --> 01:44:01.680]   working towards attacking.
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.440]   I mean, it's probably very tough to get anything.
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:08.000]   And for people who don't know, time ran out,
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.320]   you had something that looked like an arm lock,
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:15.680]   and Shonji looked like he may be tapping,
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:18.120]   but it looked like he might be just celebrating,
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:18.960]   which is most likely.
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.800]   - I'm not sure.
[01:44:19.800 --> 01:44:27.920]   I'm not sure because I think his arm was just,
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:30.360]   just straight his arm, time finish.
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:33.920]   So I'm not sure if he was tapping to let go,
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.240]   time's up, or because of the outside,
[01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:40.640]   most likely the time was up.
[01:44:40.640 --> 01:44:42.480]   - Yeah, and also there's a thing where you start,
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:45.040]   you realize there's only three, two seconds left,
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.080]   so you just kind of start celebrating.
[01:44:47.080 --> 01:44:49.800]   You realize that Hadji's not gonna be able
[01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:52.560]   to finish this arm bar in the time left,
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:53.880]   so you start celebrating.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.720]   - No, I think he tapped to say the time is up.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:57.880]   - The time is up.
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.520]   Anyway, what do you think,
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:03.800]   the longevity especially is impressive with Shonji.
[01:45:03.800 --> 01:45:07.920]   - I think he doesn't get credit as much as he deserves
[01:45:07.920 --> 01:45:11.320]   because he pushed his career very far,
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:14.880]   and the last few years he was on his best.
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:20.520]   So he's, if he would have stopped before,
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:25.200]   people would remember him on his highest,
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:30.200]   but he kind of pushed more than his peak, let's say.
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:35.880]   - How hard is it for you to walk away?
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:38.560]   We'll talk about the journey into MMA as well,
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.560]   but you basically, especially with the second match
[01:45:41.560 --> 01:45:45.120]   against Boucher, she basically walked away on top,
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:50.040]   beating arguably the greatest competitor of all time,
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:53.240]   and just walking away.
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:56.000]   - It wasn't that hard to be honest
[01:45:56.000 --> 01:45:58.960]   because that was something that I was considering
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:03.280]   for a while because the last few years of my career,
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.440]   let's say, it was fighting MMA at the same time
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:11.280]   as fighting Jiu-Jitsu, and it's very challenging to do both.
[01:46:11.280 --> 01:46:15.280]   Like I don't, there's not another person who ever did that
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:18.120]   because the training is a confliction
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:19.840]   with the way you train.
[01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:23.720]   Everybody who start doing MMA, start focusing MMA,
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:26.400]   their Jiu-Jitsu gets worse
[01:46:26.400 --> 01:46:28.720]   because they stop training with the game.
[01:46:28.720 --> 01:46:30.880]   Everybody, no exception.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:33.560]   - Was your Jiu-Jitsu also getting worse?
[01:46:33.560 --> 01:46:37.240]   - No, because I made sure I kept training with the gi,
[01:46:37.240 --> 01:46:40.760]   and I kept fighting at least the world championship
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:41.960]   once a year.
[01:46:41.960 --> 01:46:42.800]   That was my goal.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:46.280]   I'm like, I'm gonna go for MMA, but I love Jiu-Jitsu
[01:46:46.280 --> 01:46:49.560]   and I still wanna fight the highest level.
[01:46:49.560 --> 01:46:53.080]   So I kept fighting once a year for a few years.
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:57.160]   It was a challenge, especially because the two
[01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.960]   or three times when I competed at the world's,
[01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:03.480]   it was right after a MMA fight I had.
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:07.720]   And no gi, you don't have the grips.
[01:47:07.720 --> 01:47:11.160]   So my grips, it made a big difference on my grips.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:13.520]   So I was weaker grip-wise.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:14.360]   So I felt that.
[01:47:14.360 --> 01:47:18.400]   So I knew it was like, it's unnecessary risk
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:20.480]   because I'm not, if I cannot be a hundred percent,
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.400]   so why am I doing this?
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:25.000]   But I'm stubborn, I love Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:28.960]   That's like, I love fighting Jiu-Jitsu.
[01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:30.360]   I never loved MMA.
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:33.520]   I've liked it, but I think if all grace, I wouldn't done it.
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:39.200]   - So the thing you felt the most is the grips.
[01:47:39.200 --> 01:47:40.040]   - Yeah.
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:46.360]   - 'Cause you win a gi world championship without gripping.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:47.480]   - No.
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:49.760]   - Like just pretending it's no gi match,
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:51.720]   they get to grip you, but you don't.
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:52.560]   - No.
[01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:53.400]   - So grips are essential.
[01:47:53.400 --> 01:47:54.240]   - Of course.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.200]   I mean, how can you choke someone?
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:57.440]   Like it's, if your grips are weak,
[01:47:57.440 --> 01:48:02.440]   your forearms will fatigue and then you will have no power
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:04.400]   and then you cannot do anything.
[01:48:04.400 --> 01:48:05.520]   - Yeah.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:07.840]   You could still arm lock and you could.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:10.920]   So I meant more not for the submission,
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:13.000]   but for the control of the game of it, the dance.
[01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:15.320]   - But you need to grip to get there.
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:16.800]   - To get there.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.680]   - And if your grips are weak.
[01:48:18.680 --> 01:48:20.640]   - But you also have grips in no gi.
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:22.040]   Can't you use those grips?
[01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:22.880]   - No.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.960]   - It's a thought experiment.
[01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:26.080]   So like I'm trying to understand how essential.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:30.000]   - When I get a no gi guy go far with the gi, they panic.
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:30.840]   - They panic?
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:31.680]   - Of course.
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:32.520]   - Everyone panics.
[01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.600]   A bear panics when they're in the water with a shark,
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:36.840]   but that doesn't mean the bear can still win
[01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:39.360]   when it stops panicking and relaxes.
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:40.520]   - It's not possible.
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:41.840]   - That's another discussion.
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.760]   - Can a bear beat a shark in the water?
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:48.560]   - Actually, I need to, maybe a polar bear,
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:49.800]   'cause they're pretty good at swimming.
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:50.640]   Okay.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:53.400]   - I say not possible for the no gi guy to win.
[01:48:53.400 --> 01:48:55.360]   But the bears is a further discussion.
[01:48:55.360 --> 01:48:58.160]   What was to you the biggest difference
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:49:02.200]   between mixed martial arts and jiu-jitsu?
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:03.600]   What are some interesting differences,
[01:49:03.600 --> 01:49:04.880]   some interesting insights,
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:07.320]   even just about the grappling within both sports?
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:13.080]   - So the biggest difference for me between MMA and jiu-jitsu
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.960]   is first is the speed.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:18.400]   Like jiu-jitsu, you know, like a 10-minute match,
[01:49:18.400 --> 01:49:19.920]   I can take my time.
[01:49:19.920 --> 01:49:24.000]   There's no dangers that forces me to move fast.
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:29.240]   MMA, you have to be 100% sharp and fast
[01:49:29.240 --> 01:49:32.440]   from first, second of the fight,
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.280]   because punches are coming,
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:35.080]   you can get knocked out any time.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:37.560]   One mistake, you're out.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.240]   Jiu-jitsu, you don't have that.
[01:49:39.240 --> 01:49:42.320]   Like it's, I don't have to worry about quick submission,
[01:49:42.320 --> 01:49:45.720]   because it's all about the way my body's positioned,
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:46.560]   you know, my grips.
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:49.000]   It's easy to avoid, it's easier to see it coming.
[01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.320]   Like it's like a quick submission, a surprise,
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:55.760]   it only works if you make a mistake,
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:59.000]   if you're not correct position.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.480]   Otherwise, it's impossible.
[01:50:00.480 --> 01:50:02.280]   It's extremely difficult.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.040]   MMA is not.
[01:50:04.040 --> 01:50:07.800]   I mean, one split-second mistake,
[01:50:07.800 --> 01:50:12.240]   and when the person comes, you have to respond.
[01:50:12.240 --> 01:50:14.280]   You have to match his pace.
[01:50:14.280 --> 01:50:15.600]   I mean, you can slow down,
[01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:17.880]   but it's like you're forced to respond.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:22.880]   So it's a much faster, it's a lot more physical, a lot more.
[01:50:22.880 --> 01:50:28.000]   And you need to be physical, much better conditioning,
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.640]   faster, it's explosiveness, it's much harder.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:35.520]   - Is it possible in MMA to calm things down?
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:37.840]   - If they change the rules, yeah.
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:38.960]   Five minute rules, no.
[01:50:38.960 --> 01:50:41.800]   - Ah, I see.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.440]   So like, I just meant actually technically speaking,
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:48.600]   is there ways to take an opponent
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.120]   that's being exceptionally aggressive?
[01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:51.960]   - You can, clinch.
[01:50:51.960 --> 01:50:54.520]   But then he takes you down, he keeps moving.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.680]   Something is hard to control that pace.
[01:50:57.680 --> 01:51:03.360]   You can, if you play defense, you save more energy
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:06.280]   than if you try to be the aggressor and respond.
[01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:08.040]   - And even getting to the clinch is very difficult.
[01:51:08.040 --> 01:51:11.520]   - Yeah, you have no way to hold yourself there.
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:13.520]   So that was the biggest challenge for me in MMA,
[01:51:13.520 --> 01:51:17.720]   is the speed, 'cause I'm a very slow start fighter.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:20.200]   If you look at my matches, I start very slow.
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:24.200]   Because if I go hard, I fatigue faster.
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:29.200]   So for me, that was the hardest part, is to start fast.
[01:51:29.200 --> 01:51:31.120]   - What about on the ground?
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:34.200]   Is there something different, more challenging
[01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:35.280]   on the ground?
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:36.640]   - Being in the bottom, yes.
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:38.640]   There's punches, punch coming.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.320]   - How fundamentally different is Jiu-Jitsu
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:41.160]   with punches on the ground?
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:44.080]   - It changes everything, everything.
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:45.320]   - Which parts?
[01:51:45.320 --> 01:51:48.640]   - The distance that you allow your opponent to be on you,
[01:51:48.640 --> 01:51:50.880]   the techniques that you choose to apply.
[01:51:50.880 --> 01:51:57.520]   You have to, your body has to be aware of the punches,
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:01.440]   and you are a lot more limited on your attacks.
[01:52:01.440 --> 01:52:03.280]   - So you're known for your closed guards.
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:05.320]   How does your closed guard have to adjust?
[01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:07.920]   How does the positioning of your hands have to adjust
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:09.400]   when you're on the bottom of closed guard?
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:12.360]   - So in the guard, especially in the closed guard,
[01:52:12.360 --> 01:52:15.760]   you have to either keep the person very close to you,
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:18.000]   or you have to kick him away.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.640]   In the guard, it's either I'm hugging you,
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:22.120]   or get away from me.
[01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:24.160]   - And in Jiu-Jitsu, you're allowed to have a middle?
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.800]   - Yeah, in Jiu-Jitsu, there's a lot,
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:27.560]   you can allow the person to be.
[01:52:27.560 --> 01:52:33.480]   - What about getting arm lock or triangle submissions
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.040]   from the guard?
[01:52:35.040 --> 01:52:37.580]   Is that fundamentally different?
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:40.880]   Because you don't have the middle game?
[01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:41.920]   - It's much harder.
[01:52:41.920 --> 01:52:47.200]   There's barely no open guard in MMA, very little.
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:52.200]   Because open guard, there's a distance between you and him.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:55.080]   There's a distance you cannot control.
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:52:57.080]   It's much harder to control that punch coming.
[01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:01.720]   And I have to position myself a way to block that,
[01:53:01.720 --> 01:53:04.400]   and it limited my attacks, my options of attacks.
[01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:07.440]   - Is there a reason, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:09.920]   but I don't think you do open guard much
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:12.360]   in Jiu-Jitsu and No Gi.
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:14.320]   Is there a reason for that?
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:19.320]   - It's harder with explosive person,
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:22.400]   because when they're moving fast,
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:24.120]   then you have to try to slow them down.
[01:53:24.120 --> 01:53:26.240]   - So you like guards that allow you to control the person?
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:27.080]   - Yeah.
[01:53:27.080 --> 01:53:29.920]   - And closed guard is the ultimate control?
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:30.760]   - Yeah.
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.680]   It's not ultimate control,
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:34.280]   but closed guard puts you in a position
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:36.840]   that I'm attacking and you're defending.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:38.960]   You cannot attack me from my closed guard.
[01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:43.160]   We can argue that there might be one or two attacks,
[01:53:43.160 --> 01:53:46.440]   but it's like very, very, very limited,
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:49.400]   and depends who you're fighting against.
[01:53:49.400 --> 01:53:52.200]   - I hate the closed guard.
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:55.200]   Being on top against a good closed guard is very--
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:56.760]   - No one likes, it's terrible.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:57.600]   - It's horrible.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:53:59.000]   - It's one-sided.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:01.040]   So you're in the guard and it's one-sided.
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:02.880]   The person in the bottom has the advantage.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:05.880]   I can be completely relaxed in my closed guard,
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:07.480]   and I cannot be completely relaxed.
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:09.200]   - You know what the most annoying thing is?
[01:54:09.200 --> 01:54:10.760]   Is somebody who is both good
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.080]   and extremely confident with a closed guard,
[01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:16.080]   'cause they have that smug energy about them.
[01:54:16.080 --> 01:54:17.800]   They know how much unpleasant,
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:20.240]   how much work it takes to pass this.
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:24.200]   Anyway, especially people with longer legs.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:28.720]   Is there something you wish you did differently
[01:54:28.720 --> 01:54:31.040]   in how you started training in MMA,
[01:54:31.040 --> 01:54:34.520]   in that trajectory, in figuring out how to train,
[01:54:34.520 --> 01:54:35.960]   how to get good?
[01:54:35.960 --> 01:54:39.320]   Like what have you learned about getting good at MMA
[01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:42.720]   from having done it, if you were to start now, for example?
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:46.320]   - I think I would have to dedicate it more.
[01:54:46.320 --> 01:54:48.360]   I didn't dedicate enough.
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:51.160]   - Both like literally time, number of training sessions--
[01:54:51.160 --> 01:54:52.520]   - Training, yeah. - But also mental--
[01:54:52.520 --> 01:54:53.920]   - Training-wise, physical.
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:56.360]   I think a lot more the physical part of it.
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:54:57.200]   - The strikes, everything?
[01:54:57.200 --> 01:54:58.840]   - The strike from the beginning.
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:03.720]   It's because, I mean, I love jujitsu.
[01:55:03.720 --> 01:55:07.480]   Like I truly love all the aspects of it,
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:11.960]   fighting, training, the practice, the competition.
[01:55:11.960 --> 01:55:13.760]   I don't have that for MMA.
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:16.080]   So it's hard to give your heart to it,
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.320]   something that you don't have the passion to it.
[01:55:18.320 --> 01:55:21.920]   Like jujitsu, I gave my heart to it.
[01:55:21.920 --> 01:55:24.360]   Like I did everything that I had to.
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:27.040]   MMA, I didn't do that.
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:29.400]   So that's why it was,
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:34.600]   I won't say it was wrong for me to do it
[01:55:34.600 --> 01:55:36.680]   because I don't regret doing it.
[01:55:36.680 --> 01:55:40.120]   I always, looking back as a kid,
[01:55:40.120 --> 01:55:44.760]   when I decided to take jujitsu for life,
[01:55:44.760 --> 01:55:49.200]   I already knew that some point I would have to do MMA.
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:51.960]   There's almost like that's the path of a Gracie.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:55.360]   When you're ready, you go do MMA.
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:57.800]   So-- - So there was like
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:55:59.320]   a duty versus a love. - There was no choice.
[01:55:59.320 --> 01:56:01.120]   Yeah, there was not a choice.
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:03.040]   There was like I have to.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:06.200]   It's just the life I took, it will lead that way.
[01:56:06.200 --> 01:56:09.920]   - Are you proud of that step?
[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:13.440]   You know, go against the natural love and towards more duty?
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:20.160]   - I think I don't regret it because if I hadn't done it,
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:23.880]   I would feel there was something missing.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:28.280]   So I don't regret doing, I would regret not doing.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:30.160]   (chuckles)
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:33.560]   - The tricky thing is the choice to go to MMA
[01:56:33.560 --> 01:56:36.040]   could have compromised your ability
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:39.560]   to win against Bouchescu and it didn't.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:44.000]   And it's a fascinating case study.
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.760]   It still doesn't make sense to me
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:48.320]   that after all those years, you're able to come back
[01:56:48.320 --> 01:56:51.640]   and go against the best person in the world and beat him.
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:56.640]   - Yeah, and I had to because the first fight we had,
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:59.760]   I had something stuck in my throat for a long time.
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:03.400]   - So you think about that.
[01:57:03.400 --> 01:57:08.400]   - Oh yeah, I'm like as soon as that first fight finished,
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:11.400]   I had said that got stuck in my throat
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.640]   that I already at that point I knew
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:15.480]   I'm gonna have to fight him again.
[01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:17.760]   I knew, I always knew.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:20.760]   'Cause there's no choice, I have to.
[01:57:20.760 --> 01:57:25.760]   - Oh man, all right, well, in terms of Nogi,
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:29.400]   who do you think is the best Nogi competitor of all time?
[01:57:29.400 --> 01:57:31.400]   - There's no question, it's Gordon.
[01:57:31.400 --> 01:57:37.320]   I don't think it's right to say the best competitor
[01:57:37.320 --> 01:57:39.400]   of all time 'cause he's still very young.
[01:57:39.400 --> 01:57:41.160]   I think that's something that he can be angry
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:43.360]   in the end of when the person--
[01:57:43.360 --> 01:57:44.760]   - You don't want him to get lazy.
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:45.600]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:57:45.600 --> 01:57:47.440]   - No, no, I mean, but you cannot praise someone
[01:57:47.440 --> 01:57:49.240]   in the middle of his career.
[01:57:49.240 --> 01:57:54.240]   So you cannot call him the best ever, he's 26 or 27.
[01:57:54.520 --> 01:57:58.000]   So it's, I mean, he's great, he's very good.
[01:57:58.000 --> 01:58:02.960]   He's ahead of all of other competitors, I think.
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:06.680]   And I mean, he's having an amazing career,
[01:58:06.680 --> 01:58:08.720]   he's doing amazingly well.
[01:58:08.720 --> 01:58:10.960]   So I mean, when he's, when he finished,
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:15.080]   when he finally retired, then you can argue like--
[01:58:15.080 --> 01:58:17.160]   - You know what, there's wisdom in that.
[01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:19.840]   It matters how you finish, right?
[01:58:19.840 --> 01:58:20.680]   - Of course.
[01:58:20.680 --> 01:58:21.840]   - It's very interesting.
[01:58:23.560 --> 01:58:28.560]   - I think that Nogi is relative new, that Nogi scene.
[01:58:28.560 --> 01:58:31.400]   There was not, there wasn't a scene before.
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:35.240]   I think he started now on his generation, you know,
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:39.080]   his time 'cause before, like when I was competing,
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:41.680]   Nogi was just ADCC, there's nothing else.
[01:58:41.680 --> 01:58:45.640]   Every two years, first was only in the Emirates.
[01:58:45.640 --> 01:58:48.600]   You know, you had to go there to compete.
[01:58:48.600 --> 01:58:49.960]   So there was not even a scene.
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.000]   There was like this one tournament
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:55.640]   that gives a lot of money to, you know,
[01:58:55.640 --> 01:58:58.200]   to competitors, to fighters,
[01:58:58.200 --> 01:59:01.200]   and brings fighters from other modalities, you know,
[01:59:01.200 --> 01:59:06.200]   to Marker, Van Narsdale, you know, some wrestlers,
[01:59:06.200 --> 01:59:10.760]   Greg Coroman, you know, that can compete against each other.
[01:59:10.760 --> 01:59:14.360]   And they, you know, they create that set of rules,
[01:59:14.360 --> 01:59:16.440]   try not to favor anyone.
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:17.880]   So that was it.
[01:59:17.880 --> 01:59:21.560]   So you cannot be called the greatest Nogi of all time
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:25.480]   if you only have one tournament every two years.
[01:59:25.480 --> 01:59:28.040]   Only in Emirates, they have to be invited to.
[01:59:28.040 --> 01:59:32.440]   But I think now, you know, it grew a lot.
[01:59:32.440 --> 01:59:34.160]   Now we have so many different tournaments.
[01:59:34.160 --> 01:59:35.000]   Now we have a scene.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.880]   You have people that only train Nogi,
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:39.280]   they're fully dedicated to Nogi.
[01:59:39.280 --> 01:59:42.640]   And you have super fights, different tournaments.
[01:59:42.640 --> 01:59:46.280]   So now it's, you know, now it's professionally,
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:47.560]   you can do just Nogi now,
[01:59:47.560 --> 01:59:49.080]   which before was unheard of it
[01:59:49.080 --> 01:59:51.320]   because you have one or two tournaments.
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:54.360]   If you cannot be called a Nogi fighter,
[01:59:54.360 --> 01:59:58.480]   fighting once every two years, twice every two years.
[01:59:58.480 --> 02:00:01.320]   - Yeah, now there's entire systems
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:03.040]   that are optimized for Nogi
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:04.440]   that could be fundamentally different.
[02:00:04.440 --> 02:00:06.880]   Like, what do you think about the body lock?
[02:00:06.880 --> 02:00:09.240]   Like, this passing with the body lock,
[02:00:09.240 --> 02:00:11.840]   I don't know if you get an understanding of it.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:14.120]   - Yeah, I think it's okay.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:21.400]   It's a popular way to, what is it?
[02:00:21.400 --> 02:00:24.720]   Maybe to apply--
[02:00:24.720 --> 02:00:25.760]   - To stay tight.
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:26.600]   - To stay tight.
[02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:28.480]   - Very close to your opponent
[02:00:28.480 --> 02:00:31.520]   so he can't push great distance, he can push away.
[02:00:31.520 --> 02:00:35.920]   - But somehow it shuts down the hips as well.
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:36.880]   - Yeah.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:38.240]   - Makes it more difficult to defend.
[02:00:38.240 --> 02:00:40.160]   - Yeah, kind of trap your legs.
[02:00:40.160 --> 02:00:43.760]   Your back is stuck on against the floor.
[02:00:44.040 --> 02:00:49.040]   Are you scientifically curious about these new developments?
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:52.480]   Do you have answers in your head to them?
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:54.680]   - Most.
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:00:57.720]   - So body lock is one interesting one.
[02:00:57.720 --> 02:00:59.320]   Obviously foot locks is another.
[02:00:59.320 --> 02:01:00.720]   And that'll mean just the foot locks,
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:03.960]   but the whole control aspect of foot locks.
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:06.560]   That's interesting.
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:08.040]   And there's other interesting stuff.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:13.040]   John is really into the wrestling.
[02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:16.280]   Aspect, but not wrestling, wrestling,
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.840]   but wrestling everywhere.
[02:01:17.840 --> 02:01:19.940]   Jiu-Jitsu at all levels of the plane.
[02:01:19.940 --> 02:01:23.480]   That's very interesting 'cause obviously
[02:01:23.480 --> 02:01:26.000]   Jiu-Jitsu has not really been,
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:29.080]   unlike freestyle wrestling and so on,
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:32.160]   has not been a systematic, scientific,
[02:01:32.160 --> 02:01:34.000]   rigorous exploration of wrestling.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.400]   It's like you're on your feet and you're on the ground.
[02:01:36.400 --> 02:01:38.440]   Not in jiu-jitsu.
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:39.280]   There's a lot of interest.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.160]   - John is academic.
[02:01:40.160 --> 02:01:45.040]   He tried to, he knows numbers, mathematic, everything.
[02:01:45.040 --> 02:01:46.280]   - You kinda are too.
[02:01:46.280 --> 02:01:47.680]   - Yeah.
[02:01:47.680 --> 02:01:52.200]   No, I mean, I am.
[02:01:52.200 --> 02:01:54.600]   Because you have to understand what you're doing.
[02:01:54.600 --> 02:01:57.600]   There's a, everything, there's a step-by-step,
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:00.940]   like logistic, like details.
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:03.840]   Every single move, there's a reason for it.
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:05.600]   There's things around that happens.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.800]   The more you know, the better you are.
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:11.680]   The more knowledgeable, the competitor, whatever.
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:17.160]   So I think with the foot locks, with the nogi,
[02:02:17.160 --> 02:02:18.440]   like if you look back,
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:23.900]   if you think of, it used to be seen as a really bad thing
[02:02:23.900 --> 02:02:25.360]   to attack the foot.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:29.200]   It wasn't seen as a good option of attack.
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:30.480]   Mainly--
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.320]   - What is that, like,
[02:02:31.320 --> 02:02:33.680]   respectable gentlemen don't attack the leg or what?
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:36.040]   - No, because if you look back,
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:38.160]   the tournaments, when they were created,
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:41.360]   all the rules and everything else was to simulate
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:44.600]   a real fight with no punches, when I was having nogi.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:47.240]   I mean, if you ask, what is jiu-jitsu?
[02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:48.080]   Like, what are you trying,
[02:02:48.080 --> 02:02:50.000]   what's the main goal of jiu-jitsu?
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:51.160]   To dominate your opponent.
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.120]   What's the main goal of fighting?
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:55.440]   It's, we're fighting, it's, of course,
[02:02:55.440 --> 02:02:57.360]   submission is the ultimate goal.
[02:02:57.360 --> 02:03:02.840]   But before that, the main goal is to dominate you.
[02:03:02.840 --> 02:03:05.160]   Like, we're fighting, I have to dominate you.
[02:03:05.160 --> 02:03:06.760]   And then the submission comes.
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:12.400]   And foot locks, it's, I don't require any domination on you.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:16.440]   I don't need to be in a dominant position
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:17.760]   to attack your foot.
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:20.120]   And if I attack your foot,
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.560]   you're still free to knock me out.
[02:03:22.560 --> 02:03:24.080]   If your body goes down to my foot,
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:25.400]   I can still come close to you,
[02:03:25.400 --> 02:03:27.520]   I'll stand up and I'll punch you.
[02:03:27.520 --> 02:03:30.000]   So it's not a good position to be in a real fight.
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.760]   Yeah, to attack in the foot.
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:35.960]   I mean, how many times you've seen that going bad?
[02:03:35.960 --> 02:03:38.360]   That going bad in an MMA fight?
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:42.000]   I mean, of course you had some sort of success
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:42.880]   with the hukou.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:45.960]   It's no questions, but how many times went wrong?
[02:03:45.960 --> 02:03:48.000]   People were knocked out attacking the foot.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.720]   So you can't say it's the best position to be.
[02:03:50.720 --> 02:03:55.120]   It's okay to go, but it's a very high risky position to go.
[02:03:55.120 --> 02:03:57.080]   So that's why it's not in a real situation,
[02:03:57.080 --> 02:03:59.080]   it's not seen as a good thing.
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:00.680]   So when you translate that to jiu-jitsu,
[02:04:00.680 --> 02:04:03.200]   when attacking the foot, it's not seen as a good thing
[02:04:03.200 --> 02:04:07.040]   because when you reflect that to a real situation,
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:08.880]   it's not gonna go down well.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:13.520]   So it was always seen as a easy way out, easy cut.
[02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:15.200]   You're trying to do the easy path.
[02:04:15.200 --> 02:04:17.880]   You can't pass my guard, you can't dominate me,
[02:04:17.880 --> 02:04:20.120]   and then you're trying to attack my foot.
[02:04:20.120 --> 02:04:23.840]   That's why it was always seen as not as the best,
[02:04:23.840 --> 02:04:25.800]   a great submission, a way to win.
[02:04:25.800 --> 02:04:27.440]   - But the sad side effect of that
[02:04:27.440 --> 02:04:30.600]   is it was completely underdeveloped because of that.
[02:04:30.600 --> 02:04:33.280]   - Exactly, of course.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:35.640]   So people never really developed that.
[02:04:35.640 --> 02:04:38.640]   But now, the tournaments, the fighting,
[02:04:38.640 --> 02:04:41.400]   it got completely, not completely,
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:46.400]   but it's no longer seen as a simulation of the real thing.
[02:04:46.400 --> 02:04:49.200]   Now it's a sport.
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:50.880]   It's only seen as a sport.
[02:04:50.880 --> 02:04:52.400]   So now it doesn't matter.
[02:04:52.400 --> 02:04:54.640]   If you attack my foot, you cannot punch me.
[02:04:54.640 --> 02:04:57.680]   So why is it bad now to attack the foot?
[02:04:57.680 --> 02:04:59.480]   So it's not seen as a bad thing anymore.
[02:04:59.480 --> 02:05:03.800]   And now it got really developed.
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:07.400]   - I don't know, that's another bear versus shark question.
[02:05:07.400 --> 02:05:12.400]   But there is, in a street self-defense situation,
[02:05:12.400 --> 02:05:15.680]   it's possible to imagine where foot locks
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:17.480]   would be effective for Haile.
[02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:20.360]   But I guess if you invest 10,000 hours,
[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:24.280]   it's better to invest it in chokes.
[02:05:24.280 --> 02:05:25.120]   - Yeah, to dominate.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:28.720]   If I were fighting, it's way better for me
[02:05:28.720 --> 02:05:31.000]   to be on your side control, on the mount,
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:33.520]   where I can pin you, be completely safe,
[02:05:33.520 --> 02:05:36.440]   than to stay inside your legs, trying to attack your foot.
[02:05:36.440 --> 02:05:39.040]   - People would argue that there's a lot
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:41.440]   of very dominant controlling positions
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:43.080]   in the whole foot lock game, right?
[02:05:43.080 --> 02:05:45.240]   - It is, but it can go bad very quickly.
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:46.080]   - Yeah.
[02:05:46.080 --> 02:05:49.320]   - No, I mean, there's some great ways
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:51.840]   to control someone that he cannot escape,
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:54.240]   but it can go bad very quickly.
[02:05:54.240 --> 02:05:55.080]   That's the thing.
[02:05:57.160 --> 02:05:58.840]   - Well, even back control can go bad
[02:05:58.840 --> 02:06:01.000]   very quickly on the street.
[02:06:01.000 --> 02:06:02.560]   So mount, I don't know.
[02:06:02.560 --> 02:06:04.280]   Is mount a really good position?
[02:06:04.280 --> 02:06:06.080]   - But then there's no good position then.
[02:06:06.080 --> 02:06:08.000]   - There's no good position.
[02:06:08.000 --> 02:06:09.360]   There's no--
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:12.560]   - Every position, there's a risk, okay?
[02:06:12.560 --> 02:06:14.320]   Attacking the foot is a way higher risk
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:17.200]   than side control, mount, back.
[02:06:17.200 --> 02:06:20.560]   That's what I'm saying, the back is not the best way
[02:06:20.560 --> 02:06:23.880]   to pin someone, unless you're underneath me.
[02:06:25.560 --> 02:06:29.880]   Because if you try to rotate, I can sacrifice the back
[02:06:29.880 --> 02:06:32.800]   and just allow you to pin the mount.
[02:06:32.800 --> 02:06:34.400]   - Okay, there you go.
[02:06:34.400 --> 02:06:37.120]   Would you prefer mount or back mount
[02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.760]   where they're flattened?
[02:06:38.760 --> 02:06:39.600]   Like a--
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:41.480]   - Still mount.
[02:06:41.480 --> 02:06:44.520]   - Thought I'd get you.
[02:06:44.520 --> 02:06:49.680]   So yeah, going back to Gordon,
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:51.040]   what do you think makes that guy so good?
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:54.040]   We were just at ADCC, you get to see him
[02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:56.560]   historically dominate performance.
[02:06:56.560 --> 02:06:59.640]   - His dedication, the way he trains,
[02:06:59.640 --> 02:07:01.440]   and how much he trains.
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:04.240]   And of course, you have to add his mind,
[02:07:04.240 --> 02:07:08.880]   his belief to really try to be good, the best.
[02:07:08.880 --> 02:07:11.360]   So I don't know what his goals are,
[02:07:11.360 --> 02:07:13.880]   but I know he tries to be better than his opponents.
[02:07:13.880 --> 02:07:15.900]   So his beliefs are very strong.
[02:07:15.900 --> 02:07:20.440]   His dedication, he probably trains more than everybody else.
[02:07:22.400 --> 02:07:25.440]   I haven't seen firsthand it, but from what I hear
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:28.480]   interviews with him and everybody else training,
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:31.760]   the way everybody trains, trying to,
[02:07:31.760 --> 02:07:35.800]   from my little knowledge I have,
[02:07:35.800 --> 02:07:38.120]   I'll bet he trains more than everybody else.
[02:07:38.120 --> 02:07:41.240]   And most important, how he trains.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:46.840]   I kind of already knew, but when I heard John podcast
[02:07:46.840 --> 02:07:49.840]   with you the other day, John was explaining
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:52.240]   the preparation, the training for the ADCC,
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:56.320]   and that kind of gave me a very strong idea
[02:07:56.320 --> 02:07:58.800]   how they've been training all these years.
[02:07:58.800 --> 02:08:02.520]   So when we said, you have to work on your weakness,
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:07.440]   so you have no weakness, he trains a lot on his weakness,
[02:08:07.440 --> 02:08:10.560]   which not everyone does that.
[02:08:10.560 --> 02:08:15.560]   If you look, I'm not gonna name, but all the main schools,
[02:08:15.560 --> 02:08:19.120]   like very strong competitors, great competitors,
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:24.120]   super tough people, but super tough, not great.
[02:08:24.120 --> 02:08:27.200]   Because they train, they spar very hard,
[02:08:27.200 --> 02:08:29.080]   that makes them tough.
[02:08:29.080 --> 02:08:32.160]   If you wanna be good, you have to work on your weakness.
[02:08:32.160 --> 02:08:35.360]   Because when you spar, like we're saying,
[02:08:35.360 --> 02:08:38.200]   how many times you're gonna practice
[02:08:38.200 --> 02:08:41.680]   escaping a bad position, like a submission hold
[02:08:41.680 --> 02:08:45.160]   or a pinning position, side control, mount,
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:47.760]   it's very little the amount of time you get
[02:08:47.760 --> 02:08:50.920]   to spend on those positions if you don't start there.
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:55.560]   So that, he's very smart the way he trains.
[02:08:55.560 --> 02:08:57.280]   - And part of that is also cerebral,
[02:08:57.280 --> 02:08:59.240]   it's not just putting yourself in those positions,
[02:08:59.240 --> 02:09:02.360]   but talking through different ideas.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:06.280]   Like they talk, they like experiment,
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:10.240]   it's very like, at first glance,
[02:09:10.240 --> 02:09:12.400]   it's like philosophical almost.
[02:09:12.400 --> 02:09:14.520]   'Cause you're trying to create systems constantly,
[02:09:14.520 --> 02:09:15.920]   you're trying to understand how this fits
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:17.440]   into this big picture.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:22.440]   And then it goes back to what is fighting.
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:24.920]   He's fighting for dominance,
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:27.760]   he's fighting for the ultimate dominance positions,
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:30.080]   which is back and mount, there's no others.
[02:09:30.080 --> 02:09:31.760]   And from that you finish.
[02:09:31.760 --> 02:09:35.200]   So if you look back at his, over the years,
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:40.200]   of his past fights, before he used to mainly focus in legs,
[02:09:40.200 --> 02:09:44.200]   and over the past few years, now he's mainly focusing
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:47.360]   in finishing from the mountain back.
[02:09:47.360 --> 02:09:49.080]   That's when he became really good.
[02:09:49.080 --> 02:09:54.080]   - So part of that is Mr. John Donaher.
[02:09:54.080 --> 02:09:57.520]   What do you think, you've known John for a long time,
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:02.520]   what makes that guy interesting, special, and good?
[02:10:02.520 --> 02:10:04.240]   What have you learned about jiu-jitsu
[02:10:04.240 --> 02:10:06.120]   and life from John Donaher?
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:09.800]   - He's super smart, I mean eccentric,
[02:10:09.800 --> 02:10:12.480]   and he lives through jiu-jitsu.
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:16.920]   He's 24/7 thinking better ways to teach,
[02:10:16.920 --> 02:10:19.880]   how to make his competitors better.
[02:10:19.880 --> 02:10:22.640]   And that as a coach, when you have that dedication
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:25.240]   as a coach, that it makes the most difference
[02:10:25.240 --> 02:10:26.760]   of your athletes.
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:28.920]   Which other big team you have that coach
[02:10:28.920 --> 02:10:30.880]   with that motivation?
[02:10:30.880 --> 02:10:34.720]   All the other schools, it's either someone that competes,
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:37.560]   that push the training, like Andre Galvao.
[02:10:37.560 --> 02:10:39.200]   He's one of the competitors,
[02:10:39.200 --> 02:10:41.560]   so he brings the hype in everyone else.
[02:10:41.560 --> 02:10:44.080]   But he doesn't have the time,
[02:10:44.080 --> 02:10:46.400]   he doesn't spend the time working individually.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:48.120]   I mean, I'm sure he does, but it's limited
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:49.680]   because he's also a competitor.
[02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:54.520]   And looking most of the other big schools,
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:57.320]   you don't have that.
[02:10:57.320 --> 02:11:00.240]   Now all the leaders, the main coaches
[02:11:00.240 --> 02:11:03.520]   for the other big schools, they have other things
[02:11:03.520 --> 02:11:05.800]   in their lives, they don't fully dedicate it
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:06.880]   to the athletes.
[02:11:06.880 --> 02:11:07.720]   John does.
[02:11:07.720 --> 02:11:12.920]   Look at the interview, he spends hours and hours a day
[02:11:12.920 --> 02:11:17.120]   studying how can a way, the system,
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:18.720]   to make his athletes better.
[02:11:18.720 --> 02:11:21.320]   Look at the results.
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:23.760]   - I enjoy, I was just sending back and forth,
[02:11:23.760 --> 02:11:27.000]   you can actually just get him, you control him essentially
[02:11:27.000 --> 02:11:28.920]   by sending interesting videos and you could just
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:29.960]   see his mind.
[02:11:29.960 --> 02:11:33.040]   He's gonna do research on that.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:34.840]   'Cause I kept sending him videos of bears
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:39.840]   'cause he claimed that a lion would beat a bear
[02:11:40.200 --> 02:11:43.840]   because, I'd love to get your take on this, okay.
[02:11:43.840 --> 02:11:47.400]   So the bear is much bigger, much stronger.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:52.520]   But his take is that the bears don't have experience
[02:11:52.520 --> 02:11:54.600]   of fighting to the death, that's not part of the culture,
[02:11:54.600 --> 02:11:55.920]   they're more scared.
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:11:59.320]   In fact, he keeps sending me footage of even
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:02.040]   a small mountain lion scaring a bear away
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:04.040]   because they don't want to fight.
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:10.260]   So his idea is that it really matters your life experience,
[02:12:10.260 --> 02:12:13.660]   how much you fight, it's not necessarily the skill,
[02:12:13.660 --> 02:12:16.380]   like the dimensions, the characteristics you have.
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:19.620]   But then I send him, here I'll show you.
[02:12:19.620 --> 02:12:27.940]   People should Google this, it's bears fighting of any kind.
[02:12:27.940 --> 02:12:31.700]   It's pretty much the most epic thing ever.
[02:12:31.700 --> 02:12:33.780]   Here, I'll show you.
[02:12:34.700 --> 02:12:35.540]   Look at these guys.
[02:12:35.540 --> 02:12:37.060]   The cardio, though, is interesting.
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:39.060]   - You know, it's funny, I was gonna mention that
[02:12:39.060 --> 02:12:41.580]   'cause I was flipping through internet.
[02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:45.900]   I came around that video.
[02:12:45.900 --> 02:12:47.380]   - Look how big these guys are.
[02:12:47.380 --> 02:12:50.540]   - No, they're huge, but see, they don't bite each other.
[02:12:50.540 --> 02:12:51.380]   - You think it's just play?
[02:12:51.380 --> 02:12:52.900]   - They try to, no, intimidating,
[02:12:52.900 --> 02:12:54.620]   'cause they don't wanna get hurt.
[02:12:54.620 --> 02:12:56.580]   So they try to size each other up.
[02:12:56.580 --> 02:12:59.780]   You know, they'll see the whole fighting
[02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:01.540]   is sizing each other up.
[02:13:01.540 --> 02:13:05.140]   There's a lot of pushing, and the fur is so thick,
[02:13:05.140 --> 02:13:07.420]   so the claw doesn't really damage much.
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:11.620]   - They're using the tree, so maybe they, yeah.
[02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:15.180]   - I mean, there is bites, but see, there's very little.
[02:13:15.180 --> 02:13:20.980]   So the whole time, they're trying to intimidate the other one
[02:13:20.980 --> 02:13:24.580]   like winning the fight by their size.
[02:13:26.940 --> 02:13:31.780]   - And mostly about the way drunk college kids fight,
[02:13:31.780 --> 02:13:34.220]   which is like some kind of display of dominance
[02:13:34.220 --> 02:13:35.260]   versus actual--
[02:13:35.260 --> 02:13:37.580]   - Yeah, they're not fighting to kill.
[02:13:37.580 --> 02:13:42.900]   And bear or tiger, they fight to finish,
[02:13:42.900 --> 02:13:45.580]   unless the other one runs away, one will die.
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:48.020]   - Yeah, lions and tigers.
[02:13:48.020 --> 02:13:50.580]   Yeah, but look at the cardio.
[02:13:50.580 --> 02:13:52.300]   Look how bad their cardio is.
[02:13:52.300 --> 02:13:56.540]   I wonder how, my favorite part is when one of them
[02:13:56.540 --> 02:13:59.820]   just stands behind a tree and says, "All right."
[02:13:59.820 --> 02:14:00.660]   - He's holding.
[02:14:00.660 --> 02:14:02.900]   (laughing)
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:05.020]   - He's getting the breath.
[02:14:05.020 --> 02:14:05.860]   - Let me catch my breath.
[02:14:05.860 --> 02:14:06.820]   (laughing)
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:08.340]   - He sits down.
[02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:10.540]   He's like, "All right, you can't, it's over."
[02:14:10.540 --> 02:14:15.260]   It's like it's the equivalent in the forest,
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:17.700]   like tapping out, "All right, all right, you got me.
[02:14:17.700 --> 02:14:19.900]   Let me just catch my breath."
[02:14:19.900 --> 02:14:23.660]   Look, they're both just shot.
[02:14:25.460 --> 02:14:27.100]   (laughing)
[02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.500]   But see, the thing is that I was trying
[02:14:28.500 --> 02:14:32.060]   to make an argument for is that we get this rare footage.
[02:14:32.060 --> 02:14:33.960]   It's not rare, I mean, it was like hundreds of videos,
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.420]   but it's not millions of videos
[02:14:35.420 --> 02:14:37.300]   'cause there's a huge number of bears.
[02:14:37.300 --> 02:14:39.300]   And I was trying to say that there's some badass bear
[02:14:39.300 --> 02:14:43.420]   we don't know about 'cause he just goes in there
[02:14:43.420 --> 02:14:44.940]   and just does work.
[02:14:44.940 --> 02:14:49.700]   And we just don't know about it 'cause he's like everyone.
[02:14:49.700 --> 02:14:52.380]   See, the thing is, if you kill a lot of other animals,
[02:14:52.380 --> 02:14:53.980]   you probably have a territory
[02:14:53.980 --> 02:14:55.080]   that nobody's gonna mess with you.
[02:14:55.080 --> 02:14:56.760]   So it's very hard to catch the,
[02:14:56.760 --> 02:15:02.020]   like the Haja Gracie of bears.
[02:15:02.020 --> 02:15:05.980]   He's just gonna be sitting there doing nothing.
[02:15:05.980 --> 02:15:07.620]   So I don't know.
[02:15:07.620 --> 02:15:10.340]   I don't know, I feel like, of course,
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:13.540]   when you corner him, John will say that if you put a bear
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:15.580]   in a line in a cage, the bear will win
[02:15:15.580 --> 02:15:20.580]   if they're forced to be to the death, but I don't know.
[02:15:20.580 --> 02:15:22.180]   Oh, let me ask you another ridiculous thing
[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:24.820]   before I ask you serious questions.
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:28.300]   So Joe Rogan thinks that a tie
[02:15:28.300 --> 02:15:33.060]   is an effective way to attack somebody.
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:35.700]   I don't know if, I can't believe I haven't,
[02:15:35.700 --> 02:15:38.140]   in the time in Vegas, I didn't talk to you about this.
[02:15:38.140 --> 02:15:39.260]   I think it's not.
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:40.580]   Have you ever explored this?
[02:15:40.580 --> 02:15:43.420]   It's the best choker in the world.
[02:15:43.420 --> 02:15:45.340]   Have you ever explored the use,
[02:15:45.340 --> 02:15:48.380]   'cause like Jiu-Jitsu has the jacket,
[02:15:48.380 --> 02:15:53.380]   but the tie, to me, is a pretty shitty way
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:54.520]   to choke somebody.
[02:15:54.520 --> 02:15:56.620]   Like intuitively, he thinks like it's a good way,
[02:15:56.620 --> 02:15:58.340]   but it can slide around.
[02:15:58.340 --> 02:16:03.340]   It feels like there's no way to really pin.
[02:16:03.340 --> 02:16:05.300]   - You would need to.
[02:16:05.300 --> 02:16:08.780]   - Right, so you use it the way you use a belt, essentially.
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:09.620]   Yeah, but then--
[02:16:09.620 --> 02:16:10.940]   - I would guess so.
[02:16:10.940 --> 02:16:11.780]   - Yeah.
[02:16:11.780 --> 02:16:16.340]   And I think if it gives you,
[02:16:16.340 --> 02:16:17.720]   it actually has the reverse effect,
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:20.940]   which it gives you the false sense of confidence
[02:16:20.940 --> 02:16:24.500]   that you can use it, and instead it'll just distract you.
[02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:27.540]   - So he think it's a stronger way than the collar?
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:28.380]   Or just a stronger--
[02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:29.200]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:16:29.200 --> 02:16:30.040]   - Stronger than the collar? - Stronger than the collar,
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:30.860]   yeah, yeah.
[02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:32.300]   - I don't see how.
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:33.140]   Maybe, just I can say.
[02:16:33.140 --> 02:16:35.300]   - Well, in a street fight scenario, right?
[02:16:35.300 --> 02:16:37.620]   - But by the time you grab the tie,
[02:16:37.620 --> 02:16:39.020]   the guy goes punch your nose.
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:39.860]   - Yeah.
[02:16:39.860 --> 02:16:44.380]   What George St. Pierre thinks is the best use of the tie
[02:16:44.380 --> 02:16:48.220]   is to actually, what do you call that?
[02:16:48.220 --> 02:16:50.180]   So basically to off-balance them,
[02:16:50.180 --> 02:16:52.500]   which is an interesting point, to push that down.
[02:16:52.500 --> 02:16:54.940]   - I mean, that can be used to, yeah.
[02:16:54.940 --> 02:16:57.680]   - Well, you could use the jacket for the same kind of thing.
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:16:58.520]   Yeah, I don't know.
[02:16:58.520 --> 02:16:59.660]   I haven't really fully tested it.
[02:16:59.660 --> 02:17:00.500]   It's up to--
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:02.820]   - I'll say jacket or tie, for that perspective
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:06.940]   of off-balancing the person, it can be, yeah.
[02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:09.340]   Because you have control of the person's neck.
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:11.940]   The collar, the jacket moves.
[02:17:11.940 --> 02:17:14.900]   So for the purpose of off-balancing the person,
[02:17:14.900 --> 02:17:16.860]   I would agree with George.
[02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:19.580]   - See, the thing is, that's the thing about martial arts,
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:21.380]   is you can say all kinds of bullshit,
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:24.580]   but until you really test it,
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:27.140]   in over a period of years,
[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:28.960]   the competition, you won't really know.
[02:17:28.960 --> 02:17:31.720]   I think that's where my gut says,
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:37.240]   just how easily the tie moves, my gut says the collar.
[02:17:37.240 --> 02:17:40.060]   There is something really powerful about the jacket.
[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:42.860]   There's the way it sits.
[02:17:42.860 --> 02:17:45.580]   I mean, the fact that the arms trap it from rotating.
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:48.460]   It's a weird piece of clothing.
[02:17:48.460 --> 02:17:50.220]   It's a really dangerous piece of clothing
[02:17:50.220 --> 02:17:51.340]   that we put on ourselves.
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:53.380]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:54.820]   - And it's kinda cool that we've developed
[02:17:54.820 --> 02:17:56.540]   this whole martial arts system that allows you
[02:17:56.540 --> 02:17:59.300]   to use that to do a lot of damage.
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:00.560]   It's very interesting.
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:02.780]   - So when we're saying something that you develop
[02:18:02.780 --> 02:18:05.460]   over the years or practice over and over again,
[02:18:05.460 --> 02:18:09.060]   going back to the efficiency of the mount or back,
[02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:12.040]   by experience of attacking people,
[02:18:12.040 --> 02:18:17.900]   people always had a much higher chance of escaping
[02:18:17.900 --> 02:18:19.700]   from the back than from my mount.
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:25.840]   So I feel if I mount and you get both my hands on your neck,
[02:18:25.840 --> 02:18:26.700]   you cannot escape.
[02:18:26.700 --> 02:18:29.340]   If my hands are deep, it's over.
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:33.020]   I don't remember anyone escaping,
[02:18:33.020 --> 02:18:36.480]   but I do remember if my hands are deep on your collar
[02:18:36.480 --> 02:18:39.260]   or even a real naked choke, it's still a hassle.
[02:18:39.260 --> 02:18:40.580]   Like, it's not clean.
[02:18:40.580 --> 02:18:42.460]   - You have some data on this.
[02:18:42.460 --> 02:18:46.260]   Is there some aspect to how your body is,
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:47.860]   the characteristics of your body,
[02:18:47.860 --> 02:18:50.860]   that fits a particular set of techniques?
[02:18:50.860 --> 02:18:52.860]   So if we just look at Jiu-Jitsu broadly,
[02:18:52.860 --> 02:18:56.940]   do you see most techniques being able to work
[02:18:56.940 --> 02:18:58.380]   for most people?
[02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:01.220]   Like, what you're saying about mount versus back control,
[02:19:01.220 --> 02:19:03.340]   is it possible for a different body type,
[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:04.840]   the mount is not as effective?
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.840]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:11.340]   I'll say very big people, they should mount.
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:13.420]   - You don't think of yourself as big?
[02:19:13.420 --> 02:19:15.060]   - No, big, I mean fat.
[02:19:15.060 --> 02:19:18.420]   They should stay off the mount.
[02:19:18.420 --> 02:19:19.260]   - Why is that?
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:20.080]   That's a connotation.
[02:19:20.080 --> 02:19:24.060]   - Mobility, it's like, I think that you don't see any,
[02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:27.020]   there was a few ways, like 160 kilo,
[02:19:27.020 --> 02:19:32.020]   like in pounds, I don't know, 270 pounds of a lot of fat.
[02:19:32.020 --> 02:19:36.740]   You need a bit of mobility,
[02:19:36.740 --> 02:19:41.460]   and that would play against you, even back.
[02:19:41.460 --> 02:19:43.980]   - A great mount requires mobility.
[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:47.180]   So even though it doesn't look like you're moving
[02:19:47.180 --> 02:19:48.820]   very much when you're doing mount,
[02:19:48.820 --> 02:19:50.400]   that requires mobility?
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.920]   'Cause you have to reposition and weight redistribution.
[02:19:52.920 --> 02:19:54.840]   - Constantly adjusting your body.
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:57.360]   - All right, the legend goes you got very good
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:19:59.840]   by training mostly with lower ranks.
[02:19:59.840 --> 02:20:02.240]   What was your training like in that environment?
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:07.200]   - So when I first moved to London, I was 20 years old.
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:13.320]   I opened my school there, and I had nobody to train with.
[02:20:13.320 --> 02:20:17.080]   I had one guy that was teaching with me
[02:20:17.080 --> 02:20:18.840]   a black belt, middleweight.
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:24.420]   He was good, and that's it.
[02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:27.080]   Braulio was, he moved to the same,
[02:20:27.080 --> 02:20:29.600]   he moved to England the same time as I did,
[02:20:29.600 --> 02:20:31.200]   but he was in Birmingham.
[02:20:31.200 --> 02:20:34.680]   So we did go together, maybe twice a week,
[02:20:34.680 --> 02:20:37.580]   close to when we were preparing for something.
[02:20:37.580 --> 02:20:40.320]   If not, then not very often.
[02:20:40.320 --> 02:20:44.400]   As often as we could, but let's say not that often.
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:47.200]   And I had just color belt students.
[02:20:47.200 --> 02:20:48.600]   There was no one high level,
[02:20:48.600 --> 02:20:51.240]   there was no one world champion in any belt to train.
[02:20:51.240 --> 02:20:57.080]   Then you need to create a scenario that simulates,
[02:20:57.080 --> 02:21:02.080]   that can simulate, like a realistic fighting.
[02:21:02.080 --> 02:21:07.400]   So I think on that aspect, when people said,
[02:21:07.400 --> 02:21:10.380]   people ask why do I have such a basic game?
[02:21:10.380 --> 02:21:14.200]   I think that also influenced me sharpen up all my skills
[02:21:14.200 --> 02:21:18.920]   when I moved there, because if you practice with people
[02:21:18.920 --> 02:21:22.200]   lower level than you, you cannot,
[02:21:22.200 --> 02:21:26.560]   there's nothing to learn from them.
[02:21:26.560 --> 02:21:28.880]   Or you can learn things and practice with them,
[02:21:28.880 --> 02:21:31.880]   but I would say very complex things on them,
[02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:33.040]   it is not the best.
[02:21:33.040 --> 02:21:36.160]   So I sharpen up all my skills.
[02:21:36.160 --> 02:21:39.280]   So that when I really improved everything
[02:21:39.280 --> 02:21:42.080]   that I already knew to a higher level.
[02:21:42.080 --> 02:21:43.720]   - But how can you sharpen something
[02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:46.680]   if the resistance is much lower level than--
[02:21:46.680 --> 02:21:48.560]   - A purple belt can make it very hard
[02:21:48.560 --> 02:21:49.880]   for you to escape side control.
[02:21:49.880 --> 02:21:52.640]   Doesn't have to be a world champion black belt.
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:55.520]   It's, you know, if it's, when it's holding you,
[02:21:55.520 --> 02:21:56.600]   it can be very hard.
[02:21:56.600 --> 02:21:57.880]   - What about on the attack?
[02:21:57.880 --> 02:22:02.240]   How do you become literally by far the best person
[02:22:02.240 --> 02:22:03.920]   at the cross choke from mount
[02:22:03.920 --> 02:22:05.420]   by training with purple belts?
[02:22:05.420 --> 02:22:08.040]   - It's sometimes purple belts
[02:22:08.040 --> 02:22:10.240]   defense way better than black belts.
[02:22:10.240 --> 02:22:12.440]   - Okay, see a lot of people listening to that
[02:22:12.440 --> 02:22:15.200]   would be like, that makes no sense, Hajo Gracie.
[02:22:15.200 --> 02:22:16.760]   How does that make any sense?
[02:22:16.760 --> 02:22:18.960]   - Because like a lot of the black belts,
[02:22:18.960 --> 02:22:20.960]   even world champion, they get to the black belt,
[02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:23.920]   they're really good in what they do.
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:25.880]   Let's say in the guard, you know,
[02:22:25.880 --> 02:22:29.400]   on top or the bottom position, but their defense are not.
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:32.520]   Like very, very few people, high level,
[02:22:32.520 --> 02:22:35.880]   have a very good defense because they don't practice.
[02:22:35.880 --> 02:22:38.440]   Then that goes back to how you train.
[02:22:38.440 --> 02:22:40.080]   You know, you can be very tough,
[02:22:40.080 --> 02:22:42.760]   very tough will make you terrible defense
[02:22:42.760 --> 02:22:45.320]   because you're not gonna practice your weakness.
[02:22:45.320 --> 02:22:47.680]   So your weakness still gonna be terrible.
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:49.520]   You're gonna have the best guard in the world,
[02:22:49.520 --> 02:22:51.200]   impossible to pass.
[02:22:51.200 --> 02:22:54.000]   The day people pass your guard, you're nothing.
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:58.640]   Like it's, your guard is high, the highest level,
[02:22:58.640 --> 02:23:00.960]   but your side control defense are not.
[02:23:00.960 --> 02:23:02.360]   Your mount defense are not.
[02:23:02.360 --> 02:23:06.800]   So some purple belts, they practice this, you know,
[02:23:06.800 --> 02:23:09.480]   the mount way more than the black belt did.
[02:23:09.480 --> 02:23:11.640]   So naturally, their defense is better.
[02:23:11.640 --> 02:23:14.240]   - So they get to experience the defensive position
[02:23:14.240 --> 02:23:16.680]   much, much, much more, and especially training with you,
[02:23:16.680 --> 02:23:19.200]   they get really good at defending.
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:20.360]   And then-- - Over and over again,
[02:23:20.360 --> 02:23:22.400]   you attack them with the same thing over and over again,
[02:23:22.400 --> 02:23:24.360]   they know what's coming, they will block.
[02:23:24.360 --> 02:23:26.600]   They will develop a defense over that.
[02:23:26.600 --> 02:23:27.560]   - Yeah.
[02:23:27.560 --> 02:23:30.960]   - Way better than most other high level black belts.
[02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:33.600]   - So both put yourself into really bad positions
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:36.640]   with low ranks and just keep attacking the same way
[02:23:36.640 --> 02:23:37.800]   over and over and over.
[02:23:38.960 --> 02:23:42.480]   - Yeah, and with that, you're able to be
[02:23:42.480 --> 02:23:45.760]   at the top of the world, at the world championships.
[02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:47.200]   - Yeah.
[02:23:47.200 --> 02:23:48.800]   - I mean, can you give some,
[02:23:48.800 --> 02:23:51.560]   what was the preparation like to a world championship
[02:23:51.560 --> 02:23:52.480]   with lower ranks?
[02:23:52.480 --> 02:23:53.960]   I mean--
[02:23:53.960 --> 02:23:57.600]   - I did a lot of boxing, a lot of conditioning.
[02:23:57.600 --> 02:23:59.600]   No, but-- - Conditioning is a big part of it.
[02:23:59.600 --> 02:24:02.880]   - But the one thing that helped me extremely
[02:24:02.880 --> 02:24:06.800]   living in England, in London, was training judo
[02:24:06.800 --> 02:24:08.720]   at the Budo Koi in London.
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:13.040]   That helped me massively because it gave me the motivation
[02:24:13.040 --> 02:24:18.040]   to learn something new because by then at the Budo Koi,
[02:24:18.040 --> 02:24:22.040]   the standup was, I'm sure today it is too,
[02:24:22.040 --> 02:24:24.640]   but by then was even higher than it is today.
[02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:28.520]   Like there was some very high level judo guys training there
[02:24:28.520 --> 02:24:31.280]   and the first time I went there,
[02:24:31.280 --> 02:24:34.960]   my standup was terrible compared to theirs.
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:38.120]   I mean, it was bad, but compared to them, it was terrible.
[02:24:38.120 --> 02:24:40.080]   So I was getting through like a child.
[02:24:40.080 --> 02:24:46.160]   And that motivate me to keep coming back and get better.
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:49.720]   So that made my jujitsu much stronger.
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:54.000]   I became, my base got better, my top game improved,
[02:24:54.000 --> 02:24:55.680]   my pressure game improved.
[02:24:55.680 --> 02:24:58.640]   - Does Neil Adams train?
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:24:59.480]   - Ray Stevens.
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:00.320]   - Ray Stevens.
[02:25:00.320 --> 02:25:01.920]   - No, I've never met Neil Adams.
[02:25:01.920 --> 02:25:04.080]   - Have you met Neil Adams?
[02:25:04.080 --> 02:25:06.040]   He's the voice of judo, I don't know if you watched
[02:25:06.040 --> 02:25:07.960]   the tournaments, he's incredible.
[02:25:07.960 --> 02:25:12.680]   - Yeah, Ray Stevens is a silver medalist in the Olympics.
[02:25:12.680 --> 02:25:14.760]   He won European, he won a lot.
[02:25:14.760 --> 02:25:15.840]   - So you did some judo training.
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:18.200]   What's your favorite throw, like a Soto?
[02:25:18.200 --> 02:25:20.600]   - Uchimata, I would say, if I would pick one.
[02:25:20.600 --> 02:25:22.400]   - So that made you better at jujitsu as well?
[02:25:22.400 --> 02:25:23.240]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:25:23.240 --> 02:25:27.800]   And back then, like for the first,
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.080]   I would say maybe three years, maybe four,
[02:25:31.080 --> 02:25:33.880]   I went to Brazil for like two months before
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:35.600]   every major tournament.
[02:25:35.600 --> 02:25:37.520]   So I say, you know, I moved away from the school
[02:25:37.520 --> 02:25:40.800]   and I really focused, I was really well prepared
[02:25:40.800 --> 02:25:42.200]   with my judo and everything else,
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:45.680]   sharpen up my skills and then went to Brazil
[02:25:45.680 --> 02:25:48.560]   to train with like really high level people.
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:53.040]   So that way I would manage to compete in the highest level.
[02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:55.360]   - What advice would you give to,
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:58.040]   let's start with a complete beginner.
[02:25:58.040 --> 02:26:01.560]   So, you know, a bunch of people come up to me,
[02:26:01.560 --> 02:26:03.080]   they still wanna start doing jujitsu.
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:05.640]   What advice would you give them?
[02:26:07.080 --> 02:26:09.600]   - Try to absorb as much technique as you can
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:12.320]   and try to be as relaxed as you can.
[02:26:12.320 --> 02:26:18.120]   Don't, you know, don't desperately try to fight so hard.
[02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:23.160]   Like learn and move slow.
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:26.360]   - Move slow and relax.
[02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:27.960]   - That's the hardest thing to do.
[02:26:27.960 --> 02:26:28.800]   (laughs)
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:30.280]   The hardest.
[02:26:30.280 --> 02:26:32.560]   - You know what I find with people,
[02:26:32.560 --> 02:26:35.120]   it seems like it's hard to even know
[02:26:35.120 --> 02:26:36.520]   that you're not relaxed.
[02:26:36.520 --> 02:26:38.760]   It's like the introspection.
[02:26:38.760 --> 02:26:42.440]   They don't even know what it feels like to relax.
[02:26:42.440 --> 02:26:44.000]   - Not even know they tense.
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:44.840]   - Yeah, right.
[02:26:44.840 --> 02:26:46.200]   - They try to relax, look at you say,
[02:26:46.200 --> 02:26:47.680]   "What, what do you mean relax?
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:48.520]   I'm relaxed."
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:49.880]   - Exactly, exactly.
[02:26:49.880 --> 02:26:50.960]   - The arms are shaking.
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:52.320]   (laughs)
[02:26:52.320 --> 02:26:53.400]   - You feel it.
[02:26:53.400 --> 02:26:54.920]   And in terms of going slow, they're like,
[02:26:54.920 --> 02:26:56.160]   "Yeah, I'm going slow."
[02:26:56.160 --> 02:26:57.320]   No, you're not.
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:26:58.160]   - Yeah.
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:02.280]   - Yeah, there's a grace and elegance of movement
[02:27:02.280 --> 02:27:05.920]   that you can probably pick up from a lot of other disciplines
[02:27:05.920 --> 02:27:08.600]   like for me, I think that came from just learning piano
[02:27:08.600 --> 02:27:09.440]   at a young age.
[02:27:09.440 --> 02:27:13.360]   It's for, I think any mobility thing
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:15.480]   to learn how to move efficiently,
[02:27:15.480 --> 02:27:17.040]   you have to know how to relax.
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:18.520]   So it's just the fact that you can,
[02:27:18.520 --> 02:27:22.120]   like the body can be tense or it can be relaxed.
[02:27:22.120 --> 02:27:23.240]   Just knowing that fact.
[02:27:23.240 --> 02:27:24.080]   (laughs)
[02:27:24.080 --> 02:27:25.760]   - Now imagine your shoulders tense.
[02:27:25.760 --> 02:27:26.600]   - Yeah.
[02:27:26.600 --> 02:27:27.600]   - You think you play piano well?
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:29.600]   No, everything has to be relaxed.
[02:27:29.600 --> 02:27:31.560]   - I guess some of that is mind too,
[02:27:31.560 --> 02:27:34.400]   but just knowing that and being self-aware.
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:39.400]   But see like, even me, you know, approaching a thing,
[02:27:39.400 --> 02:27:43.560]   I'm not, I don't know anything about being a beginner.
[02:27:43.560 --> 02:27:44.800]   You're going to tense up.
[02:27:44.800 --> 02:27:47.360]   No matter, and like, it actually takes a conscious effort
[02:27:47.360 --> 02:27:48.760]   to think to relax.
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:49.600]   I mean, that's--
[02:27:49.600 --> 02:27:50.440]   - Massively.
[02:27:50.440 --> 02:27:53.240]   That's why learning things as an adult is much harder
[02:27:53.240 --> 02:27:54.080]   than as a child.
[02:27:54.080 --> 02:27:55.680]   Like it's very hard.
[02:27:55.680 --> 02:27:59.520]   And as an adult, it's like to get to the highest level,
[02:27:59.520 --> 02:28:01.280]   it's not possible.
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:04.800]   Because you will never relax the way you should.
[02:28:04.800 --> 02:28:08.560]   - Yeah, relax in the way that you become like water,
[02:28:08.560 --> 02:28:11.000]   but then you solidify in the right places.
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:12.160]   (laughs)
[02:28:12.160 --> 02:28:13.000]   Yeah.
[02:28:13.000 --> 02:28:15.400]   Yeah.
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:17.520]   Is there advice you can give to an adult?
[02:28:17.520 --> 02:28:20.600]   So like somebody that has a job, like a hobbyist,
[02:28:20.600 --> 02:28:21.800]   like how to progress, how to get--
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:26.600]   - I mean, train, just need to train as much as you can.
[02:28:26.600 --> 02:28:29.160]   Not, you know, five, seven days a week
[02:28:29.160 --> 02:28:31.160]   because you're gonna get injured.
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:34.200]   I mean, two, three times a week to start
[02:28:34.200 --> 02:28:39.200]   is the best way to initiate your jujitsu journey.
[02:28:39.200 --> 02:28:42.520]   And practice the same thing over and over again.
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:43.580]   When they don't work,
[02:28:43.580 --> 02:28:45.380]   it's just because you're not doing well,
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:47.800]   not because you have to learn something else.
[02:28:47.800 --> 02:28:51.120]   - Do you see some value in just picking a set of techniques
[02:28:51.120 --> 02:28:54.120]   that seem to draw your heart in?
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:55.800]   Like for example, I'll give you an example,
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:57.520]   you're gonna yell at me.
[02:28:57.520 --> 02:29:02.520]   But I never learned the close guard well.
[02:29:02.520 --> 02:29:07.440]   It just never connected with me.
[02:29:07.440 --> 02:29:09.040]   You could say it's body mechanics, whatever,
[02:29:09.040 --> 02:29:09.880]   it doesn't matter.
[02:29:09.880 --> 02:29:12.360]   The point is, it's just like my heart
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:14.320]   never connected with it.
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:16.440]   You know, the way I justified it to myself
[02:29:16.440 --> 02:29:17.960]   is I felt like when you're bad,
[02:29:17.960 --> 02:29:19.240]   you're using the close guard
[02:29:19.240 --> 02:29:21.840]   just like you could use the half guard to stall.
[02:29:21.840 --> 02:29:25.040]   So I was really drawn to the butterfly guard as a beginner
[02:29:25.040 --> 02:29:28.680]   because I thought, or open guard in general,
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:32.400]   I have no options to stall, so I'm going to learn.
[02:29:32.400 --> 02:29:35.100]   My thinking was, let me do the guard
[02:29:35.100 --> 02:29:37.240]   that enforces me to learn.
[02:29:37.240 --> 02:29:38.840]   And then I fell in love with the butterfly guard
[02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:40.240]   and the open guard and so on.
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:44.200]   And I never really understood the close guard.
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:45.640]   And the other thinking was,
[02:29:45.640 --> 02:29:48.840]   do I really need to understand the close guard?
[02:29:48.840 --> 02:29:51.640]   Because it's always by choice that I go there.
[02:29:51.640 --> 02:29:52.480]   So I can avoid--
[02:29:52.760 --> 02:29:55.260]   - I mean, you can avoid anything you want.
[02:29:55.260 --> 02:29:56.440]   (Lex laughs)
[02:29:56.440 --> 02:29:58.880]   I mean, you don't have to do anything.
[02:29:58.880 --> 02:29:59.720]   - In this life, yes.
[02:29:59.720 --> 02:30:01.520]   - It doesn't make you complete.
[02:30:01.520 --> 02:30:02.360]   That means you have a weakness.
[02:30:02.360 --> 02:30:04.180]   - But you want to be complete as a,
[02:30:04.180 --> 02:30:05.160]   this is the question,
[02:30:05.160 --> 02:30:08.840]   how valuable is it to be complete to get good?
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:13.560]   - Depends how good you want to be.
[02:30:13.560 --> 02:30:15.200]   - Okay, let's go.
[02:30:15.200 --> 02:30:17.100]   Well, there's several questions there.
[02:30:17.100 --> 02:30:19.200]   Yeah, okay, like to be the best in the world,
[02:30:19.200 --> 02:30:20.800]   do you need to be complete?
[02:30:20.800 --> 02:30:22.320]   - Of course.
[02:30:22.320 --> 02:30:24.800]   The best in the world, of course you have to be complete.
[02:30:24.800 --> 02:30:28.520]   Otherwise, somebody's gonna be better than you.
[02:30:28.520 --> 02:30:31.480]   - But what about, so to understand to defend,
[02:30:31.480 --> 02:30:33.160]   you have to be also good at the offense
[02:30:33.160 --> 02:30:35.320]   in every single position?
[02:30:35.320 --> 02:30:37.360]   - Otherwise, you have a weakness
[02:30:37.360 --> 02:30:41.040]   and someone can capitalize on that weakness.
[02:30:41.040 --> 02:30:43.360]   - Okay, what about to be like a hobbyist?
[02:30:43.360 --> 02:30:44.520]   - Then you don't have to.
[02:30:44.520 --> 02:30:47.520]   - But can you, or is it still bad?
[02:30:47.520 --> 02:30:48.360]   - I mean, it's not bad.
[02:30:48.360 --> 02:30:49.480]   I mean, nothing is bad.
[02:30:49.480 --> 02:30:52.320]   I mean, if as a hobbyist you start late,
[02:30:52.320 --> 02:30:55.280]   I mean, it doesn't matter how far you're gonna get.
[02:30:55.280 --> 02:30:58.920]   As long as you enjoy it, just train as much as you can.
[02:30:58.920 --> 02:31:01.400]   If it's twice a week, twice a week it is.
[02:31:01.400 --> 02:31:04.120]   You'll be limited how good you will be
[02:31:04.120 --> 02:31:06.240]   training twice a week, of course.
[02:31:06.240 --> 02:31:08.680]   Then the guy that trains twice a day,
[02:31:08.680 --> 02:31:11.920]   you know, it's just, the more you train, the better you get.
[02:31:11.920 --> 02:31:13.320]   - But you have to select what you train,
[02:31:13.320 --> 02:31:14.160]   that's what I'm asking.
[02:31:14.160 --> 02:31:16.760]   - I don't know, yes, but like for how long?
[02:31:16.760 --> 02:31:18.680]   Like there's some point in your life
[02:31:18.680 --> 02:31:22.080]   that you might try something, see if you like it.
[02:31:22.080 --> 02:31:23.600]   You know, there's some point in your life
[02:31:23.600 --> 02:31:25.640]   that you might, okay, let me try close guard.
[02:31:25.640 --> 02:31:27.560]   You might not like it now,
[02:31:27.560 --> 02:31:29.920]   maybe in two, three years from now.
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:31.200]   - Still don't like it.
[02:31:31.200 --> 02:31:32.160]   I kept trying it.
[02:31:32.160 --> 02:31:34.960]   Listen, 'cause, listen, it's very difficult
[02:31:34.960 --> 02:31:37.080]   to get any respect in jiu-jitsu.
[02:31:37.080 --> 02:31:41.280]   It's hard to get to black belt and beyond in jiu-jitsu
[02:31:41.280 --> 02:31:46.120]   at a respectable place and not have a good close guard.
[02:31:46.120 --> 02:31:46.960]   Close guard is--
[02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:48.800]   - Then don't do it.
[02:31:48.800 --> 02:31:50.600]   It's not necessary.
[02:31:50.600 --> 02:31:51.760]   - I'm being a rebel.
[02:31:51.760 --> 02:31:53.080]   - No, no, it's not.
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:55.760]   I'll say, because it's not a position
[02:31:55.760 --> 02:31:58.040]   that you want the pressure,
[02:31:58.040 --> 02:32:00.600]   that if you don't know, you'll be in trouble.
[02:32:00.600 --> 02:32:02.760]   You're not gonna be in trouble not to know the close guard.
[02:32:02.760 --> 02:32:04.480]   You're just gonna go straight for open guard.
[02:32:04.480 --> 02:32:05.320]   - I mean, the--
[02:32:05.320 --> 02:32:06.160]   - It's not a problem.
[02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:09.080]   - The main limitation is if you don't do close guard a lot,
[02:32:09.080 --> 02:32:10.840]   that you don't quite,
[02:32:10.840 --> 02:32:14.680]   you don't get a full, complete picture
[02:32:14.680 --> 02:32:16.560]   of understanding how to attack close guard
[02:32:16.560 --> 02:32:18.280]   when somebody puts you into a close guard,
[02:32:18.280 --> 02:32:19.480]   when you're on top.
[02:32:19.480 --> 02:32:20.840]   So it's nice to know both sides,
[02:32:20.840 --> 02:32:21.760]   if it's just to understand.
[02:32:21.760 --> 02:32:25.440]   - Yeah, but you can have a pretty good understanding
[02:32:25.440 --> 02:32:28.880]   of how to defend from the top and not having any bottom.
[02:32:28.880 --> 02:32:31.240]   - I mean, some of it is also just like the length of legs
[02:32:31.240 --> 02:32:33.320]   and just the geometry of your body.
[02:32:33.320 --> 02:32:37.720]   Nick, I'm sure Marcel Garcia has a good close guard, but--
[02:32:37.720 --> 02:32:38.560]   - I've never seen it.
[02:32:38.560 --> 02:32:39.400]   (laughing)
[02:32:39.400 --> 02:32:41.480]   - That's exact, that's the point I'm trying to make.
[02:32:41.480 --> 02:32:43.360]   (laughing)
[02:32:43.360 --> 02:32:46.480]   In theory, in theory, you can imagine it.
[02:32:47.080 --> 02:32:50.080]   - For a hobbyist, I think it's interesting to think of that.
[02:32:50.080 --> 02:32:52.760]   Is it possible to,
[02:32:52.760 --> 02:32:59.640]   is it possible to focus on a small set of techniques
[02:32:59.640 --> 02:33:01.360]   that help you to develop--
[02:33:01.360 --> 02:33:02.200]   - Of course.
[02:33:02.200 --> 02:33:03.040]   - Still into a good jujitsu player.
[02:33:03.040 --> 02:33:03.880]   - Yeah, of course.
[02:33:03.880 --> 02:33:05.080]   - And still enjoy and still be able to--
[02:33:05.080 --> 02:33:10.080]   - Most people hobbies in the jujitsu world, 99%.
[02:33:10.080 --> 02:33:11.800]   I mean, people that compete.
[02:33:11.800 --> 02:33:13.160]   - Even the people that compete and--
[02:33:13.160 --> 02:33:18.160]   - 1% max and you have high level competitors.
[02:33:18.160 --> 02:33:20.320]   Have no clue what close guard is.
[02:33:20.320 --> 02:33:22.040]   - Okay, thank you for making me feel good.
[02:33:22.040 --> 02:33:25.040]   No, I think you would say that most people don't have enough.
[02:33:25.040 --> 02:33:29.520]   Close guard is such a difficult position to understand,
[02:33:29.520 --> 02:33:30.600]   for me.
[02:33:30.600 --> 02:33:32.200]   - Maybe one day we'll brainwash.
[02:33:32.200 --> 02:33:33.280]   - Yeah, good.
[02:33:33.280 --> 02:33:38.280]   I felt it's too easy to stall versus attack.
[02:33:38.280 --> 02:33:42.000]   That was my main concern is like,
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:46.880]   I wanna be forced in every way to always be attacking,
[02:33:46.880 --> 02:33:48.880]   to always be moving, to always be,
[02:33:48.880 --> 02:33:52.040]   and it felt like if I got really good,
[02:33:52.040 --> 02:33:54.800]   I've seen it happen with half guard too.
[02:33:54.800 --> 02:33:56.600]   It's like when people get really good at half guard,
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:33:58.240]   it just feels stally.
[02:33:58.240 --> 02:34:01.280]   If you just look at the matches and so on,
[02:34:01.280 --> 02:34:04.240]   it's you slow things down to a thing that's not,
[02:34:04.240 --> 02:34:06.920]   you don't get reps on learning.
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:10.020]   You don't get action in interesting ways.
[02:34:10.020 --> 02:34:13.420]   So that was my worry, that I'll get old and fat
[02:34:13.420 --> 02:34:15.980]   and just sit in close guard all day,
[02:34:15.980 --> 02:34:19.900]   holding on to the white belts trying to kill me.
[02:34:19.900 --> 02:34:21.500]   'Cause it's also, I mean, that's the other thing
[02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:24.980]   for hobbyists and for everyone is to,
[02:34:24.980 --> 02:34:29.820]   like when you first start, I think you have to relax
[02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:31.780]   in the face of the fact that you're just getting
[02:34:31.780 --> 02:34:33.860]   your ass kicked nonstop.
[02:34:33.860 --> 02:34:35.800]   That can also be really tough on the ego.
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:37.620]   I think probably the right way to see that
[02:34:37.620 --> 02:34:39.900]   is you're growing as a person.
[02:34:39.900 --> 02:34:43.700]   You see that clearly when they are in a bad position,
[02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:45.980]   let's say side mount or mount.
[02:34:45.980 --> 02:34:50.220]   Like a beginner, he will never relax on those positions.
[02:34:50.220 --> 02:34:53.740]   The moment that you say go, they like trying to
[02:34:53.740 --> 02:34:55.060]   (laughs)
[02:34:55.060 --> 02:34:57.140]   push you out and explode.
[02:34:57.140 --> 02:35:00.060]   There's no relaxation and work on the defense.
[02:35:00.060 --> 02:35:05.060]   It's like, no, it's out and go until I have zero to give.
[02:35:05.060 --> 02:35:08.520]   Until I'm exhausted, my arms cannot move.
[02:35:08.600 --> 02:35:10.560]   (laughs)
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:12.080]   - It's kind of fun to watch actually.
[02:35:12.080 --> 02:35:13.480]   What's the role of drilling?
[02:35:13.480 --> 02:35:16.360]   Do you like drilling?
[02:35:16.360 --> 02:35:18.760]   - I do not like drilling, but I'll tell you why.
[02:35:18.760 --> 02:35:20.920]   I think,
[02:35:20.920 --> 02:35:25.880]   fighting is mechanic, right?
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:29.520]   So it's very important to drill a move
[02:35:29.520 --> 02:35:31.120]   until you learn the mechanic.
[02:35:31.120 --> 02:35:32.440]   Of course it's important.
[02:35:32.440 --> 02:35:35.600]   If someone wanna teach you an arm lock,
[02:35:35.600 --> 02:35:37.520]   you wanna practice that movement
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:39.120]   until you learn the mechanic of it,
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.420]   but the guy's not resisting, so it's easy to apply, right?
[02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:47.200]   So you apply as many times as you have to
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:49.080]   until you know the mechanic of the moves,
[02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:51.160]   until you can apply the mechanics.
[02:35:51.160 --> 02:35:53.320]   The moment that you know how to apply,
[02:35:53.320 --> 02:35:55.040]   there's no more point in drilling.
[02:35:55.040 --> 02:35:56.640]   Now you have to practice.
[02:35:56.640 --> 02:35:59.440]   Now you have to practice with resistance.
[02:35:59.440 --> 02:36:01.000]   Of course you're not gonna practice
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:02.840]   with the guy fully resisting.
[02:36:02.840 --> 02:36:03.680]   The guy's better than you,
[02:36:03.680 --> 02:36:04.880]   'cause he's not gonna give you a chance
[02:36:04.880 --> 02:36:06.000]   to practice that move.
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:08.400]   But you have to practice with resistance.
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:11.680]   So where does drilling comes on that?
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:16.480]   Is most of people, they flow drill and everything.
[02:36:16.480 --> 02:36:18.480]   I think whatever you do,
[02:36:18.480 --> 02:36:21.060]   you're conditioning your body to do something.
[02:36:21.060 --> 02:36:24.960]   You repeat the same move over and over again.
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:27.080]   Your body's conditioning to apply that movement
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:28.800]   or that technique.
[02:36:28.800 --> 02:36:30.600]   Drilling is not realistic
[02:36:30.600 --> 02:36:33.240]   because the other person's not resisting.
[02:36:33.240 --> 02:36:34.600]   The flow movement or whatever.
[02:36:34.600 --> 02:36:36.360]   After you go beyond,
[02:36:36.360 --> 02:36:39.800]   when you already know the mechanics,
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:41.680]   the drilling with no resistance
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:43.160]   is not gonna teach you anything
[02:36:43.160 --> 02:36:45.080]   because you will never know
[02:36:45.080 --> 02:36:47.540]   how to apply the movement with resistance.
[02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:50.120]   So it's pointless to carry on drilling
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:51.960]   after you learn the mechanics.
[02:36:51.960 --> 02:36:55.360]   - See, but you're making it sound easy
[02:36:55.360 --> 02:36:57.480]   to learn the mechanics, I would argue.
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:00.100]   - You can drill as many times.
[02:37:00.100 --> 02:37:03.880]   I'm not limiting how much you drill.
[02:37:03.880 --> 02:37:06.080]   You drill as long as you had to.
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:08.440]   I mean, it doesn't matter how long.
[02:37:08.440 --> 02:37:09.800]   - The benefit of drilling,
[02:37:09.800 --> 02:37:12.200]   and I'm just playing devil's advocate with you.
[02:37:12.200 --> 02:37:14.120]   The benefit of drilling is that
[02:37:14.120 --> 02:37:16.920]   you can more efficiently get a higher number of reps in.
[02:37:16.920 --> 02:37:18.840]   So--
[02:37:18.840 --> 02:37:21.880]   - What are you gonna gain with those reps?
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:24.000]   - Understanding the mechanics of the movement.
[02:37:24.000 --> 02:37:26.000]   And what I would like to argue
[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:27.760]   is you don't necessarily need resistance
[02:37:27.760 --> 02:37:29.960]   to deeply understand the mechanics of something.
[02:37:29.960 --> 02:37:31.880]   Now, I don't know-- - I agree.
[02:37:31.880 --> 02:37:36.880]   - There's some moves, like I bet you,
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:41.260]   you could drill your way to an incredible mount.
[02:37:41.260 --> 02:37:44.680]   Mount is a good example of that.
[02:37:44.680 --> 02:37:45.980]   You don't really need a--
[02:37:45.980 --> 02:37:50.200]   I can imagine a world in which the resisting opponent
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:52.320]   is not essential for developing
[02:37:52.320 --> 02:37:55.840]   some of the very fine details of the mechanics--
[02:37:55.840 --> 02:37:56.680]   - Which one?
[02:37:56.680 --> 02:37:57.960]   'Cause I don't know any.
[02:37:57.960 --> 02:37:59.420]   - What? - You say mount.
[02:37:59.420 --> 02:38:00.400]   - Yes.
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:05.680]   - What you're gonna achieve by drilling with no resistance
[02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:07.520]   after you learn the mechanics in mount.
[02:38:07.520 --> 02:38:08.880]   - But see, what I'm trying to tell you,
[02:38:08.880 --> 02:38:11.000]   the learning of the mechanics isn't a thing
[02:38:11.000 --> 02:38:12.920]   where you get a certificate and you're done.
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:15.040]   You're gonna learn the fine details
[02:38:15.040 --> 02:38:17.120]   of the way you redistribute your weight.
[02:38:17.120 --> 02:38:18.960]   You're going to learn how to move your,
[02:38:18.960 --> 02:38:19.800]   I don't understand mount, so--
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:21.160]   - Against a dead body.
[02:38:21.160 --> 02:38:25.080]   Like everything you do is a slow process in timing.
[02:38:25.080 --> 02:38:27.240]   - Timing, you can't learn--
[02:38:27.240 --> 02:38:28.600]   - You have to understand moving.
[02:38:28.600 --> 02:38:29.440]   - Okay.
[02:38:29.440 --> 02:38:31.680]   - If the guy's resisting, like he's not,
[02:38:31.680 --> 02:38:34.120]   I'm not gonna grab you and apply the movement.
[02:38:34.120 --> 02:38:38.320]   I need to grab you and feel when is the right time to do.
[02:38:38.320 --> 02:38:41.760]   Like that, it only comes with movement.
[02:38:41.760 --> 02:38:45.140]   If you're not fully resistant, how would I know?
[02:38:45.140 --> 02:38:48.020]   - You couldn't infer through it.
[02:38:48.020 --> 02:38:49.520]   It's like a--
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:51.480]   - With no movement, with no resistance.
[02:38:51.480 --> 02:38:52.960]   Like arm lock. - There's some resistance.
[02:38:52.960 --> 02:38:55.160]   - Okay, arm lock, let's say arm lock.
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:56.000]   - Okay.
[02:38:56.000 --> 02:38:57.760]   - Okay, let's say you've been drilling for a week.
[02:38:57.760 --> 02:38:58.640]   - Yeah.
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:38:59.920]   - Five hours a day.
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:02.280]   You should be an expert with the mechanics.
[02:39:02.280 --> 02:39:07.560]   But now, how, are you gonna carry on drilling?
[02:39:07.560 --> 02:39:08.480]   With no resistance?
[02:39:08.480 --> 02:39:10.000]   - No, yeah, I mean, yes.
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:13.460]   - After that week, drilling five hours a day,
[02:39:13.460 --> 02:39:16.200]   the arm lock, you still have no clue
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:19.320]   how to apply the arm lock against a resisting opponent.
[02:39:19.320 --> 02:39:20.480]   No clue, zero.
[02:39:20.480 --> 02:39:21.320]   - Yeah.
[02:39:21.320 --> 02:39:23.160]   - So you don't know the movement, you know the mechanic.
[02:39:23.160 --> 02:39:26.920]   Which is, you know, it's like how long you have to drill
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:30.520]   and how, that doesn't matter, it varies of the person.
[02:39:30.520 --> 02:39:32.000]   You can drill for a month.
[02:39:32.000 --> 02:39:34.640]   After that month is over, you should understand
[02:39:34.640 --> 02:39:36.360]   how the mechanic works.
[02:39:36.360 --> 02:39:38.400]   You still have no clue how to apply the movement
[02:39:38.400 --> 02:39:40.000]   against a resisting opponent.
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.000]   You will never, ever know how until you apply
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:44.880]   with a fully resisting opponent.
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:45.720]   - Yeah.
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:49.400]   - That's the only way to know, to really learn a movement.
[02:39:49.400 --> 02:39:51.200]   - Yes, well put.
[02:39:51.200 --> 02:39:54.920]   But the question is, can you have a small percentage
[02:39:54.920 --> 02:39:57.160]   of time when you go against a resisting opponent
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:39:59.400]   to get the wisdom and the insight of what it takes
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:02.480]   to perform that movement, and you spend a large percentage
[02:40:02.480 --> 02:40:05.920]   of other time just practicing the mechanics of it?
[02:40:05.920 --> 02:40:10.920]   So like, do you need to, as you get better and better
[02:40:10.920 --> 02:40:14.560]   at technique, to basically drift away completely
[02:40:14.560 --> 02:40:17.840]   from drilling and more into the sparring?
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:20.000]   I'd like to, I just--
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:21.000]   - You like drilling?
[02:40:21.000 --> 02:40:22.760]   - No, I don't like drilling.
[02:40:22.760 --> 02:40:25.080]   Well, yes, I like drilling, I would say.
[02:40:25.080 --> 02:40:26.840]   But I just see, it always bothered me
[02:40:26.840 --> 02:40:30.000]   in the jiu-jitsu community how few people really
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:30.840]   saw the value of drilling.
[02:40:30.840 --> 02:40:33.560]   I see it in wrestling, especially in the Russian style
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:35.800]   of wrestling, like the value of drilling.
[02:40:35.800 --> 02:40:38.680]   I don't necessarily mean that it's like a dead body
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:40.480]   or like a dummy or something like that,
[02:40:40.480 --> 02:40:43.480]   but just getting the reps in, really focusing
[02:40:43.480 --> 02:40:45.680]   on the high amount of reps.
[02:40:45.680 --> 02:40:49.000]   - I agree in wrestling and judo.
[02:40:49.000 --> 02:40:50.640]   I agree that drilling is very important.
[02:40:50.640 --> 02:40:52.760]   Initial drill of 1,000 times each move.
[02:40:52.760 --> 02:40:54.360]   - Yeah, judo's a really big one for that, too.
[02:40:54.360 --> 02:40:59.360]   - It is, because it's the movement, the timing,
[02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:02.640]   you know, it's the precision of the movement.
[02:41:02.640 --> 02:41:05.960]   It has to be perfectly, because it's one movement.
[02:41:05.960 --> 02:41:08.760]   Then you learn about the timing of the movement
[02:41:08.760 --> 02:41:10.680]   when you're fighting, but during fighting,
[02:41:10.680 --> 02:41:12.760]   you only need to know the time,
[02:41:12.760 --> 02:41:15.040]   'cause your body movement is exactly the same
[02:41:15.040 --> 02:41:16.040]   when you drill.
[02:41:16.040 --> 02:41:17.240]   - That's really well put, yeah.
[02:41:17.240 --> 02:41:19.280]   The mechanics is much more important there.
[02:41:19.280 --> 02:41:22.040]   - Yeah, but it's completely different for jiu-jitsu,
[02:41:22.040 --> 02:41:25.600]   because let's say from jiu-jitsu, like the arm lock,
[02:41:25.600 --> 02:41:27.640]   for example, we use that as an example.
[02:41:27.640 --> 02:41:29.000]   Let's say from the close guard.
[02:41:29.000 --> 02:41:31.800]   Even my close guard, before I go for the arm lock,
[02:41:31.800 --> 02:41:33.680]   I need to have a set of grips.
[02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:36.200]   Let's say I have your collar and your arm, right?
[02:41:36.200 --> 02:41:38.280]   And then, you know, when you're drilling,
[02:41:38.280 --> 02:41:40.720]   I'm gonna grab your arm, I'm gonna grab your collar,
[02:41:40.720 --> 02:41:43.080]   and I'm gonna drill my body until I can apply
[02:41:43.080 --> 02:41:44.400]   the arm lock and finish.
[02:41:44.400 --> 02:41:46.560]   And I can do that 1,000 times.
[02:41:46.560 --> 02:41:49.640]   Okay, now we're fighting, we start with the grip.
[02:41:49.640 --> 02:41:51.840]   The moment that I initiate the arm lock attack,
[02:41:51.840 --> 02:41:54.520]   you will defend, the arm lock will not work.
[02:41:54.520 --> 02:41:56.840]   So it's not the one movement that will get me
[02:41:56.840 --> 02:41:57.680]   to attack the arm.
[02:41:57.680 --> 02:42:01.640]   There's a combination of other things that I need to do.
[02:42:01.640 --> 02:42:03.880]   I need to feel about your weight, you know,
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.120]   I need to get you close to me.
[02:42:05.120 --> 02:42:08.960]   There's so many other things involved that I need to feel
[02:42:08.960 --> 02:42:13.400]   that only comes with a fully resistant opponent.
[02:42:14.320 --> 02:42:18.000]   - Yeah, so pretty quickly it has to be live.
[02:42:18.000 --> 02:42:18.840]   - Yeah.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:25.000]   And then it comes how you practice, how you train.
[02:42:25.000 --> 02:42:28.960]   You're starting on that position and just saying, let's go.
[02:42:28.960 --> 02:42:31.840]   And the moment that we disengage from that position,
[02:42:31.840 --> 02:42:34.520]   we go back, that's when you really learn.
[02:42:34.520 --> 02:42:36.040]   Because everything that you do wrong,
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:38.440]   you're gonna go back there, and you're gonna try again,
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:39.600]   try again, try again.
[02:42:39.600 --> 02:42:42.800]   And the repetition, it will teach you,
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:46.760]   have a feeling of timing, when to go,
[02:42:46.760 --> 02:42:49.000]   if there's other combinations,
[02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:52.200]   which you always has, to go with it.
[02:42:52.200 --> 02:42:56.360]   - By the way, for the internet that's currently yelling
[02:42:56.360 --> 02:42:59.280]   at me for arguing with Haja Gracie about drilling,
[02:42:59.280 --> 02:43:03.040]   that's called playing devil's advocate
[02:43:03.040 --> 02:43:04.760]   to strengthen, to explore ideas.
[02:43:04.760 --> 02:43:06.400]   I'm not actually arguing.
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:07.240]   Okay.
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:10.280]   I forgot to ask you.
[02:43:11.840 --> 02:43:14.360]   If you had to fight against the bear, lion, gorilla,
[02:43:14.360 --> 02:43:18.400]   or anaconda to the death, which one would you choose?
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.080]   And would you be able actually to win against any of them?
[02:43:23.080 --> 02:43:28.080]   - We'll have bear, a lion, a tiger, or anaconda.
[02:43:28.080 --> 02:43:30.480]   - Oh, gorilla too, gorilla.
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:31.440]   You can go gorilla.
[02:43:31.440 --> 02:43:35.120]   - I'll probably choose the anaconda.
[02:43:35.120 --> 02:43:37.360]   (laughing)
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:41.800]   - I mean, you're not allowed to run away though.
[02:43:41.800 --> 02:43:43.440]   So you're in a cage.
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:46.320]   Do you have to kill?
[02:43:46.320 --> 02:43:49.240]   - Still the anaconda.
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:51.320]   - So the anaconda.
[02:43:51.320 --> 02:43:53.400]   - I think I have no chance against any other ones.
[02:43:53.400 --> 02:43:54.240]   - Zero chance.
[02:43:54.240 --> 02:43:55.400]   That's what John thinks.
[02:43:55.400 --> 02:43:56.240]   I think--
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:43:58.600]   - I have a tiny little against the anaconda.
[02:43:58.600 --> 02:44:00.800]   (laughing)
[02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:02.320]   - Just wait it out.
[02:44:02.320 --> 02:44:04.400]   You don't think it's possible to be,
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:10.200]   I just, it feels like technique
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:12.400]   can do something against these animals.
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:14.600]   But they have so much strength, so much aggression.
[02:44:14.600 --> 02:44:17.240]   - You know, the real naked joke,
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:19.960]   translating to Portuguese, is kill the lion.
[02:44:19.960 --> 02:44:25.880]   So ever since I was a kid, I always thought
[02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:28.480]   that maybe if I get behind a lion,
[02:44:28.480 --> 02:44:32.000]   the real naked joke, which in Portuguese it says,
[02:44:32.000 --> 02:44:36.160]   mata leão, so mata leão means kill the lion.
[02:44:36.160 --> 02:44:38.600]   So I always thought that that's the only way
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:41.000]   to kill a lion, or to, you know,
[02:44:41.000 --> 02:44:41.840]   if you're fighting against a lion,
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:44.240]   you go behind him, put the real naked joke,
[02:44:44.240 --> 02:44:46.320]   I think you put him to sleep.
[02:44:46.320 --> 02:44:49.880]   The name mata leão is like kill the lion.
[02:44:49.880 --> 02:44:51.800]   Someone came up with the name.
[02:44:51.800 --> 02:44:52.640]   Why?
[02:44:52.640 --> 02:44:53.480]   - Somebody must have.
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:55.840]   - Maybe someone, he going to fight with the lion,
[02:44:55.840 --> 02:44:56.680]   choked him up.
[02:44:56.680 --> 02:44:57.520]   - There you go, John.
[02:44:57.520 --> 02:44:59.120]   There you go.
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:00.680]   Honestly, do you think, or so, actually, yeah,
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:03.200]   you understand controlling positions.
[02:45:03.200 --> 02:45:06.640]   Do you think an animal like a gorilla or a lion
[02:45:06.640 --> 02:45:07.840]   would shake you off?
[02:45:07.840 --> 02:45:10.440]   If you had back full, you're locked in.
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:12.600]   - Well, I would say the one that'll have
[02:45:12.600 --> 02:45:15.800]   the biggest chance of staying there is the lion
[02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:17.520]   'cause he's the thinner body.
[02:45:17.520 --> 02:45:19.680]   He's smaller than a tiger, I guess.
[02:45:19.680 --> 02:45:21.400]   Think tigers are bigger?
[02:45:21.400 --> 02:45:22.240]   - Yes.
[02:45:22.240 --> 02:45:24.360]   So do you think they can shake you off, though?
[02:45:24.360 --> 02:45:27.320]   - I think I'll have a bigger chance of staying
[02:45:27.320 --> 02:45:30.120]   against a lion's back than any other animal.
[02:45:30.120 --> 02:45:31.600]   - Still not answering the question.
[02:45:31.600 --> 02:45:33.380]   Do you think you have a chance?
[02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:35.680]   - If I start on the back?
[02:45:35.680 --> 02:45:38.280]   - If you start full locked in, full controls,
[02:45:38.280 --> 02:45:39.560]   let's say it's a small enough lion
[02:45:39.560 --> 02:45:41.400]   that you can actually have a full--
[02:45:41.400 --> 02:45:42.360]   - I would guess so.
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:44.320]   I mean, I would like to believe so.
[02:45:44.320 --> 02:45:45.760]   Okay.
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:46.840]   - Well, just like you said,
[02:45:46.840 --> 02:45:49.240]   somebody must have been able to do it.
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:50.980]   Throughout your journey in jiu-jitsu,
[02:45:50.980 --> 02:45:52.600]   have there been low points?
[02:45:52.600 --> 02:45:53.600]   Like, has there been points
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:55.680]   where you really doubted yourself?
[02:45:55.680 --> 02:45:58.200]   - No, I've never really doubted myself.
[02:45:58.200 --> 02:46:00.640]   There's low points in defeats.
[02:46:00.640 --> 02:46:03.400]   Those are the low points when I lost.
[02:46:03.400 --> 02:46:05.000]   - How did you deal with defeats?
[02:46:05.960 --> 02:46:08.040]   - I just went back to the gym next week
[02:46:08.040 --> 02:46:09.480]   and say I need to get better.
[02:46:09.480 --> 02:46:12.280]   That every time I lost, I'm like,
[02:46:12.280 --> 02:46:15.360]   I need to get better 'cause I need to choke them out.
[02:46:15.360 --> 02:46:18.280]   I need to submit them because, you know,
[02:46:18.280 --> 02:46:22.400]   win by points, it's, as a black belt,
[02:46:22.400 --> 02:46:24.680]   I have very, very little loss.
[02:46:24.680 --> 02:46:29.520]   I would say, I mean, I don't like to sound
[02:46:29.520 --> 02:46:31.760]   like a crime baby, but I'll say most,
[02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:35.080]   most of those loss was very, very controversial.
[02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:37.760]   - Yeah, it was not a dominant, clear performance.
[02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:39.880]   It's about referees and points and so on.
[02:46:39.880 --> 02:46:42.560]   - Everything was, since I was very young,
[02:46:42.560 --> 02:46:45.480]   I always fought against my opponent and the referee.
[02:46:45.480 --> 02:46:48.440]   Like, it's, if there was ever in my whole life,
[02:46:48.440 --> 02:46:52.160]   since I was a kid, there was ever a doubt,
[02:46:52.160 --> 02:46:55.360]   they always go to my opponent, always, always.
[02:46:55.360 --> 02:46:57.240]   That was just something that I had to deal with
[02:46:57.240 --> 02:46:58.080]   my whole life.
[02:46:58.080 --> 02:46:59.880]   - Yeah, what's the motivation behind,
[02:46:59.920 --> 02:47:02.160]   what led to the fact that you win most of your matches
[02:47:02.160 --> 02:47:03.800]   by submission or in dominance?
[02:47:03.800 --> 02:47:05.360]   Like, are you chasing?
[02:47:05.360 --> 02:47:08.560]   - Because that's the only way to prove you better.
[02:47:08.560 --> 02:47:12.360]   And I'm never, I never fought to win tournaments.
[02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:13.520]   That was never my goal.
[02:47:13.520 --> 02:47:16.880]   That was the consequence of me trying to be the best.
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:20.040]   Like, I don't care how many titles I have.
[02:47:20.040 --> 02:47:24.160]   I care about, I need to beat all my opponents
[02:47:24.160 --> 02:47:28.440]   and not, not win because win is not enough.
[02:47:28.440 --> 02:47:30.120]   I have to submit them.
[02:47:30.120 --> 02:47:34.360]   That's the only way to prove I'm the best, to submit them.
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:37.360]   If I win by advantage or a point,
[02:47:37.360 --> 02:47:39.160]   that means I was better than them that day.
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:41.160]   That does not mean I'm better than them.
[02:47:41.160 --> 02:47:46.240]   If the top, if I take you down,
[02:47:46.240 --> 02:47:49.600]   pass your guard, mount you and submit you,
[02:47:49.600 --> 02:47:52.440]   there's zero questions who's the best.
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:54.680]   Like, there's nothing you can say about it.
[02:47:54.680 --> 02:47:58.280]   If I foot sweep you, you put your butt on the floor,
[02:47:58.280 --> 02:47:59.880]   I get an advantage.
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:02.440]   We carry on fighting and I win, means nothing.
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:05.480]   Not even means I'm better than you.
[02:48:05.480 --> 02:48:08.840]   - And if that happened, that would haunt you.
[02:48:08.840 --> 02:48:10.960]   - For me, it's not enough.
[02:48:10.960 --> 02:48:11.960]   I wouldn't be happy.
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:17.480]   - What advice would you give to young folks
[02:48:17.480 --> 02:48:20.840]   who look at you, who are able to accomplish
[02:48:20.840 --> 02:48:22.960]   from a place where you're not very good
[02:48:22.960 --> 02:48:25.920]   to becoming the best in the world at a thing?
[02:48:25.920 --> 02:48:28.120]   What advice would you give them
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:30.000]   to have a journey like that,
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:31.800]   to have a journey where they could be successful
[02:48:31.800 --> 02:48:36.040]   in their career and their life to such a high level?
[02:48:36.040 --> 02:48:39.960]   - Determination is the most important thing.
[02:48:39.960 --> 02:48:44.400]   You need to know where you're going to get there.
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:47.760]   So you need to have a goal, whatever that goal is.
[02:48:47.760 --> 02:48:50.720]   Like, you need to set that goal for yourself
[02:48:50.720 --> 02:48:52.840]   so you know where you wanna go.
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:56.080]   And to have the determination to get there
[02:48:56.080 --> 02:49:01.000]   and be sure that you will fail many times.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:04.960]   Like, you cannot let your failures bring you down
[02:49:04.960 --> 02:49:08.080]   because you will fail many times.
[02:49:08.080 --> 02:49:09.120]   Everybody does.
[02:49:09.120 --> 02:49:12.800]   - So you said you didn't look to external sources
[02:49:12.800 --> 02:49:17.760]   of belief, you just believed in yourself.
[02:49:17.760 --> 02:49:21.320]   Is there something to that where you have to try
[02:49:21.320 --> 02:49:26.320]   to be your own source of belief,
[02:49:26.320 --> 02:49:32.040]   flame the fire within yourself?
[02:49:32.040 --> 02:49:34.080]   Was that something difficult to do?
[02:49:34.080 --> 02:49:36.800]   - That was just very natural for me.
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:43.040]   I said, you can surround yourself with great people.
[02:49:43.040 --> 02:49:46.040]   That is extremely important.
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:48.560]   Don't surround yourself with failures
[02:49:48.560 --> 02:49:52.360]   because they're not gonna push you to,
[02:49:52.360 --> 02:49:57.120]   they don't know what it is, how to get there.
[02:49:57.120 --> 02:49:58.240]   I mean, everybody knows,
[02:49:58.240 --> 02:50:01.560]   but when you surround yourself with winners,
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:04.600]   you will know what it took them to get there.
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:06.120]   Use them as an example.
[02:50:06.120 --> 02:50:10.240]   - Yeah, there's a certain kind of aura to people
[02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:13.040]   that just achieve great things and being around them.
[02:50:13.040 --> 02:50:15.280]   But still, it's hard to find people that,
[02:50:15.280 --> 02:50:16.760]   especially at that early stage.
[02:50:17.160 --> 02:50:18.640]   - Any area.
[02:50:18.640 --> 02:50:19.480]   - Yeah.
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:20.320]   - Any area.
[02:50:20.320 --> 02:50:21.400]   - That's right.
[02:50:21.400 --> 02:50:23.080]   Yeah, greatness has a certain,
[02:50:23.080 --> 02:50:25.000]   I think it's almost humbling just to see,
[02:50:25.000 --> 02:50:28.120]   okay, any human, at least that's a lesson I learned.
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:31.480]   Almost any human can be great.
[02:50:31.480 --> 02:50:35.400]   - I mean, one, I've used Muhammad Ali as a great example.
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:37.200]   Look at his belief.
[02:50:37.200 --> 02:50:39.080]   Look at how much he believed himself
[02:50:39.080 --> 02:50:41.760]   before he was Muhammad Ali.
[02:50:41.760 --> 02:50:44.120]   Look at the determination he had,
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:46.920]   the way, the confidence he had fighting,
[02:50:46.920 --> 02:50:48.320]   even on his loss.
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:50.920]   It never changed him.
[02:50:50.920 --> 02:50:55.280]   Not when he fought Foreman, George Foreman.
[02:50:55.280 --> 02:50:57.720]   Not one person in the world thought
[02:50:57.720 --> 02:50:59.720]   he was gonna win that fight by himself.
[02:50:59.720 --> 02:51:02.760]   He never doubted himself.
[02:51:02.760 --> 02:51:04.000]   Everybody else did.
[02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:08.320]   He won over all odds against.
[02:51:08.320 --> 02:51:12.200]   So, I mean, when you look at people like that,
[02:51:12.200 --> 02:51:17.200]   you don't have to be a boxer to try to follow his example.
[02:51:17.200 --> 02:51:21.400]   - But see, those are like epic, giant battles,
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:23.360]   but I feel like you fight the same kind of battle
[02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:26.040]   when you're young and your parents tell you that,
[02:51:26.040 --> 02:51:28.560]   you know, just with their whole energy that this is silly.
[02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:29.400]   Don't be silly.
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:30.960]   Don't be silly to chase.
[02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:32.440]   - It's harder.
[02:51:32.440 --> 02:51:34.040]   It is harder.
[02:51:34.040 --> 02:51:36.920]   But as a kid, it's harder to deal with that
[02:51:36.920 --> 02:51:39.760]   because, I mean, to go against adults,
[02:51:39.760 --> 02:51:42.680]   especially parents telling you otherwise,
[02:51:42.680 --> 02:51:47.680]   like the amount of strength you need is gigantic.
[02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:50.160]   I don't even know how much strength you need
[02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:52.800]   'cause that was not my case.
[02:51:52.800 --> 02:51:56.120]   So I can understand what you have to go through
[02:51:56.120 --> 02:51:59.360]   with the force of your parents telling you otherwise.
[02:51:59.360 --> 02:52:03.000]   But it's how much you want,
[02:52:03.000 --> 02:52:06.440]   it will dictate how far you're gonna go,
[02:52:06.440 --> 02:52:07.320]   where you're gonna go.
[02:52:07.320 --> 02:52:11.400]   So if you can break through that, you'll get nowhere.
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:13.040]   It's that simple.
[02:52:13.040 --> 02:52:15.320]   - And actually, one of the really nice things
[02:52:15.320 --> 02:52:18.320]   the internet does that I would give advice to young people
[02:52:18.320 --> 02:52:20.040]   is like you can find,
[02:52:20.040 --> 02:52:22.600]   even if your parents are not a source of that,
[02:52:22.600 --> 02:52:24.380]   your teachers, your community,
[02:52:24.380 --> 02:52:26.760]   you can find people on the internet who will believe in you.
[02:52:26.760 --> 02:52:27.680]   It's kind of cool.
[02:52:27.680 --> 02:52:30.440]   It's kind of cool how the internet opens the possibility
[02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:35.080]   of a community of 10, 11-year-olds building shit.
[02:52:35.080 --> 02:52:36.080]   I see this all the time.
[02:52:36.080 --> 02:52:40.320]   Engineering, I mean, they're fueled by belief.
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:47.620]   They want to create the next trillion dollar company.
[02:52:47.620 --> 02:52:50.720]   There's that fire in their eyes.
[02:52:50.720 --> 02:52:52.000]   And not for the money, obviously,
[02:52:52.000 --> 02:52:54.200]   but to do something really impactful.
[02:52:54.200 --> 02:52:56.640]   And I think that fire is extinguished often
[02:52:56.640 --> 02:53:00.520]   by teachers and parents.
[02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:02.960]   'Cause I think the logic that parents have,
[02:53:03.920 --> 02:53:06.800]   and teachers, they look at a kid,
[02:53:06.800 --> 02:53:09.320]   and they don't, on the surface level,
[02:53:09.320 --> 02:53:10.900]   they don't see greatness.
[02:53:10.900 --> 02:53:14.960]   They just see kind of mediocrity.
[02:53:14.960 --> 02:53:17.200]   And so to them, it's like, no, all right,
[02:53:17.200 --> 02:53:18.960]   the world is more complicated than that.
[02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:20.880]   In order to get great, you have to,
[02:53:20.880 --> 02:53:25.760]   they somehow kind of always try to be reasonable with you,
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:27.680]   and in so doing, extinguish the flame.
[02:53:27.680 --> 02:53:28.520]   It's weird.
[02:53:28.520 --> 02:53:33.280]   - I think most people are afraid to even try.
[02:53:34.040 --> 02:53:36.360]   So you can call them cowards for not trying,
[02:53:36.360 --> 02:53:39.520]   because you are a coward for not trying,
[02:53:39.520 --> 02:53:41.780]   not putting yourself at risk, right?
[02:53:41.780 --> 02:53:46.780]   So I would say a big part of society
[02:53:46.780 --> 02:53:49.400]   are cowards for never trying,
[02:53:49.400 --> 02:53:52.480]   never pursuing what they really want.
[02:53:52.480 --> 02:53:59.000]   There is a weight, a pressure, everyone, most people,
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:03.040]   a lot of people, I'll say, around you,
[02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:05.800]   that because they were afraid to try,
[02:54:05.800 --> 02:54:09.320]   they don't incentivize people to do so,
[02:54:09.320 --> 02:54:13.060]   because they want everybody to be like them.
[02:54:13.060 --> 02:54:16.320]   Because imagine if everybody around you
[02:54:16.320 --> 02:54:18.900]   suddenly are not afraid, and everyone is trying,
[02:54:18.900 --> 02:54:20.700]   and you look yourself in the mirror,
[02:54:20.700 --> 02:54:23.480]   and say, I was too scared, I've never tried.
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:25.320]   So you feel really bad about yourself.
[02:54:25.320 --> 02:54:28.160]   So it's easier to have people around you
[02:54:28.160 --> 02:54:31.840]   that think exactly like you than otherwise.
[02:54:31.840 --> 02:54:34.440]   So that reflect a lot on the kids.
[02:54:34.440 --> 02:54:38.040]   It's society almost like press them down
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:41.720]   to be like everybody else, to have a normal life,
[02:54:41.720 --> 02:54:44.760]   normal job, it's don't take risk,
[02:54:44.760 --> 02:54:46.660]   because you can lose it all.
[02:54:46.660 --> 02:54:49.840]   I mean, that's the worst thing you can tell everybody.
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:52.880]   Take all the risks, lose it all a few times.
[02:54:52.880 --> 02:54:54.720]   That's how you're gonna build things.
[02:54:54.720 --> 02:54:55.760]   - Especially when you're young.
[02:54:55.760 --> 02:54:56.600]   - Yes.
[02:54:56.600 --> 02:54:57.420]   - You can recover much quicker.
[02:54:57.420 --> 02:54:59.840]   - Exactly, what's the point of not trying?
[02:54:59.840 --> 02:55:03.920]   You should try, and you will lose everything.
[02:55:03.920 --> 02:55:08.600]   Doesn't matter what it matters to lose everything.
[02:55:08.600 --> 02:55:12.600]   It does matter, it will teach you resilience.
[02:55:12.600 --> 02:55:14.800]   You know, try harder, go after.
[02:55:14.800 --> 02:55:18.680]   Don't live a normal life,
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:21.680]   because otherwise, what are we here for?
[02:55:21.680 --> 02:55:24.020]   - Yeah, take big risks, take a lot of them,
[02:55:24.020 --> 02:55:24.860]   fail and fail and fail and fail.
[02:55:24.860 --> 02:55:26.720]   - Of course, fail a thousand times.
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:30.600]   Until you succeed, and then you're gonna,
[02:55:30.600 --> 02:55:32.800]   you'll be the most proud of yourself.
[02:55:32.800 --> 02:55:36.000]   Like, there's, then it'll be priceless.
[02:55:36.000 --> 02:55:38.680]   It's, then we'll change the world.
[02:55:38.680 --> 02:55:43.060]   - It is true that most people are not necessarily cowards,
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:44.840]   but have cowardice in them.
[02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:47.760]   - It's most people are just afraid to try, you know.
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:49.440]   - And a lot of it comes from a place of love,
[02:55:49.440 --> 02:55:54.440]   because, you know, if you try and you fail, you get hurt.
[02:55:54.440 --> 02:55:59.440]   - It hurts, I mean, it's not a pleasant thing to fail.
[02:55:59.440 --> 02:56:05.000]   I mean, you feel terrible to think, you know,
[02:56:05.000 --> 02:56:07.840]   when I lost any tournament was a good thing.
[02:56:07.840 --> 02:56:10.040]   You know, and think when I was getting beat up
[02:56:10.040 --> 02:56:12.520]   at the gym over and over again was a good thing.
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:14.080]   When I was getting there and getting smashed
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:16.800]   by all the good guys, to think I liked it.
[02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:20.240]   Well, I hate it, but it's my resilience that, you know,
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:22.720]   make me carry on until I succeed.
[02:56:22.720 --> 02:56:24.640]   Think I like to get tapped?
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:26.080]   Well, I'm the most competitive,
[02:56:26.080 --> 02:56:27.880]   one of the most competitive person you know.
[02:56:27.880 --> 02:56:32.200]   I hate to lose, but I accept.
[02:56:32.200 --> 02:56:35.240]   I mean, I just need to get better.
[02:56:35.240 --> 02:56:40.000]   Every single time I lost in the championship, I hate it.
[02:56:40.000 --> 02:56:42.720]   I've never screamed, no one never saw me screaming,
[02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:44.880]   shouting that, you know, I got robbed.
[02:56:44.880 --> 02:56:46.880]   You know, I should have won, the referee,
[02:56:46.880 --> 02:56:49.640]   you know, screwed me over.
[02:56:49.640 --> 02:56:52.280]   I mean, it's, okay.
[02:56:52.280 --> 02:56:55.320]   It happen, shit happens.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:56.640]   I need to get better,
[02:56:56.640 --> 02:56:59.400]   'cause I don't wanna be in that position ever again.
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:02.120]   So when I fight, if I'm better,
[02:57:02.120 --> 02:57:04.840]   if I tapped him, there's no question.
[02:57:04.840 --> 02:57:07.680]   I don't need to wait for the referee to decide
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:09.560]   that there was points or no points.
[02:57:09.560 --> 02:57:14.080]   If, you know, his interpretation, that made me better.
[02:57:14.080 --> 02:57:17.400]   'Cause I was even more determined to be better.
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:20.360]   In my mind, I have to tap everybody else.
[02:57:20.360 --> 02:57:21.640]   Winning is not enough.
[02:57:22.640 --> 02:57:25.160]   It's just objectively speaking,
[02:57:25.160 --> 02:57:28.200]   what you learn the most from
[02:57:28.200 --> 02:57:31.800]   is really wanting to succeed and then failing.
[02:57:31.800 --> 02:57:35.560]   And doing that often.
[02:57:35.560 --> 02:57:36.920]   That's the reality from a parent,
[02:57:36.920 --> 02:57:38.840]   from a teacher perspective, from anybody,
[02:57:38.840 --> 02:57:40.440]   from people you love.
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:44.520]   If they really wanna do something, help them do that thing.
[02:57:44.520 --> 02:57:46.480]   If you think they're gonna fail, good.
[02:57:46.480 --> 02:57:48.880]   Help them do that faster so they fail faster.
[02:57:48.880 --> 02:57:50.520]   - Of course. - They're gonna learn.
[02:57:50.520 --> 02:57:52.640]   The only way to succeed is failing.
[02:57:52.640 --> 02:57:53.800]   There is no other way.
[02:57:53.800 --> 02:57:55.880]   That's what people have to understand.
[02:57:55.880 --> 02:57:58.680]   Without failing, there is no success.
[02:57:58.680 --> 02:58:03.200]   - Since you've gotten a little softer,
[02:58:03.200 --> 02:58:05.280]   a little more emotionally open,
[02:58:05.280 --> 02:58:07.480]   what's the role of love in the human condition,
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:08.640]   Hajo Gracie?
[02:58:08.640 --> 02:58:10.480]   - Probably the most important thing.
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:13.800]   That's the basic of everything, right?
[02:58:13.800 --> 02:58:17.000]   It's, I mean, love brings the best of us.
[02:58:17.000 --> 02:58:19.000]   It's if we had more love and compassion
[02:58:20.000 --> 02:58:22.360]   from the other person,
[02:58:22.360 --> 02:58:26.480]   I think the world would be a more evolved species.
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:28.600]   The world would be a much better place than it is now.
[02:58:28.600 --> 02:58:31.160]   - Did friends, family help you along the way?
[02:58:31.160 --> 02:58:32.600]   - Yeah, a lot.
[02:58:32.600 --> 02:58:35.760]   I always had a lot of love and help from many people.
[02:58:35.760 --> 02:58:36.640]   That's why I succeed.
[02:58:36.640 --> 02:58:38.320]   I've never got here by myself.
[02:58:38.320 --> 02:58:42.000]   I had a lot of people who loved me,
[02:58:42.000 --> 02:58:45.280]   believed in me, and helped me get to be here today.
[02:58:45.280 --> 02:58:48.160]   - Well, I'm glad they did.
[02:58:48.160 --> 02:58:49.280]   And I'm glad you're here today.
[02:58:49.280 --> 02:58:50.120]   I'm a huge fan.
[02:58:50.120 --> 02:58:51.800]   It was an honor to meet you.
[02:58:51.800 --> 02:58:54.240]   It was an honor to hang out with you in Vegas,
[02:58:54.240 --> 02:58:56.160]   to hang out with you again today.
[02:58:56.160 --> 02:58:58.480]   I've just been a huge fan for a long time.
[02:58:58.480 --> 02:58:59.320]   - My pleasure, man.
[02:58:59.320 --> 02:59:00.760]   - Thank you for everything you're doing.
[02:59:00.760 --> 02:59:02.200]   Thank you for this conversation.
[02:59:02.200 --> 02:59:03.040]   It was awesome.
[02:59:03.040 --> 02:59:04.040]   - Thank you very much.
[02:59:04.040 --> 02:59:06.400]   - Thanks for listening to this conversation
[02:59:06.400 --> 02:59:07.640]   with Hajo Gracie.

[02:59:11.440 --> 02:59:13.520]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:59:13.520 --> 02:59:15.040]   from Hajo Gracie himself.
[02:59:15.920 --> 02:59:18.360]   Jiu-jitsu is simple.
[02:59:18.360 --> 02:59:19.920]   You just have to do it right.
[02:59:19.920 --> 02:59:22.120]   Thank you for listening,
[02:59:22.120 --> 02:59:23.960]   and hope to see you next time.

[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:29.160]   (upbeat music)
