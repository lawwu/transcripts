[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.560]   Two weeks back, we looked at missions
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.240]   and personal evangelism, the goal of it all.
[00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.680]   Why did Paul specifically give his life
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.720]   to spreading the gospel?
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.760]   And we got the answer.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.880]   Paul was all about winning, winning.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.400]   He mentions the word win five times in four verses
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.360]   in 1 Corinthians 9, verses 19 to 22.
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.520]   Now is our focus in APJ 1898 recently.
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.940]   It's pretty easy to speak of evangelism
[00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.100]   in the abstract like that.
[00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.560]   And it's far more challenging to actually do evangelism.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.160]   So today I want to encourage you with a story.
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.600]   This is the story of one man's attempt
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.560]   to win another man to Christ, a story of two neighbors.
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.020]   And it's a story that will challenge us
[00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.440]   to consider the all important question
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.520]   behind all of our evangelism.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.400]   What is Jesus worth to me?
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.040]   Your answer to that question
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.000]   becomes your shareable testimony.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.120]   It's what you offer others
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:04.480]   as you seek to win them to Christ.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.320]   When it comes to personal evangelism,
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.640]   I'm encouraged by gritty and honest stories
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.840]   of doubt and hesitation and overcoming fears.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.320]   And that's what we get today.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.260]   The story of one man, Pastor John,
[00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.440]   seeking to win his next door neighbor to Christ,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.460]   a man named Alan.
[00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.480]   And a very rare extended story told by Pastor John
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.280]   back in 1982, over 40 years ago.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.820]   Here it is.
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.800]   - I have a neighbor named Alan.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.080]   And he's a single man and in his 40s, I would guess.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.520]   When Noel and I moved into the neighborhood over here,
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.320]   I met him probably the first or second day.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.520]   And in that conversation,
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.720]   I asked if he went to church anywhere.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.400]   He said, "No."
[00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.300]   And my response to that was,
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.280]   "Well, you're sure welcome to come to Bethlehem anytime."
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.740]   Knew I was the pastor there, I told him that.
[00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.260]   And I dropped.
[00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.540]   Now, the reason I dropped it there,
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.760]   I mean, I assume when somebody says
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.820]   they don't go to church anywhere,
[00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.220]   that they probably don't know Christ,
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.220]   because Christ moves his people into fellowship.
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.780]   The reason I didn't follow up on that,
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.500]   though I suspected he needed the Lord very much,
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   is not because I had a very clear and wise strategy
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.620]   for reaching him in the next few weeks.
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.860]   It's because I was inept and my faith was not vital
[00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.580]   and Christ was not very precious to me at that moment,
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.920]   communicating to me a love for this man.
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.660]   Now, a year goes by.
[00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.860]   During the year from the summer of '80 to the summer of '81,
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.500]   I saw him, I don't know how many times,
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.860]   but never in any extended conversation,
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.820]   just passing along the way, "Hi, Alan."
[00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.460]   "Hi, John," and that was it, pretty much,
[00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.580]   even though he lives right next door.
[00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.660]   And during the year, I could hardly ever go to prayer
[00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.180]   without him coming to mind.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.560]   I would go to God feeling low sometimes and say,
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.980]   "God, I want power.
[00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.380]   "I want blessing on my life.
[00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.500]   "Is there anything standing between me and you?
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.340]   "Is there?"
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.260]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, every time.
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:23.500]   I felt so guilty.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.060]   And what happened was that I began to pray very fervently.
[00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.380]   And I asked the Lord to give me courage,
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.140]   most of all, love, that I'd be authentic,
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.740]   really care so that when I spoke, it was real.
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:46.780]   And then the Lord began very patiently
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.260]   to move me step by step.
[00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.420]   Here was step number one.
[00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.540]   He caused me in the spring to start carrying
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540]   this little booklet around,
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.460]   "Becoming a Christian" by John Stott.
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.260]   I'd carry it in this pocket right here every day.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.840]   And I vowed to the Lord, "Next time I see Alan,
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.280]   "and I'm gonna talk to him about his faith.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.180]   "I'm gonna tell him, 'Alan, I care about you,
[00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.900]   "'and this book has been a help to me,
[00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.820]   "'and maybe you could read it and we could talk about it.'"
[00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:14.060]   That was my tactic.
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.420]   The Lord laid that on my heart.
[00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:21.340]   Okay, summer all the way through up to July,
[00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.780]   end of July, and it's time to go on vacation.
[00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.980]   Never seen him, hadn't seen him for three months.
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.740]   By carrying this thing the whole time, it's all shabby.
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.460]   I got a new one out and put it in my pocket.
[00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:34.220]   Then I think it was about the day before vacation,
[00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.900]   just before August, I had to get some grading done
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.900]   on the side of the house.
[00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.460]   And I had to get his permission
[00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.760]   'cause it was gonna go over into his yard, I thought,
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.700]   and told him about the grading.
[00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:46.540]   Is that okay?
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.900]   Oh, sure.
[00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.900]   Alan, I said, "You remember last time we talked,
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.860]   "you said you didn't go to church anywhere,
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.040]   "and I assume that means you don't have much interest
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.980]   "in Jesus either, and you probably know
[00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.500]   "that I count him as my Lord,
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.140]   "and I'm really concerned when people don't care
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.340]   "about Jesus, and I've been carrying this book around
[00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:12.740]   "for three months in hopes to give it to you
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.660]   "so that maybe we could talk about what it means
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.660]   "to trust Christ.
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.860]   "Would you mind reading it?"
[00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.860]   Sure, I'll read it.
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:24.820]   He was going to the Boundary Waters the next day.
[00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.460]   He took it very courteously, thanked me for it,
[00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.580]   and the last I saw of him, he took Christmas.
[00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.380]   But I'm getting ahead of myself.
[00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.100]   After that, I was in constant prayer
[00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.260]   about how I should follow up on this.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.380]   You just can't.
[00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:40.380]   If you really care about somebody,
[00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.300]   you don't stick 'em with literature and run away.
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.940]   What do I do next, Lord?
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.500]   What's the next move?
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.620]   One Monday morning in the fall,
[00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:55.500]   I was praying back here in my study,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.940]   and I couldn't get off my knees
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.140]   until I made a vow to the Lord.
[00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.380]   And what I vowed was I'll call him tonight.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.820]   Then I got up, and I told these interns that afternoon,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.180]   "Guys, I'm gonna call him tonight,
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:16.940]   "and I'm gonna ask him if we could talk about the book."
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.940]   And they prayed for me, and 7.30, I called him.
[00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:21.140]   He wasn't home.
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.980]   Called him again.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:22.820]   He wasn't home.
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.300]   He didn't come home all night.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.140]   I felt good.
[00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.860]   I'd never, I hadn't done that for a long time,
[00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.860]   and that made me feel good that at least I'd done that.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.740]   Now, I didn't feel right to call him the next night
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.500]   because the Lord started to lay on me another thing.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.620]   Forget the phone.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.820]   Let's have a face-to-face.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.660]   Go.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.660]   Jesus went.
[00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.100]   Go.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.380]   Quit this intermediate stuff, and go if you care.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.660]   Now, the next thing that happened
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:55.380]   was this Christmas open house we had.
[00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:58.020]   That was end of November, and he came.
[00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:00.500]   That's the first time I'd seen him since July.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:02.180]   But the living room was just full of people.
[00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:03.460]   We sat on the floor together.
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.980]   He felt so good to be there.
[00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:06.580]   He's just natural and nice.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:07.420]   Great.
[00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.820]   He's not as scared of me,
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.140]   and that's good,
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:12.140]   but I didn't ask him about the book fair
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:13.700]   because there's so many people around.
[00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:15.980]   I don't know whether I should have or not, but I did.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:18.180]   And he left, and I felt good that he had felt free to come,
[00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:21.980]   and I felt like now I know he's not afraid of me,
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.340]   and so we can be natural with each other.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.180]   And then I did something that I recommend to everybody.
[00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:32.460]   Monday, December 14th, I took a retreat day.
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:35.860]   For five hours, I prayed and read the Bible,
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.860]   and the Lord laid on me a great burden
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.900]   for last week's sermon and this week's sermon,
[00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:47.100]   and I suspected very strongly I couldn't preach it
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:49.940]   if I didn't follow through without it.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:52.420]   That's the pressure for a preacher.
[00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:54.980]   The fruitlessness of our witness at Bethlehem
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.580]   really weighed on me,
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.580]   and I knew the problem was as much with me
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.540]   as with any of you,
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.340]   and therefore, as a leader and a pastor,
[00:08:04.340 --> 00:08:09.180]   I knew some changes had to be made in me.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.740]   Sure, I witness every Sunday from this pulpit,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.860]   and you may think, "Oh, Piper, he's so fortunate.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.700]   He can just declare the Word all the time and feel great."
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.620]   And I talk to people about the Lord in my study
[00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:19.700]   every time they come there.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:23.340]   I hardly let anybody get out without the Gospel.
[00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:24.900]   That's easy.
[00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:29.060]   But when it comes to going to the people in the world
[00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:31.260]   where they are, like Jesus did,
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:33.860]   I am as hesitant as any of you,
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:36.780]   so don't think any differently.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:38.860]   We're all in it together.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:42.340]   I knew something had to give in me.
[00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.500]   Something had to snap.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:47.820]   Some long ingrained fears had to be overcome
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.260]   if I was going to be any authentic minister.
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.380]   If I was going to keep going as pastor,
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.380]   I said to myself,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:58.140]   "I have to quit denying the Gospel through silence."
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.100]   If I'm going to stand in this pulpit and say to you,
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:01.820]   "Love your neighbor, love your neighbor,
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.140]   love your neighbor,"
[00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:07.620]   I had to quit contradicting that command by my own neglect.
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.540]   So, December 23rd rolled around.
[00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.780]   Early before breakfast, I was praying downstairs.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:15.900]   And the Lord did something He hasn't done
[00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:19.340]   for ever in one sense to me.
[00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:22.340]   I was wrestling, wanting the resolve,
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.060]   yet not wanting the resolve
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.460]   to get up off my knees and go.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:29.540]   And the Lord would not let me up
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:30.940]   until I vowed to do it.
[00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.140]   At night.
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:37.260]   Now, besides 18 months of prayer
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:40.580]   and faltering and little baby steps,
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.740]   the thing that brought me to that point
[00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:44.300]   was this question,
[00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:47.020]   how much is Jesus worth?
[00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.820]   And I took one of these big yellow sheets of paper
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.620]   and I laid it beside me on the couch
[00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:54.140]   where I was kneeling.
[00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:56.940]   And I wrote for myself,
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.060]   "How much is Jesus worth?"
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:01.180]   at the top of the page.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:03.580]   And then here's what I wrote in answer.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.260]   "Jesus, I would rather have You
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:08.540]   as my Savior and Leader
[00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:10.620]   than keep my health,
[00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:12.860]   have my sons and wife,
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.100]   or preserve my own life.
[00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.980]   You are more valuable to me
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:18.900]   than all I own,
[00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.180]   all the friendships I cherish,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.500]   all the pastimes I enjoy,
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.740]   and all my plans for the future."
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.220]   And then I wrote, "Why?"
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.540]   Why is He so valuable?
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.500]   And I wrote three answers.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:38.700]   First, "Jesus, I could have no peace with God
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.100]   without You.
[00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.100]   My conscience declares to me
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:45.100]   there is a God and I am an accountable sinner.
[00:10:45.100 --> 00:10:47.500]   And without Your death on the cross, Jesus,
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.700]   I would live daily in the misery of guilt."
[00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.700]   Second, "Jesus, without You,
[00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:58.700]   my life would be like a ship without a rudder
[00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:02.700]   in a sea of time with no destination at all.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.500]   I want meaning and significance to my life.
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.100]   And I know if the Bible is true,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:11.460]   only You can give that meaning
[00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.580]   because You give meaning to the whole universe."
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:16.540]   And then third, I wrote,
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.180]   "Without You, Jesus, eternity and death
[00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:21.660]   would be fearsome to me.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.060]   But God sent You into the world
[00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:25.380]   so lovingly
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.020]   that if I just believe on You,
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:29.820]   I need not perish but have eternal life."
[00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:33.220]   And I put a text with each one of those reasons
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.740]   for why He is so valuable to me.
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.740]   And I jumped up off the floor
[00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:41.020]   and I said, "I'm gonna read that to Alan McCook today."
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:42.820]   And I went over and typed it on a piece of paper
[00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:43.660]   so I could give it to him.
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.940]   I haven't typed for years.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.940]   Typed on a piece of paper so I could give it to him.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.180]   Before I left the room, I asked the Lord for a promise.
[00:11:51.180 --> 00:11:52.260]   I need a promise, Lord,
[00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.900]   'cause I'm gonna chicken out today.
[00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:54.820]   I'm gonna chicken out
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:56.820]   if You don't give me a promise.
[00:11:56.820 --> 00:11:58.100]   And you know what He gave me?
[00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.500]   Chariots of Fire, the movie.
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.260]   And the text,
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:05.500]   "He who honors me, I will honor."
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:07.260]   Comes from 1 Samuel 2:30.
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.500]   And I looked up another one.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.820]   "If anyone serves me," Jesus said,
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.460]   "the Father will honor him."
[00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:15.140]   And I just paraphrased that for myself.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.980]   I said, "Okay, if that's true,
[00:12:16.980 --> 00:12:20.300]   then it means He who aims in love
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.100]   to testify of my value, I will honor."
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:26.740]   And the Lord opened my eyes to see
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.100]   there is nothing in the world more valuable
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.100]   than to be honored by God.
[00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.940]   And I fought the battle all day with that text.
[00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:34.780]   And it was great.
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:37.020]   At noontime, I went to Logos Bookstore
[00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.780]   and bought "A New Testament"
[00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:40.900]   and "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.920]   And I wrote a message of hope
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:45.940]   and a prayer in each one of those.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.740]   And I wrapped 'em up as a Christmas present.
[00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:53.420]   And that night, we had guests for supper.
[00:12:53.420 --> 00:12:56.860]   And after supper, I asked these people,
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.340]   I told 'em what I was gonna do,
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:13:00.160]   and asked 'em if they would pray for me
[00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.340]   while I go next door.
[00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:04.460]   And we prayed, and I called.
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.140]   "Hello, Alan?
[00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.980]   This is John Piper, your neighbor.
[00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:11.100]   I've got a Christmas present for you.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.660]   Can I bring it over?"
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:14.260]   "Sure."
[00:13:14.260 --> 00:13:15.740]   He's home.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:16.980]   Great.
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.300]   Victory number one.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.540]   And I go over and knock on his door,
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:21.460]   and he lets me in.
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.740]   We stand there in the living room,
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:24.540]   and the television is on.
[00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:28.260]   And I say, "I got a couple of books here
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.540]   I wanted to give you for Christmas.
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:34.100]   And there's something else I wanna say, too.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:35.380]   Is it okay?"
[00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.220]   "Sure."
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:41.260]   I said, "You know from our conversations
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.180]   that Jesus is real important to me,
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:48.460]   and I know that you don't believe in him the way I do.
[00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:50.900]   And I've been praying for you every day
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.700]   for almost a year.
[00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.740]   And I just felt this morning like I had to come tell you
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.820]   why Jesus is so valuable to me.
[00:13:59.820 --> 00:14:03.460]   'Cause I'd like like crazy for you to believe in him, too."
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:05.220]   And I took out this piece of paper.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.920]   I was gonna read it,
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.340]   but the television was on right there beside me.
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.060]   I just can't imagine the atmosphere.
[00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.060]   It was so rotten for sharing something so precious.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:16.180]   So instead of reading it, I just held it.
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:18.500]   I wrote these down, I'll leave them with you.
[00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.660]   And I paraphrased.
[00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:21.500]   So this is how important he is to me.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:22.780]   And I said, "These are the reasons."
[00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.660]   I gave him those three reasons in my own words.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:29.060]   And then I said, "Al, have you ever desired
[00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:30.300]   that kind of a relationship?
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:34.620]   Have you ever wanted to know Jesus like that?"
[00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:38.540]   And he said, "Turn off the television, sit down."
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:40.940]   (Al gasps)
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:41.940]   That's great.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.580]   And we sat down on the couch and talked.
[00:14:44.580 --> 00:14:46.980]   And among the things that we said,
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.420]   he said, "I read that book, 'In the Boundary Waters,'
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.060]   and I heard some Christians singing a song
[00:14:54.060 --> 00:14:55.460]   in the boundary waters."
[00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:58.020]   And I said, "That might be kind of nice
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:15:00.420]   to have faith like that."
[00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:03.900]   And I said, "What hinders, what's the hindrance?
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:07.940]   Why, is it what it would cost, lifestyle,
[00:15:07.940 --> 00:15:10.580]   or is it intellectual problems?"
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:12.300]   And he said, "Yeah, the latter."
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.980]   And I said, "Well, one of these books,
[00:15:14.980 --> 00:15:16.900]   C.S. Lewis, was a tremendous help to me
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.780]   when I was a freshman in college,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.700]   overcoming lots of those hindrances.
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.860]   And I'd love to talk with you about that book
[00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:25.820]   and about those problems."
[00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:28.580]   And he said, "Yeah, that would be great.
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:29.620]   Could we talk again?"
[00:15:29.620 --> 00:15:32.860]   "Sure, thank you for my concern."
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:36.380]   Now, that's where the story stands today,
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.700]   that I pray for him every day.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.820]   Now, that's the first time I ever did that in my life.
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:43.700]   Go to a neighbor, I've talked to other people
[00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:45.220]   about the Lord, a neighbor,
[00:15:45.220 --> 00:15:46.820]   the hardest people to witness to,
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:50.740]   and go into his house and say, "I love Jesus.
[00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.060]   It's so important to believe in Jesus.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:53.780]   Can I tell you why it's important?"
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:54.860]   And I did it.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.260]   And I would do some things very differently.
[00:15:58.260 --> 00:15:59.780]   Retrospect is always better.
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:02.540]   You learn by experience.
[00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:05.380]   Now, here's the lessons for us from that story.
[00:16:05.380 --> 00:16:07.300]   Number one, God is patient.
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:09.060]   Don't give up on God.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.820]   He's patient.
[00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:15.140]   18 months of guilt feelings, and he did not abandon me.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:18.220]   Two, if you continue in prayer,
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:20.140]   this is all you've got to do, I promise,
[00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:22.860]   if you will not quit praying,
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.380]   the Lord will do the rest.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.420]   That's all. He'll get you one way or the other.
[00:16:26.420 --> 00:16:28.580]   All you need to do is pray.
[00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.380]   What we do is we feel so guilty
[00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:31.820]   every time the name comes to mind,
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.020]   we put it out. We blank it out.
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:36.420]   But if you don't blank it out and you keep praying,
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.500]   He'll do the rest. He'll make the way.
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:41.620]   And third, if you do what I did,
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:43.300]   take a piece of paper and write out
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:44.820]   how much is Jesus' worth,
[00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:46.060]   put that in your own words,
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.580]   and then say why, and write why.
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.460]   There's your testimony.
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:51.620]   And it's yours. It's authentic.
[00:16:51.620 --> 00:16:53.500]   Doesn't have to come from any book.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.220]   And you'll have a testimony,
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.980]   and you'll have the prayer support,
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:00.540]   and our church will be on the way to harvest in 1982.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:02.660]   - Such a relatable, honest, motivating,
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:05.820]   humbling, encouraging story.
[00:17:05.820 --> 00:17:06.780]   I find it encouraging.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.500]   At least this comes from John Pepper's sermon
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.380]   titled "How Much Is Jesus Worth?"
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:14.540]   Preached over 40 years ago on January 10th, 1982,
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.420]   the entire message is online at DesiringGod.org.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:22.380]   Well, the Apostle Paul, writing in 1 Timothy 1:15,
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:27.380]   declared himself to be the world's worst sinner.
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:30.060]   The world's worst sinner.
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:34.340]   So was that hyperbole or simple self-deprecation?
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.620]   Or was it true?
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.620]   Was Paul really the world's worst sinner?
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:42.180]   You want to know? I want to know.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.420]   A listener named Joel wants to know.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.380]   And so we'll ask Pastor John next time.
[00:17:47.380 --> 00:17:48.420]   We'll see you Friday.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:51.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:53.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:53.620 --> 00:18:03.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
