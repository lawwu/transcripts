[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   I think the thing that many of us worry about in terms of Silicon Valley more recently is it feels
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.400]   much more like it's in one industry town, which is dangerous. And it feels more like it's a bunch
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.800]   of industrial biomass rather than a bunch of smart, scrappy startups. And that's a recipe
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.000]   that feels much more like Detroit in the 1950s than it does like Silicon Valley in the 1960s.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.200]   100 years ago, that thing was called heroin. 200 years ago, that thing was called morphine. 300
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.360]   years ago, that thing was called laudanum, right? We have these new drugs which have come in,
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.400]   and they've never been safe. It's just a very different thing if you're saying,
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.880]   I'm going to give $100 to a poor Congolese farmer, or I'm going to give $10,000 to a
[00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:43.360]   long-term jobless person in Eastern Kentucky. Okay. Today, I have the pleasure of speaking
[00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.880]   with Professor Edward Glazer, who is the chair of the Harvard Department of Economics,
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.160]   and he is the author of the best books and papers about cities. So, Professor Glazer,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.360]   thanks for coming on the Lunar Society. Oh, thank you so much for having me on,
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.720]   especially given the Lunar Society pays homage to one of my favorite moments in urban innovation
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.440]   in Birmingham in the 18th century. Oh, wow. I didn't even catch that theme, but actually,
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.760]   yeah, that's a great time. Yeah. My first question, what advice would you give to Elon
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.240]   Musk about building the first cities on Mars? That's a great question.
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:31.600]   I mean, I think, in fact, demand for urbanism in Mars is going to be relatively limited. Cities
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.000]   are always shaped by the transportation costs that are dominant in the era in which they're
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.560]   created. That both determines the sort of micro shape of the city and determines its macro futures.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.720]   So, cities on Mars are, of course, going to be limited by the likely to be prohibitive cost of
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.520]   traveling back and forth to the mother planet. But we also have to understand what cars are people
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:00.640]   going to be using on Mars. I assume these are all going to be Teslas. I assume that everyone is going
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:06.160]   to be driving around in some sort of appropriate Tesla on Mars. So, it's going to be a very car
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:13.120]   oriented living. I think probably the best strategy on this is to create a fairly flexible plan,
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.440]   much like the 1811 grid plan in New York, that allows entrepreneurs to sort of change land use
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.400]   over time, to put a few bets on what's necessary in terms of infrastructure, and then just let the
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.400]   city evolve sort of organically. I think that's usually the best ways to trust more to individual
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.560]   initiative than to trust to central planning, at least in terms of micromanaging what goes where.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.240]   Gotcha. Now, since 9/11, many terrorist groups have obviously intended to cause harm to cities.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.680]   But by and large, at least in Western countries, they haven't managed to kill off thousands of
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.840]   people like they were able to do during 9/11. What explains this? Do you think cities are just
[00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.200]   more resilient to these kinds of attacks than we would have otherwise thought, or they're just not
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.880]   being creative enough? I don't know. I mean, there's also the question as to what the objectives
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:09.440]   are. I mean, even the 9/11 terrorists, their end game was not to kill urbanites in America. It was
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:18.320]   to affect change in Saudi Arabia or in the Middle East more generally. I think that's likely to be
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.320]   one major thing. We've also protected our cities better. I mean, if you think about it, there are
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.240]   two things that go on simultaneously when you collect economic activity in one place in terms
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.880]   of defense, one of which is they become targets. And of course, that's what we saw in 9/11. I mean,
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.320]   it's hard to think of a symbol that's clearer than those twin towers. But at the same time,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.440]   they're also defensible space. I mean, the origin of the urban agglomeration, the first use for
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.320]   cities and towns was the fact that they could be walled settlements. Those walls bringing together
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.040]   people collectively for defense is the ultimate reason why these towns came about. So the walls
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.880]   provided protection. And so I think the same thing is playing out with cities over the past 20 years,
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:06.240]   that just as, you know, New York was a target, it was also a place which in the years after 2001,
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.280]   the city ramped up their anti-terrorist efforts. They put together a sort of massive group,
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.240]   as London had previously done with, you know, the cameras everywhere. And in the case of London to
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.440]   try and affect the cameras that would then implement congestion pricing in London with
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:26.960]   the same cameras that we used against the Irish terrorists. So both effects go on. I think we've
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.120]   been both fortunate and I think shown the strength of cities in terms of protecting themselves.
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.280]   Yep. Yep. Now, if you look throughout history, there's like in the ancient world, at least,
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.920]   there's so many examples of empires that are basically synonymous with their capital cities.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.720]   You think of like something like Rome or Athens or Sparta. And today you would never think of
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:52.080]   America as the Washingtonian empire. So what is the explanation for why the capital city has
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:58.400]   become much less, much less salient in terms of the overall nation? Is it a sort of Coasian
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:07.680]   answer here or? So there are specific things that went on with English offshoot colonies,
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.400]   where they, in many cases, in part, because they recognize the tendency of the capital city
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.080]   to attract lots of excess goodies that have been taken from elsewhere in the country.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:27.040]   They located the capital city in a remote place. And this was very much, it's actually part of the
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.840]   story of the Hamilton musical in the room where it happened. Part of the deal in the room where
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:40.640]   it happened was about moving the capital of the US to a relatively remote Virginia location,
[00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:44.240]   rather than having it be in Philadelphia, New York. Although it wasn't Philadelphia, New York
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:50.400]   in the earlier days. Partially that was to reflect the fact that the South needed to be
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:56.480]   protected against all of the extra stuff going to New York and Philadelphia. And so whether or not
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:03.920]   this is Canberra or Ottawa, you see all of these English offshoot places having their capitals,
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:08.640]   very much not in the big metropoles. Whereas traditionally what's happened, particularly
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.080]   if these places have been around for centuries, is even if the capital didn't start off as the
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.160]   largest city, it became the largest city because centuries of French leaders thought their business
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:24.240]   was to take wealth from elsewhere in France and make Paris great. And I think certainly the French
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.920]   empire was as synonymous with Paris as most of those ancient empires were with their capital city
[00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:38.480]   as well. So I think that's the main back force. I guess the question I could throw back to you
[00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:47.360]   is the places where this is not true, Moscow, St. Peter's, Moscow, Beijing. Do we think that
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:54.400]   Beijing is less synonymous with China than the Roman empire is with Rome? Maybe a little,
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.240]   possibly just because China is so big and Beijing is a relatively small share of the overall
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:09.120]   population of China, but it's more so certainly than Washington DC is with New York, with the US.
[00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:13.520]   Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's an interesting, that's a really interesting answer.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:19.120]   Suppose a city goes through a period of decline. So maybe an important industry moved out,
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.600]   or maybe it's had a sequence of bad governance. Are you inclined to bet that there will be some
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.440]   sort of renewal or do you think that things will continue to get worse? In other words,
[00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.360]   are you a momentum trader or are you a reversion to the mean trader when it comes to cities?
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.640]   I can tell you different answers for different outcomes. So housing prices,
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:44.320]   I can tell you exactly what we know statistically about this, which is at higher frequencies,
[00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:51.280]   let's say one year, housing prices show wickedly large levels of momentum. For five years or more,
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.840]   they show very significant levels of mean reversion. So it's a short-term cycle in
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:01.600]   housing prices followed by a decline. Population just shows enormous persistence on the downside.
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.720]   And so what happens is you typically will have an economic shock that Detroit used to be the most
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.240]   productive place on the planet in 1950, bunch of shocks to transportation technology that means
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:20.560]   it's no longer such a great place to make cars for the world. And it takes a century for the city to
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:25.440]   respond in terms of its population because the housing is sticky, the housing remains there.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:31.840]   And so between 50 and 60, population declines a little bit, prices drop. They drop sufficiently
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:36.560]   far that you're not going to build a lot of new housing, but people are going to still stay in
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:40.640]   the houses. They're not going to become vacant. And so the people are still there because the
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:45.760]   houses are still there. 60 to 70, population drops a little bit further, prices kind of stay
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:50.960]   constant, but still it's not enough to build new housing. So the declines are incredibly persistent.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.760]   Growth, less so. So on the boom side, you have a boom over a 10 year period,
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.960]   that's likely to mean revert. So that's not nearly as persistent because it doesn't have this sticky
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:16.080]   housing element to it. In terms of GDP per capita, much more of a random walk there in terms of the
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:20.160]   straight income stuff. So it's the population that's really persistent, which is in fact,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.120]   the reality of persistent decline. Interesting. Interesting. Why don't Americans move as much
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:29.680]   as they used to a century ago? So you have a paper from 2018 titled "Jobs in the Heartland" where you
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:33.760]   talk about how there's increasing divergence between the unemployment rates between different
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:39.600]   parts of America. Why don't Americans just move to go to the places where there's better economic
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:43.200]   circumstances? I want to highlight one point here, which is you said unemployment rate,
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:47.760]   and I want to replace that with non-employment rate. And that's partially what we're seeing now,
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:53.040]   that in fact, the huge gap, and so it looks like America's labor force couldn't be better in terms
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:57.200]   of the low levels of unemployment. But what's happened over the last 50 years is a very large
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.560]   rise in the share of prime age men who are not in the labor force. So they've stopped looking for
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.440]   work. And those guys are miserable. It's not that those guys are somehow or other productive and
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:12.880]   happy not being employed. This is a very bad outcome for prime age men. I'm separating men
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:17.680]   from women, not to say that the female labor markets aren't just as important, just as
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:22.320]   fascinating, just as critical. But labor force participation means something different for many
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.680]   women than it does for men. And there are many women who are not in the labor force who are doing
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   things that are enormously productive socially, who are caring for their children, caring for
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.160]   their families. I wish it were symmetric across the genders. It just isn't true. I mean, there
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.760]   just are very few men who are not in the labor force who are doing anything much other than
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.760]   watching television, right? I mean, it's just a very different thing. So yes, there are big
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:48.400]   differences in the non-employment rate. There are some parts of America where for much of the past
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.800]   decade, one in four prime age men have been jobless. I mean, it's just an enormous gap.
[00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:58.400]   And the question is, why don't they get out? And I think the answers are really twofold. One of
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.880]   which is the nature of how housing markets have frozen up. So historically, housing in the US
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:09.840]   didn't cost that. The differences weren't that huge across places. Most parts of America had
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:14.400]   some kind of affordable housing. It was relatively easy to put up new housing. At the dawn of the
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:19.840]   20th century, these were kit helms sold by Sears and Roebuck that sprung up by the thousand. You
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.240]   bought the kit from Sears and Roebuck and you just built it yourself. And after World War II,
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.760]   it was mass-produced homes in places like Levittown. For most of the last 50 years,
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.000]   in places like coastal California or the East Coast, building has just gotten far more difficult.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.480]   And so with the decline of mass-produced housing, it's become far more expensive and it becomes
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:45.920]   harder and harder for relatively low-income people to find opportunity in places that have
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:53.680]   high levels of income, high levels of opportunity. And that's, I think, partially why there's not
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.680]   just a general decline in mobility. There's a decline in directed mobility for the poor,
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:03.200]   meaning historically poor people moved from poor areas to rich areas. That's pretty much stopped.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.720]   And in part, that's because rich areas just have very, very expensive housing.
[00:12:06.720 --> 00:12:14.080]   The other thing is the rising importance of the informal safety net. So if you think about most,
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:18.160]   particularly prime-aged men, they're not receiving significant handouts from the
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:23.840]   government except if they're on disability. But they will typically have some form of income,
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:27.840]   some form of housing that's being provided for them by someone other than themselves.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:33.040]   A third of them are living in their parents' homes, right? That informal safety net is usually
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:37.200]   very place-dependent, right? It's not like your parents, let's say you're living in Eastern
[00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.880]   Kentucky, it's not like your parents were going to buy you a condo in San Francisco. You can still
[00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:46.480]   have your own bedroom, but you can't go anywhere else and still get that level of support. And so
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.920]   that's, I think, another reason why we're increasingly stuck in place.
[00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.920]   The third you mentioned, is that a third of the non-employed population of young men,
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:00.640]   or is that a third of all young men? Non-employed, it's a third of non-employed
[00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:06.880]   prime-aged men. So that's 25 to 54. There are a lot of 45-year-olds who are living on their
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:10.800]   parents' couches, right? Or in their old bedroom. I mean, it's a fairly remarkable thing.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:16.320]   Yeah. Now, we'll get to housing in just a second. But first, I want to ask you,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:21.200]   if the fertility trends in East Asia and many other places continue,
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:25.520]   what will the impact on cities be if the average age gets much older,
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.040]   and there might even be some depopulation? So that's a really interesting question. The
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:42.800]   basic age fact on cities is that the sort of high-income or middle-income,
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:50.720]   prime-aged parents, cities tend to be relatively bad for them. So once you're in the sort of high
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:57.120]   end of the upper middle class, the distrust of our public school systems, merited or not,
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:04.240]   have means that that group tends to leave. You have plenty of parents with kids who are lower
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.840]   income. And then you have groups who are part of a barbell, a demographic barbell, who like cities.
[00:14:09.840 --> 00:14:14.560]   So this is partially about people who don't feel like they need the extra space, partially because
[00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:20.800]   if they're young, they're looking to find prospective mates of various forms. Cities
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:27.120]   are good for that. Urban proximity works well in the dating market. And they've got
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:31.520]   time on their hands to enjoy the tremendous amenities, the consumption advantages that
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:38.000]   cities have. Older people, it's less about finding a mate typically, but the urban consumption
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.720]   amenity has still value, the ability to go to museums, the ability to go to concerts. And
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:48.320]   that continues to draw people in. So I would have thought that going forward,
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.360]   I would have continued to expect the barbell dimension to persist until we actually get
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:15:01.120]   around to solving our urban schools and declining population levels. If anything,
[00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:05.840]   I would have thought that COVID skews you a bit younger because the older people are more anxious
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:11.200]   about... They remember that cities can also bring pandemics. They remember that it can be a nice
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:16.400]   thing to have a suburban home if you have to shelter in place. And so that might lead some
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:22.560]   people who would have otherwise relocated to a dense urban core to move out, to stay out.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:28.800]   You just mentioned urban schools. And you've written about how urban schools,
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:33.120]   that's one of the reasons why people who have children might not want to stay in cities.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   I'm curious why it's the case that American cities have some of the best colleges in the world,
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.200]   but for some reason, their K-12 is significantly worse or can be worse than the K-12 in other
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:49.760]   parts of the country. Why is it that the colleges are much better in cities, but K-12 is worse?
[00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:54.480]   So it's interesting. It's not as if... I don't think there's ever been an Englishman who felt
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:57.600]   like they had to leave London to get better schools for the kids or a Frenchman who thought
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.440]   they needed to leave Paris. It's not like there's something that's intrinsic to cities.
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:06.320]   But I've always thought it's a reflection of the fact that instead of allowing all of the
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:13.680]   competition and entrepreneurship that thrives in cities and that makes cities great,
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.120]   in the case of K-12 public education, that's vanished. And your example of colleges is
[00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:24.720]   exactly right. I'm in this industry. I'm a participant in this industry. And let me tell
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.440]   you, this industry is pretty competitive. Whether or not we're competing for the best students,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:34.720]   at our level, we go through an annual exercise of trying to make sure we get PhD students to
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.280]   come to our program instead of our competitors. Whether or not it's hiring faculty members,
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:46.400]   whether or not it's attracting undergraduates, we occupy a highly competitive industry where we are
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:50.080]   constantly aware of what we need to do to make ourselves better. It doesn't mean that we're
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.520]   great along every dimension, but at least we're trying. K-12 education has a local monopoly.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:04.880]   And so it's like you take the great urban food leisure and hospitality and food industries,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.920]   just take urban restaurants. And instead of having in New York City, like a hyper competitive world
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:13.040]   where you constantly have entry, you say, "You know what? We're going to have one publicly
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:17.600]   managed canteen. And it's going to provide all the food in New York City. And we're not going
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.720]   to allow any competitors or the competitors are going to have to pay a totally different thing."
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.160]   That canteen is probably going to serve pretty crappy food. And that's in some sense what happens
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.760]   when you have a large scale public monopoly that replaces private competition. But isn't that also
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:36.720]   true of rural schools? So why are urban schools often worse? There's much more competition in
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:42.720]   suburban schools. So in terms of the suburban schools, typically there are lots of suburbs,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:50.080]   people are competing amongst them. The other thing that's actually important is, and I don't want to
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:53.840]   over-exaggerate this, but I think it is something that we need to think a little bit about, which is
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:18:01.760]   the role of public sector unions and particularly teachers unions in these cases. So in the case of
[00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:08.640]   a suburban school district, the teachers union is no more empowered on the management side than they
[00:18:08.640 --> 00:18:12.560]   would be in the private sector. So a normal private sector, you've got a large company,
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.080]   you've got a union, they're arguing with each other. It's kind of a level playing field. It's
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:20.080]   all kind of reasonable. I mean, I'm not saying management has done awful things. Unions have done
[00:18:20.080 --> 00:18:23.840]   foolish things. I'm not saying either are perfect, but it's kind of a well-matched thing. It's kind
[00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:27.760]   of matched that way in the suburbs as well. You've got highly empowered parents who are
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   highly focused on their kids and they're not dominated. It's not like the teachers union
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:38.080]   dominates elections in Westchester County. Whereas if you go into a big city school district, you
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:42.400]   have two things going on. One of which is the teachers tend to be highly involved politically
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:47.920]   and quite capable of influencing management essentially, because they are an electoral
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.600]   force to be reckoned with, not just by the direct votes, but also with their campaign spending.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:56.320]   And on top of this, you're talking about a larger group of disparate parents, many of whom have
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.120]   lots of challenges to face and it becomes much harder for them to sort of organize effectively
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:07.360]   on the other side. So for those reasons, our big urban schools, they can do great things and many
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:13.600]   individual teachers can be fantastic, but it's an ongoing challenge. Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:18.800]   What is your opinion on Georgism? Do cities need a land value tax? Would it be better if all the
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:25.680]   other taxes were replaced by one? Okay. So Henry George, I don't know any economist who doesn't
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:31.680]   think that a land value tax is an attractive idea. And one of the reasons, so the basic idea is we're
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.960]   going to tax land, let's say, rather than taxing real estate values. And you would probably
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:43.680]   implement this in practice by evaluating the real estate and then subtracting the cost of
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:47.440]   construction, at least for anything that was built up, meaning you'd form some value of the
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:52.880]   structures and you just subtract it. The attractive thing is, from most of our perspective, is it
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.680]   doesn't create the same disincentive to build that a real estate tax does. A real estate tax says,
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:02.720]   "Oh, you know what? I might want to keep this thing as a parking lot for a couple of years,
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:07.600]   so I don't have to pay taxes on it." If it were a land value tax, you're going to pay the same tax,
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:09.920]   whether or not it's a parking lot or whether or not you're going to put a high-rise on it,
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:15.760]   so you might as well put the high-rise on it. And we could use the space. So I think by and large,
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.320]   that's a perfectly sensible idea. I'd like to see more places using land value taxes or using land
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   value taxes in exchange for property taxes. Where George got it wrong is the idea that a land value
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.720]   tax is going to solve all the problems of society or all the problems of cities is ludicrously not
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.520]   true. One can make an argument that in those places that just have a property tax that you
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:41.920]   could replace it with a land value tax with little loss, but at the national level, it's not a
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:46.000]   particularly progressive tax in lots of ways. It would be hard to figure out how to fund all the
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   things you want to fund, especially since there are lots of things that we do that are not very
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.160]   land-intensive. I think George was imagining a world in which pretty much all value-creating
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:58.640]   enterprises had a lot of land engaged. So a good idea, yes. A panacea, no.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:03.840]   No, that's a good point. I mean, Google's offices in San Francisco are probably generating more
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.800]   value than you would surmise just from the quantity of land they have there.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:14.000]   Do American cities need more great builders like Robert Moses?
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:24.480]   So Robert Caro's The Power Broker is one of the great biographies of the past hundred years,
[00:21:24.480 --> 00:21:28.640]   unquestionably. The only biography that I think is clearly better is Robert Caro's
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:34.320]   biography of Lyndon Baines Johnson, right? I mean, Caro is truly amazing. That being said,
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:41.760]   I would not exactly call it a fair and balanced view of Robert. I mean, it is true that Robert
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:47.440]   Moses was high-handed, and it is true that there are things that he did that were terrible, that
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.880]   you never want to do again. But on the other hand, the man got stuff built. I mean, I think of
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:57.200]   myself as a child growing up in New York City, and whether or not it was the public pool that I swam
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:02.160]   in, or the parks that I played in, or the roads that I traveled on, they were all delivered by
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.440]   Robert Moses. And there's got to be a middle ground, which is, no, we're not going to run
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.960]   roughshod over the neighborhood like Robert Moses did, but we're still going to build stuff. We're
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.280]   still going to deliver new infrastructure. And we're going to do it not for 10 times more than
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.560]   every other country in the world does it. We're actually going to have sensible procurement
[00:22:18.560 --> 00:22:23.600]   policies that bring in things at a reasonable cost. And I think we need to balance a little
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:28.880]   bit back towards Robert Moses in order to have slightly more empowered builders who actually
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.160]   are able to deliver American cities the infrastructure that they need at an affordable
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:41.680]   cost. Yep, yep. Do we have too much democracy at the local level? So you wrote a paper in 2017
[00:22:41.680 --> 00:22:46.000]   titled The Political Economy of Transportation Investments. And one of the points you make
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.440]   there is that the local costs are much more salient to people for new construction than
[00:22:51.440 --> 00:22:55.760]   the public benefits and the benefits to newcomers would be. Does that mean we have too much
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:23:01.840]   federalism? Should we just have far less power at the city level? So not universally. There are lots
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:09.280]   of good things that local control does. I do think we have too much local ability to say no to new
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:15.680]   housing projects. So that's a particular case that I'm focused on. And I think it's exactly right
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:22.480]   that the near neighbors to a project internalize all of the extra noise and perhaps extra traffic
[00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:25.760]   that they're going to have due to this project. They probably overestimate it because they are
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:30.720]   engaging in a bit of status quo bias and they think the present is great and can't imagine any
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:38.560]   change. By contrast, none of the people who would benefit from the new project are able to vote.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.440]   All of the families that would love to move into this neighborhood but are being zoned out by the
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.920]   insiders get a say. And I think the goal is to make sure that we have more ability to speak
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.320]   for outsiders. Cities at their best are places where outsiders can find opportunity. That's
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:01.040]   part of what's so great about them. And it's a sort of tragic thing that we make that so hard.
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:05.520]   Now, I'm not sure exactly that I'm claiming that I want less democracy, but I do want more
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.560]   limitations on how much regulation localities can do. So I think there are certainly certain
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:17.040]   limitations on local power that I think are fine. I mean, basically, this is not,
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:22.800]   I would prefer to call this not a limitation on local democracy, but an increase in the protection
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:26.960]   of individual rights or the individual rights of landowners to do what they want with their land.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.440]   So, I mean, which in effect is a limit on democracy, but the Bill of Rights is a limit
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.720]   on democracy, right? The Bill of Rights says that in fact, they don't care if 51% of your voters
[00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:40.960]   want to take away your right to free assembly, they're not allowed to do that. And so in some
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.720]   sense, what I'm just arguing for is more property owners' rights so that they can actually allow
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:49.680]   more housing on their building. In terms of transportation projects, it's a little bit
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:55.440]   dicier because here the builder is the government itself. And there again, I think the question is,
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:25:00.080]   like you want everyone to have a voice. You don't want every neighborhood to have a veto over every
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:04.640]   potential housing project or potential transportation project. And so you need
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.240]   something that is done more at the state level with representation from the locality,
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.400]   but without the localities getting the ultimate say.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:16.720]   - Yeah, yeah. I wonder if that paper implies that I should be shorting highly educated areas,
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.800]   or at least in terms of real estate, because one of the things you mentioned in the paper was that
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:25.360]   highly educated areas have much higher opposition or able to like foment much more opposition.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.440]   - You shouldn't short, it's those places, it's places that used to, yes. Okay,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.840]   so here's the real estate strategy, which I have heard that actually there are buyers who do this.
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.840]   But in fact, you take an area that has historically been very pro-housing. And so it's got lots of
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.760]   housing, it's affordable right now because supply is good, but it's lots of educated people have
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:48.560]   moved in. Okay, which means that going forward, they're going to build much less, which means that
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:53.440]   going forward, they're likely to become much more expensive. So in fact, you should in fact,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.680]   buy that stuff or buy options on that stuff rather than shorting it. You should short,
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.840]   if you have a security that is related to the population level in that community,
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.640]   yeah, you should short that because the population growth is going to go down,
[00:26:04.640 --> 00:26:10.160]   but the prices are likely to go up. - Yep, yep. So you wrote a paper last
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.320]   year on the opioid epidemic, and you're going to explain in more detail, but one of the points
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:19.680]   that you made there was that the opioid epidemic can be explained just by the demand side stuff
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:27.040]   about social isolation and joblessness. And I wonder how this analysis, what it makes you think
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:31.280]   about, like, let's say there is mass scale automation in the future, just assume that that
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:35.760]   might be the case. What impact do you think that would have and assume it's paired with universal
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.760]   basic income or something like that? Do you think it would cause a tremendous increase in opioid
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:47.440]   abuse or do you think that that would? - So we're actually, I would have phrased it
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:58.400]   slightly differently, which is as opposed to the work of, I mean, of, and they're two amazing
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:27:07.120]   economists, Anne Case and Angus Deaton, who really emphasize the role of deaths of despair.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:16.320]   We are much more focused on the supply side. So that doesn't mean that the demand side, meaning
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:23.600]   like just the way that we handled the distribution of large scale pain relieving medicines, right? So
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:31.120]   we tell a story where every 30 to 50 years, someone comes up with the same sort of idea,
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:35.840]   which is we know that human beings love opioids in different forms, right? We also know they're
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.280]   highly addicted and lead to sort of a terrible cycle. So all of a sudden comes along this
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.720]   innovator and says, you know what, I've got a new opioid and you know, it's safe. You don't have to
[00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:49.680]   worry about getting addicted from this one. It's magical, it won't work. And you know, 100 years
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:54.160]   ago, that thing was called heroin. 200 years ago, that thing was called morphine. 300 years ago,
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.320]   that thing was called Maldenum, right? We have these new drugs which have come in and they've
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:04.400]   never been safe, but you know, in our case, it was OxyContin and you know, the magic of the time
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:11.280]   relief was supposed to make it safe and it wasn't safe. And there's a lot of great work that just
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:17.040]   shows that the patterns of opioid use was related to the places that just had a lot of pain 30 years
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:23.680]   ago. So just those places with a lot of, you know, prescribing various things for pain when opioids
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.800]   came in, when OxyContin came in, those were the places that got addicted most. Now it's also true
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:35.920]   that there are links with these economic issues. There are links with joblessness. And I basically
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:41.360]   do believe that things that create joblessness are pretty terrible and are actually much worse
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:47.040]   than income inequality. I push back against the universal basic income advocates who I think are
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:51.680]   basically engaging in a materialist fallacy of thinking that a human being's life is shaped by
[00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:59.120]   their take on pay or their unearned pay. I think for most people, a job is much more than that.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:04.160]   A job is a sense of purpose. A job is a sense of social connection. And when you look at human
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:08.880]   misery and opioid use, right, you look at the difference between, you know, high-income earners,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.880]   mid-income earners, you know, there are differences, but they're small. You then look at the
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:17.520]   difference between low-income earners and the jobless, then, you know, unhappiness spikes
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:22.640]   enormously. Misery spikes enormously. Family breakups spike enormously. And so things like
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:27.040]   universal basic income, which, you know, the negative income tax experiments in the 1970s,
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:31.120]   which are the closest thing we have towards large-scale experiments in this area, which had
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:37.520]   very large effects of joblessness, of just giving people, you know, money, they feel quite dangerous
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:41.680]   to me because they feel like they're going to play into rising joblessness in America, which
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:48.640]   feels like a path towards misery. I want to, though, just quickly deviate. And some of the UBI
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:55.920]   advocates have brought together UBI in the U.S. and UBI in the developing world. So UBI in the
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.320]   developing world, which means basically you give poor farmers in sub-Saharan Africa fairly modest
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:04.640]   amounts of money, this is a totally sensible strategy. These people are not about to, like,
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:10.240]   live life permanently not working. You know, they're darn poor. It's very efficient relative
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:15.840]   to other ways of giving, right? And so I am in no sense pushing back on UBI with modest amounts of
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:19.280]   money in the poorest parts of the world. By all means, it's been deemed to be effective. It's
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.680]   just a very different thing if you're saying I'm going to give $100 to a poor Congolese farmer,
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:29.680]   or I'm going to give, you know, $10,000 to a long-term jobless person in eastern Kentucky.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:34.800]   Right, right. You're not buying a PS5 with $100 in Congo.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:35.300]   That's right.
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:41.680]   So I wanted to ask you about remote work. So you write in The Survival of the City,
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.560]   "Improvements in information technology can lead to more demand for face-to-face contact
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:50.720]   because FaceTime complements time spent communicating electronically."
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:58.160]   And I'm curious, what distinguishes situations where, you know, FaceTime substitutes for in-person
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:31:04.640]   contact and the situations where it complements FaceTime complements in-person, sorry, or I mean
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:13.840]   virtual contact? So there's not a universal rule on this. I just want to sort of, let's, so that
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.880]   paper, the paper that was based on this, which I wrote in the early 1990s, on our face-to-face
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:24.560]   contacts complements or substitutes for electronic contacts, was really motivated by a lot of anxiety
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:30.880]   in the 1970s that, you know, the information technology of their day, the fax machine,
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:34.160]   the personal computer, was going to make face-to-face contact in the cities that enable
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:38.720]   that contact to obsolete. That, you know, discussion has reappeared amazingly in the
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:46.400]   past two and a half years because of Zoom, right? And all of those questions still resonate.
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:52.480]   I think in the short run, typically these things are substitutes, right? Typically you don't,
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:56.560]   you know, you don't necessarily need to meet some person who's your, you know,
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:00.320]   your long-term contact. You can actually just telephone them or you can connect with them
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:04.560]   electronically. In the long run, they seem to be much more likely to be complements,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:10.480]   part because these technologies change our world. I mean, the story that I tell over the last 40
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.400]   years is that, yes, there were some face-to-face contacts that were made unnecessary because of
[00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:20.560]   electronic interactions. But, you know, it's not just that cities did well over the past 40 years.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.760]   Business travel went through the roof over the past 40 years. And you'd think that that would
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.960]   have been made unnecessary by all these electronic interactions. And I think what just happened was
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:34.640]   that these new technologies and globalization created a more interconnected world, made it a
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   world in which knowledge was more important. And we become smart by interacting with people
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:43.440]   face-to-face. And this world that became more knowledge and information intensive and more
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.880]   complicated, right? And as things get more complicated, it's easier for ideas to get
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.440]   lost in translation. And we have these wonderful cues for communicating comprehension or confusion
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.520]   that are lost when we're not in the same room with one another. So I think over the longer time,
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.880]   they tend to be complements. And over the shorter term, they tend to be substitutes.
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:08.160]   One of the things I think that was helpful in my earlier work on this was looking at the history
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:14.320]   of information technology innovations. I think probably the first one is the book, right? It's
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:18.400]   hard to imagine the book with movable type, Gutenberg, right? It's hard to imagine an
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:23.760]   innovation that did more to flatten distance in the book, right? Now you can read stuff that people
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:28.640]   are saying hundreds of miles away. And yet there's not a shred of evidence that the book led to less
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.520]   urbanization in Europe or to less connection. It helped create a totally different world in which
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:37.840]   people were passionate about ideas and wanted to talk to each other. And they wanted to talk to
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.800]   each other about their books. And then flash forward 350 years, and we have the telephone.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:48.480]   And again, telephones started being used more in cities, and they were used mostly by people who
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:53.760]   were going to meet face to face. And again, no evidence that this has created a decline in the
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:57.680]   demand for face-to-face contact or a decline in the demand for cities. So I think if we look at
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:01.840]   Zoom, which unquestionably has allowed a certain amount of long distance contact, that's very,
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:08.320]   very useful. And in the short run, it certainly poses a threat to urban office markets. My guess
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:13.840]   is in the long run, it's probably going to be likely to be neutral at worst for face-to-face
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.280]   contact in the cities that enable that contact. >> Yeah, yeah. No, I think that my podcast has
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:24.000]   been a great example for me about this where, I mean, like right now we're talking virtually.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.520]   So maybe in a way it's like substituted, maybe I would have interviewed in person
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:32.320]   without the podcast. But in another way, I've met so many people that I've interviewed on the podcast
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:37.040]   or who are disconnected with me because of the podcast in person. And the amount of in-person
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:43.200]   interactions I've had because of a virtual podcast is a great anecdote to what you're
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:45.280]   talking about. >> That makes total sense. Absolutely.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:51.680]   >> Yeah. Why do even the best software engineers in India or in Europe make so much less when
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:56.240]   they're working remotely from those locations than remote engineers working in America make?
[00:34:56.240 --> 00:35:01.200]   I mean, why don't employers just pay them more until the price discrepancy goes away?
[00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:06.720]   >> That's interesting. I don't fully know the answer to that question.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:14.640]   I would suspect some of it just has to do with the nature of supply and demand. So there are
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.960]   some things that are just very hard to be done remotely, right? So either because you have sort
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:24.480]   of very precise informational needs that's easier to communicate to people who are nearby, or the
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:29.760]   person who's nearby has evolved in ways in terms of their mind that they actually know exactly what
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:37.280]   you want and they have exactly the product that you need. And so even though the remote call center
[00:35:37.280 --> 00:35:43.280]   worker and the local one may be totally equivalent on raw programming talent, you may still end up
[00:35:43.280 --> 00:35:47.120]   in equilibrium and be willing to pay a lot more to the local one just because, right?
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.760]   So there's a slightly differentiated skill that the local one has. And look, there's just a lot
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:56.480]   of competition for the remote ones. And so the price is going to be pretty low. And there's not
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:00.240]   that much supply of the one guy who's down the hall who knows exactly what you're looking for.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:04.640]   And so that guy gets much higher wages, even though, just because he can offer you something
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.520]   that no one else can exactly reproduce. >> But let me clarify my question. I meant
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:15.760]   even remote engineers in America will make more than remote engineers in Europe or in India. So
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:20.240]   if somebody is like working remotely, but he just happens to live in the US, is that just because
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:28.160]   they can communicate in English in the same way? What explains that? >> I would take the same
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:33.520]   stance. I would say that they're likely to have just skills that are somewhat idiosyncratic and
[00:36:33.520 --> 00:36:39.200]   are valued in the US context. >> Are you optimistic about the ability of the metaverse and VR to be
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:45.040]   able to better puncture whatever makes in-person contact so valuable? >> No, I do not think the
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:50.240]   metaverse is going to change very much. I do think that there will be a lot of hours spent
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:54.720]   on various forms of gaming over the next 20 years that I'm very confident about, but I don't think
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:37:01.920]   it ultimately poses much of a threat to real world interaction. In some sense, we saw this with the
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.560]   teenage world over the last three years. We saw a lot of America spend an awful lot of time, 15,
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:14.640]   16 year olds, 17 year olds, gaming and connecting entirely virtually during the whole time of the
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:20.560]   pandemic lockdowns. Every single person that I've seen of that cohort who, when you allow them to
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:25.280]   interact with real members of their group live, leapt at the opportunity, right? Leapt at the
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:29.440]   opportunity of meeting, of actually hanging out with real people until three o'clock in the
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:35.520]   morning and arguing over whatever it is, whether or not it's football or content. And I think,
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:43.120]   particularly for the young, living life live just beats the alternative.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:48.320]   Yeah. That sounds like a very Harvard scenario, the having to argue over football or content,
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:55.920]   those two topics. But are you predicting lower taxes over the coming decades in places like
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:02.240]   California and New York, specifically because of remote work, that it sets a sort of maximum bar
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:05.360]   of how much you can tax highly productive people before they will just leave?
[00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.760]   Okay. So I see this as being a central, it's a great question. It's a central issue of our day.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.640]   So here's how I think about it. And in part, it's why I wrote my recent book, Survival of the City,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:18.560]   is because I was so worried about this. Okay. Two things have happened simultaneously. One,
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:25.360]   as you correctly say, Zoom has made it easier to connect from anywhere. I don't think that Zoom is
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.840]   going to cause our tech startup currently in Silicon Valley to say, "Oh, you know what? We're
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:38.480]   just going to go home to our Orange County suburban homes and never meet live again." I think that's a
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.120]   low probability event. But what seems like a perfectly high probability event is saying, "Oh,
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:48.000]   we can Zoom with our VCs. We can Zoom with our lawyers. Why don't we just relocate to Austin,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.120]   Texas and not pay taxes or relocate to Boulder, Colorado so we can have beautiful scenery or
[00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:59.600]   relocate to Honolulu so we can surf?" So that seems like we've made the ability for smart
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.920]   people to relocate much easier, even if they're going to keep on seeing each other in the office
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:12.080]   three or four days a week. Okay. That collides with this very fervent desire to deal with
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:18.000]   festering social inequities at the local level. Be this limited upward mobility for poorer people,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.800]   be this high housing costs, be this the rise of mass incarceration and police brutality towards
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:29.440]   particularly minority groups. And so there's this progressive urge which runs up against the fact
[00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:37.840]   that the rich guys can run away. And if your model, which says, "Oh, the local governments
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:41.600]   are going to realize the rich guys can run away, so they will seamlessly lower tax rates in order
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.120]   to make sure that they attract those people." That's running up against the fact that there's
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.120]   a whole lot of energy on the progressive side, which says, "No, Massachusetts just passed a
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:54.160]   millionaire's tax." So for the first time ever, we have the possibility to have a progressive tax,
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:59.840]   which feels extraordinarily dangerous given this time period. So I think we may need to see a bunch
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:04.320]   of errors in this area before we start getting things right. I mean, we went through a lot of
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:11.520]   pain in the 1970s as cities first tried to deal with their progressive goals and rich people and
[00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:16.560]   companies ran away. And it wasn't until the 1980s that sort of people started realizing this was the
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:22.640]   path to local bankruptcy and that we had real city limits on what the locality could do.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:27.120]   Now, you cited research in The Survival of the City, which said that firms like
[00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.560]   Microsoft were much less willing to hire new people once they went online because of the
[00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:36.880]   pandemic. What do you make of the theory that this is similar to when industrialization first
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:40.800]   hit and we hadn't figured out exactly how to make most use of it to be most productive,
[00:40:40.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   but over the long run, somebody will do to remote work what Henry Ford did to the factory floor,
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.520]   and in fact, just make it so much more effective and efficient than in-person contact just because
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.280]   we'll have better ways of interacting with people through remote work, we'll have better systems?
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:02.960]   You know, it's entirely possible. I never like betting against the ingenuity of humanity.
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:08.400]   On the other hand, you need a lot of technology to override 5 million years of evolution.
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:14.320]   And we have evolved to be an in-person species, not just because we're productive and learn a lot
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:20.160]   face-to-face, but also because we just like it. I mean, like a world of hyper-efficient remote
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:23.600]   work where you basically are puttering around your apartment, doing things very quickly and
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:29.040]   getting things done, that doesn't sound particularly joyful to me. And workplaces are not just places
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.760]   of productivity, they're also places of pleasure, particularly at the high end.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:40.400]   And remember, I mean, in 2019 and earlier, Google, Yahoo, the companies that should have
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:45.040]   been doing, like had the biggest capacity to do remote stuff in general, weren't sending their
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:50.880]   workers home. They were building these paradises for high-skilled workers, stuffed with foosball
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:56.720]   tables and free snacks and whatever else they had in these giant campuses in the Googleplex.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:42:02.320]   So they were certainly betting on the power of face-to-face and creativity rather than on the
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:07.760]   ability of sort of remote work to make everything work. I mean, I think the most reasonable views,
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:12.960]   let's say that of Nick Bloom of Stanford, is that for those types of workers, you know,
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:19.040]   20% of your week being hybrid, maybe 40% seems quite possible. That seems like a thing,
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:22.880]   particularly for workers who have families who really value that degree of flexibility.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:29.680]   But fully remote, I guess that's a pretty niche thing. And, you know, there's some jobs like
[00:42:29.680 --> 00:42:34.080]   call center workers where you could imagine it being the norm, but in part because it's just
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.400]   hard to learn the same amount remotely that you do face-to-face. And this came out both in the
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:44.240]   earlier Bloom study on remote call center workers in China and on more recent work by Natalia
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.680]   Emanuel and Emma Harrington, that both studies found the same thing, which is in these call
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:51.760]   centers, they are plenty productive when they're remote, but the probability of being promoted
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:57.520]   drops by 50%. And so the entrepreneur may make it very efficient to do things in the short run
[00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:02.720]   remotely, but they're going to turn off this tendency that we have to be able to learn things
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:07.760]   from people around us, which is just much harder to duplicate remotely. Right. Yeah, yeah.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:15.360]   Um, now, uh, I I'm curious why Silicon Valley became the hub of technology. Uh, I mean,
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:20.160]   you wrote a paper in 2018 about where, uh, among other things, where pioneer and non-pioneer firms
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:25.200]   locate. So I was hoping you had insight on this. Was it, is it, does it Stanford? Is it where
[00:43:25.200 --> 00:43:28.560]   Fairchild Semiconductor is located? And that just like the offshoot of that, or like, what is the
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:34.880]   explanation? So we take it as being earlier. It is Stanford. Um, so I traced through this,
[00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:40.640]   I think in triumph. Um, yeah, it, it, it was a company called federal telegraph company.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:49.280]   Um, that was founded by a guy called Cyril Frank Elwell, uh, who was a radio pioneer and
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:57.680]   he was tapped by his teacher to head this radio company. So there had been this local genius.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:03.200]   The story was, as I remember it, there'd been this local genius in San Francisco who had,
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.880]   you know, attracted all these investors and was going to do this wireless telegraphy company.
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:14.080]   And, um, he died in a freak carriage accident. Um, his investors wanted to find someone else
[00:44:14.080 --> 00:44:19.040]   and they went to, you know, Stanford's the nearby faculty and ask who should we hire?
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:23.680]   And it was this guy Elwell who founded federal telegraph, federal telegraph, then licensed,
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:29.040]   I think, Danish technology. It was originally the Poulsen, uh, telegraph company. They then hired
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:34.560]   some fairly bright people like Lee DeForest. Um, and they did incredibly well in world war one off
[00:44:34.560 --> 00:44:40.640]   of federal Navy contracts off of, off of Navy contracts. And they then did things like provided
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:46.080]   jobs for people like the young Fred Turman, whose father was a Stanford, uh, scientist. Now Fred
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:55.120]   Turman then plays an outsized role in this story because he goes to MIT. Uh, he studies, um, uh,
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:45:04.400]   and engineering there, uh, and then comes back, um, to, um, to become Dean of Stanford's, uh,
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:09.760]   engineering program. And he really plays an outsized role in setting up the Stanford industrial
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:14.560]   park, attracting Fairchild Semiconductor. And then this is sort of random thing that, um,
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:19.440]   Fairchild Semiconductor attracts these people and then repels them because you have this
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:23.120]   brilliant guy Shockley, right. He's both brilliant and sort of personally abhorrent
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.640]   who manages to attract brilliant people and then, you know, repel all of them.
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:29.920]   And so they all end up dispersing themselves into different companies and they create this
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:35.120]   incredibly creative ecosystem that is the heart of Silicon Valley that in its day sort of had this
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.440]   combination of really smart people and really entrepreneurial ethos, which just made it very,
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:43.280]   very healthy. I think the thing that many of us worry about in terms of Silicon Valley
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.760]   more recently is it feels much more like it's a one industry town, which is dangerous. And it feels
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:51.920]   more like it's a bunch of industrial biomass rather than a bunch of smart, scrappy startups.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:56.800]   And that's, that's a recipe that feels much more like Detroit in the 1950s than it does like
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:02.320]   Silicon Valley in the 1960s. Speaking of startups, uh, what, what, what is your, uh, what is your
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:08.960]   study of cities imply about where tech startups, um, should locate and, you know, like what kind
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:13.840]   of like organization in person or otherwise they should have. So I think there's a lot to like
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:18.960]   about in person, certainly. I mean, it's, I think relying too much on, on remote feels quite
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:25.680]   dangerous. If you're a scrappy startup, look, I like a lot, the, the Sunbelt smart cities.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:29.920]   I like, I like a lot of the places that sort of combine, I sort of have a two factor model of
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:34.640]   economic growth, which is it's about education and it's about having governments that are pro
[00:46:34.640 --> 00:46:40.560]   business. Right. And if you think about sort of, you know, the U S there's a lot of heterogeneity
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.080]   in this. And if you think about the U S versus other countries, it's heterogeneity. So the U S
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:48.880]   has historically been better on being pro business than let's say the Northern European social
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:53.120]   democracies, but the Northern social Northern European social democracies are great on the
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:58.240]   education front. And so, you know, places like Sweden and the Netherlands and Germany are also
[00:46:58.240 --> 00:47:01.600]   very successful places because they have enough education to counter the fact that they may not
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:06.800]   necessarily be as pro business as the U S is within the U S you also have this balance.
[00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:12.560]   Whereas places like Massachusetts, California are certainly much less pro business, but they're,
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:17.040]   you know, pretty well educated. Um, and other parts of the country may be more pro business,
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:21.600]   but they're less so, but the sort of real secret sauce is finding those places that are both
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:27.760]   highly educated and, uh, pro business. So those are places like Charlotte and Austin, and even
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   Atlanta, um, places in the sunbelt that have attracted lots of skilled people. And, um,
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:38.320]   you know, they, they've done very, very well during COVID. I mean, Austin, by most dimensions
[00:47:38.320 --> 00:47:43.520]   is the superstar of the COVID era in terms of just attracting, attracting people. So, um, I think you
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:46.880]   had to wait for the real estate prices to come down a bit in Austin, but those are the places
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.920]   that I would be looking at. Yeah. I don't know if you know, but I live in Austin actually. I did not
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:59.280]   know that you're exactly, you know? Yeah. Yeah. Uh, well actually I'm surprised you said that
[00:47:59.280 --> 00:48:04.240]   about education because you write in the paper, um, general knowledge measured as average years
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:09.680]   of schooling is not a strong determinant of the survival of a pioneer firm, but that the
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:14.000]   relatedness of knowledge between past and present activities is. So I'm surprised that like you
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.320]   think for pioneer firms, uh, um, uh, the, the education is a strong. No, it's I, I I'm a big
[00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:25.280]   human capital determinant determinants. So I tend to believe that individuals, cities, and nations
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:30.320]   rise and fall based on their skill levels. And certainly if you look over the last 40 or 50
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.280]   years, skills are very predictive of which cities, particularly colder cities, um, manage to do well
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.600]   versus poorly. And if you ask yourself why Detroit and Seattle looked different, you know, more than
[00:48:39.600 --> 00:48:45.760]   50% of Seattle's, uh, adults have college degrees, maybe 14, 15% of Detroit's adults do right. That's
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:49.680]   just a huge, huge gap. And certainly when we're thinking about your, you know, your punitive
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:53.280]   startup, you're going to be looking for talent, right? You're going to be looking to hire talent
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:57.040]   and, you know, having lots of educated people around you is going to be helpful for that.
[00:48:58.480 --> 00:49:05.040]   Yep. Yep. Let's talk about housing. So, uh, Houston has basically very little to no zoning.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:09.280]   Why is it not more of an interesting city? It's a very, nobody goes to Houston for tourism.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:15.760]   I have, I have in fact gone to tourism. Although part of it, I admit was to look at the housing,
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:21.200]   uh, and to go to the woodlands and, and look at, look at that. Um, you know,
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:27.840]   interesting has a lot to do with age, like in this country. So the more that a city has,
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:32.640]   you know, Boston is good for tourism just cause it's, it's been around for a long time
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.600]   and it hasn't changed all that much. So it has, it has this sort of historic thing.
[00:49:37.600 --> 00:49:43.520]   Houston's a new place in the sense that, um, not just in the sense that it's like chronological
[00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:49.120]   age is, is lower, but also in the sense that it's just grown so much it's dominated by new stuff,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:52.800]   right? And that new stuff tends to be more homogenous. It tends to have less history on it.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.280]   I think those are things which, which make new cities typically sort of less interesting than
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:03.600]   older cities. I mean, as witnessed by the fact that, you know, Rome, Jerusalem, London, these
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:07.200]   are great, you know, tourist capitals of the world because they've just accreted all this
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:14.800]   interesting stuff over the millennium. Um, so I think that's, that's part of it. I I'm not sure
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:20.640]   that if we look at more highly zoned, uh, new cities, we're so confident that they're all that
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:25.120]   more interesting. So I don't, I don't want to be particularly disparaging any one city. So I'm not
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:28.000]   going to, I'm not going to choose that, but I'm not sure that, you know, there's actually a bunch
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.040]   that's pretty interesting in Houston and I'm not sure that I wouldn't, you know, I would say that
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:36.320]   it's any less interesting than any comparably aged city in the country. Yeah. Yeah. I'm visiting
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:40.960]   Houston later this month and I, uh, I asked my friend there, should I stay here longer? I mean,
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:44.880]   is there anything interesting to do here? And then he responds, well, it's like the fourth biggest
[00:50:44.880 --> 00:50:53.120]   city in the country. And then he goes, so no. Um, so, um, many, many people, including many
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:57.760]   economists have said that we should drastically increase us population through immigration
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:51:02.720]   to like a figure like 1 billion. Do you think that, uh, our cities could accommodate that?
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:08.000]   Do we have the infrastructure? And I mean, let's say we reformed housing over like, you know,
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:11.360]   like a decade or so it could, could be accommodates as such a large influx of people or
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:17.840]   a billion people in a decade. Um, I love the vision. You know, I'm certainly among those who,
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:22.160]   you know, I, I basically in my heart, I'm an open borders person, right. In the sense that I don't,
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.760]   I mean, it's a moral thing, right? I don't really like the idea that I get to enjoy the privileges
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:31.120]   of being an American and think that I'm going to deny that opportunity to anyone else. Um,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:37.520]   so I love this vision. Uh, a billion people over 10 years is sort of an unimaginably large amount
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:44.480]   of people over a relatively short period of time. I I'd love to give it a shot. Um, I mean, it's,
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:49.120]   it's certainly not as if there's any long-term reason why you couldn't do it. I mean, goodness
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.600]   knows we've got more than enough space in this country. Um, they're, you know, it would be
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:58.480]   exciting to try to, to, you know, see if we could build enough infrastructure and structures to do
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:03.200]   that. Um, but it would require a lot of reform in the housing space and require a fair amount
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:07.040]   of reform in the infrastructure space as well, to be able to do this at some kind of, you know,
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:11.520]   large scale affordability. What does the evidence show about public libraries? Do they matter?
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:16.320]   My friend, uh, Eric Kleinberg has written a great book about, you know, I think they're called,
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:20.000]   it's called palaces for the people about, you know, the, all the different functions that
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:25.520]   libraries have played. I've never seen anything systematically, statistically, uh, systematic
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.400]   statistically about this, but you know, you're not going to get a scholar to speak against books.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:38.000]   It's not a, uh, it's not a possible. Um, why do European cities, uh, why do they seem so much
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:42.400]   more similar to what they look like decades or even centuries ago than American cities,
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:46.000]   even American cities that are old, obviously not as old as European cities, but you know,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:51.200]   uh, they seem to change much more over time. Okay. Um, lower population growth, much tougher
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.920]   zoning, um, you know, much tougher historic preservation. All three of these things are
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.880]   going on. So it's very difficult to build in European cities. There's a lot of attention to,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:06.240]   um, you know, in caring about history, it's often part of the, the, the nationalist narrative.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:12.080]   You often have huge amounts of national dollars going to preserve local stuff and, um, you know,
[00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:17.200]   relatively lower levels of population growth. Extreme example of this is places like Warsaw
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.040]   where central Warsaw is completely destroyed during world war II. And they built it up to
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:26.720]   look exactly like it looked before the bombing. So this is a national choice, which is unlikely
[00:53:26.720 --> 00:53:32.800]   that we would necessarily make here in the U S yeah. Um, I was, uh, in Mumbai earlier this year
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:38.720]   and I visited Darby, which is the, uh, which is the biggest slum in Asia. And it's like,
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.680]   it's like a pretty safe for a pretty safe place for a slum. Why are, why, why are slums in
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:47.440]   different countries? Why do they often have like different levels of, you know, how safe they are?
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:54.160]   Like what is the reason I too have been in Darby and felt perfectly safe. It's, it's, you know,
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:54:00.080]   like, like walking around Belgravia and London in terms of it. Um, I think, I think my model of Darby
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:06.000]   is the same model as Jane Jacobs model of French village in 1960, which is, this is just a well
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   functioning community. People have eyes on the street. If you're a stranger in these areas,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   you're, they're going to be looking at you. And it's a community that just functions. And there
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.240]   are lots of low-income communities throughout the world that, you know, have this, it requires a
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:22.560]   certain amount of permanence. So if the community is too much in flux, it becomes hard to enforce
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:27.600]   these, these norms, uh, hard to enforce these sorts of community rules. And it's really helpful
[00:54:27.600 --> 00:54:32.560]   if there aren't either a massive number of guns floating around or an unbelievably lucrative
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:36.880]   narcotics trade, which is in the area. Those are both things that make things incredibly hard.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.320]   And of course, you know, partially us drug policy has, you know,
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.800]   been responsible for creating violence in some of the poor parts of the Latin of Latin American city.
[00:54:44.800 --> 00:54:49.120]   Yeah. Yeah. Um, and then maybe you don't play video games enough to know the answer to this
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:54.720]   question, but I'm curious, is there any video game, any strategic video game like civilization
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:00.160]   or Europe or that you feel like does a good job representing, uh, the economics of cities?
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:04.480]   No, I will just say that when I was in graduate school, I spent a few hours playing something
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.480]   called Sim City. And I did think that was very fun, but, uh, I'm not going to play,
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.000]   but I think that it got it. It got it right. But that was, that was probably my largest engagement
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:16.400]   with, uh, with city building video game. What would you say we understand the least
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   about how cities work? I'm going to say the largest unsolved problem in cities
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:23.440]   is what the heck we're going to do about climate change and the cities of the developing world.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:30.000]   This is, this is the thing I do not feel like I have any answer for in terms of,
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.520]   you know, what, how it is that we're going to stop Manila or Mumbai from being leveled
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:40.320]   by some water-related climate event that we haven't yet foreseen. Right. We sort of think
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:44.000]   that we're going to spend tens of billions of dollars to protect New York and Miami,
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:48.640]   and that's going to happen. But I am, you know, the thing I don't understand is a thing that I
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.800]   think we really need to need to invest in, in terms of knowledge creations. What are we going
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:55:58.160]   to do with the low lying cities of the developing world to make them safe? Yep. Yep. Okay. Well,
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.360]   your most recent book is survival of the city. And before that tribe of the city, both of those,
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   I highly recommend to readers, Professor Glazer, thank you so much for coming on the podcast. This
