[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.480]   Today, we enter the second week of Advent, a season set aside to dwell on Christ, the
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.480]   King whom shepherds guard and angels sing.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.820]   As Christians, we believe Jesus is the anointed Messiah, the Davidic King, the Christ.
[00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.400]   But how did we arrive at such a massive claim?
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.420]   Historically, this has proven to be no small debate.
[00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.720]   If Christ is the long-awaited Messiah, why does the Old Testament have so few unambiguous
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.540]   texts we can point to as proof?
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:46.080]   In his detailed investigation of the origins of Messianism, New Testament scholar Joseph
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.540]   Fitzmyer goes so far as to conclude that hopes of a Messianic figure within Judaism intensify
[00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.000]   only after the Old Testament canon is closed.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.880]   And even when the term Messiah is used in the Old Testament, it often has nothing to
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.940]   do with a single Messianic figure.
[00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.220]   So how did the apostles and the earliest Christians arrive at such a clear link, claiming with
[00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.260]   confidence that the Jesus born in Bethlehem was the anointed King?
[00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.020]   To answer this question and to better understand what we celebrate in Advent, I turn it over
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.640]   to Dr. Don Carson, co-founder and president of the Gospel Coalition.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.200]   He joins us over the phone to answer the Advent question, "What child is this?"
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:37.800]   I suppose that for many Christians in the West who have not been exposed to much Bible
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:44.480]   reading yet, when they hear Jesus Christ, they're thinking Jesus is his first name and
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.780]   Christ is his second name or his family name.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.080]   So one might almost refer to him as Mr. Christ.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.760]   But of course it was never that way in the first century.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:00.240]   Christ was not initially, at least in any sense, a family name.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.120]   It was a title.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:08.880]   And it's disputed today whether it ever becomes fully a name anywhere in the New Testament.
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.480]   My own view is that it never loses its titular function, even if it does pick up some naming
[00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.680]   function in the later New Testament books.
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.440]   But let's back up a wee bit.
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.560]   Christ is simply a translation for the Greek word "Christos," which means "someone who's
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.240]   anointed."
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:35.280]   And it's equivalent to Messiah, which is a translation from the Hebrew word "Meshiach,"
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.480]   which means "someone who's anointed."
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.320]   Thus, if we were actually using translation, Jesus Christ means something like "Jesus the
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.320]   anointed one."
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.560]   But that needs to be unpacked in any case.
[00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:57.880]   In the Old Testament, anointing that is literally carried out is the act of applying oil to
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   an object or a person.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.720]   This can be done by smearing the oil or pouring a little bit on the person or the thing, rubbing
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.680]   it in a little bit.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.960]   And the thing that thus has been anointed then is set aside in some way.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:20.240]   And in the Old Testament, in terms of people, there are two, just about three, categories
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:28.320]   of people who are anointed by oil as a way of indicating that they've been designated
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.140]   for a certain role, a certain function.
[00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:39.320]   For example, in the Jotham fable in 1 Kings 9, 7 and following, it's aimed at those who
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.920]   had made Abimelech king of Shechem.
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.080]   But in this fable, the trees are portrayed as wanting to anoint one tree to be king over
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.160]   them.
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.400]   That is, to designate one tree to appoint one tree.
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.280]   And then later on, for example, when the men of Judah anoint David king over the house
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.320]   of Judah, 2 Samuel chapter 2, the same sort of thing is operating.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:11.360]   So anointing with oil is very, very common in the Old Testament in terms of designating
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.240]   someone a king.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:19.840]   And then secondly, it's also used in connection with designating someone priest.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.760]   Moses receives instructions to anoint Aaron high priest, Exodus 29, Leviticus 8, and so
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.000]   on.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.800]   And not just Aaron, but his sons.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:36.080]   And a number of times, the sons are said to have been anointed, Exodus 28, 41, Exodus
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.720]   30, 30, and other passages.
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.160]   And indeed, in some sense, Leviticus 7, 36 goes so far as to say that it is God, Yahweh
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.040]   himself, who anointed Aaron and his sons.
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.840]   Now, obviously, that doesn't mean that he took a flask of oil and literally poured it
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.680]   over their heads or something of that order.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.000]   But he did it through his designated agents.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:06.080]   But again, it's a way of saying that someone has been set aside for a particular task.
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:11.880]   And although there's no general anointing of prophets, there is one remarkable passage
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.520]   in 1 Kings 19, 16.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.320]   Elijah is told to anoint Elisha to be his successor as prophet.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:26.600]   Now, when the event comes, we're not told that he actually poured oil on him.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.440]   Rather, when Elijah departs, Elisha asks for and receives a double share of Elijah's spirit.
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.880]   So it may even be that that reception of the spirit is considered the reality of the anointing.
[00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.920]   Just as in 1 John, Christians are said to have the anointing, and in the context, almost
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:51.380]   certainly that means they've got the spirit, even though they haven't all been smeared
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.760]   with oil or the like.
[00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.680]   So you begin to get a kind of sense of the relationship between the physical act, the
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.840]   ritual act, and what it is designating.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:11.280]   Now, by the time you get to the New Testament, it's not uncommon to ask questions about messianism,
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   that is, the expectation that a Messiah would come who would save his people, who would
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.560]   transform them, who would bring in the new age, who would bring in the end of days, and
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:22.560]   so on.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:31.640]   And a majority of scholars today argues that there is, strictly speaking, no use of Messiah
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:38.120]   Christ in the Old Testament that is unambiguously foretelling, that is, unambiguously announcing
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.840]   the coming of the Messiah, Paracelsus.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.400]   That's almost right, but not quite, in my view.
[00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:54.560]   Usually the word "anointed" refers to ordinary kings and priests and so on, without pointing
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:55.560]   forward.
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:07:01.120]   For example, Saul, King Saul, before David, who eventually lost his throne, is called
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.560]   the Lord's Anointed, 1 Samuel 12, 3 and 5.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:09.040]   And that's why David spares his life.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:14.240]   One should not raise his hand against the Lord's Anointed, we're told, 1 Samuel 24,
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.320]   7, and other passages.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:23.600]   That means we're not to raise our hand against the person whom the Lord has appointed to
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:30.440]   a particular task, even if that person, like Saul, has become corrupt.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:33.120]   God will deal with him.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.320]   But likewise, later, the Amalekite, who claims to have killed Saul at his own request to
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:46.000]   put him out of his misery, he is put to death by David because he did not observe the rule
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.360]   of not killing the Lord's Anointed, 2 Samuel 1, 14-16.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.880]   And specifically, Psalm 105, 15 says, "Do not touch my anointed ones, do my prophets
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:58.880]   no harm."
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:08.680]   So, in all such cases, the anointed person or persons are kings, priests, prophets, as
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:15.920]   in this last passage, and they are not themselves unambiguously messianic in the prophetic sense.
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.680]   They're not referring to the Messiah, the Christ.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:26.560]   But there are some passages, like Psalm 2 and a handful of others, where the immediate
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:32.640]   context really does suggest a Davidic king in the historical sphere.
[00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:39.360]   And yet the same context also points forward beyond the immediate historical sphere to
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   the ultimate David.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:47.080]   There's a Davidic typology that is built right into the treatment.
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:50.360]   Psalm 2 is especially telling in that regard.
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:55.400]   It's a wonderful psalm and it's unambiguously messianic in some respects.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.800]   But it's messianic through a typology.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:04.080]   We've dealt with this one briefly before when we considered the sonship language.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.200]   You recall how it begins, "Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot in vain?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:14.560]   The kings of the earth rise up and the rulers band together against the Lord and against
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:15.560]   His anointed."
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:20.880]   That's against His Meshiach, against His Messiah, against His Christ, saying, "Let
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.760]   us break their chains and throw off their shackles."
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.800]   And in one sense, of course, that can be read against the background of local regional petty
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:35.160]   kings trying to rebel against David or Solomon in the days of the unified monarchy.
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:41.520]   Yet when you press on, you discover that the language becomes so extravagant that it's
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.760]   looking forward to the ultimate Messiah against whom people rebel.
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.720]   And it's quoted by the Christian church in Acts chapter 4, for example, when persecution
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:59.960]   is arising and Christians are thinking it through in the light of Scripture.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:06.400]   And they quote precisely these words, "Why do the nations conspire and the peoples plot
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:10.960]   in vain against the Lord and His Messiah?"
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.800]   And in all such contexts, such use of Messiah in Psalm 2 and related passages is clearly
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:22.840]   referring to the Davidic king, either at the historical level, the immediate Davidic king,
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:29.840]   or on the long scale typological level, the ultimate Davidic king.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:36.640]   So that when you get to the wonderful confession of Peter in Matthew chapter 16 and parallel,
[00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:39.040]   who do people say that I am?
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:45.600]   And Peter responds, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.
[00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:47.160]   You are the Messiah."
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:49.320]   And how is Messiah understood in that context?
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.280]   The Son of the living God.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.360]   Probably not in the context understood to be the second person of the Trinity or something
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.120]   of that order, though that's not denied.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.480]   It simply isn't the focus.
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:05.460]   But the Son of God language, as we have seen earlier when we considered both the expression
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.800]   Son of God and when we considered kingship themes, Son of God is regularly used once
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.360]   a Davidide has come to the throne.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:21.040]   The day that he comes to the throne, God says to him, "Today I have begotten you."
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:25.440]   He's taken on as God's son, as God's king.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:30.840]   God is the supreme king, and insofar as the Davidide reigns under God with God's concern
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:34.680]   for justice and integrity and the preservation of the covenant and all of that, then he's
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.080]   acting like God.
[00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.560]   He's God's son.
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.560]   And the Son of God in one of its uses regularly refers to the Davidic king.
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:50.600]   And my guess then is that what Peter is saying, most people would agree with this I think,
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:55.920]   is when he confesses that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, he's really saying
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:11:58.320]   he's the promised Davidic king.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:11:59.800]   He's the messianic king.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.040]   He's the anointed king.
[00:12:01.040 --> 00:12:05.160]   And there was expectation that when that messianic king came, he would bring in the ultimate
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.840]   age and that grows with time.
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:13.240]   Many of the connections with the Old Testament, however, are through these typological lines
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.600]   of sonship and Davidic kingship and so on of that order.
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:25.320]   So in the New Testament, then, Jesus is regularly referred to as the Christ.
[00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:29.680]   And in most cases, it means the promised Davidic king.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:34.160]   It's a way of alluding to the coming, dawning kingdom.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.960]   But in some passages, the title gets blurred over, I think, to a larger sweeping expectation
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:48.000]   of God's promised redeemer, God's promised revelation of himself, so that he comes to
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.360]   transform.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:55.160]   There are hints of that in the Old Testament when you see in Isaiah 9, for example, that
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:13:00.040]   the one who is coming, "Unto us a son is born, unto us a child is given, and he shall
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:02.280]   reign on the throne of his father David."
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.480]   There's the Davidic sign.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.880]   But he shall also be called the wonderful counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:09.640]   father, the prince of peace.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.200]   So that even though Messiah is not used there because Messiah is regularly used for the
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.680]   Davidic king, this becomes a passage that is espousing a messianism, that is an expectation
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:24.440]   of a redeemer to come who's in the line of David, even though the term Messiah is not
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:26.000]   actually used there.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.560]   And this is so important a title that John's Gospel, for example, when it articulates its
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:36.800]   purpose in John 20, 30, and 31, many things have not been written about Jesus, but these
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:42.320]   are written that the Christ, the Son of God, to show that the Christ, the Son of God, truly
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:46.600]   is Jesus, and that by believing we might have life in his name.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:52.720]   So this messianic language is tied to a number of other biblical theological themes that
[00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:57.880]   we really don't have time to unpack here, but I'll mention one of them.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:02.800]   People who study Mark's Gospel often detect what is sometimes called in Mark's Gospel
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.640]   the messianic secret.
[00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:13.240]   And what they mean by that is that sometimes Jesus' identity as the Messiah is hidden,
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:21.320]   or is a title that is actually not to be disclosed right away because for whatever reason Jesus
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:26.720]   tells the disciples or tells the person who's been healed, for example, not to announce
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   who he is.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.760]   So in some sense it's a messianic secret.
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:36.520]   That language can go too far and become instantly deceptive.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:44.260]   Part of the reason why Jesus hides his identity in some respects is because local expectations
[00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:50.600]   of a coming redeemer, of a coming king, were often so political that if Jesus simply said,
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.760]   "I am the Messiah," he would be urged to be saying something that he doesn't in fact
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:56.760]   mean.
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:15:00.760]   "I am here to establish a political kingdom and turf out the Romans and set up the throne
[00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:05.160]   exactly as it was in the days of David a thousand years earlier, and this time we're going to
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.160]   win."
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:09.960]   Whereas the kingdom that Jesus has in mind is far more transcendent than that, far more
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:13.800]   sweeping but working on very different principles.
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:19.320]   And so Jesus is in the strange place where sometimes he acknowledges that he's the Messiah
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:24.280]   and sometimes he skirts the question precisely because he doesn't want false expectations
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.060]   to arise.
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:30.560]   But writing decades after the event, then John can say far more categorically, "These
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:35.040]   are written in order that you might believe that the Christ, the Messiah, the Son of God
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.720]   really is Jesus."
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:44.560]   So part of the problem then is the inability of the disciples, let alone of the larger
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:53.200]   crowds to see how rich and biblically faithful and Davidic this notion of the Christ, the
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:57.920]   Messiah, the Sonship of God really is as applied to Jesus.
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:06.400]   And it cannot be reduced to merely lineal descent and an earthly kingdom that does not
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:13.720]   have all of the sweeping power of the kingdom displayed in the New Testament.
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:16.680]   So that's how the term Messiah works.
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:22.840]   And when we say Jesus Christ, we should be thinking in our mind, Jesus the Messiah, Jesus
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.880]   the promised priest, king, prophet, Jesus the one who is anointed by God to bring about
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.000]   our redemption, Jesus who has been set aside by God, anointed by God, the ultimate Redeemer,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.400]   the ultimate anointed one, the ultimate Christ.
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:38.400]   Amen.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.840]   That's so helpful.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:46.200]   Very grateful to God for Dr. Carson, the co-founder and president of the Gospel Coalition for
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.960]   his willingness to take up the topic.
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.200]   This is our 14th installment of Don Carson working through major themes in biblical theology
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.640]   here on the podcast.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   Sonship was earlier.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.000]   He alluded to that a couple of times.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.920]   Today, of course, the topic was Messiah.
