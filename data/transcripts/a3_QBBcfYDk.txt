[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   [silence]
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.380]   So any discussion about heat and sperm
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.220]   and how heat is detrimental to sperm
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.740]   has to raise this issue of whether or not cold
[00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.060]   is good for the testicle.
[00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:14.320]   Okay, well now there's a lot of data starting to come out
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.060]   about the positive effects,
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.540]   the positive biological effects of deliberate cold exposure
[00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:23.540]   on different aspects of brain biology,
[00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.740]   such as the release of dopamine and norepinephrine,
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.860]   and on the biology of the body,
[00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.080]   to some extent metabolism,
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.440]   but more so the impact on brown fat stores,
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.400]   which are good for us, so-called brown fat thermogenesis.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.080]   There's a lot related to deliberate cold exposure,
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.700]   and we've done entire episodes on deliberate cold exposure.
[00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.560]   Again, you can find that at hubermanlab.com.
[00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.680]   We did a guest episode with an expert
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.320]   on the use of cold for health and performance
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.340]   with my colleague Craig Heller
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.000]   from Stanford Department of Biology.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.220]   We also have a toolkit on how to apply
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.840]   deliberate cold exposure for health
[00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.040]   for both females and for males,
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.800]   for sports performance, cognitive performance,
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.080]   mood, sleep, et cetera.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:00.960]   You can find all that, again, hubermanlab.com,
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.760]   totally zero cost.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.280]   Just go into the menu, go to newsletter,
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.240]   and scroll down, and you'll find those.
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.920]   When thinking about sperm quality,
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.680]   we want to remember that excessive heat is bad.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.440]   Now, does that mean that deliberate cold is good?
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.400]   Well, it turns out that one of the major causes
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   of lowered sperm count and overall reduced sperm quality
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.400]   that's quite common is the presence
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:26.560]   of what's called a varicella.
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.040]   A varicella is kind of like varicose veins
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.400]   of the veins that innervate the testicle.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.800]   And what it essentially does is it means
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.880]   that blood will pool in the testicular region.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.200]   It can't circulate back to the body quickly enough,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.400]   and therefore the temperature of that environment increases.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.320]   There's some other things that varicellas do
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.360]   which can be obstructive at the physical level,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.440]   so they're not just temperature related.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.160]   It's pretty clear that using deliberate cold exposure
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.720]   can be healthy for the sperm
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.240]   because of the ways not that cold
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.880]   directly supports testosterone or sperm quality,
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.760]   but rather because cold reduces heat, okay?
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.140]   So you will find available online,
[00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.560]   I think they're actually called,
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.920]   forgive me, but that's what they're called.
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.280]   I didn't name them, called Snowballs.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.200]   These are, they're sort of like gel pack cold briefs
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.280]   that you can buy and men will wear for some period of time.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.520]   I don't think you wear them all day.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.640]   You wear them for some period of time.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.600]   A lot of people are now using cold showers
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.000]   and ice baths and circulating cold baths
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.640]   or going into a cold ocean or lake
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.080]   for any number of different reasons I talked about earlier.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.720]   I myself start every day
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.400]   with either a one to three minute cold shower
[00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.160]   or one to three minute immersion up to my neck
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.720]   in a cold bath, cold water,
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.600]   circulating water or a cold shower.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.320]   I do that mainly for the psychological effects
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.080]   related to the long lasting increases
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.840]   in dopamine and epinephrine,
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.340]   but there are other data starting to come out
[00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.200]   showing that that sort of approach or similar approaches
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.020]   can increase testosterone levels
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.080]   and maybe even sperm counts
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.860]   can reduce cortisol late in the evening
[00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.640]   if the cold exposure is done early in the day,
[00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:03.480]   so on and so forth.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.240]   So a lot of interesting data coming out
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.360]   in really good journals that are peer reviewed
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.480]   and so on in humans.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.680]   I should mention those studies are done in humans
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.640]   to support the use of deliberate cold exposure.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.620]   But again, if you're going to use deliberate cold exposure
[00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.960]   to improve sperm quality, can it work?
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.380]   Yes, indeed it can work,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.840]   either indirectly by increasing testosterone
[00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.920]   or directly by improving sperm quality,
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.560]   but both of those effects are likely to be indirect
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.540]   by virtue of reducing the temperature
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:31.240]   of the testicle overall,
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.160]   not because there's any sort of magic effect of cold
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.160]   on the testicle.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.600]   Now I have to imagine that a number of you,
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.200]   in particular females listening to this,
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.160]   are going to say, is deliberate cold exposure,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.000]   and for that matter, is deliberate heat exposure
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.300]   like sauna or hot tub, good or bad for the ovary,
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.840]   for eggs and for fertility?
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.140]   Now there are fewer data to look to, unfortunately,
[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.100]   but what we do know is that deliberate cold exposure
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:57.720]   done in the way that I just described,
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.820]   one to three minutes a day,
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.060]   ideally early in the day through cold shower
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:02.180]   or immersion up to the neck,
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:03.140]   doesn't have to be an ice bath,
[00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.100]   could be cold circulating water
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.220]   or even non-circulating cold water.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:08.820]   And people will say, well, how cold?
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.060]   I should have mentioned that before.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.900]   How cold?
[00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.580]   There is no way I can tell you
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.100]   exactly how cold the water should be
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.460]   because for some people, 60 degrees Fahrenheit
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.460]   will be exceedingly cold, for other people,
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.220]   40 degrees is going to be more appropriate.
[00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.620]   How cold should you make it?
[00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.620]   If you're going to embrace these practices,
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.820]   you want to, according to the literature,
[00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.420]   what you want to do is make it uncomfortably cold,
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:31.960]   such that you really want to get out, but safe, right?
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.940]   You don't want to go into 30 degree water immediately.
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.260]   You can actually have a heart attack and die if you do that.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.580]   So you want to progress gradually into the cold.
[00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.660]   So you don't want to shock your system too much,
[00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.740]   although it is the adrenaline evoked by that [gasps]
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.120]   that quickening or shortening or elimination of the breath
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.960]   for a short period of time
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.100]   when you get into uncomfortably cold water
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.300]   that correlates with, or is actually the reflection of,
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:56.620]   would be more accurate to say the release of adrenaline
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.340]   and then dopamine and so forth,
[00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.380]   which has been very well-documented.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:03.820]   So uncomfortably cold, but safe to stay in.
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:06.400]   And I cannot tell you an exact number
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.640]   that is uncomfortably cold, but safe for you.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.060]   It's going to differ person by person.
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:10.980]   You want to figure that out.
[00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.280]   Just like I can't tell you how much weight
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.340]   that you should squat in order to achieve
[00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.860]   some effective resistance training for the legs.
[00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.680]   It's going to differ depending on your strength
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.300]   and your prior experience and so forth.
[00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.060]   So ease into it, be safe.
[00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.020]   But it does appear that both for men,
[00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.940]   for reasons I talked about a few minutes ago,
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.940]   and for women, that deliberate cold exposure
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.380]   can be beneficial for fertility and for hormone production,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.020]   but in particular for females
[00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:39.840]   in terms of regulating cortisol and for hormone production.
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:41.960]   Now you might say, okay, getting into cold is stressful.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.740]   How can that be helpful for regulating stress?
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.560]   Well, it turns out when you get into the cold,
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.820]   you get a big surge in adrenaline and then dopamine,
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:49.140]   which is very long lasting,
[00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:51.220]   provided that's done in the early part of the day.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.820]   So I would say, you know, not too close to sleep.
[00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.380]   Then what you do is you restrict
[00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.700]   your maximum cortisol release to a period earlier in the day
[00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:02.880]   that buffers, reduces, that is the likelihood
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.300]   that you would have excessive amounts of cortisol
[00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.420]   later in the day, which not only can disrupt sleep,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.940]   but is correlated with a number of other hormonal effects
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.960]   that are not good for us
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:13.780]   and therefore not good for fertility.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.540]   So here, what I'm describing are positive
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:20.020]   yet indirect effects of a cold on hormone levels,
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.660]   both in males and in females.
[00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.300]   So for men, we talked about increased testosterone,
[00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.300]   improved sperm quality that was indirect, right?
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.700]   You're reducing the temperature of the testicle,
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.020]   but it's not that cold itself
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.680]   is positively impacting those things.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:33.520]   Does that make sense?
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.040]   Heat is bad, therefore reducing temperature is good.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:37.980]   Likewise with females,
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:39.440]   deliberate cold exposure can be good
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.780]   for the overall fertility process.
[00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.300]   Not because cold is good for the ovary
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.600]   or being cold is good for the ovary
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.580]   or for luteinizing hormone or for follicle stimulating
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.260]   hormone or anything else like that,
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:54.580]   but rather that using deliberate cold exposure
[00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.100]   as a way to restrict stress in a deliberate way
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.300]   to a particular time of day,
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.420]   increases the release of cortisol then
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.980]   and indirectly reduces the amount of cortisol
[00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:07.340]   that's released at other times along the 24-hour cycle.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.940]   Okay, so these are positive yet indirect effects.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:12.700]   So if you're a woman who really is interested
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.240]   in exploring deliberate cold exposure
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:16.380]   or who enjoys it or is already doing it
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:19.660]   and you're wishing to conceive, great, explore it,
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.500]   do it safely of course,
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.860]   but explore it and continue to do it.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.900]   However, if you're somebody who just hates the cold
[00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.340]   and doesn't want to go anywhere near it,
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.140]   there's no reason to think that you absolutely need it
