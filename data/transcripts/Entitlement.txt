[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.480]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.120]   It's Sam from the Financial Samurai podcast.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.620]   And in this episode, I want to share a breakthrough because for the longest time, I have been
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:18.000]   wondering why are there so many privileged people out there who are so angry and entitled.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.880]   Since 2009, when I started Financial Samurai, I've been trying to battle entitlement mentality
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.520]   in my own head and in readers' heads because I truly believed then and I still believe
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.840]   now that if we get rid of entitlement mentality, we'll be happier and wealthier because we
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.440]   will put in the work and we won't expect anything from anybody.
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.760]   I remember starting work off in banking in New York City and it was a grind.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.480]   We'd get in at 5.30 a.m., we'd leave at 7.30 p.m.
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.440]   There was no such thing as working less than 40 hours a week or single-digit workdays.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.800]   And because of my experience, I've taken this attitude to everything I do.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.280]   And it's probably not healthy, always grinding and grinding, but I'm trying to give you some
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.980]   background as to why I think entitlement mentality is really dangerous.
[00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.940]   Because if you come into your job and you expect to go straight to the corner office
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.720]   without putting in your dues, well, you're going to have something coming for you.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.120]   You're going to be disappointed, you're going to be angry, you're going to be frustrated.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.960]   And ultimately, you will be unhappy.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.840]   In a previous post entitled "Entitlement Mentality is a Sneaky Wealth Destroyer," I wrote that
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.320]   after a three-year COVID pause, student loan interest will resume starting on September
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.920]   1st, 2023, and payments will be due starting in October, according to the Department of
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.920]   Education.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.160]   And as we recently heard, the Supreme Court struck down Biden's plan for eliminating $400
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.960]   billion of student loan debt.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   And I know some people are angry.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:57.960]   Some more than others.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.640]   Some are just like, "Well, thank you for the three-year reprieve."
[00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.380]   Personally, I think I would be thankful for a three-year reprieve, and I would be anxious
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.380]   to start paying back my student debt because it just feels really uncomfortable.
[00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.360]   Like my internals just don't feel right if I don't pay someone back ASAP.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.120]   And if I don't pay someone back at all, that's just a non-starter for me.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.600]   Not in my culture, not in my family.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.160]   We always pay back our debts, and we always follow through with what we promise.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.960]   So there was this viral tweet that went out from a woman who complained about her student
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.180]   loans.
[00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:43.680]   She highlighted her estimated monthly payment amount after the forbearance ends is $1,298.83
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   a month.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.820]   And that is a lot, folks.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.640]   No doubt about it.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:53.320]   She writes in her tweet, "Student loans and their interests are a class tax on people
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.500]   with working-class heritage.
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.760]   It is antithetical to the American Dream."
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.560]   And I had to look up how to pronounce antithetical because I was saying anti-ethical, antithetical,
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.160]   antithetical, I don't know who writes antithetical.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.160]   "Antithetical."
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.160]   Uh-huh, see?
[00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.160]   Thank you, Google.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.040]   So anyway, so I was thinking to myself, "Okay, I understand that.
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.960]   I understand the cost of student loan debt is a lot even though that is what you agreed
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.280]   to pay when you took out those loans."
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.200]   So I was curious to understand what was this person's educational background because having
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.560]   to pay that much, you know, $1,300 a month is a lot.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.240]   You probably had to take out $100,000 to $200,000 in student loans.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:41.160]   So it looks like, actually, it's true that the Twitter person went to Champlain College,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.840]   a private university I have never heard of, which costs about $45,000 a year today, which
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.520]   is actually not that bad for a private university, many of which cost about $60,000.
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:58.400]   And then she went on to get a writing master's in fine arts from Columbia University, which
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.680]   costs $76,000 a year in tuition and fees alone.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:06.880]   And Columbia University is an Ivy League university.
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.080]   So in other words, this person was able to go to two private universities.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.600]   Don't know whether she also went to a private grade school.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:20.680]   So it means that she probably is wealthier than the average person, the average family
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.740]   at least.
[00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:30.920]   And then she decided to study writing, poetry, fine arts, right, which is notoriously a low-paying
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:31.920]   sector.
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   I've been writing since 2009.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:39.480]   I would say it's very hard to support my family on my e-book on how to engineer your layoff,
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.640]   as well as my Wall Street Journal bestseller, Buy This, Not That.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.340]   And I got a book deal that was pretty good.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:52.320]   But these payments, they are spread out over three to four tranches over two to three years.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.200]   It is not easy making a living as a writer or teaching writing.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.000]   It's hard to make money in the arts.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.880]   So if you're able to attend private universities that cost way more annually than the median
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:12.120]   household income in the United States after tax, and if you have the opportunity to get
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:19.960]   a degree in a low-paying field, then clearly it means you are wealthier than average, or
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.240]   you simply have not done your research.
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   So to then take out student loans and then complain why you have to pay them back doesn't
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.840]   seem very logical.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:35.520]   I mean, when I was in high school, you know, I was 16, 17 years old thinking about college.
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.240]   Back then, I knew the cost of college.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:38.600]   I just looked it up, right?
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.360]   And I thought to myself, "Well, I'm going to go attend the College of William & Mary
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.560]   because it's $2,800 a year, and worst-case scenario, I'm going to be able to pay my parents
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.760]   back with a minimum wage job at McDonald's."
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.160]   And then I decided, "Well, I need to study something that hopefully will get me a well-paying
[00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.240]   job that is somewhat interesting."
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.720]   So I studied economics, and then I minored in Mandarin.
[00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:01.600]   And the idea was economics was relatable to many fields.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:05.000]   I could work in finance, maybe law, technology.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.920]   I was a college student, but it sounded logical because I looked at the income for economics
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.280]   degrees and it seemed reasonable.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.320]   And I studied Mandarin because I had studied abroad in China in 1997.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.480]   My mom is from Taiwan.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.040]   I lived in Taiwan for four years, and if I got shut out from America for getting a job,
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:30.320]   then maybe I can go to China or Taiwan and use my Mandarin minor degree as well as my
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.640]   economics degree.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.040]   This was my thinking, and I think most people are logical and most people are rational long-term.
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:43.480]   So I don't believe in the narrative that people for the long-term do dumb, irrational, low
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.440]   ROI things.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:50.240]   Maybe I have too much faith in humanity, but this is what I think because I've been trained
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.080]   to think as an economist that everything is rational long-term.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.600]   And some people figure it out sooner than others, but at the end of the day, we're going
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.040]   to do things that improve our lifestyles, improve our happiness, and we're going to
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.040]   stop doing things that hurt our lifestyles and cause us to be miserable.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.360]   Now it would be one thing to complain on Twitter, because we all like to complain on social
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:19.240]   media sometimes, that student loan debt is expensive and it's an attack on working-class
[00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:20.400]   people.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:25.560]   And it would be one thing to say that and attend a private university, elite private
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.500]   universities, and work at Columbia University or whatever.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:34.260]   But it would be another thing to do all that and then to follow up your tweet and say,
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:39.920]   I just finished my library and it's a beautiful looking library and it's a dedicated room
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.400]   to a library.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:47.560]   So how many people who live in New York City can afford a dedicated room, office, with
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:54.520]   massive stacks of books in New York City, but then say, I can't afford to pay my student
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.960]   loan debt or I don't want to pay it.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.100]   It's just this conundrum that bothered me so much that I went for a walk and I thought
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:09.100]   to myself, why do privileged, somewhat wealthy or wealthy people have this entitlement mentality?
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.740]   And then it hit me.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:15.620]   Maybe the reason why some don't feel it is fair to pay back what they owe is because
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:20.220]   they don't fully appreciate the value of what they got.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:21.580]   Think about that.
[00:08:21.580 --> 00:08:23.460]   So important.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:29.440]   If you don't recognize the full value of a college degree, then you may take it for granted.
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:33.100]   It's similar to treating your spouse or partner poorly.
[00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.680]   You take them for granted because you don't recognize and appreciate all that they do
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.080]   day in and day out.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.960]   It's like getting a new pair of jeans or a new pair of shoes for free.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:49.960]   You know, you'd like it, but you don't appreciate it as much if you had to slave away over a
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.800]   hot stove earning minimum wage for 30 hours.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:09:00.600]   Because if you put in those dues, then you really appreciate what you can buy or what
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:03.000]   you get for that money that you earned.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.800]   Personally, I don't want things just given to me because it takes away the pride and
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.880]   the joy of the struggle to finally achieve that something.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:19.520]   It is unbelievable how good it feels to start from nothing or to start from zero and just
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:21.840]   work your way up to get there.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:26.800]   That is a priceless feeling of joy that I don't want anybody to take away from me.
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:28.240]   And it's the same thing with my kids.
[00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.240]   I don't want to just give them something because it takes away that meaning, that purpose,
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:39.080]   that struggle that we should all go through to appreciate more of what we have.
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:43.720]   Nothing is given, everything is earned is a better mentality to have.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:49.980]   If you adopt this mentality, then you will approach life from a position of strength.
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:54.120]   When entitlement mentality takes hold, you might end up doing curious things such as
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:57.560]   complaining about having to pay back your student loan debt while posting on Twitter
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:02.500]   how you turned down five job offers, wrote a best-selling book, and built a dedicated
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.120]   library in your New York City apartment.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:11.640]   Entitlement mentality reduces self-awareness, or maybe people who lack self-awareness have
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.580]   a greater sense of entitlement.
[00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:20.440]   If you think about all the poverty in the world, the children who are starving, people
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:27.080]   with disabilities, if you know what's going on, you will reduce your chances of maybe
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:33.500]   overeating, of maybe taking your lodging for granted, your health for granted, your vision
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.080]   for granted.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:40.760]   All these things we will appreciate more if we are more aware of the suffering and the
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.000]   state of the world around us.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.800]   Now, I want to conclude this episode by sharing with you how to calculate the value of a college
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:54.720]   degree because there is a student loan debt issue, two trillion plus, right?
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:00.000]   People are graduating college with no jobs or they're underemployed and they have student
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.800]   loan debt and that's a problem.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   That is difficult.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.920]   So this is why, one of the reasons why I've been talking for over 10 years about trying
[00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:09.360]   to go to an affordable college.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.800]   Nothing wrong with state school, folks.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.600]   Get some scholarships, apply, take the effort.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.420]   Don't really just focus on prestige and shiny degrees.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.820]   Be practical in what you study.
[00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.440]   This is all practical advice.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:28.080]   However, if it's too late for you in the sense that you've already graduated college and
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:33.920]   you have some debt or you're struggling, this calculation of how to value college degree
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:35.320]   should be very valuable.
[00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:39.080]   So we know that net worth equals assets minus liabilities.
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.840]   We also know the net present value of an asset is equal to its future cash flows discounted
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:47.160]   by an estimated growth rate.
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:53.760]   In this case, the future cash flows of a college degree is equal to the college graduates lifetime
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.440]   earnings.
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.980]   And to understand this calculation, you must also believe a college degree is a valuable
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:01.560]   asset.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.600]   Millions of people are willing to dedicate four to six years of their lives and hundreds
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:08.960]   of thousands of dollars to get a college degree.
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:14.360]   Therefore, of course, a college degree is an asset because rationally, you wouldn't
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.900]   do something if you didn't think there was a return.
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.120]   So a college degree is an asset.
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.660]   It's an investment.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:27.080]   To start, the first way to calculate the value of a college degree is to calculate the cost
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:32.560]   of a college degree plus a conservative rate of return on the money you would have made
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:38.480]   if you didn't go to college, and to assume that the cost of college increases every single
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:39.480]   year.
[00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:43.520]   So in my post, I highlight Boston University, an expensive private university, that for
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.440]   2024 costs $86,363.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:57.600]   And then I bump that up by 5% a year and for a full four year total cost of $372,259.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:59.160]   That's a lot of money, right folks?
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.560]   And if you assume a 5% annual investment return, had you invested the money instead, the total
[00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:10.920]   cost of college for four years is about $534,000.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.720]   Half a million dollars, folks.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.760]   So choose wisely where you want to go to school.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.800]   You were willing to pay that much money to attend Boston University because you believe
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.880]   it's going to give you a greater return in terms of your earnings power going forward.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.920]   If you didn't believe, you wouldn't pay that price.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.840]   Or you would still go to that college if you got free money in terms of grants and scholarships.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:40.180]   Or you'd have gone to a different university because we are all rational actors.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:44.760]   This is a fundamental variable that we must accept.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:50.920]   So let's say you graduate Boston University with debt of $120,000, right?
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:51.920]   A lot.
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   That's a lot.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.360]   So your net worth is actually equal to $534,000, which is the value of your college degree,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.560]   minus $120,000, which means a positive net worth of $414,000.
[00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:05.560]   Not bad, right?
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:08.080]   And I know some of you guys are thinking, "Well, you're crazy.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.140]   You're not worth $414,000 if you pay the full price to attend Boston University."
[00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:15.140]   But am I really crazy?
[00:14:15.140 --> 00:14:23.520]   Am I really crazy when we pay 40x revenue for stocks like Nvidia, we pay 100 times earnings
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:27.360]   multiples for nascent companies that pay no dividends?
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.460]   Why do we do that?
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:36.360]   We do that because we expect the future earnings to be discounted back and worth something
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:38.120]   to shareholders now.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:39.840]   We expect growth, right?
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:45.120]   So when you graduate college, we expect you to grow into a worker who earns more and more
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.360]   over time.
[00:14:46.360 --> 00:14:51.520]   And the longer you work, the greater the value of your investment and your assets, right?
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:56.620]   Because if your investment continues to spit out income for a million years, of course
[00:14:56.620 --> 00:15:02.080]   it's going to be worth more than an investment that spits out income for only 10 years.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:06.480]   So what are the implications of the cost method of valuing a college degree?
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:08.280]   Well, here are some.
[00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.280]   The more you pay for college, the greater your net worth.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:17.040]   So hooray for those of you who spend tons and tons of money on a college education.
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:21.960]   I don't recommend it, but this is a different way of thinking because you're building that
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.520]   asset.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:27.760]   Wealthier families who can afford to pay more for college end up having college graduates
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:32.020]   with higher net worths based on this formula.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.760]   Students who reduce the cost of college by getting grants or scholarships are able to
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.600]   quote "free ride" and benefit from the full value of a college degree.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:41.600]   Why?
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.440]   Because employers don't pay candidates less because candidates paid less for college.
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:47.840]   They just pay the market rate.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.600]   And then finally, overall, private university graduates are wealthier than public university
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.620]   and community college graduates.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:16:01.800]   You look at the study on the makeup of household income earners who attend Harvard University.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:08.880]   Something like 15.3% of the students have household incomes that are in the top 1%.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.640]   Now that is not a good reflection of society.
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.960]   That's very imbalanced.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:13.960]   And we know this.
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:18.440]   We know that private universities attract wealthier families because wealthier families
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   can pay higher tuition rates.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:21.440]   All right.
[00:16:21.440 --> 00:16:26.720]   The second way to calculate the value of a college degree is to estimate the lifetime
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.720]   earnings of the graduate.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:32.760]   According to Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce, it estimates
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:37.280]   the lifetime earnings of a bachelor's degree holder is about $2.3 million.
[00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:43.240]   Therefore, we can assume the value of a college degree is worth about $2.3 million.
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:50.160]   So suddenly paying the outrageous sum of $372,000 to attend four years at expensive Boston University
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:55.720]   doesn't sound that bad because that is a relatively good rate of return.
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:17:00.680]   Unfortunately, in order to earn the $2.3 million, you'll have to work until the assumed
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.040]   age.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:08.280]   And we're talking 40 years of work post-college, which is about $57,000 a year.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:12.520]   So if you truncate your work, if you join the FIRE movement that I helped start and
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:18.320]   talk about in 2009, the value of your college education diminishes.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:23.080]   And if you decide to work longer, let's say until you're 80 years old, as some doctors
[00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.840]   mention, well, the value of your college degree increases.
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:33.760]   However, given it takes 40 years to earn $2.3 million in the study, it is not fair to use
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:39.880]   the estimated lifetime earnings of a college graduate to calculate a college's value.
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:45.200]   Because it's due to the expected real investment returns, we should discount the value of $2.3
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.360]   million to come up with the value in today's dollars, right?
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:56.240]   Because we all know that if inflation is going at 1,000% a year in 10 years, the value of
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.000]   your dollar is going to be worth almost nothing.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   So little.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:05.240]   But if inflation was worth only 1%, well, the value of your dollar is worth more today.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:11.560]   Now, the third way to value a college degree is basically to calculate its net present
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.440]   value of future cash flows.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.120]   And I know I'm going to lose some of you in this.
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:18.080]   It's kind of confusing.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:20.360]   But let me give it a go.
[00:18:20.360 --> 00:18:21.360]   All right.
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:28.160]   NPV, net present value, equals all future cash flows over some holding period discounted
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:32.760]   back to the present using a rate of return.
[00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.040]   Discounting if you think about it is merely the inverse of growing.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.080]   So in this calculation, let's assume a discount rate of 5%.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:44.160]   You can also think about it as the rate of return on your investment, right?
[00:18:44.160 --> 00:18:47.620]   You've got the cost of college, $372,000.
[00:18:47.620 --> 00:18:53.240]   You've got the variable of 40 years, because that is the period of time the college graduate
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.080]   will work.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:01.440]   You've got earnings of $56,700 a year, and the total value of the earnings over 40 years
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:03.400]   of $2.3 million.
[00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:09.760]   So if you input these figures in an NPV calculator, just check it out in the post or go online,
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   you get about $600,000.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.760]   Therefore, for this Boston University graduate who paid full freight, the value of their
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:20.760]   college degree is equal to about $600,000.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:27.000]   And this includes the person's cost, initial outlay of paying $372,000.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:31.440]   And what one commenter pointed out very smartly is that you should take the calculation a
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:39.880]   step further by subtracting the NPV of a high school degree from the NPV of a college degree,
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:46.120]   because the idea is high school is generally free for all if you want, and going to college
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   is a choice.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.880]   So you want to think about what is the incremental return on your earnings if you go to college.
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:57.980]   So the bottom line here is that any of you listeners who went to college can now increase
[00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:01.520]   your net worth, because your college degree is an asset.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:02.520]   It's valuable.
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:04.440]   It should go in the asset column.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:09.800]   Using the cost plus methodology to valuing college degrees, I personally will be able
[00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:13.120]   to add $122,000 to my net worth if I want to.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:20.160]   The College of William & Mary cost about $44,000 for four years from 1995 to 1999 when I attended.
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:25.600]   And then UC Berkeley's Haas School of Business cost $78,000 over three years when I attended
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:28.300]   from 2003 to 2006.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:29.760]   I went part-time.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:34.120]   So all in, $122,000.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:35.120]   Not bad.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.760]   And maybe I should increase the worth of my college degree even further because my income
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.980]   grew in banking over 13 years, and I retired with about a $3 million net worth.
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:48.580]   So clearly, it's not worth $122,000.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:56.760]   If I ascribe all of my earnings power to college, then the value of the college degree is higher.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:01.560]   But you can't ascribe all your earnings power to college, right?
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:07.040]   Because over time, you grow, you learn, maybe you become entrepreneurial, or you read things
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.040]   like personal finance books, right?
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:10.360]   Buy this, not that.
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.120]   Or you watch something on TV, or you take other classes.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:17.400]   And that also helps improve your earnings power.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:19.220]   Well, hopefully it should.
[00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:20.720]   And there's one final point.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:23.120]   Good news for college degree holders.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:26.200]   We all like to complain about the cost of college.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.200]   Ridiculous.
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:31.760]   Going higher faster than the rate of CPI every single year.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.680]   How can this be when everything is free online?
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:39.080]   Well, the good thing is if you already have a college degree, then the value of your college
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:44.840]   degree also increases every single year, thanks to cost inflation.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.480]   And this helps boost our net worth.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:49.160]   Every year we're getting richer thanks to our college degree.
[00:21:49.160 --> 00:21:53.520]   You know, it only cost me $44,000 to go to William & Mary for four years back when I
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.520]   did.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.260]   But now I'm just looking at it.
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:22:01.080]   It costs $270,000 all in for an out-of-state student today.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.800]   And why can't I assign the value of an out-of-state student's cost?
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.960]   It's the same degree.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:11.940]   So essentially I've earned a 6x return on my investment over 24 years later.
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.300]   And that's a healthy 12% compound annual return.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.920]   And I know some of you guys are thinking, "Man, Sam, you're crazy for thinking this
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   way."
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:21.600]   But again, what is an asset?
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.060]   What is an investment worth?
[00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:29.880]   But what we say it's worth and what kind of income it produces for us over time.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.280]   Alright, folks, thanks for listening.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:37.880]   I hope this episode has helped explain why some people have entitlement mentality.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:43.000]   And I think it's because they simply don't understand the full value of what they get
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:44.780]   for what they're paying.
[00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.000]   So I guess maybe educators are right.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.760]   Education is the key to a happier life, to more wealth, and more freedom.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.940]   And if you want to have an easy way to keep boosting your net worth, keep reading books.
[00:22:57.940 --> 00:23:03.160]   Every book you finish adds to your net worth by at least the cost of the book and at most
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:07.200]   how much more wealth you can build because of the book.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:13.200]   Some books, like my book, Buy This, Not That, at financialsamurai.com/buy-this-not-that,
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.400]   will give you actionable advice that will make you more money.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.760]   That could make you far wealthier than the average person over time.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:23.320]   But you gotta read it and you gotta take action.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:28.700]   So do not discount the value of your education, your college degree, and do not discount the
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:31.560]   value of continuing education.
