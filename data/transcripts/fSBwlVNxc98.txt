[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this evening are to be found in
[00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.160]   the book of the prophet Jeremiah in the second chapter and the eighth verse.
[00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.800]   The eighth verse in the second chapter of the book of the prophet Jeremiah.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.560]   The priests said not, Where is the Lord?
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.000]   And they that handled the Lord knew me not.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:34.280]   The pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.260]   after things that do not profit.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.300]   The priests said not, Where is the Lord?
[00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.400]   And they that handled the Lord knew me not.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:53.120]   The pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.240]   after things that do not profit.
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.980]   We come back once more to this extraordinary statement that we find here in this second
[00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.480]   chapter of the book of this prophet Jeremiah.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.080]   It's a description, as I've been pointing out on previous Sunday evenings, of the condition
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:18.880]   of Israel at a time and at a juncture in their history when things had reached almost their
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.640]   very lowest ebb.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.440]   There had been a terrible declension in a religious sense, in a moral sense, and even
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   in a military sense.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.840]   And here they are, threatened by the attack of the Chaldeans, threatened with the destruction
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.720]   of their country, and they're being carried away into captivity.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:44.200]   The position, in other words, could not have been worse than it was at this particular
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.960]   point in the story.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.560]   But here God sends a prophet.
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.000]   He'd already sent the many prophets.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.480]   Here he sends this prophet Jeremiah, the last of a long succession, to give them a final
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.160]   warning ere it is too late.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:07.280]   And here is the message which the prophet was given by God to deliver to this recalcitrant
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.040]   and rebellious people.
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:17.360]   The essence of his message is this, that they were as they were, in trouble and in distress,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.800]   and worse things were threatening them for one reason only, and that was their departure
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.000]   from the living God.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.120]   You remember he begins bringing that out in the fifth verse.
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.280]   "Thus saith the Lord, what iniquity of your fathers found in me, that they had gone far
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.160]   from me."
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.880]   They had turned deliberately from God.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.000]   They were ignoring altogether what he had done for them in that glorious deliverance
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.080]   from the captivity and the bondage of Egypt.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.240]   They had forgotten all about it.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.240]   They were not interested.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.320]   Neither said they, "Where is the Lord that brought us up out of the land of Egypt and
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.420]   led us through the wilderness?"
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.040]   They were not saying that.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.920]   They had forgotten all about it.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.620]   The most glorious thing in their history meant nothing to them.
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:17.960]   And in the same way they were completely unable to appreciate and to realize the wonderful
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.840]   salvation that God had given them.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.600]   "I brought you into a plentiful country to eat the fruit thereof and the goodness thereof.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.000]   But when he entered in, he defiled my land and made my heritage an abomination."
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.200]   Now that is what he has been telling them so far.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.780]   In other words, their troubles were entirely due to just that, that they failed to realize
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.900]   what it is to be God's people.
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.060]   They failed to realize God's glorious salvation.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:57.820]   They failed to realize the benefits of that salvation which God had given to them so freely
[00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:58.820]   and so fully.
[00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:03.940]   Well, now, I am calling attention to all this because, as I am suggesting, it seems to me
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:11.300]   to present such a perfect picture of the present state and condition of mankind at this very
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:12.300]   moment.
[00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.700]   Our world is troubled.
[00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.700]   Our world is unhappy.
[00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.820]   Terrible things have already happened.
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.780]   It looks as if worse things are going to happen.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.580]   What is the matter with us?
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.340]   What is the matter with the entire human race?
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.740]   What has gone wrong?
[00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.020]   What can be done about it?
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.940]   Well here is the answer.
[00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.580]   You see, there is nothing new in our situation.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.700]   It is a very old situation.
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:43.540]   The Bible is full of stories and descriptions of like and similar situations throughout
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.540]   the centuries.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.700]   And it is always the same trouble.
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:54.300]   The trouble is always that men and women will worship any sort of God and turn in any direction
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.860]   except to God himself.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:00.540]   You know the greatest trouble in the world tonight is not the trouble that is being produced
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.140]   by certain statesmen or by certain countries.
[00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:07.540]   It is not what is happening on the different sides of these so-called curtains.
[00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.500]   That is not the real trouble.
[00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:17.180]   The real trouble is that the whole race of mankind is turning away from God.
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.820]   And that the greatest thing that God has ever done for this world is not even being considered.
[00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:23.940]   What is that?
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.500]   Well he sent his only son into the world.
[00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.780]   He sent his only begotten beloved son into this world as a man in order to save and to
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.700]   rescue and to redeem.
[00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.340]   But the world does not pay the slightest attention to it.
[00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.020]   It is not interested in it.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:43.700]   Interested in everything else.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.500]   Christ, just an expletive, an oath, a curse.
[00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.700]   Blood of Christ, something ridiculous, monstrous.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.020]   Isn't that true?
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:59.260]   And likewise with the great salvation that God offers us, it is here to be seen in the
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.260]   New Testament.
[00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.500]   People do not know what it is.
[00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:03.500]   They are not interested.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.580]   It is offered them, they reject it.
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.180]   They think they know a better way and can make a better life for themselves.
[00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:12.660]   That is why I am calling attention to it.
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.060]   The world today is repeating this unutterable folly of the children of Israel.
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:20.940]   And that is the argument deplied by the prophet.
[00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:24.940]   He says the thing is irrational, it is unreasonable, it is mad.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:26.800]   How can you be doing such a thing?
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.940]   So he goes on pleading with them and urging them to realize the position.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:37.620]   But now then, here we come to another statement in this eighth verse.
[00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:42.980]   The priests said not where is the Lord, and they that handle the law knew me not.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:49.380]   The pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked
[00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.580]   after things that do not profit.
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:54.860]   Here is a further explanation.
[00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.340]   Why were these children of Israel as they were?
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.060]   Well the answer is that their leaders were as they were.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.540]   Like people, like leaders.
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.140]   The people follow the leaders.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.780]   And here the prophet goes on to show how it was the priests and the pastors, which means
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.940]   the princes and the prophets, who were mainly responsible for the state of the people.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.180]   In other words, the people were turning away from God and ignoring his great act of salvation
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:33.220]   and despising the good land into which he brought them, because of the misrepresentation
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.360]   of the truth concerning God.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:41.260]   And that misrepresentation had in turn led to confusion.
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.100]   Now that's the subject that is before us tonight.
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:47.060]   I want at this point to make a very personal statement.
[00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:49.540]   I don't often make this kind of statement.
[00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:53.820]   I feel constrained to make it at this moment.
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.300]   I have to perform this evening what is to me a most distasteful task.
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:02.140]   I would much prefer not to do it.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:03.140]   Well why am I doing it?
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:08.180]   Well I'll tell you why.
[00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.680]   Let me put it in the form of a question.
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.020]   Why do you think I'm preaching on this second chapter of this book of the prophet Jeremiah?
[00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.780]   Here's the fifth Sunday night we've been looking at this chapter.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.540]   Why am I doing so?
[00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:26.500]   You know my friends, there's only one reason for it.
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.860]   I tell you the thing in the presence of God.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.860]   God sees and knows my heart and yours, and he knows all about us.
[00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.980]   I have only one reason for calling attention to this particular chapter, that I verily
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:47.660]   believe that God has called me to do so.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:55.460]   I don't know whether you know anything about preaching and about preparing sermons.
[00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:03.420]   I stand in this pulpit generally some 42 or 43 Sundays every year and preach twice every
[00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:06.380]   Sunday.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.580]   And you know there are times when I have to find my own texts as it were, or I expound
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:16.780]   through a book of the scriptures, and that is a part of my calling.
[00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:21.420]   I'm being called to expound and to teach the scriptures.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.640]   But you know there are times when something remarkable happens.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:33.140]   When a man just finds that he is given a message, he hasn't been seeking it, but it's given
[00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:35.940]   to him.
[00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:39.620]   And I am here tonight and I'm preaching on this eighth verse in this second chapter of
[00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.620]   Jeremiah because this was given to me.
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:46.060]   Not only this verse, the whole thing was given to me.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:49.180]   You know sometimes a man has to work very hard to find a sermon.
[00:09:49.180 --> 00:09:55.020]   I want to tell you that I have received all the sermons I've preached hitherto on this
[00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.220]   chapter as a gift from God.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:00.540]   I've never had less work to do.
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:02.780]   They were opened out before me.
[00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.420]   In other words, I'm preaching on this verse because I dare not preach, because I dare
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.220]   not refuse to preach on it.
[00:10:10.220 --> 00:10:12.500]   I am conscious of this sense of compulsion.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.420]   Now, I'm saying this by way of personal explanation.
[00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.820]   It's a very distasteful thing.
[00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:24.540]   I confess that I'm weak enough and fallible and sinful enough to wish in a way that I
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.420]   wasn't doing what I'm going to do tonight.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.700]   But you see, that's not the business of a preacher.
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:32.220]   He is not to do what he wants to do or what he likes to do.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:35.060]   He is to do what God calls upon him to do.
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.260]   I've got one great comfort.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:42.180]   Jeremiah himself felt exactly as I feel.
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:47.460]   Listen to him in the 15th chapter saying this in verse 10, "Woe is me, my mother, that
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.260]   thou hast borne me, a man of strife and of contention to the whole earth.
[00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:57.260]   I have neither lent unusury, nor men have lent to me unusually, yet every one of them
[00:10:57.260 --> 00:11:00.700]   doth curse me."
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:04.220]   And he repeats it again in the 20th chapter in the 10th verse.
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.180]   Let me read that to you.
[00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:11.220]   "For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side.
[00:11:11.220 --> 00:11:14.180]   Report, they say, and we will report it.
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:20.100]   All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, 'Peradventure he will be enticed, and we shall
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:26.940]   prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him.'"
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:30.380]   Jeremiah didn't want to preach the message that God had given to him.
[00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:35.540]   Indeed, he tells us in that 15th chapter that he decided not to speak any more.
[00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:38.020]   He said, "The more I speak, the more I get into trouble.
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:39.020]   Everybody's against me.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.140]   I seem to be a lone vice, and I'm in great trouble.
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.820]   I wish at times that I'd never been born at all.
[00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:50.340]   Why should I have to be saying something unpalatable and unpleasant while everybody else is saying
[00:11:50.340 --> 00:11:51.860]   something that is quite different?"
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:54.100]   He decided he'd never speak again.
[00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:59.940]   He said, "The word of God began to burn as a fire in his bones, and he had to speak."
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.340]   Well, I'm not comparing myself with Jeremiah.
[00:12:02.340 --> 00:12:04.700]   I'm not foolish enough to do so.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:10.180]   But in a very, very small way, I think I understand more than I've ever done before of something
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:11.500]   of what this man felt.
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:16.140]   I say I'm called to an unpleasant and to a distasteful task.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.140]   What is it?
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:23.260]   Well, let me expound it to you in terms of this situation that confronted the prophet
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.660]   Jeremiah.
[00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.860]   This is what he said, that the condition of the children of Israel was very largely due
[00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:42.000]   to the fact that their very priests and princes and prophets were not fulfilling their function
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.340]   as they should have been, and the people were muddled and confused as a result of it.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:51.020]   Now, this was the terrible thing.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:58.420]   These priests and princes and prophets were still holding the offices.
[00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:03.700]   They were still calling themselves by these names that God had originally given to the
[00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:06.680]   priests, the princes, and the prophets.
[00:13:06.680 --> 00:13:11.900]   They were using the offices, they were using the titles, they were using the very terms
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:15.340]   and expressions.
[00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:21.380]   But they were actually teaching something and doing something that was the exact opposite
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:25.540]   of God's will and God's revelation.
[00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:30.380]   That is the condition that the prophet here is describing.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:34.580]   You see, the priests were meant to lead people to God.
[00:13:34.580 --> 00:13:37.900]   But the priests were not saying, "Where is the Lord?"
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.180]   They'd been called to do that.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.940]   They were the representatives of God.
[00:13:42.940 --> 00:13:47.820]   They were the people who had to teach, the officers that had to teach the people that
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:52.660]   they sinned against God and that therefore they must take their offerings and their sacrifices
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:54.980]   to God that their sins may be covered.
[00:13:54.980 --> 00:14:00.380]   That was their office, an office appointed by God, an office ordained by God.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:05.540]   You read the account of it there back in the book of Exodus and Leviticus and all that.
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:07.300]   It's there in great detail.
[00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:12.180]   God had appointed a priesthood so that the people might be kept in touch with him.
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:14.020]   It was their special function.
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:19.360]   And they had a secondary function which was to handle the law.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.520]   This is descriptive, you see, of the priests.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.980]   The first two statements apply to the priests.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:29.800]   They say not, "Where is the Lord?" and they that handle the law knew me not.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.640]   They were not doing that.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:37.540]   Then the princes who were called here pastors, the shepherds and the guides of the people,
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.940]   God had ordained these in order that they might govern over the people, that they might
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.860]   administer the law, and that they might be a pattern and an example to the nation and
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.020]   to the people as to how they should live a God-fearing life and a God-honoring life.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.580]   That was the meaning of the pastoral office as it were of the princes.
[00:14:58.580 --> 00:14:59.580]   God had appointed them again.
[00:14:59.580 --> 00:15:01.580]   It was God's ordination.
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:06.780]   And that is why he gave these men this great honor, that they might stand out as patterns
[00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:12.580]   and examples to the people, and in turn the prophets.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:18.740]   The business of the prophets was to be constantly watching the condition of the nation and reminding
[00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:23.620]   people of the spiritual character of the law and the exact meaning of the burnt offerings
[00:15:23.620 --> 00:15:24.620]   and sacrifices.
[00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:30.420]   These were to be the kind of seers, the men who rarely had understanding and who were
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:36.660]   to be constantly calling the people back to God and to his law and to his righteous holy
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:37.660]   ways.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:42.740]   But you see what the prophet is compelled to say about them is this, that they were
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.740]   not doing that.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.940]   Well, what were they doing?
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.020]   Well, he says this is what they were doing.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:49.020]   They were turning their backs upon God.
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.380]   They were not asking where is the Lord.
[00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:58.500]   They turned their backs on God and on what he'd done and on what he had revealed.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:01.820]   They that handled the law knew me not.
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.140]   You see, their office was to handle it, to expound it and to teach it.
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.060]   That's what the handling means, handling the word of God.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:11.060]   But they were not doing that.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:12.260]   They were doing it in name.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:15.140]   They were pretending to do it still, but they were actually not doing it.
[00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:16.700]   They don't know me, says God.
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:18.020]   They've departed from me.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:21.380]   No, they're still in the office and call themselves priests.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.260]   They're not fulfilling the functions of the priesthood.
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:25.940]   They're doing something very different.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.380]   They're not bringing people to me.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:31.980]   They've got their backs to me and they're sending the people in another direction, both
[00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:38.300]   in their handling of the sacrifices and in their handling of the law.
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.620]   That was the first thing of which they were guilty, that they had turned their backs upon
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.900]   God and upon God's law and his revelation of himself.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:55.260]   And instead of looking to God and seeking him and expounding, they were, what, well,
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:01.340]   trusting their own minds and trusting their own thoughts and trusting their own understandings.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:05.060]   They'd made a new religion which appealed to them and which they liked, and they were
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.140]   teaching it to the people.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:07.740]   Not God's, but theirs.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:11.900]   They were the authors of what they were teaching, their own understanding, their own reason,
[00:17:11.900 --> 00:17:12.900]   their own thought.
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:16.580]   Indeed, it was even worse than that.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.340]   They were teaching false doctrines.
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:26.420]   The prophets prophesied by Bell and walked after things that do not profit.
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:30.020]   Instead of prophesying in the name of the Lord, they were prophesying in the name of
[00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:37.660]   this no-God Bell, this mere figment of men's imagination, this mere creation of human ingenuity,
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:40.380]   Bell and all he stands for.
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.260]   Idols, things that do not profit, the vanity of which we were treating in the fifth verse
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.940]   where he said, "What iniquity have your fathers found in me that they have gone far from me
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:55.140]   and have walked after vanity and have become vain?"
[00:17:55.140 --> 00:17:56.820]   That's what they were doing.
[00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:02.540]   And the result of all this, of course, turning their backs upon God, trusting their own minds,
[00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:09.260]   preaching the false doctrines of Bell, was that in conduct and practice and behavior,
[00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:15.700]   they and the princes and all the people were guilty of terrible sin and iniquity against
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:16.700]   God.
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:22.540]   And God sends this prophet Jeremiah to them to tell them that if they continue along that
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:27.860]   line that there is only one thing awaiting them, and that is doom and disaster.
[00:18:27.860 --> 00:18:32.320]   That was his message, perfectly plain, perfectly clear.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:35.060]   Now my friends, I say, what am I doing here tonight?
[00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:43.900]   Well, alas, unfortunately, I've got to repeat this message.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:51.180]   Why is the vast majority of people in this country today outside the Church?
[00:18:51.180 --> 00:18:56.500]   Why is it true to say that only 10% of the people of this country even claim to be Christian?
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:57.500]   That's the fact, isn't it?
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.180]   You're aware of that.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.740]   Ninety percent of the people of this country don't even claim to be nominally Christian,
[00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:06.540]   not even interested.
[00:19:06.540 --> 00:19:07.540]   Why is that?
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:18.220]   I am here to suggest that the explanation is still the same, that the people are utterly
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:25.580]   confused as to what Christianity is, as to what it means, as to what it's about.
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:33.260]   There is utter confusion as to what really Christianity stands for and teaches, and what
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.980]   is the cause of the confusion.
[00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:41.380]   Here's the difficulty.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:51.420]   It is because the priests and the pastors and the prophets have misled the people.
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:56.060]   This has been going on for a hundred years and more.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:20:04.740]   And the confusion of today is due to precisely the same cause as it was in the tragic days
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:05.740]   of Jeremiah.
[00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.740]   What is the position?
[00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:12.660]   Let me put it like this, as simply as I can.
[00:20:12.660 --> 00:20:17.980]   The titles are still being used.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:21.620]   The offices are still being occupied.
[00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:31.300]   Preachers, pastors, bishops, clergymen, call them what you like, the titles are still being
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.620]   used.
[00:20:34.620 --> 00:20:39.020]   The titles that are found in the New Testament, the titles that have been used in the glorious
[00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:44.220]   ages of the Christian Church, they're still being used, as they were being used in the
[00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:48.740]   time of Jeremiah.
[00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:54.100]   Not only that, the same terminology is being used, the same language is being used.
[00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:57.500]   Christ is still being used as a term.
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:59.420]   Salvation is still being used.
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.820]   Christianity is still being talked about.
[00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:03.580]   Yes.
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:09.260]   But when you come to inquire as to the content put into the terms, you will find that it
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:17.660]   is often something entirely different, and indeed violently opposed to that of the original
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:24.100]   meaning given in the New Testament itself.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:32.180]   The original meaning has been evacuated, and another meaning has been introduced and insinuated.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:35.420]   Now I'm dealing with this for one reason only.
[00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.260]   I say that there are men and women who are not Christians tonight for this reason.
[00:21:39.260 --> 00:21:41.780]   They're outside the Church, they're not even listening.
[00:21:41.780 --> 00:21:42.780]   Why?
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:45.980]   Well, because they say, "I know what Christianity is.
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:51.260]   I heard so-and-so saying this, or I read in the newspaper that so-and-so said that, and
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:59.460]   they named Church dignitaries, and they're no longer interested in Christianity."
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:05.020]   I verily believe that this is the real explanation of why things as they are, not only in the
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:11.260]   Christian Church but in the country tonight, this is why we are seeing this moral declension.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.820]   This is why this moral problem is alarmingly increasing.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:22.900]   It isn't very safe any longer for a woman to go about alone in London, is it?
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:24.260]   You're aware of all these things.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:25.580]   There's a decline, my friends.
[00:22:25.580 --> 00:22:27.900]   Things are going down from bad to worse.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:28.900]   What's the matter?
[00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:32.660]   I say this is the matter.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:33.660]   What does it mean, says somebody?
[00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:34.740]   "Well, I'll tell you.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:40.340]   Let me divide it up as I've divided up the Prophet Jeremiah's analysis of his own contemporaries."
[00:22:40.340 --> 00:22:44.220]   You know, it's exactly the same thing being repeated.
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:45.220]   What has happened?
[00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:47.540]   Well, I'll tell you what's happened.
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.940]   The Bible is no longer the standard by which people operate.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:56.500]   They've put this aside.
[00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.300]   The Bible is no longer the authority.
[00:23:00.300 --> 00:23:02.220]   It's no longer regarded as God's Word.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.020]   They say the Bible is a book like any other book.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.100]   I say the Church has been teaching this.
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.820]   That's the serious matter.
[00:23:07.820 --> 00:23:12.220]   I'm not going to detain you tonight with anything about the princes, the statesmen, and the
[00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.220]   philosophers.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:14.620]   I could say a great deal there.
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:16.940]   I'm not going to say so.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:22.100]   But you see, as we read the biographies of great statesmen and so on, well, we see that
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:26.660]   they were undermining very often in their personal lives every notion of morality and
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.940]   justice and truth.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:33.060]   Whatever they might have said in their speeches, they have lowered the whole moral tone and
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:34.060]   level.
[00:23:34.060 --> 00:23:38.580]   And it isn't confined only to statesmen.
[00:23:38.580 --> 00:23:43.900]   In philosophers, who should be the seers, the teachers of the people, the people who
[00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:49.780]   should guide us to an understanding of life, what is the truth concerning?
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:55.620]   Most of them, not all of them, but most of them are infidels and atheists and skeptics.
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.540]   And their view of morality, some of them, is this.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.900]   They don't really believe in marriage.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:04.380]   And some of them who do believe, believe you should have an experimental marriage first.
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:05.540]   They teach that openly.
[00:24:05.540 --> 00:24:07.380]   They don't pretend that there's anything wrong.
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:09.580]   They say, "It's eminently common sense.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:10.860]   We must wake up," they say.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:14.060]   So you have an experimental marriage first.
[00:24:14.060 --> 00:24:15.420]   The sanctities are going.
[00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.820]   And these are some of the men who are most responsible for that.
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:22.940]   Well, I don't want to stay with them, the statesmen and the philosophers.
[00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.020]   I'm rather concentrating on this other aspect.
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.460]   Now I say that the Bible and the Word of God is no longer the standard and the authority.
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:33.060]   People do not ask, "Where is the Lord?"
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:35.220]   No, no, they begin to speak.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.060]   And in what terms do they speak?
[00:24:37.060 --> 00:24:43.420]   Well, modern thought, modern thought and knowledge, philosophy.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:44.700]   What does philosophy teach?
[00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:45.700]   Here's the authority.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.260]   This, of course, we don't any longer believe what you find in the Old Testament and so
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.260]   on.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.780]   No, no, a modern thought, modern science.
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:56.940]   Reason, man's understanding.
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:02.140]   These are the tests, these are the standards, these are the things that come first.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:08.700]   As it was in the time of Jeremiah, they've turned their backs upon God and they say,
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:10.480]   "Now this is what we think.
[00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.120]   This is what we say.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.140]   This is what modern thought has led us to believe.
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:17.980]   This is really the modern view of these matters.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:22.460]   This is the kind of truth that's needed in this atomic age, in this post-war age that
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:23.460]   we are in.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:25.140]   And this is it."
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.940]   And they tell you the ideas of men.
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:32.860]   We are given the teachings that emanate from human reason and thought and understanding
[00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:34.420]   and nothing beyond that.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.420]   And what are the results?
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.340]   Well, the results, you see, are endless.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:47.220]   It works out like this, that there has been a complete change in the seat of authority.
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:49.660]   The authority is no longer God and his Word.
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:55.220]   The authority is man and his reason, his knowledge, his understanding.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:58.900]   You see, they're saying this increasingly.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:02.980]   There are men who say that they now understand what is supposed to have happened at the resurrection.
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:03.980]   Why?
[00:26:03.980 --> 00:26:09.140]   Well, you see, the latest discoveries of the committee of the churches which is to investigate
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:12.340]   psychic phenomena enables us now to understand.
[00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:14.940]   Of course, we are very lucky we are alive now.
[00:26:14.940 --> 00:26:18.580]   If we'd been alive at any time before this, we couldn't have believed in the resurrection.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:20.180]   But now we can.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.860]   And you see, the miracles reported in the Old Testament and the New.
[00:26:22.860 --> 00:26:26.100]   "Ah, well, now strange things happen, you know, I think I've quoted you before.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:29.500]   The man who wrote a book, I think, bearing the title 'The Bible is True' or something
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:30.500]   like that.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:33.620]   He says now he can believe, you know, that when Moses struck the rock, the water came
[00:26:33.620 --> 00:26:34.620]   out."
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.620]   Why?
[00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:39.280]   "Well, during the last war," he says, "a sergeant had a group of men and these men were supposed
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:40.940]   to be digging in the neighborhood of a rock.
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:45.260]   And accidentally, the pickaxe of one of the men just happened to strike a rock and some
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:46.260]   water trickled down.
[00:26:46.260 --> 00:26:48.560]   So he can believe the miracle now."
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.860]   You see, how lucky is that he lives now.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:53.380]   If he'd lived before the war, he couldn't have believed in miracles.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:56.780]   But now, well, of course, we are beginning to understand.
[00:26:56.780 --> 00:27:03.380]   Now these are but illustrations, you see, of how the whole seat of authority has changed.
[00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:06.220]   Man's reason is supreme.
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:11.580]   We only believe what we can understand, nothing else.
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:18.020]   And of course, this has drastic results and consequences.
[00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:22.700]   Their whole view of God is different.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:26.660]   They say quite openly in the name of the Christian Church that they don't believe in the God
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:27.660]   of the Old Testament.
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:31.900]   "Ah, they say that was a tribal God."
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:36.020]   Do you know that there's a man in America with the title of bishop and a very prominent
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:42.900]   man in the World Council of Churches who says that he regards the God of the Old Testament
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.340]   as being largely a bully?
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:48.500]   No, I'm not inventing these things.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:52.540]   I am telling you things that can be seen in print.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:53.540]   A bully.
[00:27:53.540 --> 00:27:59.220]   This is said in the name of the Church, in the name of Christianity.
[00:27:59.220 --> 00:28:04.140]   God of the Old Testament is nothing but a tribal God sitting in his anger on top of
[00:28:04.140 --> 00:28:05.140]   a Mount Sinai.
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:07.660]   They say they don't believe in him.
[00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:10.180]   They have no use for such a God.
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:14.420]   They believe they say the God of Jesus and this God of the Old Testament they reject.
[00:28:14.420 --> 00:28:18.780]   Of course, they conveniently seem to forget the fact that the Jesus whom they claim to
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:24.660]   have as their authority believed in the God of the Old Testament and said so quite plainly
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:27.260]   and said that the Scriptures could not be broken.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.300]   But you see, it affects their whole view of God.
[00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:30.300]   Why?
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:34.220]   Well, they don't like a God who is a just God.
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:38.700]   They say that God of the Old Testament talks about being a jealous God and a God of wrath.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:40.220]   He says he's going to punish.
[00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:44.100]   He gives a law and he tells people if they break it that he will punish them.
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:49.220]   They say we cannot believe in such a God and they don't believe in such a God.
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:53.340]   And they therefore create a God after their own imagining, a God that fits in with their
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.900]   reason and understanding and their sentimentality and he's nothing but laugh and smile has
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.060]   been blindly upon everybody.
[00:29:01.060 --> 00:29:04.700]   It affects their very belief in God himself.
[00:29:04.700 --> 00:29:10.180]   But the point I'm emphasizing is this is said in the name of the Christian Church.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:17.020]   The priests, the prophets, the pastors still holding the offices, still using the terms,
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:22.980]   have evacuated their meaning and interpolated their own meaning even about the being of
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:26.060]   God himself.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:29.660]   Is it surprising that the nation is as she is?
[00:29:29.660 --> 00:29:35.380]   Is it surprising that there is lawlessness and vice and immorality and confusion and
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.380]   discord?
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.940]   It's not a bit surprising.
[00:29:38.940 --> 00:29:43.740]   The people always are like the God whom they claim to worship.
[00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:46.940]   But not only does it affect their view of God, it affects the whole of their view of
[00:29:46.940 --> 00:29:48.180]   Old Testament history.
[00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:51.980]   See, they don't believe of a beginning when God created the world.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:52.980]   No, no.
[00:29:52.980 --> 00:29:54.900]   They don't believe men started worshipping God.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.980]   They believe in what they call comparative religion.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:04.580]   And they believe that men started by worshipping, oh, spirits in trees and in stones, animism.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.860]   And they gradually went up and believed in a multiplicity of gods, a sort of polytheism,
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:13.460]   and up and up they came until at last this one nation arrived at a belief in one God,
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:14.460]   monotheism.
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.860]   They say, "That's what you've got.
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:17.620]   It's a development upwards.
[00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.380]   You don't start with God and depart from him as the Old Testament says.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:22.380]   No, no.
[00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:24.940]   You gradually arrive at God.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:29.260]   It's the exact opposite of what you're told in the Old Testament."
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:35.460]   And of course, in the same way, their view of men is entirely different.
[00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:40.500]   The Bible teaches that men is made in the image of God and that he's a moral and a responsible
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:41.500]   being.
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:49.020]   It says that he's different from all the animals, that God put something of his own nature into
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:52.980]   men and intended him to be the Lord of creation.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.540]   But that's no longer believed.
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:57.060]   Man is just a reasoning animal.
[00:30:57.060 --> 00:31:00.780]   He's just evolved out of the primitive slime.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:05.180]   Man is nothing beyond an animal, the highest form of animal, of course.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:08.700]   This part of the brain called the cerebrum has developed more in men than in other animals,
[00:31:08.700 --> 00:31:09.700]   hence men.
[00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:11.620]   But he's essentially one with all the others.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:13.340]   That's what they teach about men, you see.
[00:31:13.340 --> 00:31:18.100]   And they do it in the name of God and in the name of the Bible and in the name of the Christian
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   church.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:22.820]   And of course, the people are listening to them.
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.660]   They say, "After all, we're only animals.
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:30.380]   What's wrong then if we behave like animals?
[00:31:30.380 --> 00:31:36.100]   If we're only animals, well, why shouldn't our morals go back to the farmyard?
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.020]   And let's behave as the animals do in the farmyard.
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:40.460]   We're nothing but animals.
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:43.600]   Well, then what's all this nonsense about?"
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.100]   And so, you see, they're accepting the teaching and they're putting it into practice.
[00:31:48.100 --> 00:31:52.100]   And of course, it applies in the same way, this follows next, in their whole view of
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:53.100]   sin.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.620]   They don't believe in such a thing as sin.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:57.140]   They don't like it.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:01.340]   In the name of Christianity, they tell people not to believe that they're sinners.
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:02.860]   They say, "It's all nonsense.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:04.740]   It's bad psychologically for you.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:07.300]   It will make you have a poor opinion of yourself.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.540]   It will only depress you."
[00:32:08.540 --> 00:32:12.700]   "No, no," they say, "what you've got to do is to believe in yourself and to trust yourself
[00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.140]   and to express yourself."
[00:32:14.140 --> 00:32:16.500]   They're teaching people that in the name of Christianity.
[00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:19.940]   They say, "Don't listen to their term, sin.
[00:32:19.940 --> 00:32:22.460]   That's been the thing that has troubled the human race.
[00:32:22.460 --> 00:32:25.020]   It's created psychological problems," they say.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:31.500]   "It's accounted for most of the misery in the past and made people psychologically sick."
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:35.940]   That's what they say, you know, but the actual facts are, of course, that there was much
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:41.020]   less psychological sickness when people did believe in sin than there is now.
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:44.980]   It is now that the psychological illnesses are on the increase.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:50.960]   As man has ceased to know himself as a creature of God and as he's lost the category of sin.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.460]   But they don't believe in sin.
[00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:54.180]   Oh, it's the same with everything.
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.820]   They don't believe in prophecy.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.780]   The Bible says that 800 years before the time, the prophet Isaiah and others prophesied the
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:04.900]   coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, said where he was going to be born, even in the little
[00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   town of Bethlehem, and gave many details about it.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:09.060]   They don't believe in foretelling.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.420]   They say it's impossible.
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.420]   Why?
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.700]   Well, they don't believe in the supernatural, rarely.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:18.780]   You see, a man can't foretell the future, so they knock out the whole of prophecy.
[00:33:18.780 --> 00:33:19.780]   But still more serious.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:25.020]   I don't want to stay with these unpleasant and unsavory details, but I'm trying to show
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.540]   you why the people are outside the church and why their souls are lost.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:34.220]   They've been confused in the name of Christianity, as to what Christianity is.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:39.300]   And so I come to the question of our blessed Lord himself.
[00:33:39.300 --> 00:33:43.340]   Who is he?
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:50.380]   Well, in the name of Christianity, many of them don't believe in his virgin birth.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:53.300]   Many of them don't believe in his unique deity.
[00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:57.860]   They say that he achieved divinity, that because he was such a good man, he as it was became
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:00.820]   divine and we can do the same if we only follow him.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:05.100]   They don't believe that the only begotten Son of God, the second person in the blessed
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:10.020]   Holy Trinity, came out from heaven and took unto him human nature and was born of the
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:11.020]   virgin womb.
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.700]   They reject it.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:17.940]   He's only the greatest man, the greatest religious genius that the world has ever known.
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:20.380]   Of course, out go the miracles also.
[00:34:20.380 --> 00:34:22.660]   These were just the imaginations of people.
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:26.620]   They can explain them all, they think, quite easily.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:31.220]   Turning water into wine was a joke.
[00:34:31.220 --> 00:34:38.100]   That poor man of Gadara, oh, he can easily be explained, they say, in terms of local
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:40.220]   circumstances with which they are familiar.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:45.380]   Did you know that a man, an eminent, prominent man in the Christian church today wrote a
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:53.380]   book not long ago and he actually said this, that of course he doesn't believe in the
[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:57.300]   virgin birth of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:00.580]   He said it's quite obvious as to who he was.
[00:35:00.580 --> 00:35:04.060]   He said, haven't you noticed in all the pictures he's always given fair hair?
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:05.060]   Why?
[00:35:05.060 --> 00:35:07.700]   Well, he was obviously an Aryan.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:09.100]   How did he come to be an Aryan?
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:14.420]   Well, they say, you know, that at the time he was born, Rome had captured and had conquered
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:19.380]   Palestine and in the Roman army there were legionaries from different parts of the world
[00:35:19.380 --> 00:35:23.420]   and amongst the legionaries there happened to be German legionaries.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:28.540]   So at that time there were a number of German soldiers serving in the Roman army, living
[00:35:28.540 --> 00:35:31.460]   in this conquered land of Palestine.
[00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:41.180]   And Jesus of Nazareth was the illegitimate son born to that girl Mary of this German
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:42.180]   soldier.
[00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:50.820]   Now that is being taught in the name of Christianity and of the Christian church.
[00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:53.060]   That's the position, my friends.
[00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:55.940]   Is it surprising that people are not Christian?
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:59.940]   All you see that we are told here is rejected, it's dismissed, but they still call themselves
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:09.060]   Christians and preachers and pastors and professors in the Christian church.
[00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:16.300]   Much of his teaching is likewise dismissed and when you come to his death, they don't
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:20.940]   see the Son of God taking upon him the sins of men and bearing the punishment and dying
[00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:23.380]   for us.
[00:36:23.380 --> 00:36:27.940]   What they see is just a great tragedy, that he was too good for the world which didn't
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:32.220]   understand him and that out of malice and spite and hatred they put him to death to
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:33.220]   get rid of him.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:34.220]   Nothing more than that.
[00:36:34.220 --> 00:36:38.260]   Except that they may add that it was very wonderful the way in which he took it and
[00:36:38.260 --> 00:36:43.260]   said in spite of your doing this to me, I tell you that God still loves you.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.260]   No substitution.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:50.220]   There was no meaning in all the burnt offerings and sacrifices of the Old Testament.
[00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:54.660]   John the Baptist didn't know what he was talking about when he said, "Behold the Lamb of God
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.300]   that taketh away the sins of the whole world."
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:37:00.860]   That was just Jewish nonsense he didn't understand.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.420]   They know better by now.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   These things are not true.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.860]   A theology of bloodless.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.420]   They ridicule it.
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:12.340]   No, no, that was the death of a martyr and one who taught that God was love by taking
[00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:13.340]   it in the way that he did.
[00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.860]   The resurrection, of course, they just don't believe.
[00:37:15.860 --> 00:37:19.700]   They don't believe that he rose literally in the body from the grave on the morning
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:21.260]   of the third day.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.580]   That's impossible to them.
[00:37:22.580 --> 00:37:23.580]   That's miraculous.
[00:37:23.580 --> 00:37:24.580]   So it's rejected.
[00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:28.580]   And, of course, if you tell them to believe that he's going to come again, riding the
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:32.700]   clouds of heaven to judge the world, they just explode with laughter.
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:39.400]   The thing they say is monstrous and ridiculous.
[00:37:39.400 --> 00:37:43.980]   They treat the writings of the apostles in exactly the same way.
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:48.260]   I was reading a sermon by a man the other day, a sermon, I'm saying, delivered in the
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:52.620]   Christian church, in which the man said that he was looking forward very much to having
[00:37:52.620 --> 00:37:56.460]   ten minutes with the apostle Paul when he got to heaven, that he'd got a few points
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:58.180]   on which he'd like to put him right.
[00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.460]   Oh, you say it's a joke.
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:04.580]   Well, but you know, I don't understand the men who in the name of Christ can joke about
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:06.900]   the apostle Paul.
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:10.180]   They don't accept the authority of the apostles.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:14.300]   The apostle Paul says that the Christian church is built upon the foundation of the apostles
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:15.300]   and prophets.
[00:38:15.300 --> 00:38:19.260]   They say that they can put the apostles right, that they can correct them, that the apostles
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:23.980]   made many mistakes, and they are in the superior position of being able to tell them where
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.980]   they went wrong.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:29.500]   They know more about Christ than Saul of Tarsus knew, the apostle Paul knew.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.260]   They don't hesitate to say so.
[00:38:31.260 --> 00:38:38.820]   And so they play fast and loose with the remainder of the teaching of the New Testament.
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:44.220]   And from all this it follows, of course, that their view as to what it means to be a Christian
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:48.060]   and how one becomes a Christian is in line.
[00:38:48.060 --> 00:38:49.060]   What is a Christian?
[00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:51.220]   A Christian is a man who lives a good life.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.260]   A Christian is a man who does good.
[00:38:54.260 --> 00:38:55.460]   How does one become a Christian?
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:57.780]   Well, by doing good.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:59.980]   You try to live as Jesus Christ lived.
[00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.620]   You try to carry out his precepts and practices.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:06.300]   You try to sacrifice yourself, and you try to be a philanthropist.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:10.900]   You do that, they say, you do your best, it's all right, that makes you Christian.
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:15.100]   You make yourself a Christian by the life which you live.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:20.700]   That's their teaching, as to what it means to be a Christian and how you become a Christian.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:24.020]   So of course the men of the world, hearing all this, says, well, then I needn't go to
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:25.020]   a place of worship.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.180]   I can do all that outside.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.060]   There are many excellent people doing it outside.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:32.540]   They never go near a place of worship, but they're good men, they're moral men, and they
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:34.420]   do a tremendous lot of good.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:36.980]   Very well, what you need the Christian church for at all?
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:40.380]   And logically people say, there's no object in it and we'll never attempt it.
[00:39:40.380 --> 00:39:43.860]   There's no purpose in it.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:48.540]   And finally, of course, when you ask them what they teach about and believe about death
[00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:55.780]   and what may lie beyond it, what they tell you is this.
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:57.940]   There is no such place as hell, of course.
[00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.340]   There's no such condition as being in hell.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.460]   That's impossible, that's not compatible with the love of God.
[00:40:04.460 --> 00:40:07.660]   Doesn't matter what you do, doesn't matter what you believe or not believe, everybody's
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:08.980]   going to be right at the end.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:15.260]   If they believe in a future life at all, they certainly don't believe in hell.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:21.380]   They don't believe that a man's eternal destiny is decided in this life and in this world,
[00:40:21.380 --> 00:40:24.580]   not so much by what he does, but by what he believes primarily.
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:26.860]   That's rejected completely.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:32.500]   We've got great John 3, 16 saying, "God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:37.580]   Son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:40:37.580 --> 00:40:39.420]   They've blotted it out.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.460]   Nobody's going to perish.
[00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.700]   No punishment, no hell, no eternal retribution.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:48.340]   Do what you like, it doesn't matter.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:52.540]   If there is a future at all, beyond death and the grave, it's going to be all right
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:56.620]   for everybody because God is love.
[00:40:56.620 --> 00:41:04.220]   Now, my friends, that is the popular teaching.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:08.060]   I think you'll agree with me.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:11.780]   But I'm here to say that it is all wrong.
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:12.780]   It is a lie.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:17.620]   "Ah," says someone, "but that just means that you were arrogant.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:20.180]   You're standing up there and saying that you alone are right.
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:21.180]   You were conceited."
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:24.780]   Well, as it happens, thank God I'm not alone.
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:30.820]   There are many others who stand in the position that I stand, but we are in a very small minority.
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:32.340]   Now I want to make that clear.
[00:41:32.340 --> 00:41:36.380]   We are in a minority, but we are a number.
[00:41:36.380 --> 00:41:40.020]   I'm not standing alone, but let me put it like this.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:45.740]   This isn't arrogance, this isn't conceit, and I'll tell you why.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:51.940]   These things are not a matter of opinion.
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:56.380]   I don't stand in this pulpit to voice my opinions.
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:59.740]   My whole case depends upon the fact that I don't do that.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:00.980]   "Well, what are you doing, sir?"
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:01.980]   someone will say.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.140]   "Well, I'll tell you what I'm doing.
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:10.620]   I am simply expounding, opening out, repeating the teaching of this book.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:14.060]   I'm not saying the conclusions at which I've arrived.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:20.020]   I am simply saying what I'm told here, and in doing that I'm doing nothing original.
[00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:24.900]   I'm simply going back to the old authority, the authority that was recognized in the Church
[00:42:24.900 --> 00:42:25.980]   throughout the centuries.
[00:42:25.980 --> 00:42:27.540]   I'm doing nothing new at all.
[00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:30.620]   I'm simply doing what was done at the Protestant Reformation."
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.700]   Do you remember what the position was then?
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:37.460]   The Roman Catholic Church, you see, instead of preaching the Bible and the Gospel of Jesus
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.660]   Christ, was preaching her own theories, preaching the Pope, preaching the Virgin Mary, preaching
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:48.500]   the saints and prayers to the saints, preaching a magical transubstantiation, and saying that
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:53.220]   the body of Christ was literally in that bread, and that you ate his body, and so forth.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:56.980]   That was what they were preaching, and the people were in darkness, and sin was rampant
[00:42:56.980 --> 00:42:57.980]   over the nations.
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:02.180]   But then there came the great Protestant Reformation, and what brought it?
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:04.860]   Well, this is what brought it.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.300]   At first there was just one man, Martin Luther.
[00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:09.300]   What did he do?
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:11.300]   He went back to the Bible.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.540]   He didn't sit down and work out a philosophy and say, "Well, no, I disagree with them here
[00:43:15.540 --> 00:43:16.540]   and there and there."
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:21.300]   No, no, the poor men, miserable, unhappy, conscious of his sin, not knowing what to
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.580]   do and seeing the awful abuses in the church.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:30.100]   He went back and read his Bible, and he made a tremendous discovery.
[00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:34.380]   He said, "All that this church has been teaching for centuries, and all that I was taught as
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.180]   I was trained, is not the Word of God.
[00:43:37.180 --> 00:43:38.340]   It's a lie.
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:40.820]   The Bible says justification by faith only.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.980]   They say justification by the church.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:45.100]   They say justification by sacraments.
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:49.620]   But this says justification by faith only."
[00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.500]   And the Reformation came out of that.
[00:43:51.500 --> 00:43:53.820]   It was nothing but a return to the Bible.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.180]   It wasn't Luther's philosophy as against Roman Catholicism.
[00:43:57.180 --> 00:43:59.580]   It was a return to the Word of God.
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:07.540]   And every great revival in the history of the church has been precisely the same thing.
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:12.740]   And that is all, my dear friends, that I am trying to do with you this evening and every
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.620]   other Sunday evening.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:17.700]   I am simply pleading with you along these lines.
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:20.380]   I say, "Come back and consider the book.
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.100]   What's your authority?
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:28.340]   Are you really content to base your eternal future upon what men think and say?"
[00:44:28.340 --> 00:44:30.700]   A man says, "I can't believe in a God of wrath."
[00:44:30.700 --> 00:44:37.540]   Are you prepared to risk your eternal destiny upon the fact that he can't accept it?
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:41.900]   Are you prepared to base your position upon philosophers?
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:47.100]   These men were simply putting forward theories and who so often fail in practice, as I say.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:49.700]   Are you prepared to risk everything on just that word?
[00:44:49.700 --> 00:44:51.420]   I can scarcely believe it.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.300]   But that is what people are doing.
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:54.300]   What do we need?
[00:44:54.300 --> 00:44:57.740]   We need, I say, to come back to this, we need an authority.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:01.980]   We must begin to ask, "Where is the Lord?"
[00:45:01.980 --> 00:45:05.940]   I am tired of hearing about science and about philosophy.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:11.860]   It's all but the result of man's mind and man's reason and man's understanding, and
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.940]   it isn't working.
[00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:14.980]   The world is as it is because of that.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.980]   It's breaking down.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:25.060]   When will you come back and ask with me, "Where is the Lord?"
[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:35.100]   Isn't it about time we realized our own finiteness, our own failure, our own miserable fallibility?
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:40.500]   Isn't it about time I asked that we turn back to the living God?
[00:45:40.500 --> 00:45:45.180]   Isn't it about time we said, "Men are failing us in spite of all their boasting and their
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:50.420]   learning and their prophecies of a marvelous age that was to come as the result of knowledge.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.420]   We are unhappy.
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.420]   We are in misery.
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:54.300]   Our world has gone mad.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   Everything is going wrong."
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:46:04.340]   Isn't it time we ceased from men and began to ask, "Where is the Lord?"
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.900]   That's the first step.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:12.940]   Repentance, confession of sin, confession of failure, confession of futility.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:13.940]   What then?
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:19.540]   Well, having turned back to him, here's the second step.
[00:46:19.540 --> 00:46:30.860]   Accepting his revelation of himself and his holy law and his way of salvation and rejecting
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:35.260]   your bells and everything else.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:38.540]   That's the way back.
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:43.420]   Did you notice how the apostle Paul put it there in 1 Corinthians chapter 3?
[00:46:43.420 --> 00:46:50.580]   "If any man," he said, "willeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that
[00:46:50.580 --> 00:46:53.020]   he may be made wise."
[00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:54.020]   What's he mean?
[00:46:54.020 --> 00:46:55.020]   He means this.
[00:46:55.020 --> 00:47:00.620]   He said, "I know numbers of you people in Corinth regard me as a fool.
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:04.340]   I came amongst you in weakness, fear, and much trembling.
[00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:08.340]   And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of men's wisdom."
[00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.860]   You see, he hadn't discussed philosophy with them.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:12.660]   He hadn't put up this theory and that.
[00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:15.460]   Plato and Aristotle and Socrates and the schools.
[00:47:15.460 --> 00:47:17.420]   He hadn't displayed his great learning.
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:19.140]   He'd got it, but he hadn't used it.
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:25.100]   He said, "I determined not to know anything among you save Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:47:25.100 --> 00:47:31.700]   They said this meant Paul was hopeless, doesn't seem to know any philosophy.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:36.580]   He said his presence is weak, he has nothing to look at, and his speech is contemptible.
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:37.580]   Look at him.
[00:47:37.580 --> 00:47:38.580]   "Ha!" they said.
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:45.900]   "Ah," says Paul, "the wisdom of this world is folly in the sight of God.
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:48.980]   And if a man wants to be wise, let him become a fool as I am.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:53.780]   Let him say, 'I determined not to know anything save Jesus Christ and him crucified.'"
[00:47:53.780 --> 00:47:59.700]   It means this, you see, that in the futility of this present hour, in our bewilderment
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:07.260]   and loss and shame, let us come back to God and let us listen to his word, his revelation.
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:19.340]   And this is what he'll tell you, that he made men and that he made them for himself.
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:26.780]   That man is a sinner and a fool, and that all his misery and unhappiness is due to his
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:30.540]   sin and his folly.
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.780]   God will tell you if you come back to this book that you'll never be blessed as long
[00:48:34.780 --> 00:48:41.420]   as you're disobeying God, that the way of the transgressor is hard, that God does punish
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:46.460]   and will punish, and that you can think and say what you like, but it won't make the slightest
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:50.580]   difference to God, and the world today is proving it.
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:56.060]   That's what he'll tell you.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:49:01.180]   And he will tell you that if you persist in that course, that things will go from bad
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:13.340]   to worse, and that if you die in that condition, you will go to eternal suffering and loss.
[00:49:13.340 --> 00:49:20.540]   He will tell you furthermore that there is to be a final judgment of this world, and
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:22.300]   that a man's destiny is eternal.
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:25.020]   That's what he'll tell you.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:33.540]   But he'll tell you this also, thank God, that though the world in its folly has sinned against
[00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:43.500]   him and rebelled against him and gone its own foolish way, and though it deserves nothing
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:53.100]   but utter retribution and punishment and calamity, that he so loved the world that he sent his
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:50:01.740]   only begotten Son into it, Jesus of Nazareth, was the only begotten Son of God, born of
[00:50:01.740 --> 00:50:03.540]   a virgin.
[00:50:03.540 --> 00:50:13.220]   The archangel said to Mary, "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and cover thee.
[00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:18.020]   That holy thing that shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God, the power
[00:50:18.020 --> 00:50:24.460]   of the highest, a miracle, a virgin birth, Son of God, taking human nature."
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:25.780]   That's what—why did he do it?
[00:50:25.780 --> 00:50:26.780]   Why did he come?
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:31.300]   Well, he came in order to deliver us.
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:36.580]   And he will tell you that that blessed Son of God, who had never sinned at all, went
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:44.300]   deliberately to the cross on Calvary and died to bear your punishment and mine.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:52.620]   His body was broken, his blood was shed for us, that we might be forgiven, that God might
[00:50:52.620 --> 00:50:59.500]   be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus, that God in his infinite wisdom
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:06.660]   has discovered the only way to reconcile his own love and justice, his mercy and his righteousness,
[00:51:06.660 --> 00:51:10.860]   and his own Son has done it.
[00:51:10.860 --> 00:51:19.100]   The most glorious thing the world has ever known or ever will know, that God was in Christ
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:26.820]   reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and that if you
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:32.460]   and I come, just as we are, without waiting a moment, and acknowledge and confess our
[00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:38.940]   sin and shame and believe this message concerning the Son of God and his dying for us, we shall
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.980]   be immediately forgiven.
[00:51:42.980 --> 00:51:50.220]   We shall be given a new life, shall become new creatures, shall be made Christians by
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:56.580]   the power of the Holy Spirit in a new birth, shall go on living as new men and women, and
[00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:03.420]   shall be ushered into the presence of God, perfect and holy, by the Lord Jesus Christ
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:04.420]   himself.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:05.420]   That's it.
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:06.420]   That's Christianity.
[00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:14.380]   And that alone is Christianity.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:17.740]   I am not hesitating to say it.
[00:52:17.740 --> 00:52:27.980]   Other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ, the
[00:52:27.980 --> 00:52:33.300]   one foretold, the one who came, the one who is risen, the one who will come back again,
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:39.340]   the one who died as a ransom for sinners.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:45.180]   Let the world laugh at it and mock it and jeer at it.
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:48.780]   There is no other foundation.
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:55.340]   It is God's way, and it is therefore the only way.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:52:59.060]   My dear friend, are you afraid of life?
[00:52:59.060 --> 00:53:03.300]   Are you afraid of the morrow and of the future?
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:06.420]   Are you afraid to die?
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:09.660]   Are you defeated by sin and by the evil one?
[00:53:09.660 --> 00:53:14.940]   There is only one answer to it all.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:21.300]   It is this salvation of God that is offered through his only begotten Son.
[00:53:21.300 --> 00:53:29.700]   Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, born of the Virgin Mary, manifested his glory in his
[00:53:29.700 --> 00:53:37.100]   miracles, crucified under Pontius Pilate, his soul made an offering for sin, risen in
[00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:43.540]   the body triumphantly from the grave, ascended unto heaven, seated at the right hand of God,
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:50.100]   waiting until his enemies be made his footstool, coming back again to judge and to reign and
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:55.220]   to hand a perfect kingdom to God, his Eternal Father.
[00:53:55.220 --> 00:54:01.620]   Let men say what they will, whatever their office, whether they be priests or prophets,
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:07.100]   bishops, clergy, preachers, professors, let them call themselves what they will.
[00:54:07.100 --> 00:54:15.500]   Here and here alone is God's truth.
[00:54:15.500 --> 00:54:19.820]   You reject it at the peril of your soul.
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:32.860]   You believe it, and you will find salvation and a hope of glory that can never fade away.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.780]   Amen.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:38.700]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
