[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.440]   - Episode number 500, and who would have thought
[00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.720]   that we would make 500 of these?
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.880]   And there's a lot of work yet to be done, Pastor John,
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.760]   and the email questions are pouring in
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:18.240]   as fast as they ever have before.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.200]   But as we near the end of our second year,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.160]   and as Pastor John, and as 2014 closes,
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.360]   we wanna stop and look back,
[00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.760]   because there's so much to be grateful for.
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.660]   There's been much grace poured out
[00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.200]   on Desiring God this year.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.120]   Pastor John, when you think back over the ministry of DG,
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.800]   what happened in 2014, and what's to come in 2015,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   what excites you the most?
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.040]   - Well, here's a front burner thing,
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.540]   because it's always the personal that excites me most,
[00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.380]   not just the stats, although I love those too.
[00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.080]   I just got a letter just the other day
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.460]   from a woman who told me that she was at one day
[00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.720]   in Tennessee in the year 2000, so that's 14 years ago,
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:05.000]   and, 15, I guess, resolved not to die collecting shells.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.560]   She went with a team then to China
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.120]   to a people group that had not had a Christian witness,
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.460]   she said, since Hudson Taylor.
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.760]   After a year with the team,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.600]   she said the team was discouraged and depressed
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.280]   with unresponsiveness of the people,
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.000]   and someone suggested that the team watch the sermons
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.260]   on Romans 9 from Desiring God.
[00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.960]   Nine, not eight, not Romans 8, Romans 9.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.500]   This is what surprised me in the letter,
[00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500]   and she said that they did, and that they had never,
[00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.660]   she said we had never heard such a vision
[00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.980]   of God's absolute sovereignty,
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.620]   and then she said, to my wonderful amazement,
[00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.860]   it was exactly what they needed at the moment.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.780]   God strengthened their hands.
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.440]   Within the next year, a 74-year-old man was converted,
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.540]   and he became instrumental in making gospel recordings
[00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.220]   for the people group.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.520]   So one of the things that makes me soar,
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.580]   whether it's year-end or any other time,
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.500]   with thankfulness, is the number of missionaries
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.540]   whose hands are strengthened in their work by Desiring God.
[00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.060]   I love these warriors, and it is one of the greatest honors
[00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.060]   of my life to be any help I can be in their great cause.
[00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:34.900]   So that's the main and front burner thing for me,
[00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.480]   but it may be that some of our listeners
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.500]   really do like statistics,
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.740]   so it just might encourage them just about the scope
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.020]   of the reach of Desiring God,
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.340]   and so I'll give a few here to give a glimpse
[00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.260]   in who we are, what's happening.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260]   In recent months, there have been about three million visits
[00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.780]   to the website each month, and about half,
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.640]   about 50% more than the same time a year ago.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.240]   We don't know why this is really a remarkable season
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.060]   at Desiring God, and for me,
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.380]   one of the most amazing facts about those numbers
[00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.380]   are that 40%, I was told by Josh, one of our directors,
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.540]   have never been to Desiring God before,
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.540]   and I asked him, "How does that happen?"
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.300]   I mean, how did 40% of three million people a month
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.060]   find we even exist?
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.420]   And one of the answers is, he said,
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:39.260]   "Nine million people in this past year
[00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:42.860]   have visited through Google searches.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.980]   They have found us through Google searches,"
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.140]   which means that somebody went to Google
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:49.380]   and they typed in something,
[00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.460]   Christian marriage, same-sex marriage and Christianity,
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.460]   Ebola and Jesus, physician-assisted suicide and God,
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.180]   or something like that, and lo and behold,
[00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.300]   these guys are so smart that in the top two,
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:08.140]   three, four, five, six responses on Google
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.020]   comes up a Desiring God article or sermon,
[00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.060]   and they click through, and this just blows me away
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.940]   because the mission statement of Desiring God
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.040]   is we exist to spread, spread a passion
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:24.940]   for the supremacy of God in all things
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:27.700]   through the joy of all peoples through Jesus Christ
[00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.620]   by highlighting the truth that God is most glorified in us
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.060]   when we're most satisfied in Him.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.500]   And so when people find their way to us
[00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.340]   who've never heard of us before,
[00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.180]   I am simply amazed and thrilled.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.820]   This past year, the content team told me
[00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.340]   that we've produced about 1,000 new resources,
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.980]   including with you and me,
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.020]   about 260 new "Ask Pastor John" episodes,
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.220]   about 600 new articles.
[00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.780]   We've got these two apps, "Ask Pastor John" app
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.060]   and the Solid Joys app,
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:04.460]   and I think there's been about 100,000 downloads of APJ
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.820]   and about 300,000 downloads of the Solid Joys
[00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.380]   so that people are just regularly tuning in
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.820]   with the app in that way.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.740]   Besides working with you in this happy thing
[00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.020]   called "Ask Pastor John,"
[00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.900]   this year has seen the emergence finally
[00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.020]   after two years of dreaming of "Look at the Book"
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.260]   as a study help, and so I'm immersed totally
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.820]   in preparing these unusual kinds of Bible study helps
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:35.180]   with "Look at the Book," and we started in October.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.820]   We're producing two a week now,
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.460]   and we plan to do that right on into the next year
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.220]   and see how God blesses that.
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.740]   What we're really about at Desiring God
[00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:49.740]   is serious biblical substance and content.
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.700]   We don't want just fluff,
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.220]   which means besides the significant articles
[00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.300]   that are produced, there are books.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.300]   I think the content team published five e-books
[00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.100]   through Desiring God,
[00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.060]   and then I think there were four new books
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.780]   in the traditional publishing way,
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.660]   "A Godward Heart" and six volume
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.140]   of the "Swan" series of biographies,
[00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.540]   the "Dawn of Indestructible Joy" advent book,
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:20.900]   and the collection on C.S. Lewis, "Romantic Rationalist."
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.900]   So I'm excited to have two extended writing seasons
[00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:29.160]   that Desiring God wants me to take next year
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.460]   in order to continue that production of books.
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:36.780]   So God willing, I'll be able to at least make a good start,
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.620]   I hope finish a book on how we make the most of God's word.
[00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.100]   I don't have a title for that yet,
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:45.840]   but something about the heart engagement
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.580]   and the mind engagement with the Bible,
[00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.380]   and then probably another volume
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.940]   of the "Swan" series of biographies
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:56.620]   on Spurgeon and Hudson Taylor and George Mueller,
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.700]   'cause they were all friends in London
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:01.300]   and they make a very interesting triumvirate.
[00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.340]   And all of that output at Desiring God
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:10.340]   is for real people and comes from real people.
[00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.260]   There are two teams that make it happen,
[00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.080]   a content team, you're on that content team,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:19.060]   and an amazing tech team.
[00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.820]   These guys behind the scenes who make everything possible.
[00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:27.620]   They're on a kind of two-week sprint interval
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.620]   to provide improvements and bug fixes all the time.
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.620]   We are so about making this content accessible.
[00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.680]   We don't charge for it,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.180]   we don't make people register for it.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.100]   We say you can copy and paste anything you want,
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.140]   you can download anything you want,
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.180]   you can share anything you want.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:51.460]   We're all about spreading,
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:56.460]   which means that it costs us about $3.8 million a year
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:00.500]   for this team and all this technology.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:05.500]   84% of which comes from donors who love what we do.
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:09.220]   And we love those donors who love what we do
[00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.260]   and make it possible.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.940]   It's just incredible to me how much is available
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:18.820]   in God-centered truth for life-changing,
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:23.820]   Bible-saturated, Christ-exalting content that's out there.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.420]   So I just wanted, Tony, to take the opportunity
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.420]   to say thank you to all those who have shared
[00:08:32.420 --> 00:08:36.260]   in this ministry and just say pray for us
[00:08:36.260 --> 00:08:41.260]   and may your 2015 be your best year yet.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.380]   Amen, thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:45.660]   I'm so honored to be a part of this team
[00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.380]   and to be working on this podcast.
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.540]   And thank you listeners for making this podcast
[00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:50.500]   a part of your life.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.300]   All the facets of the ministry of Desiring God,
[00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.200]   which include initiatives like this daily podcast,
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.780]   Ask Pastor John, and Look at the Book,
[00:08:58.780 --> 00:09:01.740]   and our line of eBooks, and our devotional app,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.260]   Solid Joys, and the daily content that we publish
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:07.180]   at the blog, it's all made possible by the prayers
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.900]   and financial generosity of many friends of the ministry
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.660]   who love what we do.
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.580]   So as we near the end of 2014, we wanna take a moment
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.740]   to thank everyone who supports our work
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.020]   because behind the incredible growth of web traffic stats
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:24.260]   that we're seeing at desiringgod.org is a lot of labor.
[00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.240]   And behind that labor are the financial contributions
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.760]   from listeners like you.
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.400]   And if you'd like to become a partner with us in this work,
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.240]   you can do so online right now.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.020]   Go to desiringgod.org, click on the Donate tab
[00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:39.200]   at the top of the page.
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.860]   Your financial support is greatly appreciated by us.
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:45.500]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and tomorrow we return,
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.380]   and I ask Pastor John, of all of his books,
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.720]   what are the best Piper books for the beginning reader?
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.880]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:55.040]   (silence)
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.200]   (silence)
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.360]   (silence)
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:09.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
