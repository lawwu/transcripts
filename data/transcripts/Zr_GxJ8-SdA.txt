[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040]   I should like to call your attention this morning to the words that are to be found
[00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:20.780]   in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter, reading verses 19 and 20.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:28.960]   And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-world who believe, according to
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.920]   the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.160]   the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places?
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.440]   Perhaps again we'd better remind ourselves of the full context.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.720]   The apostle is here telling these Ephesians of his prayers for them.
[00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:59.200]   He first of all tells them that he ceases not to give thanks for them, making mention
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.760]   of you in my prayers, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:12.900]   give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:21.400]   The eyes of your understanding being enlightened, that you may know, one, what is the hope of
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.480]   his calling, two, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints, and
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:37.600]   three, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-world who believe, according
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.280]   to the working of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from
[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:50.680]   the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.680]   and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world,
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.480]   but also in that which is to come, and so on.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.260]   Now, we've been looking at this great prayer for a number of Sunday mornings in working
[00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:13.360]   through this first great chapter of this epistle.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:20.400]   We began last Sunday morning on a consideration of this third thing, which the great apostle
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.080]   is so anxious for these Ephesians to know.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:33.320]   He prays that the Holy Spirit may open the eyes of their understanding.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:37.960]   They won't know anything apart from that, that is always necessary.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.360]   From the beginning to the end of the Christian life, we cannot know these things apart from
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:50.280]   the enlightenment, the anointing, and the anointing, which the Holy Ghost alone can
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   give us.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.920]   So the apostle starts by praying for that, in order that they may come to know these
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.920]   three great and all-important things.
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.960]   What is the hope of his calling?
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:12.320]   To know for certain that I am a child of God, that I am an heir of God and a joint heir
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.160]   with Christ.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.720]   I must be sure of my hope.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:29.160]   Then secondly, I must know about the inheritance to which I am going, this amazing inheritance,
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.200]   the riches of the glory of God's inheritance in the saints.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:40.160]   I must experience something of the fortiest of that.
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:47.120]   He has already been dealing with this in talking about the Spirit as the earnest of our inheritance,
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:54.040]   but he wants us to know more about it from a study of the Scriptures and the truth.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.960]   To see the promised land more and more clearly.
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:01.200]   Nothing is so strengthening to faith as that.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.720]   Nothing so enables one to go through this earthly life and pilgrimage as that.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.080]   And then we come to this third thing.
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:19.760]   The exceeding greatness of his power in us who believe, and so on.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:27.960]   Now I would remind you again that we emphasized last Sunday morning that it is most important
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.760]   that we should realize that the apostle here is not praying that the Ephesians may have
[00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:35.960]   more power.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.040]   That is not the prayer at all.
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.320]   He is not asking God to give them more power.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.160]   What he is praying for is that they may come to know the power of God that is already working
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:48.480]   in them.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.800]   You see a very different thing.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.960]   We need power certainly, and power is offered us, and power is given us.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.560]   But what the apostle is praying for here, this is his peculiar petition, is that they
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.880]   may know the exceeding greatness of his power in us that believe.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.640]   And then you remember he goes on to describe it.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.800]   We have already dealt with his description of it.
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.360]   We have taken these words one by one, the exceeding, the surpassing greatness of his
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.760]   power.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.940]   His superlatives were exhausted.
[00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.920]   He piles them one on top of another, and still it is not enough.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:34.760]   So he goes on to talk about the working of his mighty power, the energy of the strength
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.200]   of his might.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.000]   That is the power.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   We looked at that last Sunday morning.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.200]   This energy, this strength of God's might is effectively and effectually working in
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.000]   us who are Christians.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And the thing that the apostle prays for is that we may come to know that, that we may
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.680]   understand that, we may be fully aware of it.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.920]   But we can't leave it at that, because the apostle doesn't leave it at that.
[00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.080]   In other words, he's not concerned only that we may come to know something about this
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.800]   in general.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:22.320]   He is anxious that we should know this in our own particular cases and in our experiences
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:25.040]   here and now.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.680]   Obviously, he was writing a pastoral letter.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.360]   He wants to help these people.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.880]   He wants them to enjoy the Christian life.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.160]   He wants them to be excellent and find advertisements of the Christian faith.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.720]   So he is praying that they may know this here and now.
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.800]   Very well.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:49.320]   How can we come to know this great power of God that is working in us?
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:56.100]   Well, the first step, it seems to me, is that we should be perfectly clear in our minds
[00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:05.040]   as to what exactly the apostle is saying and that to which exactly he is referring.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.360]   He wants us to know this exceeding great power of God in us.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.680]   Well, in what respect?
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:20.200]   There are those who say that what the apostle had in his mind here was simply our future
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:26.800]   resurrection and that he was concerned about nothing else.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:30.160]   That he was more or less saying this to them, "Very well, I've established the fact
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   that you're heirs.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.740]   I've given you a glimpse of that inheritance to which you're going, and now I want you
[00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:42.280]   to know that not even death itself can rob you of that, because there is power in God
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:48.960]   which will enable him to raise you from the dead even as he raised his own son from the
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   dead."
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.560]   And they say that that is all, that the apostle here is simply praying that these Ephesians
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:03.560]   may know this power of God in the resurrection which will raise them up at the last day and
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:07.360]   therefore take them to heaven and to glory.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.320]   Now this is obviously a very vital and a very serious question.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:17.020]   Is the apostle only referring to that or not?
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:22.840]   I want to try to establish this morning that he is not only referring to that.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.160]   He includes that; it comes in.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:33.840]   But I want to try to show you that he is referring not only to that climactic event in the experience
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:38.760]   and the life of the Christian, but that he is referring to the whole of the Christian
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:45.560]   life from the very beginning right until the very end.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.200]   That what the apostle is concerned about here is to show that it is the power of God that
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.520]   leads to the whole of the Christian life, not only that great event, but even the beginning,
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.000]   the believing, everything in connection with the Christian life.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:08.660]   That indeed we are not Christians at all apart from the power of God.
[00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:14.860]   Now there are many ways, I think, in which we can establish this point.
[00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:21.280]   For one thing, it would seem rather odd, would it not, that the apostle should be praying
[00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:28.920]   with such urgency that these Ephesians might be confident about their final resurrection.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:33.240]   It does not seem to be a very appropriate thing to do for people whom he is anxious
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.400]   to encourage at that moment.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:41.100]   But there is further evidence which goes well beyond that.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.400]   The important statement, the important words here are these words translated "according
[00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:48.180]   to".
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:55.600]   You notice, "And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe according to
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:02.720]   the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead?"
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:14.600]   Now, the whole question is, what exactly is the significance of those two words "according
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.600]   to"?
[00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:24.600]   Do they have reference to the believing that has just gone before, or has he, as it were,
[00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:30.080]   paused after saying "to us who believe" and then go on to say "according to the
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:34.760]   working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ"?
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.360]   What is the meaning of "according to"?
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:46.440]   Well, let me give you the answer to that question that is given in an authoritative lexicon
[00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.320]   like the grim fare lexicon.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:11:01.040]   It says that "according to" rarely means "in consequence of", "by virtue of",
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:08.920]   or if you prefer it, "through", "on account of", "from", "owing to".
[00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:14.940]   Those are the words that it offers at this particular point as a better translation than
[00:11:14.940 --> 00:11:17.320]   "according to".
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.200]   And undoubtedly this is right, so that we might read this, "And what is the exceeding
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:32.200]   greatness of his power in us who believe in consequence of, in virtue of, the working
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.680]   of his mighty power, the energy of the strength of his might?"
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.840]   In other words, it is an account of how we believe, that we believe in virtue of his
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.760]   power, we believe in consequence of his power, we believe through, on account of, owing to,
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:52.800]   from his power.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:12:00.640]   Now, lest someone may think that we are relying only upon a lexicon, let me show you some
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:08.440]   of the parallel statements and passages where the same word is used in exactly the same
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   way.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:14.280]   There are quite a number of them in this first chapter of this epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:20.000]   The first, for instance, is in the fifth verse, where we read this, "Having predestinated
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:26.720]   us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:29.120]   of his will."
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:36.080]   The same, exactly, "in virtue of", obviously, "as a consequence of the good pleasure of
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:37.440]   his own will."
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:42.360]   Or take it in verse 7, "In whom we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.380]   of sins according to the riches of his grace."
[00:12:48.380 --> 00:12:54.200]   In virtue of, as the result of, in consequence of, the riches of his grace.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:59.960]   Or, in verse 9, you've got it, "Having made known unto us the mystery of his will
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:02.800]   according to his good pleasure."
[00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:08.280]   You see, it's all the result of this, in consequence of, by virtue of.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:14.400]   And it's the same in verse 11, "In whom also we have obtained an inheritance, having
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.880]   predestinated us according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.600]   of his own will."
[00:13:23.600 --> 00:13:25.400]   But let us look at some other examples.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:30.080]   This is such a crucial point that I don't apologise for spending so much time on the
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.200]   mechanics of the interpretation this morning.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:36.680]   Take the third chapter, verse 7.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.320]   The apostle is referring to the gospel of Christ.
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:46.720]   Then he goes on, "Whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.880]   of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power."
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:56.240]   Now, there is a sense in which "according to" there is almost meaningless.
[00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:03.200]   He was made a minister by virtue of, as a consequence of the gift of the grace of God.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:05.360]   It was the thing that produced it.
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.540]   It was the cause of it.
[00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:09.140]   So you see, it's very specific.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:11.840]   But take verse 11 again.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:16.120]   He says in verse 10, "To the intent that now unto the principalities and powers in
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:22.160]   heavenly places might be made known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:27.360]   to the eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:35.000]   Then in verse 16, "He prays that God would grant you according to the riches of his grace."
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.840]   Still the same thing, you see, as before.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:44.440]   And then take verse 20, "Now unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:50.720]   that we ask or think according to the power that worketh in us."
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:57.640]   It means "by virtue of," it means "in consequence of," and it can carry no other
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   meaning whatsoever.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:05.040]   Now, it's exactly the same word used in exactly the same way in all these cases.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.280]   Indeed, I have quite a long list here, but I mustn't wear you with many more.
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.840]   Take one more in the epistle to the Ephesians, the first chapter in the twentieth verse.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:21.360]   The apostle says, "I know that this shall turn to my salvation through your prayer and
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:30.300]   the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ according to my earnest expectation and my hope, etc."
[00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.400]   And then, perhaps the most striking of all, the one I really had in my mind, is the one
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.640]   at the end of the third chapter of Philippians.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:43.800]   Paul says, "Our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour,
[00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:51.440]   the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall change this our vile body, that it may be fashioned like
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:59.600]   unto his glorious body according to the working, whereby he is able even to subdue all things
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:00.600]   unto himself."
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:07.240]   Now, there is a sense in which this "according to" doesn't really tell us very much.
[00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:13.880]   But if we read it by virtue of the working, or in consequence of the working, as the result
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:18.960]   of the working, well, then, of course, the meaning opens out very perfectly to us.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.300]   Well, there are large numbers of other illustrations.
[00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:25.400]   If some of you are interested to turn it up, let me give you the list.
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:31.040]   You will find it in Philippians 4, 19, in the first chapter of Colossians, verses eleven
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:35.920]   and twenty-nine, in the second epistle to the Thessalonians, the first chapter in the
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:45.600]   twelfth verse, the second chapter of Thessalonians, verse nine, 2 Timothy 1.8, Titus 1.3, Hebrews
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:50.320]   2.4, 1 Peter 1.3, 2 Peter 3.15.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:58.240]   Now, I have adduced all this evidence in order that we may establish this point beyond any
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:02.560]   question whatsoever.
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:09.040]   The apostle here is really dealing with the Christian life from beginning to end.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:14.920]   And what he really says here is this, that we may know the exceeding greatness of his
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:28.200]   power in us who believe by virtue of the working of his mighty power.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:34.440]   Our very believing is the result of this power of God, the whole of the Christian life, not
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.760]   only the resurrection, which is in a sense the end, but the beginning.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.560]   We are not Christians at all and cannot be Christians apart from this mighty working
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:48.160]   of this power of God.
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:54.320]   But of course, there is a sense in which I need not have based my exposition upon the
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.920]   meaning of words and grammar and so on and analogies in Scripture.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.600]   The very passage that we are dealing with does it itself.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:10.040]   You remember that I indicated last week that the apostle, here in praying for this, goes
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:14.680]   on with this same theme right into the second chapter.
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:21.640]   But he interrupts himself because, in illustrating this power in the matter of God raising our
[00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:25.440]   Lord from the dead, he went off into a digression.
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:30.800]   He describes him as set in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power, and
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:35.100]   says that God has given him as head to the church over all things, and that the church
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:38.600]   is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:42.240]   And then he, as it were, recollects himself and comes back to it.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:48.560]   And you, hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein in time past
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.840]   he walked, that's what you were; but God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith
[00:18:52.840 --> 00:18:57.600]   he loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together with him.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   That's the manifestation of the power.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.000]   So that the apostle is not talking about the resurrection that is to come, he's talking
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.800]   about a resurrection, a spiritual resurrection, that has already taken place.
[00:19:10.800 --> 00:19:16.240]   He's talking about us as believers, and we are believers because this power of God has
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:18.440]   already worked in us in that way.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:24.920]   So you see, from every standpoint, from that of grammar and of language and of context
[00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:31.580]   and everything else, the apostle clearly here is concerned that we may know the exceeding
[00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:37.600]   greatness of this power from the very beginning to the very end of the Christian life.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   It is all the power of God, even our initial believing.
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.080]   Now then, the question therefore arises whether we all are aware of that and whether we all
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:54.240]   do know that, whether we all realize that.
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:59.000]   I ask my question for this reason.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.040]   We all of us tend to betray what we really believe about these matters in our common
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.520]   talk and speech.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:14.880]   There's a very simple way to show and to prove whether we realize this or not.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:21.120]   If we do know this thing about which the apostle is praying, well then, we shall always give
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:26.920]   the impression that we are very surprised at the fact that we are Christians at all.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:31.520]   It will come out in our praise, in our thanksgiving.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.720]   It will come out in this sense of wonder, love and praise and astonishment in our ascribing
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.400]   everything to God and claiming nothing for ourselves.
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:47.360]   We shall be, as the apostle says in writing to the Corinthians, "Him that glorieth,
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:53.000]   let him glory in the Lord from beginning to end and in every respect in all parts of his
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   great salvation."
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.480]   But the question is, do we realize this?
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:09.000]   Do we realize that our very believing the gospel is by virtue of the power of God that
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.840]   worketh in us?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.240]   Do we know that?
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:21.680]   I go on asking my question because there is surely a tendency today to talk in a very
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:31.760]   superficial manner about believing as if believing were something which is very easy and which
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:37.760]   any man can do if he is disposed to do so.
[00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.240]   How lightly and glibly we talk about believing in the Lord Jesus Christ or about believing
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.240]   the gospel.
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.920]   It seems today to be the simplest thing in the world to get people to believe and for
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.060]   people to believe.
[00:21:49.060 --> 00:21:55.520]   They say yes to it, believing is something extremely simple.
[00:21:55.520 --> 00:22:02.720]   There is a great deal of talk about our need of power after we have become Christian.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:09.080]   But how rarely does one hear anything at all about the need of power before we become Christian.
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:14.080]   The impression seems to be that a man believes and decides to believe and that having done
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.920]   that he needs tremendous power to continue in the Christian life.
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:25.780]   But one never hears it suggested that perhaps one needs exactly the same power in order
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.000]   to enter the Christian life, and that without it one simply cannot enter the Christian life
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   at all.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.640]   Now, I think you will agree with me that that is the present tendency.
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:44.040]   There is this tremendous emphasis upon believing and decision, and it is suggested that anybody
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.520]   who wants to do so can do so.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:51.480]   That it is simply for a man to decide, and if he does, well, he can do it.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:58.320]   Believing is apparently something that is easy.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:22:59.320]   Now why is this?
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   Why have we got this idea of believing?
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.280]   It seems to me that there are two main answers to that question.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:15.320]   The first is that it is due to an appalling failure on our part to realize the consequences
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.080]   of sin and of the fall of men.
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:27.480]   It is, I say, our complete failure to understand the devastating effect that the fall of Adam
[00:23:27.480 --> 00:23:30.840]   has had upon the entire human race.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:33.160]   That is one thing.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:41.600]   The second is our failure to realize what is involved in what we describe as the new
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:52.000]   birth or regeneration, our failure to realize the greatness of the change that is described
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:24:02.680]   in those terms, and what is included in them, and why regeneration is ever necessary.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:07.240]   Now it seems to me, and I hope to establish this, that that is the cause of our glib use
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:10.360]   of the word "believe."
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.760]   Our tendency is to say that the natural man can believe, but having believed he needs
[00:24:13.760 --> 00:24:15.400]   tremendous power.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:19.400]   He does not need any help in believing, as it were, but afterwards, well, he needs great
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.000]   power and God will give it him.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:30.260]   Now there is no excuse for this, it seems to me, at all, because the biblical teaching
[00:24:30.260 --> 00:24:38.560]   about the natural man should always have kept us straight in this respect.
[00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:44.360]   You have got it in the Old Testament as well as in the New Testament.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:51.040]   Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots?
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.200]   Surely that ought to have been enough alone.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:58.280]   Leave alone those great statements that we read at the beginning out of Paul's first
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:05.200]   epistle to the Corinthians, chapters 1 and 2, "The natural man receiveth not the things
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:13.080]   of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he, for they are spiritually
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:15.120]   discerned."
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:22.640]   And all this talk about the gospel being foolishness unto the natural man at his very best and
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:27.120]   at his very highest.
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:33.660]   Very well then, I want to try to show you that the Apostle Paul is here teaching that
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:41.480]   the fact that anybody at all believes the gospel is a great miracle, which can only
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:48.680]   be explained adequately in terms of this surpassing greatness of the power of God.
[00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:54.520]   That it takes the energy of the strength of God's might to bring anyone to believe the
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:59.280]   Christian gospel and to accept the Christian faith.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:06.520]   We believe by virtue of this tremendous power.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.200]   Now let me put it to you like this.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:19.200]   Let us look for a moment this morning at some of the things that have to be overcome before
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.520]   any one of us can become a believer.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:26.160]   Oh, what a tremendous thing it is to be a believer.
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.240]   I am not talking about giving a glib intellectual assent to a number of propositions.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.800]   That is not what the New Testament means by believing.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.520]   Paul equates believing here with being born again, as does the Apostle John in his first
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   epistle.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:40.720]   The true believer is a man who is born again.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.960]   He is not a man who just says yes and may tomorrow say no.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   No, no.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:48.400]   Believer is one of these great comprehensive terms.
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.200]   The exceeding greatness of his power to us who believe.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.200]   There is no exceeding greatness of his power to them who do not believe.
[00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:58.960]   It is only to believers.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.880]   It is only to those who have been raised from that death in trespasses and sins.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:09.200]   Well now let us try to consider some of the obstacles that have to be overcome.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.040]   Why should this power of God be necessary before any man can believe?
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:19.280]   Well I will try to answer that by reminding you of some of the effects of the fall and
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:24.920]   of sin upon the human race.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.000]   What has the fall done to the mind of man?
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:39.960]   Here is a man, do you see, born in sin, shapen in iniquity, born a child of wrath even as
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:49.200]   others, and here he is in a world where the gospel is preached by the Christian church.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:52.320]   What is the relationship of that message to that man?
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.120]   Well this is what the scripture tells me about him.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:02.720]   It tells me that his understanding is darkened.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:09.160]   His mind is in a state of darkness as the result of sin.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:12.680]   Now let us be quite clear about that.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.200]   It does not merely mean that he is ignorant.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.320]   He is actually ignorant.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.800]   He does not know the gospel as it is.
[00:28:20.800 --> 00:28:25.560]   It is very difficult to discover what the gospel really is in this world.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:29.600]   This man is in darkness in that respect, yes, but not only in that respect, there is something
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:34.760]   infinitely worse than that.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:40.880]   Even though you may put the gospel before him, he cannot see it.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:45.920]   If our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost, in whom the God of this world hath
[00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:49.440]   blinded the minds of them that believe not.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:54.480]   There is a veil over their hearts, says the apostle about the unbelieving Jews.
[00:28:54.480 --> 00:28:57.320]   You put the gospel before them, they do not see it.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.320]   Why?
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:04.760]   The darkness, the blinds, the opacity in the eyes, they cannot see it.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:09.920]   That is why he has already been praying that they might have the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:11.640]   in the knowledge of him.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.600]   You see, merely to put the gospel before a man is not enough.
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:17.680]   Something must be done in the man.
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:22.520]   The spirit in the word, yes, but the spirit in the man also, and without it he does not
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.520]   see it.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:27.200]   Well, let me quote it again.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:32.700]   These things, says Paul in that section of 1 Corinthians, are spiritually discerned.
[00:29:32.700 --> 00:29:36.260]   The natural men cannot receive them, their foolishness unto him.
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:44.600]   He does not know, he is not interested, his very faculties of understanding is impaired.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:50.920]   His ability to appreciate spiritual truth has gone.
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:57.360]   When man fell, that is what happened to him, and nothing less than that.
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:03.960]   He was not only separated from God, but his spiritual faculty itself was impaired.
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:07.240]   His mind is dark and dim.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.420]   His whole understanding is darkened.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:13.440]   He lacks the ability and the capacity.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:18.400]   That is the apostolic teaching.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:24.440]   But that is not the end of the story as regards this man's mind.
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.360]   He lives in a world where false views are taught.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:35.760]   They are recommended by great names, they are loudly advertised.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:43.360]   And he is a man of the world and a child of his age is entirely prejudiced on that side.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:52.000]   All this is ridiculed, it is analyzed and criticized and derided and dismissed.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.560]   So that not only is this man a man who has a darkened mind and understanding and who
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:04.080]   lacks a spiritual faculty and apprehension, but all the prejudice of the life of the world
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:10.680]   round and about him is dead against it, and it has a tremendous effect upon him.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:15.680]   I must not worry you nor keep you in elaborating this.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.440]   We all know the tendency of everybody to believe what they read in newspapers.
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:22.400]   They still do it.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:27.480]   It is an astonishing fact, but it is a fact that people still believe what they see in
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   a newspaper.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:35.640]   They are proved to be wrong almost every day on details, political details, facts, yet
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.000]   people still say, "I saw it in the paper.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   It must be right."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.440]   And they will even believe what they read in an article.
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:47.120]   There is this curious tendency to accept anything in a paper or in a book.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:51.000]   And especially if it can be said that all the leading people believe it and all the
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:52.600]   scientists are saying it.
[00:31:52.600 --> 00:31:56.080]   All this comes and presses upon a man's mind.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:32:02.640]   Such is the mind of this man who is confronted by the gospel.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.080]   And yet we are given the impression that to believe the gospel is a very simple and an
[00:32:06.080 --> 00:32:12.640]   easy thing, something that a man can do if he decides to do it.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.940]   But wait a minute, there is something much worse than this.
[00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:21.200]   Consider the state of his heart.
[00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:29.000]   What does the Bible tell us about the man's heart as the result of the fall and of sin?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:38.440]   The first thing it tells us about it is that man as the result of the fall is proud, pride.
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.680]   You notice how the Apostle Paul generally plays with this word "boast," translated
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.520]   often "glorying" in our Authorized Version.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:50.120]   God forbid that I should glory.
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:54.920]   God forbid that I should boast.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:33:01.560]   There is nothing that is so characteristic of man as his boasting, his glory, his pride,
[00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:09.240]   and especially his pride of intellect that is the last citadel.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.560]   Man is ultimately proud, above everything else, of his own intellect.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:16.420]   Of course, that is very easy to understand.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.160]   It is man's crowning gift.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.520]   It is the thing that separates him most of all from the animals, his mind, his reason,
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:29.560]   his capacity to think and to look on objectively at himself.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:34.400]   So it is not surprising that man in sin should be especially proud of his intellect, the
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.280]   wise and prudent.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:42.640]   We have the authority of our Lord Himself for saying that of all men, they are the ones
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:46.480]   who find it most difficult to believe because they are wise and prudent.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.000]   He says, "I thank your Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.120]   from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
[00:33:55.120 --> 00:33:59.040]   Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in thy sight."
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:05.440]   It is He again who says, "Except ye be converted and become as little children, ye shall in
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.400]   the wise enter into the kingdom of heaven."
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.520]   Why this demand for childlikeness?
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:15.560]   Well, it is because of pride of intellect.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:20.000]   You see, the natural man always has a feeling that to become a Christian means to become
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:24.800]   a fool, that you have gone soft, that you have become emotional, that you have jettisoned
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:27.800]   your intellect, you have abandoned your logic.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.840]   The idea is that if you still believe this old story, you are not abreast of the times,
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.600]   you are not a reader, you are not a thinker, you are not cultured.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.320]   Isn't that it?
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.920]   And it works on man's pride, his pride of intellect and understanding.
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:43.240]   He is not going to be regarded as a fool.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.600]   He wants to be abreast of the times.
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:46.360]   He is always up to date.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:52.120]   That is the heart of man.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:58.360]   But it is not the only thing that is true of the heart of man as the result of the fall.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:04.680]   We are also told that it is hardened, which I take means something like this, that man
[00:35:04.680 --> 00:35:13.480]   not only is in this state of sin, but he delights in it, and he glories in that which is false.
[00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:19.080]   The wrath of God, says Paul to the Romans, is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   and unrighteousness of men that hold down the truth in unrighteousness, and they do.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:34.760]   They deliberately hold it down because their hearts are hardened.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.960]   If they come under a certain amount of conviction, they try to stifle it.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:38.960]   They stampen it.
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.960]   They argue against it.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:41.840]   They will invent arguments against it.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.080]   They will put up camouflage and all kinds of resistance.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:50.200]   The force of truth they resist with all their might and man.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.200]   Why?
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:52.200]   Well, because their hearts are hardened.
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:57.680]   It is a consequence of sin, and it is true of all of us.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:01.440]   And then let me go on to something else.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.240]   Those of us who attend on Sunday evenings and who realize that an evangelistic service
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:13.040]   is a great deal to say even to believers, we remember that Jeremiah says in the seventeenth
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:26.960]   chapter of his prophecy, in verse nine, "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.960]   wicked."
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:36.520]   Which we interpreted a few Sunday nights ago to mean something like this.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:42.480]   That man in sin is always fooling himself, and in a sense he cannot help it because his
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:44.200]   very heart is deceitful.
[00:36:44.200 --> 00:36:46.240]   It is twisted.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:53.840]   There is a mechanism in the heart protecting a man against his own best judgments at times.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:37:00.040]   This process of rationalizing our sins and explaining away what we have done, of pretending
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:05.000]   to ourselves that we are better than we really are, and that if we do a certain amount of
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:12.960]   good it somehow balances the evil that we have done, the deceitfulness of the heart
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:17.780]   that imagines that God can be bought by an offering, as the Jews imagined in the time
[00:37:17.780 --> 00:37:18.780]   of Jeremiah.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.780]   The deceitfulness.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:28.540]   And oh, how deceitful are our hearts, how utterly dishonest, how we all put on appearances,
[00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:33.700]   and we know in a sense we are doing it, and yet we do it.
[00:37:33.700 --> 00:37:42.040]   But not only is it deceitful above all things, it is desperately wicked.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.040]   Desperately wicked.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:47.020]   Yes, that is true of the most respectable person that has ever been born.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:50.500]   It is true of persons who may be highly religious.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:51.500]   What does it mean?
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:59.020]   Well, there is an evil principle within us—lust, the law of our members, delighting in sin.
[00:37:59.020 --> 00:38:04.780]   This is the condemnation, that the light is come, but men love darkness rather than light
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.520]   because their deeds were evil.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.340]   Men rejoice in iniquity.
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:13.500]   They not only do these things, says Paul in the first chapter of Romans, but they take
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:17.740]   pleasure in them, they do them, they write about them, they joke about them, they talk
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:22.300]   to one another about them, they boast about their evil doing, they love it, they gloat
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:23.300]   in it.
[00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.300]   It is desperately wicked.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:33.020]   That is a part of the description of the natural and regenerate heart.
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.580]   That is man in sin as the result of the fall.
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:41.900]   That is the person to whom this gospel comes with its talk about holiness and light and
[00:38:41.900 --> 00:38:45.780]   truth and God and asks him to forsake the world and sin.
[00:38:45.780 --> 00:38:51.940]   It comes to such a man, and I am told that it is an easy thing for him to believe.
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:39:02.700]   Oh, how can I, whose native sphere is dark, whose mind is dim, before the ineffable appear
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:08.020]   and on my naked spirit bear that uncreated being?
[00:39:08.020 --> 00:39:13.120]   But wait, there is still one other thing I must mention.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:20.100]   The heart of men, according to the Scriptures, as the result of the fall and of sin, is guilty
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:22.900]   even of this.
[00:39:22.900 --> 00:39:26.740]   It hates God.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.700]   It isn't merely that he was a kind of intellectual detachment.
[00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:33.620]   It doesn't believe the Bible and doesn't believe the revelation about God.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:37.220]   No, no, it hates God.
[00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:44.820]   The natural mind is enmity against God, is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:45.820]   can be.
[00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:49.660]   And there is no question at all about the truth of the assertion.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:54.580]   We are all alienated from the life of God, says Paul in the fourth chapter of this very
[00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:56.140]   epistle.
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.700]   Why?
[00:39:57.700 --> 00:40:05.620]   Well, it is, you see, because God is so utterly and entirely different from what we are and
[00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:07.940]   from what we like.
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.540]   So here is the position of men in sin.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:17.220]   His spiritual faculty darkened, his mind darkened, the veil is there, the prejudice of the world,
[00:40:17.220 --> 00:40:25.980]   his own heart desperately wicked and deceitful, hardened, proud, implacable, but above all,
[00:40:25.980 --> 00:40:30.800]   I say, an active hatred of God, an enmity against God.
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:34.700]   And how obvious it is in this modern world.
[00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:40.000]   How ready men are to believe any theory that will explain away creation, they will believe
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:45.240]   the utter nonsense of evolution, which is so thoroughly discredited intellectually today.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.600]   They still hold on to it.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600]   Why?
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:51.720]   Well, it is against God.
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:57.800]   You see it constantly, I say, not only in the newspapers, but even in learned works.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:04.040]   This natural hatred and enmity of men in sin against the Lord God Almighty.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:09.520]   Oh, how he wishes he could get rid of him and remove him and explain the cosmos without
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:10.520]   him.
[00:41:10.520 --> 00:41:13.760]   He has been doing it for a hundred years with all his might and men.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:21.120]   The enmity, the hatred of God.
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:33.240]   The mind, the heart, and likewise the very will of men is paralyzed.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:37.400]   There is a defect even in the will, sin has affected the hurl of men.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:43.680]   Oh, my friends, our failure is due to the failure to realize what happened at the fall.
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:51.280]   This devastating effect, this wrecking of God's image, this defacing of it, in the
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:55.760]   mind and in the heart and in the will.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:03.440]   Well, if you believe all that I have put before you, as the teaching of Scripture with regard
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:12.080]   to the natural men, the unregenerate men, do you still say that such men can easily
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.400]   believe the Gospel?
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:20.800]   Is such a person capable of believing it?
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:24.960]   Surely there is only one answer to the question.
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.100]   What is the exceeding greatness of his power in us that believe by virtue of his mighty
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:43.320]   power working in us to bring one's soul to believe in God and in Christ, demands the
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:52.000]   exceeding greatness of the energy of the strength of God's eternal might.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.720]   And without it, we are utterly and completely helpless.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:09.000]   By the grace of God, and by that alone, I am what I am.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.480]   Why do I believe this Gospel?
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.240]   Why am I not today, like so many thousands, I passed hundreds of them myself coming to
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:23.600]   this service this morning, why am I not going off in my car to the seaside or to a golf
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.720]   course?
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:26.600]   Why am I interested in this?
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.560]   Why do I believe it?
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:34.480]   I have only one answer.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:46.760]   By the grace of God, who worketh in me mightily, I believe I am what I am.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:55.560]   He began it, he'll continue it, he'll finish it, until I stand before him perfect,
[00:43:55.560 --> 00:44:09.680]   entire, complete, and cast my crown before him, lost in wonder, love, and praise.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:11.760]   Amen.
