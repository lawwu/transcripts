[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.360]   Well, at DesiringGod.org, we talk a lot about joy and treasuring as being an ingredient
[00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.440]   to saving faith, part of what saving faith is, the treasuring of Christ.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.040]   And it raises questions like this one from a listener named Nick.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.680]   "Hello Pastor John, thank you for answering so many questions on this podcast.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.680]   Here's mine.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.180]   I recently discovered what you believe the Bible says about saving faith, namely that
[00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.800]   it includes treasuring Jesus above all things.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.520]   This has made me wonder if I truly believed at the time of my apparent conversion.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.040]   I saw growing signs of holiness in my life after my apparent conversion, and obeying
[00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.800]   God has been the number one pursuit of my life for years, but I don't recall being aware
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.840]   of my desire for God himself in my heart over the early years after what I think was my
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.980]   conversion.
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.740]   If I did not begin treasuring Jesus when my apparent conversion happened, was I really
[00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.740]   unsaved?"
[00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.820]   Pastor John, what would you say to Nick?
[00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.660]   Well, the first thing that needs to be said, I think, is that Nick should not lose any
[00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:15.540]   sleep over the question whether he was truly saved, truly born again in that first moment
[00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.300]   of apparent faith.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:24.300]   The all-important question for all of us is the question of right now.
[00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:35.860]   Do we embrace Jesus now as the Lord and Savior and supreme treasure of our lives?
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:44.020]   When and how we came to have this glorious, miraculous preference for Jesus above all
[00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.180]   things, this submission to Jesus as Lord, is relatively unimportant.
[00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.780]   So many Christians trouble themselves about this.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.740]   When I was six, I put faith in Jesus.
[00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.500]   I think, but I'm not going to stake my life on that.
[00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.140]   No way would I say, "If I wasn't a Christian then, I'm not now," or something like that.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:18.180]   I think it was real, but I can't base my assurance or my hope on that.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.820]   It's John Piper's present relation to Jesus that's all-important.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.740]   Now I know that's not an adequate answer for Nick's question.
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.980]   He didn't ask me to tell him that at all.
[00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:37.360]   His question really does relate to real people whom we're trying to bring into a saving relationship
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   with Jesus.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   What about them?
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.660]   What about how you talk to people who are approaching conversion or who just recently
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.140]   put their faith in Jesus?
[00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.960]   What about children who put their faith in Jesus?
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:59.360]   What about people who have been brought to faith in churches that never used the language
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:07.140]   of treasuring Christ or preferring Christ or delighting in Christ as being satisfied
[00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.180]   in Christ or embracing Christ as their supreme value?
[00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.820]   What if they were saved in a church?
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.820]   They've never even heard that language.
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.120]   Nobody's ever even talked like that to them.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.380]   Can they be saved?
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.560]   So let me say four things that might be helpful in this regard.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.220]   Number one, Nick is assuming that everybody who's listening to this maybe will know what
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:38.660]   he means when he says John Biber assumes that treasuring Jesus is part of saving faith.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:45.140]   Well, whoa, I'll bet 90% of the people who are listening are saying, "What?
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.940]   I don't even know what that means."
[00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.380]   So here, let me clarify that.
[00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:03.180]   I do believe that saving faith includes receiving Jesus—that's John 1:12—to as many as received
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.220]   Him, believed in His name, so receiving Jesus.
[00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:16.860]   Saving faith includes receiving Jesus as the chief authority in one's life, Lord, the chief
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:25.180]   benefactor of one's life, Savior, and the chief value of one's life, treasure.
[00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:34.380]   Yes, I believe that's what saving faith does when it welcomes, embraces, receives, trusts
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.380]   Jesus.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:44.500]   Now, I would say that because Jesus said, "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.500]   also."
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:50.260]   So if He's not your treasure, your heart's not with Him.
[00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.820]   And Jesus illustrated conversion with this parable, "The kingdom of heaven is like a
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.020]   treasure hidden in a field, which a man found."
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:05.940]   He found and covered up, and in his joy, joy, he sells everything he has and buys that field.
[00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:13.500]   Now that is just a summary statement of when you discover the preciousness of King Jesus
[00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.900]   standing there ready to come into your life.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.300]   Conversion is a joyful abandonment of all for Him.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:30.980]   Jesus underlines it with two amazing statements, Matthew 10:37, "Whoever loves mother or father
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.220]   more than me is not worthy of me.
[00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.100]   Whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:48.420]   And Luke 14:33, "Anyone of you who does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple."
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:59.260]   So yes, saving faith includes the embrace, the receiving of Jesus as our supreme treasure.
[00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:07.300]   Paul puts it like this in describing his own transfer from darkness in his Pharisee life
[00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:15.100]   to newness in his Christian life, Philippians 3, 8, "I count everything as loss because
[00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:20.900]   of the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ my Lord.
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.860]   For His sake, I have suffered the loss of all things."
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.740]   It's like Jesus said, "Renounce all that you have or you can't be my disciple."
[00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:33.420]   I've suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish that I might gain Christ.
[00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:41.620]   And then he makes it starkly real, joltingly real with a contrast of a blessing and a curse.
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:49.260]   He says, 1 Corinthians 16, 22, "If anyone does not love the Lord, let him be accursed."
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:59.820]   In Ephesians 6, 24, "Grace be with all who love the Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible."
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.460]   So that's my first observation.
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:04.700]   Yes, I think Nick got it right.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.580]   That is what I believe.
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:13.900]   Second observation, what this means is that what happens in conversion is that the spiritual
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:24.820]   deadness and blindness of our hearts is taken away by God's Spirit and we are granted miraculously
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.980]   to see with the eyes of the heart.
[00:07:27.980 --> 00:07:30.380]   Ephesians 1, 18, see what?
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:36.460]   See the truth, the beauty, the reality, the excellence of Jesus through the portrayal
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.460]   of the gospel.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.020]   And I get that from 2 Corinthians 4, 4, "The God of this world has blinded the minds of
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.820]   unbelievers to keep them from seeing," what?
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:50.980]   What can't unbelievers see because of the demonic blindness that grips them?
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.300]   What can't they see?
[00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:58.900]   The light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:04.900]   It's the glory of Christ that we awaken to when the demonic blindness is removed, and
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:07.180]   that's described in verse 6.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:11.820]   The God who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has done that.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:18.060]   He has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.780]   face of Christ.
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:27.420]   In other words, the glory and beauty and excellence and worth of Christ himself in his saving
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:32.240]   work is the greatest good of the gospel.
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:39.340]   He saves us to know him, enjoy him, treasure him as he really is, and then to reflect him
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.260]   and glorify him in our feelings and thoughts and actions.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.860]   Just two more observations.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:52.360]   One is that a person can really be saved, that is really come into this kind of relationship
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:00.340]   with Christ, even if he or she has never been taught all these texts.
[00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:08.460]   The Holy Spirit can create a new heart that treasures Christ in a person who has never
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:13.340]   thought of the word treasure as a label for Christ.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:22.340]   The issue is not what words we use for our experience, but what real miracle has happened
[00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.980]   in our heart.
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:32.100]   I would say that the heart of a truly born-again person, when presented with the alternatives
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:39.060]   of Christ versus parents, children versus Christ, Christ versus health, Christ versus
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:48.780]   life, if those choices are ever presented, the born-again person will prefer Christ.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:54.100]   Christ over parents, Christ over children, Christ over health, Christ over life.
[00:09:54.100 --> 00:10:01.000]   The heart, the new heart will embrace Christ above all things, whatever the language has
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.260]   been taught or used in a truly, miraculously eye-opened newborn heart.
[00:10:09.260 --> 00:10:11.220]   Last thing.
[00:10:11.220 --> 00:10:19.460]   The fight of faith that Paul describes in 1 Timothy 6, 12 is therefore a fight for joy
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.540]   in Christ, a fight for treasuring Christ above all things.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:33.160]   This means that the state of a born-again heart is not without its warfare.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:37.020]   Faith can be stronger or weaker, the Bible says.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:43.600]   That means that our sense of the beauty and worth of Christ can be lively or dull.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:51.800]   Our calling at those times of dullness is to look to Christ, look at His amazing sacrifice
[00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.540]   and His paths of triumph.
[00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.780]   The Lord who judges the hearts of men knows our true condition.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:05.440]   He knows the treasure of our hearts, 1 Corinthians 4, 5.
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:07.880]   He knows those who are His.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.500]   He's never unsure.
[00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:11.800]   Our assurance may rise and fall.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.740]   He's never unsure.
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:18.180]   His faithfulness is our hope.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:24.180]   Only Christ's faithfulness in sustaining us and holding on to us will help us make it
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.900]   to the end and not throw away our treasure.
[00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.140]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:32.140]   Excellent question.
[00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.660]   Nick, thanks for sending it in to us.

[00:11:55.060 --> 00:12:00.740]   Well speaking of saving faith, one of the hardest conversations to have is with a professing
[00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:05.540]   believer who has shown little to no fruit in their lives over the years.
[00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:11.980]   Those are hard conversations to initiate and to do well, but they must be done.
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:16.660]   But what if we're talking about an elderly man or woman nearing death and we who are
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.980]   much younger want to initiate that conversation with them?
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.700]   How do we do it well?
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:23.260]   That's the question on Wednesday.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.780]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke.
