[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.440]   - Pastor John, you are not afraid to define saving faith
[00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.440]   as seeing and savoring Jesus Christ as supremely glorious.
[00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.000]   You have written sentences like these, quote,
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.600]   "Receiving Christ as your supreme treasure
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.220]   "is what faith is," end quote.
[00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.560]   Or, quote, "An essential element of saving faith
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.380]   "is treasuring Christ above all things," end quote.
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.240]   Or, quote, "Faith includes the embrace of Jesus
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.480]   "as our all-satisfying treasure," end quote.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.320]   And today we have a rather critical email
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.760]   from a listener named Colin who writes in to say this,
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.440]   "Pastor John, forgive me, but I think you've gone off
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.000]   "the deep end in your definition of faith.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.140]   "Faith is trust, period.
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.540]   "Abraham believed God and it was counted to him
[00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.560]   "as righteousness," Romans 4:3.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.260]   Definitely loving Jesus more than anything
[00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.880]   is a necessary fruit of faith,
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.000]   but not the means of salvation.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.880]   Why, Pastor John, have you complicated saving faith?
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.360]   - Well, I share the concern of this question
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.360]   that neither I nor anyone else should make faith
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.800]   so complicated that a little child can't believe
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.540]   and be saved.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.960]   I think God has provided in the Bible,
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.720]   to paraphrase John Owen, a stream in which toddlers
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.320]   can wade and an ocean in which elephants can swim,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.720]   or if you can't imagine elephants in the ocean,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.000]   try blue whales, which means that in the Bible,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.800]   the most important realities are presented in ways
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.440]   that are simple and straightforward,
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.440]   and they are presented in ways that reveal layers
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440]   and layers of meaning and reality,
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.600]   which are not always immediately obvious at first glance.
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.400]   I think it is right and good and wise,
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.720]   especially with children, to treat saving faith
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   as essentially trust, that is, trust in Jesus
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.160]   to be who he said he would be
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.640]   and to do what he said he would do.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.160]   That's what trust is, right?
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.240]   Be who you say you'll be, do what you say you'll do,
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.000]   and most essentially, save me from my sin
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.360]   and from death and hell through your death and resurrection.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.680]   I think that is good and right and wise
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.000]   and biblical to stress.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.920]   Trust does that.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.720]   But as you read more and more of the Bible
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.840]   and as you ask more and more questions
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.780]   about the very words you're using,
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.560]   you realize there are dimensions of the act of trusting
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.320]   which have to be spelled out in order
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.680]   for a full understanding of what's involved,
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.120]   and this is owing not just to the fact
[00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   that John Piper might have an overly inquisitive brain,
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.920]   but to the fact that there are biblical passages
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   which call for this kind of reflection.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.480]   For me, the issue was pressed by the Gospel of John,
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.260]   which in one sense is the simplest of Gospels,
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.180]   and in another sense, the most layered of the Gospels
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.380]   in depths of meaning.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.180]   So here's what I mean about believing in the Gospel of John.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.520]   So John 1:12, it says, "He came to his own,
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.820]   "Jesus came to his own,
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.020]   "and his own people did not receive him,
[00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.680]   "but to all who did receive him, comma,
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.140]   "who believed in his name, comma,
[00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:50.560]   "he gave the right to become the children of God."
[00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.560]   So who received him, who believed in him,
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.020]   those are at least overlapping realities, if not identical,
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.400]   but that immediately raises the question,
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.180]   receive him as what?
[00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.260]   Trust him as what?
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.780]   Messiah, king, savior, friend, Lord, God,
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.340]   counselor, financial advisor?
[00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.940]   That's not a joke.
[00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.380]   I think if you don't believe in Jesus
[00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.900]   as your financial advisor, you're not saved.
[00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.600]   That is, if you reject his counsel
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.080]   about how to use your money and say,
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.480]   "You're stupid, I'm smart," that's unbelief.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:36.740]   Is it not wise to say saving faith receives Jesus
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:42.820]   for all that he is in as far as we can understand what he is?
[00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.620]   Some little child can receive him savingly
[00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:49.940]   with genuine faith, genuine saving faith
[00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.020]   for what he is according to what that child truly understands
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:57.460]   and then if he's truly born again,
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.620]   then he will go on receiving him
[00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.620]   as he reveals more and more of who he is as life goes by.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.300]   Jesus said, "The kingdom of heaven
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.840]   "is like a treasure hidden in a field,
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.380]   "which a man found and covered up,
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.860]   "and then in his joy, he goes and sells all that he has
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.900]   "and buys that field," Matthew 13, 44.
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.180]   So one of the things that we receive Jesus as
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.900]   when we're converted is as our treasure.
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.180]   He's treasure hidden in a field
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.420]   and conversion is having our eyes open
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:31.380]   to how valuable Jesus is.
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:36.260]   So we trust, yes, trust, trust, trust him
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.760]   to be all that he says he is for us,
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.660]   namely the supreme treasure of the universe.
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.580]   Trusting Jesus includes that.
[00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.020]   This helps us understand, I think, in the Gospel of John,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.860]   that there's a kind of believing
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.500]   that's not truly saving believing.
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.060]   Listen to John 2, 23.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.660]   Now, when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover,
[00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.500]   many believed in his name
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.420]   when they saw the signs that he was doing,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.300]   but Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.940]   because he knew all people
[00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.160]   and needed no one to bear witness about man,
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:19.200]   for he knew what was in man.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:21.200]   In other words, that believing,
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:22.880]   something's wrong with that, something's wrong.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.720]   That's not authentic.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.080]   And we can see the problem if you go to John 7, 2-5,
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.240]   where Jesus' brothers see those signs,
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:33.920]   they believe in those signs,
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.480]   and they're called unbelievers.
[00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:37.320]   Listen to this.
[00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.740]   This is John 7, 3.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:43.700]   His brothers said to him, "Leave here.
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.780]   Go to Judea that your disciples
[00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.340]   may see the works that you're doing.
[00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:52.500]   For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly.
[00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.860]   If you do these things, show yourself to the world."
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.420]   And then John adds,
[00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:01.660]   "For not even his brothers believed in him."
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:02.500]   Whoa.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.420]   Well, of course they believed in him in some sense.
[00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.080]   You're doing all these wonderful works.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.100]   You're surely the messianic miracle worker
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:11.660]   we've been expecting,
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:15.120]   but they didn't know him for who he really was.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:17.980]   They didn't submit to his new way
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.640]   of bringing the messianic hope into the world.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.800]   They didn't know that he was gonna die for their sins
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.980]   and they would have to renounce all their boasting
[00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:26.660]   and take up their cross and follow him.
[00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.660]   They were totally missing the true reality of Jesus.
[00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.040]   And so all of their belief in him
[00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:38.620]   as the messianic miracle worker is called unbelief.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.260]   Those are the kinds of things that gave me pause
[00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:44.340]   as I was studying this and sent me on a quest
[00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:48.500]   to find what in this gospel really is saving faith.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:50.260]   And I found this verse so helpful.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:52.220]   This is John 6, 35.
[00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.020]   Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life.
[00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:57.540]   Whoever comes to me shall not hunger
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:01.820]   and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:05.540]   It seems to me this gets right at the essence
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:06.740]   of what faith is.
[00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:07.580]   Yes, trust.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:09.180]   It is trust in Jesus.
[00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.160]   It is trust in him as a kind of bread.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:16.260]   It's trust in him as a kind of living water.
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:21.200]   A trust that is of such a eating and such a drinking
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.640]   that the soul is satisfied.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:27.680]   You will never thirst again if you eat this bread.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.160]   And I think that's what Paul was getting at
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.700]   when he said in the case of unbelievers
[00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.720]   that Satan had blinded their minds
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:37.380]   to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel
[00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:41.300]   of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:43.220]   in 2 Corinthians 4, 4.
[00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:46.760]   In other words, to come to a true saving faith,
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.400]   whether a little child or an adult,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:54.400]   you have to experience the miracle of spiritual sight
[00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:59.400]   of the supremely valuable glory of Christ,
[00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:01.140]   the image of God.
[00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:03.460]   In other words, Christ must be perceived
[00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.260]   as supremely glorious.
[00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:08.540]   And a six-year-old experiences that.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.900]   He would never use those words probably
[00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:13.180]   unless he's been incredibly well taught.
[00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.340]   He wouldn't need to use the words.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.340]   He needs the miracle though of seeing Jesus Christ
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:24.600]   as trusted as the best of all,
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:28.020]   the most glorious and valuable of all.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:29.260]   So I'm sorry.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:34.260]   I'm sorry if this seems excessively complicated to people.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:36.700]   Here's what I hope.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.580]   I hope I don't put any stumbling block
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.260]   in anyone's way in trusting Christ.
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.280]   Instead, here's what I hope.
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:50.020]   I hope that people will find Jesus
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:54.660]   as easy to believe for the spiritual mind
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:59.660]   as a billion-dollar inheritance is easy to receive
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.120]   for the natural mind.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.020]   - Boom, this is so distinctive.
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:06.660]   I mean, this is one of the distinguishing marks
[00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:07.860]   of your entire ministry.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:10.360]   Thank you, Pastor John, for addressing it here.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.180]   Well, we are going to take a break for the weekend.
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:14.260]   As we do, I wanna remind you
[00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:16.140]   that you can subscribe to our audio feeds
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.100]   and search our episode archive
[00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.100]   and even reach us by email with a question of your own.
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.580]   You can do all of that through our online home
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:25.940]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:28.560]   Well, there is little question
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:32.300]   that the sins of greed and pride wreak havoc in our culture.
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:33.500]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.300]   So why are Christians so often talking
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:38.600]   about the devastation of homosexual practice?
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.480]   It seems like a sin, if we call it a sin,
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:44.220]   with much less influence than greed and pride,
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:46.340]   which are more widespread and destructive
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:48.080]   to the fabric of society.
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.060]   So why are Christians so distinctly known
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.060]   as anti-homosexual?
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:52.980]   It's a great question,
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.220]   and we will begin next week with it.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.340]   I'm your host, Tony Renke.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.940]   We will see you on Monday.
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:10:59.020]   Have a great weekend.
[00:10:59.020 --> 00:11:01.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:14.180]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
