[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   A horrifying story out of Colorado has grabbed headlines since it happened in August.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:16.400]   It's the story of a man who killed his entire family, his wife of six years, their unborn
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.200]   child along with their other two young daughters.
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.560]   It's sickening, so sickening.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.600]   A listener named Stephanie wrote us, "Dear Pastor John, I'm a 33-year-old mother and
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.800]   elementary teacher.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.400]   My question comes from the recent news that Chris Watts, a Colorado man who killed his
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.880]   pregnant wife and two daughters, has confessed the details of his crime and been sentenced
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.960]   to five life sentences without the possibility of parole.
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.960]   And now in these few short months, he has claimed to have found God in prison.
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920]   After following the news closely back when he was originally suspected of the heinous
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.960]   crime, my reaction to his so-called finding God was anger.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.000]   Is it wrong for me to not want this man who committed unspeakable acts to know my Jesus?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.240]   Do you believe someone like him can truly repent and enter the kingdom of God?"
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.360]   This is weighty because it deals not only with the moral reality of whether someone
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.080]   who has done something so horrific can ever be forgiven, it also deals with how we should
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.320]   feel about it.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.280]   And those are two really, really big issues.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.320]   And I think the safest thing I can do, I just sat down when I heard this question a little
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.400]   bit ago and tried to think of places that are relevant in the Bible.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.520]   So here are six passages of Scripture.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.760]   Let me just read them, and I think it will be obvious to Stephanie how she can appropriate
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.760]   these.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:58.600]   Verse number one, 1 Peter 2.23, "When Jesus was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:06.360]   When he suffered, he did not threaten, but he continued entrusting his cause or himself
[00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.600]   to him who judges justly."
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.920]   In other words, whenever we feel that injustice is being done to us, as it certainly was to
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:25.840]   Jesus on the cross, or to anyone else, we must ultimately entrust our cause, either
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.120]   our own accusation or our indignation at somebody else's accusation or non-accusation, we must
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.520]   entrust our cause to God who judges justly.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.680]   In other words, our final confidence after we have done all we can do with regard to
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.360]   seeing that justice and mercy are done in this world, our final confidence is that God
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.080]   will set all things right.
[00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.600]   Justice will be done.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.920]   Nobody gets away with anything in this universe.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.200]   Romans 12.19, "Vengeance is mine.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.120]   I will repay, says the Lord."
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.740]   And so you don't need to take it up and bear that burden.
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:18.420]   So it's right, it's right for Stephanie to care about justice being done in this universe
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.140]   and nothing being swept under the rug and people getting away with murder, as we might
[00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:25.140]   say.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.140]   So that's the first observation, 1 Peter 2.23.
[00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.500]   Here's the second one, Luke 23.42, "The thief on the cross said to Jesus just moments or
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:40.820]   hours before they both died, 'Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom.'
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:47.860]   And Jesus said to him, 'Truly I say to you, today you'll be with me in paradise.'"
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:57.220]   Which means that an entire lifetime of sinning and stealing from others, and probably worse,
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.020]   can be forgiven one hour before you die.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:10.220]   Matthew 3, Matthew 20.12-15, Jesus told a parable about a farmer who hired workers to
[00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.500]   work all day in his vineyard for one denarius.
[00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.260]   And they said, "Fine, that's good, that's fair pay."
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.540]   And then others came, and by the end of the day, he was hiring people for one hour and
[00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.540]   giving them one denarius.
[00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:23.920]   And the first group complained.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:30.780]   They said this, "These last worked only one hour and you made them equal with us and we
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.780]   borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat."
[00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:39.420]   And he replied to them, "Friend, I'm doing you no wrong.
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.560]   Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.420]   Take what belongs to you and go.
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:48.220]   I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.920]   Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:59.540]   Or is your eye evil because I am good?"
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:07.860]   In other words, God is free to be gracious to whom he will be gracious and to give them
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.220]   anything he chooses.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:19.460]   And every person who is not satisfied with God's choices will hear the words, "I'm doing
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.860]   you no wrong."
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.740]   Number four, Luke 15.25-32.
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.340]   People of the prodigal son, there were two sons, right?
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.020]   And the one who lived the debauched life came home repenting.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.260]   And the father ran out to greet him, blew everybody's mind that he would be so merciful
[00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:45.380]   to his son who had wasted his entire inheritance.
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:52.860]   And his brother who had stayed at home and served like a good slave, that's my interpretation,
[00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:57.020]   and said, "I never broke any of your rules and I didn't ever get a party."
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.900]   Here's what he says, "Your brother has come and your father has killed..."
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.180]   No, this is the report that comes to him of what happened.
[00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:08.180]   "Your brother has come and your father has killed the fatted calf because he has received
[00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.380]   him back safe and sound."
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:11.060]   But he was angry.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.500]   This older brother was angry and refused to go in.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.380]   "His father came out and entreated him, but he answered, 'Look, these many years I have
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.700]   served you and I never disobeyed your command.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:28.860]   Yet you never gave me a young goat that I might celebrate with my friends.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.820]   But when this son of yours comes home who's devoured your property with prostitutes, you
[00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:37.780]   killed the fatted calf for him.'"
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:40.500]   And the father said, "Son..."
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.180]   This is Jesus talking to the Pharisees.
[00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.300]   You have to understand the context.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.740]   The Pharisees have objected his eating with tax collectors and sinners.
[00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:54.340]   This is one of the clearest places in the Gospels where Jesus lets down his woes.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:55.540]   Woe to you, Pharisees.
[00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:04.700]   And he talks like this, "Son, you're always with me and all that I have is yours.
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:09.780]   It was fitting to celebrate and be glad.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.700]   For this your brother was dead and he's alive.
[00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.340]   He was lost and is found."
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.820]   And you can just hear Jesus saying to the Pharisees, "Don't you get this?
[00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.060]   These are your fellow Jews.
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:24.060]   They're being forgiven.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.060]   They're repenting."
[00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:30.460]   So the problem with the older brother is that he lived like a slave, not a son.
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:36.900]   He related to his father as if his work would earn good things instead of enjoying the fellowship
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.180]   of the father's bounty.
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:43.420]   So when the younger brother was freely forgiven, the older brother doesn't have any categories.
[00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:49.940]   He doesn't have any ability for enjoying grace because he's not living by grace.
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:53.060]   Number five, Luke 747.
[00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:58.940]   Jesus visited a Pharisee's house, remember, and a woman from the street came in and bent
[00:07:58.940 --> 00:08:04.900]   over Jesus' feet as they were stretched out behind him at the reclining of the table and
[00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:09.500]   weeping with thanksgiving for her forgiveness of her sins.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:14.900]   She wipes his feet with her hair and the Pharisee was indignant and Jesus told him a parable
[00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:19.420]   about a man being forgiven $500 and another man being forgiven $5.
[00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:22.420]   And he asked the Pharisee which one would be more thankful.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.460]   And he says, "Well, I suppose the one that he forgave more."
[00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:32.780]   And Jesus said, "You didn't anoint my head with oil, but she has not ceased to anoint
[00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.780]   my head with ointment.
[00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.780]   I mean, anoint my feet with ointment.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:44.740]   I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven as you can see in her great love.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.260]   But he who is forgiven little loves little."
[00:08:48.260 --> 00:08:51.980]   And he said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:08:51.980 --> 00:09:00.940]   In other words, our sense of thankfulness and love rises with our sense of how much
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.780]   we don't deserve from God and how much we are forgiven.
[00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:13.620]   Lastly, Psalm 51.3, David had committed adultery with Bathsheba and killed her husband.
[00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:17.660]   That's pretty rotten, ugly.
[00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:24.500]   And he says after he's confronted, he says in this Psalm, "I know my transgressions
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.900]   and my sin is ever before me.
[00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:30.300]   Against you and you only have I sinned."
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.740]   Now that's just outrageous that he would say that, isn't it?
[00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:39.700]   I mean, if you were Uriah's dad or Bathsheba's mom and you heard David say against God and
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:45.540]   God only have I sinned, wait a minute, you killed my son.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:54.580]   Against you and you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sight, Psalm 51.3-4.
[00:09:54.580 --> 00:10:00.380]   And Paul said, "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:08.220]   So what makes sin, in other words, most serious, this is David's and Paul's way of saying
[00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:12.500]   what makes sin most serious is not that it hurts people.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:15.140]   Oh, it hurts people.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:21.260]   But what makes sin most serious is not that it hurts people, but that it defames and belittles
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.180]   God.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:35.140]   So here's the key question, am I more indignant that a murderer may be saved and go to heaven?
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:43.740]   Am I more indignant about that than I am amazed that I might be saved and go to heaven?
[00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:44.740]   Amen.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:48.460]   Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.460]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:52.380]   Thank you for the question, Stephanie.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:59.580]   For more about this podcast, you can go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.420]   And on Friday, we close the week talking about college and universities.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.660]   What are some priorities for education?
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:10.300]   How does a young Christian choose the best college or university for them, even the best
[00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.660]   major all the way down to choosing particular classes?
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.840]   Pastor John has thought a lot about educational priorities, and he will share his perspective
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.840]   with us on Friday.
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:19.840]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:19.860]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:20.360]   [END]
