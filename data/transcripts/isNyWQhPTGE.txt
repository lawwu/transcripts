[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.840]   - Hello and welcome back to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.760]   Today's episode will be less humorous than the last one
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.040]   and a little different.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.320]   It's just me this time, Tony, your host.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.400]   And this time we'll take a look behind the scenes
[00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.880]   of the podcast and answer some of your
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.780]   frequently asked questions.
[00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.600]   We'll talk about different listening options
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.700]   and how to ask good questions and things like that.
[00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.440]   All the ins and outs of this podcast.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.800]   But I wanna just start with a thank you
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.280]   to everyone who listens.
[00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.920]   In the little over one year time span,
[00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.240]   this podcast has existed.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.920]   The listenership has grown exponentially
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.760]   and it continues to grow every day.
[00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.160]   Of course, there are many ways to listen
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.120]   to the podcast every day and you'll hear more
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.200]   of those options in a moment.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.080]   But just counting those of you who listen
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.320]   through social media, through Twitter and Facebook,
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.700]   and those of you who listen through the Ask Pastor John apps
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.160]   for the iPhone and Android,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.520]   just through those channels alone,
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.520]   we're now approaching the five million play mark
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.920]   in a little over a year.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.860]   Five million episodes played.
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.120]   It's an amazing work of God
[00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.080]   and very encouraging and humbling too.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.360]   To date, we have just over 300 episodes in the archive,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.920]   which translates to over 30 hours of audio
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:08.000]   from Pastor John in his study,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.920]   answering your very good questions.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.600]   And there's no end in sight to this project,
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.900]   either to the topics we can cover
[00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.120]   or to the questions that are coming in from you.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.780]   This podcast reminds me of the promise
[00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.800]   in Proverbs 2, verses six and seven,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.660]   which says that God's store of wisdom
[00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:23.560]   is infinite for his children.
[00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.680]   And that's a sweet promise.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.240]   It's a promise that we bank on in this podcast.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.880]   And in light of the success of Ask Pastor John
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:29.720]   over the past year,
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.520]   someone on Twitter once called Pastor John,
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.040]   quote, "The Yoda of New Calvinism."
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.200]   And while I think that's meant to be funny and flattering,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.460]   it kind of is.
[00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.760]   There's something inherently disturbing about this too,
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.140]   and it's not because Yoda is like 900 years old.
[00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.580]   As I was preparing for this episode,
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.960]   I was reminded of a question
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.520]   I've been wanting to ask Pastor John.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.160]   So I emailed him to ask it.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.000]   Here it is.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.940]   How does he want listeners to think of these podcasts?
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:56.340]   Here's what he wrote back to me, quote,
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.360]   "The way I would like listeners to receive my counsel
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.960]   "in these podcasts is in the spirit
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.860]   "of 1 Thessalonians 5, 21,
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.400]   "test everything, hold fast to what is good.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.920]   "And the test I hope they use is first, the Bible.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.600]   "That's where I try to find all my responses
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.720]   "to people's questions.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.420]   "And secondly, I hope they esteem the spiritual leaders
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.800]   "of their own churches highly
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.700]   "and talk to them about the issues they face,
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.400]   "which is also 1 Thessalonians 5, verse 13.
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.240]   "There is one final authority,
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.460]   "and it's God's word, not mine.
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.280]   "I want to exalt God's word over and over
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.440]   "as true and wise and sweet."
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.280]   End quote.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.640]   So take that to heart when listening to the podcast.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.100]   Listen to all of Pastor John's counsel through that grid,
[00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.340]   which means whether you agree with Pastor John
[00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.240]   or whether you disagree with Pastor John,
[00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.720]   you'll have to engage the text of scripture.
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.660]   That's the inescapable goal of this podcast.
[00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.600]   With that said, on to some details.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.140]   First of all, how can you listen to this podcast?
[00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.280]   Clearly you figured this out,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.200]   but here are the four best listening options.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.160]   First, you can listen through your computer.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.040]   You can go directly to the newly redesigned
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   DesiringGod.org homepage every weekday,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.840]   and you'll find the most recent episode
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.040]   playable from the homepage.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.060]   Just click the play button, you'll see it there.
[00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.840]   This feature will soon be added to the homepage
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:10.600]   of our mobile version of our website as well.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.120]   Second, you can listen to the episodes
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.480]   directly through social media
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.700]   on Facebook and Twitter each day.
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.840]   Each episode is spread through Desiring God's
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.760]   Facebook and Twitter feeds at 7 a.m. and noon
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.640]   each weekday central time,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.720]   and Pastor John follows these with a tweet
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.760]   on the episodes in the evenings.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.840]   Third, you can also subscribe to the podcast feed
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.520]   through iTunes and play it through a chosen podcast app.
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.880]   This requires a little more web skill,
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.600]   but those of you who listen to a lot of podcasts
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:35.480]   will find this helpful,
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.000]   and you probably know what you're doing already.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.880]   Fourth and finally, and maybe most significantly,
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.040]   for those of you on the go,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.680]   we have a specially designed app
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.580]   for the Apple and Android devices,
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.000]   including smartphones, iPhones, iPads, et cetera,
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.820]   and this has proven to be the most convenient option
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.040]   for many of our listeners.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.720]   The Ask Pastor John app is free of charge,
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.520]   and it can be downloaded from the Apple and Android stores
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.360]   right now.
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.640]   Again, it works both on smartphones and tablets,
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.400]   and a host of Apple and Android devices.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.920]   Not only do you get the latest episodes,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.280]   but you also get access to the archive through the app.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.080]   Currently in the Android version,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.640]   you can listen to the last eight or so episodes,
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.560]   and there's a link to the web to find the full archive.
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.920]   The iPhone and iPad app had these same features
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.480]   until recently when the app was completely revamped.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.000]   Using the free Ask Pastor John app
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.640]   on the iPhone and iPad now,
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.060]   listeners can scroll through the entire archive
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.140]   of 300 plus episodes from within the app itself.
[00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.980]   And not only that,
[00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.720]   we've added a search bar at the top of the screen,
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.040]   making it easy for you to search
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.620]   all of the episode titles in a jiffy.
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.480]   This iPhone iPad app is now the best
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.200]   and most convenient way to navigate
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:35.720]   the entire podcast archive,
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.560]   and all this functionality will soon be coming
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.840]   to the Android app as well.
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.240]   So stay tuned for that update in the very near future.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.360]   Well, with all the listeners,
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.920]   it's fun to see what have become your favorite episodes.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.280]   Here are some of the most played episodes in the archive.
[00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.880]   At the very top, it's been at the top for a while now,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.820]   is the John MacArthur and Strange Fire episode,
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.340]   episode number 214,
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.740]   which is followed by the Santa Claus episode,
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.460]   Santa Claus Harmless Fun or Christmas Disruption,
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.160]   episode 235, followed by Is Drinking Alcohol a Sin,
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:07.840]   episode 200, and a very recent episode
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.860]   broke into the top five list in its first week online,
[00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.120]   Pastor of World's Largest Church Convicted of Embezzlement.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.060]   That was episode number 290.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:19.620]   Then two related episodes on cussing, episode 97,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.020]   and the follow-up episode,
[00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.500]   Can Christians Cuss to Prove a Point, episode 260.
[00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:27.280]   These are followed by Tattoos and Biblical Perspective,
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:31.380]   episode 240, and Six Reasons to Skip Tattoos, episode 241,
[00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.900]   back-to-back episodes on tattoos
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.480]   making it in the top 10 list.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.460]   What is the Purpose of Fasting, episode 72, made the list.
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.880]   Would You Attend a Gay Wedding, episode 191.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.260]   Can a White Woman Marry a Black Man, episode number 98,
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:47.680]   which was for a long time the most played episode
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.160]   in the podcast series.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.360]   And then episode number 122,
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.480]   Is My Boyfriend's Porn a Marriage Deal Breaker,
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.300]   followed by episode 273,
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.280]   Is Porn the Unforgivable Sin.
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.560]   As you can see, we have a lot of serious episodes
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.000]   and some fun ones mixed in there too,
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.600]   like yesterday's March Madness episode,
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   which we do have some fun every once in a while,
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.200]   but by far the most popular categories
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:12.600]   are questions related to sex, marriage, and dating.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.160]   Contemporary issues within the church,
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.220]   like the Strange Fire Conference, are popular,
[00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.680]   as are questions on Reformed theology and Calvinism.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:21.040]   Questions about alcohol, cussing, tattoos,
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.960]   and Santa Claus are also very popular too.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.360]   And of course, no topic has been covered more
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.520]   than the topic of joy.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.120]   About a dozen episodes directly on that subject.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.800]   You can type joy in the app search bar
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:31.960]   and you'll see what I mean.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.800]   Striking to me about these popular episodes
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.120]   is how many of them were developed interactively
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.600]   with you, our listeners.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.260]   Your excellent questions help generate
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:41.080]   many of these most popular episodes.
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.040]   As many of you know, in the Ask Pastor John app,
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:45.180]   you can send us email questions with the touch of a button,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:46.920]   or of course you can send us an email
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.760]   to askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:52.280]   We receive over 400 emails per week
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   and they pile up very fast in the inbox,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.520]   but we do read them all,
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.200]   and all of them are very valuable to us,
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:58.620]   but there's simply no possible way
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.320]   that we can respond to any of those emails personally,
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:02.840]   so I apologize for that.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.760]   But this leads me finally to spend a moment
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.320]   talking about something essential to our success,
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.520]   and that's helping you ask us really great questions.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:12.780]   So let me close with three tips
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:15.960]   for asking good Ask Pastor John questions.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:18.920]   Tip number one, check the archive first.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.680]   About one third of the questions coming in now
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.040]   have already been addressed in previous episodes
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.920]   of the podcast, so start there.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.260]   Tip number two, send follow-up questions.
[00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.520]   If you hear an episode and it raises another question
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.740]   in your mind, send us an email with the episode number
[00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.220]   and with your follow-up question.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:34.680]   The episodes in this podcast series
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.760]   are in many ways interconnected to one another,
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.580]   and follow-up questions help us to fill out this web,
[00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:42.440]   so follow-up questions are greatly appreciated.
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.140]   Tip number three, keep it precise and brief.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.600]   If your question requires paragraphs of background detail,
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:50.160]   it's probably a situation too detailed and delicate
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.840]   for us to tackle on the podcast.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.880]   We're really looking for specific questions
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:55.560]   that appeal to many listeners,
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:56.840]   and this is a big challenge for us.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:58.760]   So maybe the best tip I can offer you
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.060]   is to encourage you to simplify your question
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.560]   into one or two sentences.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.840]   Think about your question for a while,
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.680]   give it time to soak and time to sharpen.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:10.520]   But please, keep the questions coming into us.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:13.200]   So as I wrap up this solo episode, let me say again,
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:15.380]   thank you for listening to this podcast.
[00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.060]   We are humbled that so many of you make time every day
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:18.900]   to listen in.
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:20.520]   You listen in the car on your way to work,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.940]   or while cleaning the house, or while crafting,
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:25.240]   or walking, or jogging, or biking.
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.100]   I know there's even one listener who plays the episodes
[00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:30.140]   every morning during their morning shower before work.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.740]   And while it's a little awkward to be told that in person,
[00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.060]   it's also an encouragement,
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:36.300]   and we're certainly not afraid of awkward here.
[00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:37.580]   So thank you for listening.
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.900]   And so many of you listen with an ear
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.200]   to serve others in your life,
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:42.240]   and we appreciate your labors in helping spread
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.260]   the Ask Pastor John app and specific episodes
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.780]   to people in your families and churches
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:47.660]   to bless and care for them in their time of need.
[00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.820]   So thank you for this valuable partnership
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:50.980]   of content sharing.
[00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.060]   Please continue to help us to spread God's word
[00:08:54.060 --> 00:08:56.060]   to those who need it.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:57.460]   And of course, for those of you
[00:08:57.460 --> 00:08:59.140]   who financially support Desiring God,
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.940]   your funding and prayers are crucial to this podcast.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.020]   This podcast and the free Ask Pastor John apps
[00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:05.420]   would not exist without you.
[00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.280]   So thank you for your sacrifices and support.
[00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.220]   We are deeply grateful to God for you and for your giving.
[00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.820]   - Well, goodness, that's enough of me.
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:15.140]   We'll be back tomorrow with a new episode
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.140]   featuring Pastor John
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.340]   and addressing these back from heaven stories.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:19.940]   Books like "Heaven is for Real,"
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.300]   a little boy's astounding story
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.660]   of his trip to heaven and back.
[00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:25.740]   What are we to make of this story and others like it?
[00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.540]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:28.700]   We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.280]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:43.860]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
