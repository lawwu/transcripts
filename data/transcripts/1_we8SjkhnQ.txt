[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   I should like to call your attention this evening to the words that are to be found
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.440]   in the book of the Acts of the Apostles in chapter 4, reading again verses 25 and 26,
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.920]   and also the second Psalm.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.840]   Now I want to consider that quotation there from the second Psalm, in the light of the
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.120]   message of the entire Psalm.
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.680]   You remember the picture of the scene.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.920]   Here we are looking at the early Christian people meeting together after Peter and John
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.360]   had been dismissed by the great council at Jerusalem and prohibited to preach or to teach
[00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.200]   any further in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.520]   They went back immediately to their own company and they reported to them what had been said
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.720]   to them by the court.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.200]   And we are told that the moment they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.360]   one accord.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.680]   In other words, they began to pray.
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.520]   Now last Sunday night we began the consideration of this and we are continuing with it this
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.520]   evening.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:20.640]   But we are meeting together on a day that has come to be marked and noted as a special
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.600]   day by the men and women of this country.
[00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.160]   It is what we call Remembrance Day.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.000]   And we therefore must consider our message in the light of that.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.440]   Here we are a company of people, we've turned aside out of the world for the time being
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.800]   into this building.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.640]   But we've come out of a world of confusion, out of a world of trouble, a world of pain,
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.320]   a world of unhappiness.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.400]   And the great question that should be in the minds of everybody, particularly on a day
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.040]   like this, is what is the matter?
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.320]   Why are things as they are?
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.080]   Why is there such a thing as war?
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.560]   Why indeed is there such a thing as death?
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.840]   Why is there disease?
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.040]   Why is there sorrow?
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.000]   Why is there trouble?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.120]   Why is there unhappiness?
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.320]   Why is there pain?
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.960]   Now those are the great questions that surely a day like this must bring to the minds of
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.200]   all intelligent people.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.640]   We don't just observe this sentimentally.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.240]   We've already, many of us, passed through two world wars in this century.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:44.760]   And it's about time we all began to ask in depth and with a new seriousness, what is
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.560]   the matter with our world that such things have happened and such things can happen?
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.920]   Now that's the great question.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.800]   And I want to try to show you this evening that it is the Bible alone that rarely can
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.160]   give us a satisfactory answer.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.840]   I'm not going to take up any time in proving that.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.600]   But I think that those of you who do read your Sunday newspapers and your weekly papers
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:16.440]   will know from them that it is quite clear and certain that nobody else can give us an
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   answer.
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.120]   That's abundantly prudent.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.040]   But I'm here to make a positive statement that the Bible has the answer.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.800]   And it has the only answer.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   What is its answer?
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.000]   Well, its answer, as we are reminded by this psalm that we are studying, is this.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.880]   The first thing it tells us is that there's nothing new about all this.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.840]   This is nothing peculiar to the 20th century.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.080]   You know, that's the first thing that our fellow men and women need to be told at this
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.460]   present time.
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:57.960]   They start with this fatal assumption that we are a peculiar people because we are living
[00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.440]   in the 20th century.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.440]   We've got drunk on our own knowledge and especially science.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.600]   And therefore we think that all our problems are new problems.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Nobody's ever had them before.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.760]   Now, the Bible, being such an old book, tells us immediately that that is altogether wrong.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.880]   But there's nothing new about this situation.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.800]   It's just a manifestation of what has been going on in the world for a very, very long
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.800]   time.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.520]   Nothing peculiar to us about all this.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:40.040]   Wars and death and people being maimed and jealousy and rivalry.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.120]   It's here in the Bible from the very beginning.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.560]   It's the story of the human race.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.720]   It's always been like this, I say.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.360]   And therefore, the Bible asks us to listen to what it's got to say.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.760]   You see, here's an old book, the oldest book in the world.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.600]   And I invite you to listen tonight to what it's got to tell us about our immediate position
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.240]   and situation in this world tonight.
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.640]   And I'm going to do so in terms of the message of this second song.
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:16.360]   This is only one of many, many statements of the same thing that have been found running
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.980]   through the Bible in the Old Testament and in the New.
[00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:26.000]   But as this is quoted by those early Christians in their prayer in that room at Jerusalem
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.760]   long ago, and we are studying that, well, we are taking it in this particular form.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.520]   It's a very fascinating psalm, this, from every standpoint.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.320]   It's the easiest psalm in many ways of all the psalms to divide up.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.280]   It's a psalm of twelve verses, but you can divide it into four groups of three.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:50.160]   In the first three verses, the psalmist states the position.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.400]   In the next three verses, four, five, and six, he, as it were, tells us God's reaction
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.800]   to all this.
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.600]   In verses seven, eight, and nine, as I'm going to try to show you, we have the Lord Jesus
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.280]   Christ speaking, the Son of God.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:13.160]   And then in the last three verses, ten, eleven, and twelve, the psalmist sums it all up and
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:19.240]   makes an appeal to men and women to listen to the message.
[00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:25.600]   Now, it has been generally agreed throughout the centuries that this is a psalm that ultimately
[00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   points to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:36.040]   David is undoubtedly the author, but he's not writing about himself, only in a sense.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:40.920]   He was a kind of suggestion of what was going to be true of the great deliverer, the great
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.080]   king, when he came.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.960]   So it has a kind of local application, but it is agreed generally that this is a psalm
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.680]   that is prophetic of the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.360]   You notice the terms that are used.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:58.520]   He's called the Anointed.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.600]   He is called the Son of God.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:04.440]   "Thou art my Son this day, have I begotten thee."
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:11.360]   He is called God's King, whom he sets upon his holy hill of Zion.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:17.920]   Now, the Jews themselves, before the coming of Christ, had always regarded it as a messianic
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:21.800]   psalm, a psalm pointing to the coming of the great deliverer.
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:26.280]   But you notice there in that account which we have of the prayer of the early church
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.480]   in the fourth chapter of Acts, these men, filled with the Holy Ghost, have no doubt
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.640]   nor hesitation whatsoever in applying the psalm to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.640]   In other words, what they're saying is this, and this is our message this evening.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:50.520]   What is described in this psalm has been the attitude of mankind to God throughout the
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.920]   running centuries.
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:08:01.760]   But it all came to a climax, a focus, in what the world did with Jesus of Nazareth, the
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.760]   Son of God.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:07.840]   That's what these men, you see, go on to say in their prayer as it is recorded there
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:13.440]   for us in that 26th and 27th verses.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.040]   They go on and they say, "For of a truth against thy holy child Jesus, whom thou hast
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:24.160]   anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel, were
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   gathered together."
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:32.560]   And they gather together to condemn him, to say away with him, and to crucify him, and
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   to kill him.
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:40.120]   So, you see, what we are being taught is that the world has been in this attitude towards
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.880]   God for so long, but that if you really want to see it, you must look at what happened
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:54.880]   when God sent his own Son into the world, and what the world did with him.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.040]   Very well then, here I say is the message of the Bible for us this evening.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.120]   We are dealing, remember, with the state of the world.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.600]   Why is it as it is?
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:10.640]   Well, now that's the very first word in the psalm, "Why?"
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:18.720]   Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:19.720]   Why?
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.560]   She's our question.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.200]   The psalmist puts the question.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.360]   It's an interesting word that he uses.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.040]   It's not only a question, but it's further an expression of horror and of astonishment.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:39.800]   The psalmist was a man of God, and he could see the behavior of the heathen and of the
[00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:40.800]   people.
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:46.040]   Remember, people here means the people of Israel, the children of Israel, the Jews.
[00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.800]   The Bible divides up mankind into the heathen and the people, and the people always are
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.360]   representative of the children of Israel, God's chosen people.
[00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:59.720]   So the psalmist, looking out upon his world, as you and I look out upon a similar world
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.200]   tonight, he asks his question, "Why?"
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.880]   Why are things as they are?
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.480]   Now I say again, let me put it to you in its modern terms.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:15.680]   Why is there such a thing as Remembrance Sunday?
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.560]   Why these two terrible wars, and all the wars that have gone before them?
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.400]   And why is the world piling up its armaments still?
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.400]   What's the matter?
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.400]   Why?
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:28.400]   Here's the question.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.360]   Well, now then, let's listen to the answer.
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:35.880]   I've divided it up for you into four headings.
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:41.320]   My friends, we are doing the most important thing a human being can do tonight.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:46.800]   You will get no light anywhere in the world tonight on your present situation except this,
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.880]   none at all.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:50.920]   That doesn't mean to say we don't need statesmen.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.920]   We do.
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:53.920]   We need governors and statesmen.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.720]   We need order.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.520]   Governors even grant that they're doing their best, but obviously they're in trouble.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:08.840]   And they're in trouble because they're viewing it solely upon this horizontal human level.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:12.920]   And they're not viewing it in the depth that the Bible exhorts us to do.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.920]   Very well, then, listen to the message.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:20.320]   Let's start first of all by looking at its description of the state of the world.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:21.400]   It was true then.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.560]   I want to show you how true it is now.
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:25.560]   What's the state of the world?
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.560]   Here it is.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:27.560]   It is raging.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:32.680]   Why do the people rage?
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.680]   What's it mean?
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.080]   Well, the word rage means make a tumult.
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:43.120]   It's like the sea, the roaring and the raging of the sea.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:49.480]   Now the Bible is very fond of describing life apart from God in those terms.
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:55.020]   The prophet Isaiah in a great statement which he repeats, puts it like this, "The wicked
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:12:03.680]   are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.880]   That's the description of the human race, of mankind apart from God.
[00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.120]   It's like the restless, the troubled sea when it cannot rest.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.400]   Have you seen it?
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:21.120]   Going backwards and forwards, rising, coming up and churning up mud and mire and dirt and
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.400]   refuse.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.680]   The troubled sea when it cannot rest.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:32.760]   Can you imagine a more perfect description of the world tonight than just that?
[00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:37.040]   If there is one thing that's more true of our world than anything else, it is just this
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:45.600]   restlessness, this trouble, this perplexity, this being carried backwards and forwards,
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:51.160]   victims of the latest news bulletin or the latest edition of a newspaper, never knowing
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:56.840]   what's going to happen, victims of circumstance and chance being tossed about hither and thither.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.480]   Isn't that the great trouble in life tonight?
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:03.040]   Men and women have lost all sense of direction.
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:06.440]   They're asking is there anything in life, is it worth living?
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:09.800]   Many would be glad to be dead, many are committing suicide.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:14.440]   I'm not exaggerating, this is the world, the papers are telling you all about it.
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:20.080]   You see, it's like the sea, the troubled sea, when it cannot rest.
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.640]   And it's in a condition of storm.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:26.920]   There's a raging, the nations are raging.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.760]   Can't you hear the sound, the rumbling?
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:32.760]   Look at Africa, the great continent this evening.
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.360]   Can't you see the waves beginning to move?
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:37.080]   The raging that is commencing.
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.040]   Go to your Far East, look anywhere you like, and you'll see this tension.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.200]   Oh, it takes many forms.
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:51.760]   The color problem and many other problems, there is all this thriving, this restlessness,
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   this confusion.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   It's a raging.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:57.280]   The Bible, you see, knows all about it.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:00.600]   And that's why it gives its accurate description of it.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   But look at the raging as it manifests itself in terms of living and of the evil of living.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:17.000]   Sin is always sin, but sometimes it's fairly quiet and pleasant.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.480]   You sometimes look at the sea and you don't see any waves.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:23.440]   We say it looks like silk, it looks like velvet.
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:30.800]   Especially any movement, a glorious summer's afternoon, how smooth and calm and quiet the
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   sea is.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.040]   And yet you see the depths are there and the movement is always there.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:41.760]   But sometimes it becomes manifest and the waves begin to gather and they become billows
[00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.600]   and they roll and they rage and there's confusion.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:50.040]   There's a storm, there's a crashing.
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:53.880]   And you and I are living in an age like that.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:01.920]   Men have always sinned, but they haven't always raged in their sin, but they're raging tonight.
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   There are no limits.
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.560]   It's a riot.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:06.560]   It's an abandon.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:11.800]   Things that were once regarded as sin are now not only justified, they're gloried in.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:16.920]   And men and women have lost all sense of decency and of control.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:23.000]   Listen to them on the television or on the radio and you'll hear it, shame is gone.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.520]   Sin is raging, drinking, drugging, sex.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:32.400]   The violence, the movement, the riot, the excess that's in it all.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:34.960]   Is our world raging tonight?
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:35.960]   Well here it is.
[00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:40.440]   You see, why do the heathen rage?
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.560]   And take this further bit of description.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:49.520]   Why do the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:54.360]   Oh, what a perfect summary of the 20th century.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.080]   A better translation, if you like, is this.
[00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:04.200]   Why do the heathen rage and the people devise futile and empty schemes?
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.600]   That's not my translation, but it's a very good one.
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:17.440]   Why do the people devise futile, empty schemes, hopeless and impossible things?
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.960]   But that's what they're doing.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.720]   And you see, the psalmist has chosen a word that expresses it so perfectly.
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:28.280]   It's empty, it's vain.
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:29.280]   Why?
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:35.640]   Well, anything apart from God is ultimately empty and vain, for God is, God is being,
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:37.760]   God is the author of being and of life.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.840]   And if you're not in connection with God, well you really have got nothing.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:45.320]   It may appear for a while, but it's nothing.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:52.680]   Not only that, anything done apart from God always ends in nothing.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:57.200]   And you see, men who have not been Christian at all, but who have been profound thinkers,
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.760]   have seen that.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.960]   Life, what is it?
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:03.920]   Shakespeare puts it into the mouth of one of his characters.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:08.160]   Full of sound and fury signifying nothing.
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   Nothing.
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:15.880]   And isn't that the simple truth about life in this world apart from God this evening?
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:21.440]   All the excitement and all the sophistication and all that the world bursts and writes so
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.840]   much about, what does it come to?
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:26.440]   What does it lead to?
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:32.360]   Full of sound and fury signifying nothing.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.520]   But you see, the world is very confident about all this.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.960]   The world is quite sure that it can produce a scheme.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:48.560]   They imagine a vain, a futile, an empty program and they put it before us.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:54.160]   The world is convinced, as it was in David's time and at the time of our Lord in this world,
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:59.360]   the world is quite convinced that it can make a perfect world, that it can give us all peace
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.400]   and plenty and happiness and enjoyment.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:07.000]   While we're out in, the world is quite sure that it's got it in it to make things just
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.240]   as it wants it to be.
[00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.160]   Now that is, you see, nothing but the story of civilization.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:15.240]   That's the name given to it.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:16.520]   Civilization.
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:17.520]   What is civilization?
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:24.000]   Well, civilization is the story of the great schemes of man.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Man's proposal.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   What does he propose?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:34.640]   Well, way back in the time of the Greek philosophers, he began to use the term utopia, the ideal
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.640]   state.
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:37.280]   They were talking about it then.
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:39.800]   You see, there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:44.960]   All this idea that, as I say, our problems are new and our ideas are new, it's really
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:48.240]   laughable, it's the only word to use.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.360]   Utopia.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.200]   They imagined a utopia and they worked it out.
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:58.360]   How you would divide up your people, how you would apportion various tasks to them, how
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:02.960]   you would govern them, how you would teach them, how to comport and conduct themselves
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:03.960]   and so on.
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:04.960]   Utopia.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.960]   It was going to solve the problem.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:10.400]   Now this is the story of civilization.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:14.160]   This is what the politicians have been doing throughout the centuries.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.720]   This is what your philosophers have been doing.
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:19.600]   This is what your believers in education have been doing.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   This is what your science is claiming to be able to do at this present time.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:29.920]   These men have abandoned God and they are quite convinced that they can order a perfect
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.920]   society.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.640]   They call themselves classical humanists, scientific humanists, but they're all humanists.
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.000]   God is not in it.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.920]   And they imagine their grandiose schemes.
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.040]   They're going to give us a life that is worth living.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:47.840]   They're going to solve the problem.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.800]   Some of us are old enough to remember the speeches that were delivered during the First
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:52.800]   World War.
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:57.080]   "Land fit for heroes to live in.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:00.080]   The war to end war.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:01.600]   The League of Nations."
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.680]   This brilliant idea.
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.440]   We were going to outlaw war.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.600]   Never any more trouble.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.120]   We were quite certain of it.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:11.120]   We imagined that we'd got the scheme at last.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.080]   We were going to renounce war.
[00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:14.080]   Never again.
[00:20:14.080 --> 00:20:18.200]   And the Locarno Pacts and all the rest of them.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:23.680]   There are some advantages in being old, my friends.
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.000]   We've heard all that we've been told so often before, you see.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.040]   This isn't to be cynical.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:30.400]   This is to be realistic.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.840]   These are the schemes of men.
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:37.000]   And now the United Nations.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:38.640]   Look at the energy that they put into this.
[00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:41.440]   Look at the enthusiasm.
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.760]   The people imagine schemes and proposals.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:45.760]   Utopia.
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:49.720]   Blueprints of utopia.
[00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:54.600]   But the description given of them all in the Bible is that they're vain things.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:56.200]   They're empty.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.320]   They never materialize.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.800]   They come to nothing.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:07.680]   Isn't it about time we became realists and really began to face these things?
[00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.840]   Are you content just to have these grandiose proposals put before you?
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.840]   They lead to nothing.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   They're empty.
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:14.840]   They're vain.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:15.840]   They're imaginations.
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   They're imaginings.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:20.840]   There's the state of the world.
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:24.160]   But now come to something much more serious.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:29.880]   There are many men who are not Christians who'd accept all that.
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:35.960]   Some of your greatest natural philosophers are utterly hopeless about the future.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.520]   They say so.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.320]   They can see that men is a fool.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.600]   They hold out no hope at all.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:43.600]   You read their works.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:45.640]   They've got great names.
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:50.400]   Read your Bertrand Russells and your Julian Huxleys and you'll find that they're utterly
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:51.400]   hopeless.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.400]   They must be.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:57.760]   They're just observers of facts and they can see that.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.720]   But you see, this is where the Bible comes in with something that such men know nothing
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   about.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:08.840]   The Bible not only describes the condition, it gives us the explanation of it.
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:13.200]   It opens our understandings to the causes of this condition.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:17.840]   Why do the people, the heathen rage and the people imagine vain things?
[00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:20.680]   And there's only one answer.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.960]   It is men's rebellion against God.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:26.500]   That's what it's all due to.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.080]   It is the only answer.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.360]   It is the adequate answer.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.680]   It is the sufficient answer.
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.720]   There is only one explanation of why this is remembrance Sunday, why such a thing ever
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:41.760]   comes into being, why there ever are wars and troubles and trials.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:43.480]   There's only one answer.
[00:22:43.480 --> 00:22:48.280]   It is men's rebellion against God.
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:50.040]   Listen.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.760]   The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together against the
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:23:00.800]   Lord and against his anointed saying, "Let us break their bends asunder and cast away
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:03.360]   their cords from us."
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:04.960]   Let me interpret that to you.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.160]   Here is the full and the complete explanation.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.120]   Notice to start with that all are involved in this.
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:20.640]   The kings of the earth and the rulers, they're involved in this.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:27.160]   The judges of the earth and also the masses of the common people.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.520]   The people listen to their teachers.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.640]   They're all involved in this.
[00:23:31.640 --> 00:23:35.720]   You see, there is no section of society that isn't involved, but it is particularly true
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.560]   of the leaders, the great men of the earth.
[00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:43.600]   In every realm, they stand up against God and they ignore him and they defy him.
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:48.800]   It's true, I say, of the philosophers and the politicians as well as the ordinary men
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.800]   and women.
[00:23:49.800 --> 00:23:53.560]   Tom, Dick and Harry at the street corner are saying exactly the same thing as your great
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:23:54.560]   philosophers.
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:55.560]   Nothing in religion.
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:23:58.660]   Tommy Rock played out this idea of God.
[00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.720]   We are going to make humanism is the solution.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:09.840]   Kings, philosophers, princes, common people, all are involved in this rebellion against
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:10.840]   God.
[00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:15.920]   The whole world lieth guilty before God.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:18.200]   There is none righteous, no, not one.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.000]   But notice the next thing.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:26.080]   Not only are all involved in it, but notice the deliberation with which they do it.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   The kings of the earth set themselves and the rulers take counsel together.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:41.640]   Now, this is the most terrible part of this whole subject.
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:44.040]   It isn't as if it were something unconscious.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:46.760]   It is very deliberate.
[00:24:46.760 --> 00:24:50.080]   Mankind has deliberately rebelled against God.
[00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:54.240]   They have set themselves and they're still setting themselves.
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:56.000]   They meet in their societies.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.840]   They have humanistic societies and associations.
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:24:59.840]   They gather together.
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:00.840]   They take counsel together.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.800]   They write their books together and praise one another.
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:07.960]   There is an organization of evil against God in this world.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:12.760]   They do it quite deliberately.
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:19.680]   Against the Lord and against his anointed, against God and against his plans and his
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.680]   purposes.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:24.600]   This is, I say, the most appalling aspect of the whole thing.
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:28.680]   The trouble with the human race is not that it's just slack or indolent.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:36.520]   It has deliberately and of set purpose, malice aforethought, decided, determined, and organized
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:39.480]   itself in opposition to God.
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:45.400]   And if you can't see that in the world tonight, you must be very blind, my friend.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:51.880]   If you can't see the powers that are organizing evil behind your newspapers, your television,
[00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:56.720]   and all the modern evil that leads to the muddle, you are very blind, I say.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.720]   It is deliberate organization.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:01.000]   Anti-God.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:05.840]   But let's go on.
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.680]   Why do they do this?
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   Here's the extraordinary thing.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:16.080]   Why does mankind organize itself deliberately against God?
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.680]   Why do they say, "We don't want God.
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.960]   We don't believe in God.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.160]   God's a figment."
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:25.880]   Why is this done with such assiduity, with such deliberation, with such organization,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.000]   with such zest and enthusiasm?
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.720]   Why do men glory in this?
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:34.680]   Well, here's the amazing answer.
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.640]   They do it because of the enmity that is in their hearts against God.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.640]   Listen to what they say.
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:41.640]   They betray themselves.
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:49.320]   They say, "Let us break their bans asunder and cast away their cords from us."
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   What does this mean?
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:56.720]   Well, you see, what it means is this, that they're animated by this enmity against God
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:59.440]   and his holy laws.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.600]   The apostle Paul has summed that up in a great statement in the eighth chapter of his epistle
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:11.640]   to the Romans and in verse seven when he says, "The natural mind is enmity against God, is
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:16.360]   not subject to the law of God, neither can be."
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:18.560]   Enmity against God.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.440]   You notice what they feel about God and about his holy laws.
[00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:28.040]   They regard these things as bans, as restraints.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.560]   They regard them as cords, as shackles.
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:37.600]   You see, God made men and he made the world, and he gave men certain laws and certain rules
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.640]   by which to live.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:44.040]   God has given them for our benefit and for our help.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.240]   We need instruction.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:50.220]   We all need instruction, and God, in his love and in his kindness and compassion, has given
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.560]   us instruction.
[00:27:51.560 --> 00:27:54.240]   He's given us the Ten Commandments.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.440]   He's given us the Sermon on the Mount.
[00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.840]   He's given us the teaching of the great prophets.
[00:27:58.840 --> 00:28:02.800]   He's given us the teaching of his own blessed and dear Son.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:06.760]   And all this teaching is meant for our good.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:13.400]   The laws of God are meant to show us how to live a righteous life and a holy life and
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.040]   a peaceful life.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.760]   Again to quote the apostle Paul, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteousness
[00:28:20.760 --> 00:28:27.040]   and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost."
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:33.000]   God didn't make his laws simply to keep us down and to fetter us and to entrain us.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.760]   God made his laws in order to help us, for our benefit, to teach us how to live and how
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:44.800]   to have a full life and an enjoyable life and a life of bliss and of happiness.
[00:28:44.800 --> 00:28:50.600]   That's why God has ever given us his laws and his great commandments.
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:56.240]   But mankind, instead of thanking God for that, regards this as something intolerable.
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.200]   He refers to all this as bands, as fetters, as chains.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.960]   They say, "He's making slaves of us and he's binding us with cords.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:11.240]   We've got it in us to be great, but here's God clamping us down, clamping down upon us
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.360]   and making us slaves and servants."
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.920]   That's the attitude of mankind.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:19.640]   That's why your world is as it is tonight.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.720]   Oh, I've often said it from this pulpit.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:26.360]   Let me say it again on this remembrance Sunday night.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:32.640]   If only every man and woman in this world and every nation in this world tonight were
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.320]   living according to the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount, this world would
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   be paradise.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:42.520]   There'd be no trouble in the United Nations.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.200]   You wouldn't need them.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:49.600]   If only everybody lived according to God's laws, according to God's ways, according
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:56.960]   to God's view of life, these problems would disappear, nationally, internationally, personally,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.040]   individually, socially, and in every other respect.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.600]   The world would become the paradise that it was when God originally made it.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:10.320]   There are laws in paradise and paradise is paradise because it observed the laws.
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:15.360]   The moment you break laws, you get chaos, confusion, strife.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.760]   The world becomes like a raging sea when it cannot rest.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.920]   But that's it, you see.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:28.960]   Men in his utter folly and blindness regard the goodness of God as some incubus, as some
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:35.600]   kind of fettering and enchaining and slavery, and he rebels against it and notice his self-confidence.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:41.280]   Here's the second part of the explanation.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.680]   Let us, they say, let us break their bends asunder.
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:50.400]   Let us cast away their cords from us.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.740]   You watch that expression, "Let us," in the Bible.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:58.240]   You go back and read the eleventh chapter of the book of Genesis and you'll find men
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:04.120]   again rebelling against God saying, "Let us build a tower up to heaven.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   Let us."
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:07.400]   You see the confidence?
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:14.080]   This is the thing that damns the human race, this fatal self-confidence.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:16.160]   You remember what they did at the time of Moses.
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:21.480]   Moses was up in the mountain with God and he stayed there a long time and they said,
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:22.680]   "What's happened to this Moses?
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:24.240]   We don't know.
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:27.240]   Let us make another God.
[00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.040]   Let us make a golden calf and worship him."
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:34.360]   And they did and that's what the world's still doing.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.360]   Let us.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.560]   Oh, the confidence of men.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:45.240]   They look at God and his holy laws and they say, "Let us break them.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.240]   Let's smash them.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.080]   Let's do away with them.
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.560]   Let's emancipate ourselves.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.560]   Let's be free.
[00:31:50.560 --> 00:31:57.520]   Let us rise up and get rid of this tyranny that God has imposed upon us."
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:00.560]   They think they can do it.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:07.600]   They think they can succeed in making a world such as they would have and enjoying themselves
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.640]   without any trouble or any interference.
[00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.920]   Man believes that he can liberate himself from God and from God's holy laws.
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:19.340]   That's the explanation of the trouble.
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:23.600]   But let me take you on to the next step.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.240]   Having considered the cause of this condition, let us now look at the folly of this condition,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.760]   the folly.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:37.240]   Oh, this is the tragedy of the human race.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:42.400]   He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:45.960]   The Lord shall have them in derision.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:50.920]   Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:58.320]   "Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion."
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   What does all that mean?
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:07.760]   Oh, this is the response of God to this folly of mankind, to this raging, to this imagining
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:14.280]   of vain things, to this fatal self-confidence that believes it can defy God and smash his
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:16.280]   rules and his laws.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   This is God's response to it all.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.480]   What's the trouble with mankind this evening?
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:27.480]   Oh, there's only one answer.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:33.720]   It is man's fatal ignorance of God.
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:36.840]   That's the theme of the whole Bible.
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:42.600]   Our blessed Lord at the end of his life uttered this in his great high priestly prayer, "O
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:51.200]   God's Father, the world hath not known thee, but I have known thee."
[00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:53.600]   That's always the trouble with the world.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:55.960]   It doesn't know God.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:34:00.800]   The psalmists have got a very graphic and dramatic way of putting that at times.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:02.600]   One of them puts it like this.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:08.040]   He says that God looked upon the men and said, "Thou thoughtest that I was just such another
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:09.040]   as thyself."
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.320]   That's what we all tend to do.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:16.960]   We measure God by ourselves and our own measure.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.000]   We sit in judgment upon God.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   We are so great.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:22.800]   Of course, we are the twentieth century people, are we not?
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:25.280]   We've got this great knowledge of science.
[00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.360]   God is the subject for analysis upon our laboratory table.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.080]   We break men.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:39.720]   So we stand up to God and we think that we can defy him and without him we can make our
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   perfect world.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:44.360]   But my dear friends, listen to the answer.
[00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:53.120]   He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh.
[00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:57.200]   The Lord shall have them in derision.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:35:04.120]   It's a terrifying thought that the great God is looking down upon our world this evening,
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:11.080]   our clever world, the world that thought that Charles Darwin's one book, The Origin of Species,
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:13.320]   was going to get rid of God.
[00:35:13.320 --> 00:35:16.800]   You know there's only one thing to do with people who can believe a thing like that?
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:18.800]   It is to laugh them out of God.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:21.160]   It is to ridicule them out of the universe.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:24.760]   And God is doing that.
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.760]   He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:32.720]   The Lord shall have them in derision.
[00:35:32.720 --> 00:35:33.720]   Why?
[00:35:33.720 --> 00:35:37.080]   Well, because of who he is and what he is.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.840]   He sits in the heavens.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:44.880]   People get up and say, "Let us break his bends in thunder and cast away his corpse from us."
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:51.360]   And they're saying that about the one who sits in the heavens.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:57.240]   We've got so excited recently, haven't we, about these men we can send up into orbit?
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.240]   Heavens?
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:00.640]   They haven't smelt it.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.600]   They haven't come anywhere near to seeing it.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:06.120]   We're only children playing with toys.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.360]   God sits upon the heavens.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:12.920]   He suspends the north on nothing.
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.280]   He dwells in eternity.
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:22.240]   He is the creator and the ruler of this universe.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.240]   He is not only its maker, I say, he is its ruler.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   He's made it.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   He owns it.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:28.240]   He's controlling it.
[00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:36.120]   Whether we like it or not, that's where he sits, on the throne of glory over the whole
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.000]   universe, seeing the end from the beginning.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:45.360]   Not only that, let us never forget that he is the judge.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:53.320]   When shall he speak to them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure?
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:57.640]   My dear friends, we are living in a moral universe.
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:02.760]   I know the immoral and the amoral today don't believe that, but we are.
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:05.600]   You see, there are laws that you cannot tamper with.
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.640]   You put your finger in the fire, it will be burned.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:12.600]   You wish you could change that, don't you, but you can't.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.160]   When you try and play fast and loose with God's laws, you'll soon find that they work
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   inexorably.
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:25.360]   The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceeding slow.
[00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:29.720]   And God is the judge, and his laws are standing and are abiding.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.960]   He has said, "There is no peace," saith my God to the wicked.
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:37.200]   That's why you've had your two world wars.
[00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.520]   That's why this is Remembrance Day.
[00:37:39.520 --> 00:37:41.280]   That's why the world is in trouble.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:46.640]   You do what you like, you stand up against God, you write your blueprints of your utopias,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.640]   you'll never get it.
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.640]   You'll be in trouble, you'll be in misery.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.320]   It'll be war and rumor and war.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.320]   Why?
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:38:00.480]   Because you're defying God, who owns the universe and who's the judge of the ends of the earth.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.960]   He said it and he's done it.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:11.360]   His wrath, his indignation, his fury.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:17.280]   Oh, how can anybody who's ever read the Bible or even read human history, secular history,
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.880]   doubt this for a moment?
[00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:24.000]   But listen, beyond all this, this is where we see the folly of this attitude of mankind.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.080]   They're standing up and trying to defy God's plan and purpose for this universe against
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:33.440]   the Lord and his anointed.
[00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:39.400]   This is the amazing thing, that men don't realize that God has got a plan, he's got
[00:38:39.400 --> 00:38:41.440]   a great purpose.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:46.480]   He began to reveal it away back at the beginning of the origin of the human race.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:49.240]   Even when men fell, he began to reveal it.
[00:38:49.240 --> 00:38:54.200]   Men brought down sin and chaos upon himself and judgment, but God said, "It's all right,
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:55.400]   I've got a plan.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.840]   The seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head.
[00:38:57.840 --> 00:39:00.800]   There's the beginning, the outline, and on and on it goes."
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:01.920]   He carries it on.
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.200]   You'll find it running through the whole of the Old Testament.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.600]   God's increasing, certain, sure plan.
[00:39:08.600 --> 00:39:11.000]   Read the story of the children of Israel.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.000]   God made them.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.720]   They get into trouble and their enemies conquer over them.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.480]   God delivers them and the enemies are discomfited.
[00:39:17.480 --> 00:39:18.480]   Back again it happens.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:19.920]   Back they're delivered again.
[00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:23.800]   It's the whole story of the Old Testament.
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:34.640]   But as those early Christians realized so clearly in that upper room in Jerusalem, it
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:40.760]   is in the life and death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ that this is demonstrated
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:42.440]   most clearly.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:50.200]   There you see the kings and the rulers set themselves into council together.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.160]   You're heralds, you're Pontius Pilate.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.040]   You see the king, Herod, Pontius Pilate, the ruler, they come together.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:02.600]   And the peoples, and the heathen, and the Jews, they're all in it and they're all
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.880]   together against this Christ.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:06.760]   They say, "Away with him, crucify him."
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:10.640]   Herod and Pilate became friends together who were formerly at enmity.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:15.240]   And here they are, they all together conspire and they say, "Get rid of him, away with
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:16.240]   him."
[00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.440]   And they did and they began to shout and to acclaim and they began to laugh in triumph
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:29.600]   and then God laughed and laughed them to nothing in the fact of the resurrection.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:39.080]   He revealed their unutterable folly by raising his son again from the dead and manifesting
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:44.920]   him into chosen witnesses and then taking him back to himself in the glory.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.720]   You see this is a part of God's plan.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:53.280]   And let men and let the devil and let hell all come out together with their last reserves
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   against him.
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.520]   He'll triumph and conquer over them all.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:40:59.640]   He did it in the resurrection.
[00:40:59.640 --> 00:41:05.040]   There he puts them to an open shame, triumphing over them in the very thing which they had
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.080]   done to him.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:14.360]   And you see this is only a prophecy in a sense of what is yet to happen.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:19.800]   Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:20.800]   vessel.
[00:41:20.800 --> 00:41:23.200]   That's what the Father has said to the Son.
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:27.160]   He is not only going to give him the heathen for his inheritance and the uttermost parts
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:30.760]   of the earth for his possession, he has made him the judge.
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:35.840]   He has committed judgment unto him.
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:42.320]   This is what makes preaching such a solemn thing, my friends.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:48.000]   But I have to tell you again that the Son of God will come back into this world with
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   a rod of iron.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.480]   He will come back to judge the world in righteousness.
[00:41:55.480 --> 00:42:00.080]   This world is not going to be allowed to go on like this forever.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:04.480]   This world is not going to be allowed to be governed by the devil without end.
[00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.600]   No, no, it doesn't belong to him as a usurper.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:13.080]   The one to whom it belongs is coming back and he'll break them with a rod of iron and
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:19.280]   dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.800]   He will come back again into this world and every eye shall see him.
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.840]   Yea, and they that smote him.
[00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:33.320]   And from the terror of his face they will try to hide themselves.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:40.840]   They will cry out unto the rocks saying, "Hide us from the wrath of the Lamb."
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:41.840]   But nothing will avail.
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.200]   No, the world, you see, is ignorant of all this.
[00:42:46.200 --> 00:42:50.160]   We talk about our science, our learning, our utopias and our schemes.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:55.480]   We imagine vain things, vain things about ourselves, vain things about God.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.240]   But here's the answer.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.560]   History proves it.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:00.840]   The world is proving it tonight.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:05.680]   But my dear friends, I can't leave you on that note.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:12.320]   This not only shows the folly of mankind, there's something, oh, it's even worse.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.720]   It's the tragedy of mankind.
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:24.200]   And oh, that the world might have its eyes opened to its tragedy this evening.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:30.360]   Men and women are not merely defying the might and the power of God and the righteousness
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:32.720]   of God.
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.120]   They're rejecting the love of God.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:37.120]   Listen.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:43.360]   They have taken counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:44.360]   Anointed?
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:47.360]   What does this mean?
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:53.360]   Well, I say this is a part of God's gracious plan and purpose.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.240]   Who is the anointed of God?
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:57.440]   He's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:43:59.480]   He's Jesus of Nazareth.
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:00.480]   He is God's Son.
[00:44:00.480 --> 00:44:01.480]   Well, what's the message?
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.480]   Well, here it is.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:10.600]   And this is what makes it almost impossible to understand men in sin tonight.
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:12.960]   God's gracious purpose.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:20.360]   Though we've arrogantly rebelled against him and defied him and hated his laws and
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:28.080]   regarded them as cords and as bands, though we've insulted him to his face, the message
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:40.240]   still is God so loved the world, God so loved this world as it is, that he gave his only
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:47.880]   begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting
[00:44:47.880 --> 00:44:48.880]   life.
[00:44:48.880 --> 00:44:52.200]   He is anointed.
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:57.400]   God has sent his only begotten Son out of the eternal glory into this world.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:02.880]   He was born as a babe in Bethlehem and they called his name Jesus.
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:06.640]   And God has anointed him to be the Savior.
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.280]   Why did he ever send him into this evil sinful world?
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:16.000]   To be mocked and laughed at and jeered at and spat upon, to have a crown of thorns thrust
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:21.600]   upon his holy brow, to stagger under the weight of a cross of Golgotha and to be crucified
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.920]   upon it and to die and to be buried.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.600]   Why has it happened, I ask?
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:33.520]   There's only one answer, the love of God, the gracious purpose of God.
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:40.440]   God has anointed his own Son to be our Savior and our Deliverer.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:45.200]   Do you remember how the Apostle Paul puts this in the fifth chapter of his epistle to
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   the Romans?
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   Listen to it, my friend.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:53.240]   Here is the message for you on this remembrance Sunday evening.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:46:02.360]   "For when we were yet without strength in due time, Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:08.880]   For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet for a good man some would even dare
[00:46:08.880 --> 00:46:10.080]   to die.
[00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:18.480]   But God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:20.200]   for us.
[00:46:20.200 --> 00:46:27.800]   Much more, then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:28.800]   him.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:35.160]   For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, how much more
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:40.480]   being reconciled shall we be saved through his life?
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:49.520]   Now here I say is the tragedy, that God, in spite of our rebellion, our folly, our arrogance,
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:59.360]   our mad, insane defiance of him, and our trampling upon his laws, God has looked upon our world
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:07.680]   in mercy, so much so that he sent his only Son into it.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:13.040]   And not only sent him into it to teach the world and to show them how to live, but to
[00:47:13.040 --> 00:47:21.400]   die for ourselves, to give himself for us, to receive our punishment, to rise for us.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:26.360]   And oh, the salvation that he offers us at such a cost!
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.360]   What is it?
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:33.200]   Well, it is, you see, to enter into the kingdom of eternal righteousness, to have our sins
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:36.120]   forgiven and blotted out.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:42.640]   It is to have the blessedness blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:49.480]   My friends, in spite of all that is so true of us, God has sent his only Son into the
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:54.840]   world in order that we may never reap the consequences of our own actions.
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:48:00.280]   We deserve not only punishment, we deserve eternal misery, and that is the promulgation
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.640]   of God's law upon our sin.
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:08.200]   But God has sent his Son into the world to save us from that, that we need not perish,
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:12.440]   but have everlasting life.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:20.040]   All our sins forgiven, made the sons and the children of God, made heirs of God and joined
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:26.480]   heirs with Christ, and having the promise of living eternally in the kingdom of light
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:33.920]   and of glory, forever and forever and forever, God offers us through his anointed all this
[00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:37.680]   amazing blessedness.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:44.720]   And still the world mocks at it and laughs at it and jeers at it.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:47.240]   It won't even consider it.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:54.280]   It regards it as insulting, fancy being asked to listen to an old gospel like this in 1965,
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:59.520]   when we can be reading the Sunday newspapers and the views and the schemes and the proposals
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:04.240]   of the clever men and the brilliant ideas and the marks of knowledge and of science.
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:06.600]   They regard it as insulting.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:12.480]   I can understand men in a sense rebelling against God's law, even that's terrible,
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.080]   that's wrong, I've denounced it.
[00:49:14.080 --> 00:49:19.040]   But what I cannot understand is this, that men should reject not only God's law and
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:25.520]   justice and righteousness, but that they should throw his love back into his face, that they
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:30.600]   should ridicule his mercy and his kindness and his compassion.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:33.800]   But that is what the world is doing.
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:36.080]   God has not abandoned the world.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:41.560]   God has sent his son into it to restore it, to save it.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:49.400]   But the world rejects the love in exactly the same way as it rejected the law.
[00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:53.280]   And that is why I say it is the final tragedy.
[00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:58.320]   Let me end my exposition by holding before you the appeal of the psalmist.
[00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:05.480]   Listen, in the light of all this he says, "Be wise now therefore, O you kings, be instructed,
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:11.720]   O you judges of the earth, serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling, kiss
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:17.840]   the Son lest he be angry and he perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.640]   blessed are all they that put their trust in him."
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.640]   What's it mean?
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:27.040]   Oh, let me put it to you like this.
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.520]   My dear friend, listen to this appeal.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:35.840]   Be wise, be wise.
[00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:39.000]   Stop and think.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:46.360]   Turn off the television for a moment, and the radio, and your gramophone.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:48.520]   Turn off the newspapers.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.080]   Turn off everything.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:58.640]   And stop for a moment and listen and think about what this word of God has got to say
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.640]   to you.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:03.560]   And then be instructed.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.520]   Be ready to be taught.
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:09.880]   Now be honest and admit that you don't know where you are, that you don't understand
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   life, you don't understand death, you don't understand why there is a war or rumors of
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:21.000]   wars in this enlightened, intelligent, scientific twentieth century.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:25.040]   If you don't, well admit you don't, and then become as a little child and be ready
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:28.600]   to receive instruction.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:34.120]   And here is the instruction.
[00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:37.720]   Realize what is happening.
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:40.200]   Realize why the world is as it is tonight.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.200]   You know the answer.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:42.200]   Here it is.
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:51.360]   Kiss the sun, lest he be angry, and he perish from the way when his wrath is kindled but
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:53.120]   a little.
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.400]   I believe that that is what is happening in the world tonight.
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:04.640]   We are seeing a little kindling of the wrath of the Son of God upon this world.
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:07.880]   He is withholding his gracious influences.
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:14.960]   He is allowing us to reap the consequences of our own insane folly.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:19.480]   He is withdrawing the restraints, and he is allowing us to see what we are making.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.840]   That is a part of his wrath, the wrath of God upon sin.
[00:52:22.840 --> 00:52:25.920]   He withdraws, he abandons us to ourselves.
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:31.840]   This is but a little kindling of the wrath of the Son of God, my friends.
[00:52:31.840 --> 00:52:41.000]   And if we at this moment are turning our world into a little hell, it is nothing in comparison
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.640]   with what hell itself is going to be.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:46.680]   Do you feel that this world is hell?
[00:52:46.680 --> 00:52:49.120]   Do you say life is hell?
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:50.120]   Many people are saying it.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:51.120]   They have had their fill of pleasure.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:52.120]   They cannot find satisfaction.
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:56.560]   They get involved in complications, and there they do not know what to do with themselves,
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:00.080]   and they are raging in a madness, not knowing what to do.
[00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:01.560]   They may kill the next man they see.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   They do not want to, but they do not know what they are doing.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:03.560]   They are mad.
[00:53:03.560 --> 00:53:04.560]   That is hell.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.560]   Oh, no, it is not.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:06.560]   That is only a glimpse of hell.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:18.960]   That is only a little bit of hell.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:26.480]   Hell itself is all that multiplied by infinity and going on to infinity forever and forever.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:31.720]   Be careful lest, says this man, be careful lest you lose your way, and the world has
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:34.680]   lost its way, but come back, he says, to this way.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:40.600]   Be wise, listen, consider, receive instruction, stop, listen to the message, see where you
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:44.240]   are, see the end of the road which you are traveling.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:50.560]   Stop while there is still time.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:55.840]   Realize that you are defying the Lord God of the universe in whose hands you are and
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.760]   from whom you cannot escape.
[00:53:58.760 --> 00:54:03.400]   It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.040]   You can say, I will never listen to such preaching again.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.560]   It will not make any difference, you know.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:12.160]   You still have to go on living, and you still have to die, and after death you still have
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.160]   to stand in the judgment.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:14.880]   You are just a fool.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:18.800]   You think that by forgetting a thing or at any rate refusing to allow it to enter too
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:21.720]   frequently into consciousness that you somehow do away with it.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:22.720]   You do not.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:23.720]   It remains.
[00:54:23.720 --> 00:54:24.720]   It stands.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:29.240]   It is the word of the living God.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:39.600]   Be wise, be instructed, be careful that you do not lose the way.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:41.920]   How can you make sure that you are not doing so?
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:47.280]   Well, you do so by repenting, by thinking again about all these things, by acknowledging
[00:54:47.280 --> 00:54:53.360]   your folly and your sin and your madness against God, and then what you do, oh, listen to it,
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:59.920]   hear the appeal, kiss the Son, kiss the Son.
[00:54:59.920 --> 00:55:07.320]   The Son of God is unseen in this meeting, this congregation at this moment.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:12.760]   And you know what the psalmist is urging you to do, and I urge you to do it in the same
[00:55:12.760 --> 00:55:14.760]   way.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:16.560]   Kiss the Son.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:21.880]   You know what people do when they go to Buckingham Palace and are given office by the Queen?
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   What do they do?
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.880]   Well, they kiss her hand.
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.720]   They kiss the hand of the monarch.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:29.720]   That is the sign.
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:34.960]   You are submitting to her, you are going to carry out her laws to the best of your ability.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:40.880]   You kiss her hand, and you know the Son of God is holding out his hand to you tonight.
[00:55:40.880 --> 00:55:42.840]   Kiss the Son, my friend.
[00:55:42.840 --> 00:55:44.600]   Give up your rebellion.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.160]   Submit yourself to her.
[00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.520]   Take the oath of allegiance.
[00:55:50.520 --> 00:55:53.520]   Submit yourself to the Son and trust him.
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:56.520]   Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.
[00:55:56.520 --> 00:56:01.520]   In your bewilderment, in your confusion, in your unhappiness, simply believe this, that
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:08.040]   Jesus of Nazareth is the eternal Son of God, and that he came into the world to save you.
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:09.040]   Believe him.
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:11.080]   That is submitting to him.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:12.080]   Accept his message.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.240]   Believe the gospel as it is.
[00:56:15.240 --> 00:56:19.360]   Become a little child and surrender yourself to him and to it.
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:21.720]   Trust him to save you.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.080]   Trust him to keep you.
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:29.760]   Trust him to share his eternal glory with you, and immediately begin to serve him.
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:39.920]   Serve the Lord with fear and begin to rejoice with trembling.
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:46.840]   And then you will agree with the last statement in this old psalm.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:49.840]   Blessed are they that put their trust in him.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:54.680]   Oh, the happiness of they that put their trust in him.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.720]   Do you know, my friends, you put your trust in him, you'll understand this old world
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:02.400]   in the terms that I've been putting before you.
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:06.320]   You will know that though you are still in it, you no longer are of it.
[00:57:06.320 --> 00:57:09.760]   You will know that your sins are forgiven.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:13.260]   You will come to know that you are a child of God.
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:19.200]   You will be able to see beyond this world to the world that is to come, the glory of
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.480]   the Son of God.
[00:57:20.480 --> 00:57:25.400]   You will know that you're going to be in it and enjoy its blessings with him throughout
[00:57:25.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   eternity.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:37.580]   On this remembrance Sunday evening, I just want to ask you two questions.
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:40.540]   Are you wise?
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:47.740]   Are you really wise with regard to yourself and your life and your death and your eternal
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:48.740]   future?
[00:57:48.740 --> 00:57:53.140]   Are you wise with regard to the state of this world and what's happening in it and what's
[00:57:53.140 --> 00:57:55.180]   going to happen?
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:59.660]   Are you wise?
[00:57:59.660 --> 00:58:00.660]   Are you instructed?
[00:58:00.660 --> 00:58:06.140]   But oh, here's the question.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:10.260]   Have you kissed the hand of the Son of God?
[00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:15.620]   It's my privilege to tell you again that it doesn't matter what your past may have been,
[00:58:15.620 --> 00:58:19.740]   though you've sinned yourself into the very jaws of hell, though you've committed every
[00:58:19.740 --> 00:58:27.020]   crime in the whole category of criminology, I tell you this.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:35.020]   Be wise, be instructed, acknowledge and confess your sin, kiss that outstretched hand of the
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:38.860]   Son of God tonight.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:47.860]   The past shall be forgotten, a present joy be given, a future grace be promised, a glorious
[00:58:47.860 --> 00:58:50.860]   crown in heaven.
[00:58:50.860 --> 00:58:59.100]   And when he comes, you won't be terrified, you'll rejoice, you'll run to meet him and
[00:58:59.100 --> 00:59:21.940]   you'll spend your eternity basking in the sunshine of his glorious face, beloved friend.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:22.940]   His hand is outstretched toward you.
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:23.940]   Kiss it, kiss the Son, here and now.
[00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:24.940]   Amen.
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.420]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
