[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   Well, all of our money is God's money.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.940]   And that profound reality raises all sorts of questions about stewardship, like this
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.680]   question from a podcast listener named Colin, who finds himself in a tricky spot as he considers
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.000]   a career in financial counseling.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.600]   "Pastor John, what would you say to a young man or a young woman who is interested in
[00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.580]   pursuing a career as a financial advisor?
[00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.120]   Could a Christian serve others by helping them plan financially for retirement, or do
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.040]   you think this is promoting an ungodly waste of retirement?
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   I want to help others steward their money for Christ's sake, but our society's warped
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.440]   perspective on retirement makes me think twice about entering this profession.
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.080]   Can a Christian serve others and help them plan for retirement, even a very typical American
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.480]   retirement, with a clear conscience?
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.360]   Is financial planning a worthy Christian vocation?"
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.760]   If I didn't believe that financial planning was a worthy Christian vocation, I would not
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.120]   have spoken to the annual gathering of the Kingdom Advisors—that's their name, Kingdom
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.440]   Advisors, that's the conference anyway—the Kingdom Advisors a few weeks ago.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:20.960]   In fact, if Colin isn't familiar with the Ron Blue Institute that sponsors that event,
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.480]   encouraging Christian financial planning for the last 30 years or so, I'd encourage
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.440]   him and others to check it out, the Ron Blue Institute.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.600]   He's been giving his life to this for decades.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.520]   In fact, I sat beside him at a dinner just before I spoke, and I asked him, "Can you
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.160]   put in one sentence what you've been about for 30 years?"
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.800]   He didn't even hesitate.
[00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.080]   He said, "God owns it all."
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.080]   That's it.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.680]   In other words, it's not yours.
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.880]   Your money is not yours, period, which puts you in a very, very precarious position.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's God's, and you got it in your bank, in your pocket.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Watch out.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.020]   You might become a thief or a mismanager.
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.800]   God has given you the ability to obtain it, to be sure.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.640]   That's why we make mistakes and think it's ours.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.500]   And he's calling you to be a steward, a manager of it, not an owner.
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.960]   For his purposes, not your own private purposes.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.240]   Money is currency, right?
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:33.840]   Meaning it's a culturally accepted medium of exchange for what you value.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:34.840]   You don't want paper.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.160]   I mean, what good is that?
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160]   You can't eat it.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.040]   You can't eat the metal in your pocket called coins.
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:47.080]   You can't eat the bytes on the internet that's supposedly what you got in the bank.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   I hope it's there anyway.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.520]   Everything is done by online banking now.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.200]   What is money anyway?
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.320]   It's just paper, it's metal, it's internet bytes.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:07.240]   But how you move it around, what you trade it for signifies what you value.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:17.360]   And therefore, money becomes a means of worship and witness and love or selfishness.
[00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.440]   So we can put out of our minds any thoughts that money intrinsically is evil.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.840]   It is intrinsically dangerous because Jesus said it's hard for the rich to get into
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.200]   the kingdom of heaven.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:37.240]   Money exerts a tremendous power to try to enslave us to this world.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.560]   But if we are born again with new values, new preferences, new things that we cherish
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.680]   and treasure, if we're born again, money can become an instrument with which we show
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:59.960]   how we value God more than money and do much good for people in relation to God.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:06.880]   Being a financial planner should mean, I think, for a Christian, that you have seen these
[00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:13.520]   things in the Bible and you want to help other people see them and act on them.
[00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:19.840]   But you really need convictional clarity if you're going to do this because you will
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.880]   get a lot of blowback.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.440]   You say, Colin, our society's warped perspective on retirement makes me think twice about entering
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   this profession.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.440]   Well, good.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.600]   I'm glad you think twice.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.360]   I hope that you think a hundred times about it and that with every thought you turn to
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.920]   your Bible for wisdom and guidance.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.320]   And I would suggest that you think of it this way.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:47.640]   The very fact that there is a warped perspective on retirement, even among Christians, is a
[00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:56.680]   reason to become a financial planner, a Christian, a Bible-saturated financial planner, rather
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.280]   than a reason not to become one, unless you don't have any conviction or backbone.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.320]   People need help.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:05.640]   Rich people need help.
[00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.640]   They look powerful.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.640]   They need help.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:12.320]   They need to be shaken loose from the assumptions of our culture.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:18.600]   And you can be a great help in that regard if you have the courage to speak to very wealthy
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.720]   people about what they should do with their money.
[00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   And you need to settle it early.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.120]   You won't be a typical financial planner who simply finds out the goals of his client and
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.000]   then helps him make that happen.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.560]   You will want to shape those goals.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.800]   If that's not what you want to do, then you won't be a Christian financial planner.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.400]   You'll just be a jellyfish in the current of culture.
[00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:49.280]   If you don't have the courage to do this with very powerful people, then don't go into this
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.280]   field.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.560]   You want to be a dolphin, not a jellyfish, when you're talking to the rich.
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:03.880]   I think a Christian financial planner should try to help people cast a vision for what
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:11.080]   retirement can be from a Christian view of the world and life.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:15.680]   There is no such thing as retirement from ministry in the Bible.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.760]   And everybody who's a Christian is a minister, that is serving people's needs by whatever
[00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.480]   gifts you have.
[00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.520]   You may stop doing one paid vocation.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.540]   Our culture calls that retirement.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.060]   Not a good word.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:39.400]   But you never retire from active service in a world like ours that is so broken, so needy.
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:48.560]   I just read the story of George Mueller yesterday, who'd been pouring his life out for the needy,
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:54.200]   for orphans in particular, for about 30 years, no, about 50 years.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.220]   So he turned 70.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:07:00.200]   And for the next 20 years, he did what he wanted to do.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:05.280]   He traveled 49 nations of the world preaching the gospel.
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:10.200]   And then he turned 95 and he came home and took up the pastorate again, no, I think at
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:12.680]   90, and then he died at 95.
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:18.720]   What a crazy, wonderful, beautiful, countercultural vision of so-called retirement.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:25.960]   So Colin, when you close by asking, "Can a Christian serve others and help them plan
[00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:33.960]   for retirement, even a very typical American retirement with a clear conscience?"
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.000]   My answer is no, no, no.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   No.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.240]   Your aim is not to counsel a typical American retirement.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.680]   You want people to break free from that.
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:54.520]   You will encourage people not to prioritize playing and leisure, but to prioritize serving
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.760]   and ministry.
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:08:01.040]   You will become a specialist, and I could use your help.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:10.680]   Any could, a specialist in helping people know ways to use their money wisely to maximize
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:17.120]   that kind of active ministry-oriented end-of-life season.
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:19.720]   You had me going there for a moment talking about internet bites.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:24.000]   I thought you were about to drop a Bitcoin mention and talk cryptocurrency.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.800]   I don't even know enough about that to talk about it.
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.800]   Right.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.800]   Okay, I figured not.
[00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.040]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:31.640]   And thanks for listening to us today.

[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:13.440]   And I'm not talking about those with terminal illness, but Christians who struggle with
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:16.240]   this fear on a daily basis.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.120]   The struggle is real for many Christians out there.
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:23.120]   We get a lot of emails from you, and that's up next on the podcast.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.400]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke, and on behalf of John Piper, we'll see you on Wednesday.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.400]   Thanks for listening.
