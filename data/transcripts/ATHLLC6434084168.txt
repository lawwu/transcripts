[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.840]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.000]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.160]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.880]   investments.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.600]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.360]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.560]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.360]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.160]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.240]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.640]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your children's
[00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.160]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.080]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.360]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.920]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.720]   free to join.
[00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.080]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.800]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:44.440]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hats, a show about upgrading
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.960]   your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800]   I'm Amy Fox, and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.640]   If you're confused and thinking I might've hired a professional voice actor
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.800]   to spice up this intro, you're wrong.
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.960]   Amy's actually my wife, and she's joining me to help co-host this episode.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:59.680]   Why?
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.600]   When I saw that our guests today were another married couple that liked doing
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.200]   their interviews together, I thought it would be so much more fun with all four
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.600]   of us.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.800]   So who's this married couple?
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.400]   Amy?
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.400]   Today, we're joined by Nate and Kaylee Klempp, co-authors of a fantastic book
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.600]   called The 80/80 Marriage, A New Model for a Happier, Stronger Relationship.
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.280]   When Chris first brought it home, it made me think he was trying to tell me things
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.440]   were not going well.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.400]   But it ended up adding so much value to our lives.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.440]   It must've added a lot to other people's lives too, because it was recently named
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.200]   as Editor's Choice Pick by The New York Times.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.720]   Now, who are Nate and Kaylee?
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.800]   Nate is an entrepreneur, a philosopher, a best-selling author, and mindfulness
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.240]   junkie.
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:47.360]   And Kaylee is a group facilitator, executive coach, and an expert in small
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.240]   group dynamics and leadership development.
[00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.000]   In our conversation, we'll explore the history that's led couples from
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.560]   imbalance to too much fairness to what they call radical generosity.
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.840]   We'll also get into the tools and tactics that make it easy to implement these
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.520]   changes in our own lives, so we can stop keeping score and have a lot more fun
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.960]   together.
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:12.440]   I am excited for this conversation, and frankly, just as excited that I get to do
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.440]   it with Amy as my co-host.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.840]   So let's jump in.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:21.120]   Nate, Kaylee, Amy, thank you so much for being here.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.200]   Great to be here.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.640]   So excited to be with you.
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.480]   I love the way you approached the book at the beginning about the evolution from
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.720]   80/20 to 80/80 and the stops in between.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.120]   For anyone who hasn't read that, can you walk through that evolution for
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.520]   everyone?
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:42.280]   One of the things that inspired us to write this book is we felt like we were
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.520]   part of this generational shift that's happening in marriage.
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.640]   If you look at your grandparents' marriage or maybe even your parents'
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.520]   marriage, it's likely that there's a very different structure and a very
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.640]   different mindset.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.720]   In the book, we call that 80/20.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.440]   It's the idea of one partner, generally the woman, doing about 80%, another
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.480]   partner, generally the man, doing something more like 20%.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.760]   And so we're a part of this new generation, sort of Gen X, millennial,
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.360]   we're the ones getting married now, having kids, where all of a sudden the
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.880]   norm is egalitarian marriage.
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:21.440]   There was just a recent Pew poll that was conducted that found 97% of Americans
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.680]   agree with the idea of equality in marriage.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.600]   So we are entering marriage with this idea that we want to be equals and in
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.320]   love, and that turns out to be a very difficult task because we have this kind
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.360]   of default mindset that we talk a lot about in the book, where we try to
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.640]   achieve equality.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.840]   We certainly did this for about a decade in our marriage, and we interviewed
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.680]   about 100 couples, found this very common.
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.840]   We try to achieve equality by making everything perfectly 50/50 fair, keeping
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.560]   score, and that's a recipe for all sorts of resentment and conflict.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.040]   And what goes into these percents?
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.080]   Is it 80/20 of the household chores, 80/20, like just so everyone has some
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.000]   context, what goes into those?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.600]   So if you start with 50/50, trying to be perfectly equally fair, going back to
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   80/20, we're looking at how are you contributing to the relationship?
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:22.200]   And so that's where, historically, the woman was 80% responsible for the
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:26.160]   well-being of the relationship, and the man was less so.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.080]   As we go forward, then we look at 80/80, which we recognize the math doesn't
[00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.560]   actually work, but the whole idea is when we stop scorekeeping with 50/50, if
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:43.480]   that's our foil, and strive to contribute to the relationship at 80%, it's much
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.520]   more likely that where we land is going to be radically generous and feel like
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.440]   we're winning together.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:55.040]   So I'm very curious, why is it so challenging to achieve a balanced
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.800]   relationship?
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.360]   This was one of the key insights that led us to want to write this book.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.720]   We experienced in our own life that it was failing, but we couldn't really
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.600]   figure out why.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.960]   So then we started looking at the research in psychology, and we found out
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:15.760]   that there's a way in which our assessments of what is or isn't fair in
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:19.840]   relationship are clouded by all sorts of cognitive biases.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.720]   And there are two that really stand out.
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:25.880]   One is what psychologists call availability bias, which is just a fancy
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.720]   way of saying that all of my wonderful contributions to our life together, my
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.960]   drop-offs at school and taking out the trash, all of that information is
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.080]   available to me.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.320]   But when it comes to what Kaylee does, it's a little fuzzy.
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:45.080]   And so I have this tendency to systematically underestimate everything
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.880]   that Kaylee does.
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:50.200]   And then in addition to that, there's this other cognitive bias, we call it
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.360]   the overestimation bias, where we have this tendency to overestimate the amount
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:59.840]   of time spent on things like childcare and housework.
[00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.480]   So in other words, if I say it took me like 90 minutes to clean up the house, it
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.280]   was probably more like 45.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.760]   Both men and women do this.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.720]   The research finds that men do it more.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.960]   But I think that's really important because what that means is that when we
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:19.480]   are arguing about fairness, we are essentially having an argument from total
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:22.080]   delusion based on really bad data.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:24.920]   And that's why we keep arguing about it.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:30.360]   And there's no way out of that cycle of this sort of 50/50 downward spiral into
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:30.880]   fairness.
[00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.960]   I think it's interesting that when we were interviewing couples, if we asked
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.840]   them directly, "Hey, do you guys ever fight about fairness?"
[00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.600]   They'd be like, "No, we never fight about that."
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.520]   But then as they would tell us stories, we started to recognize that fairness was
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.160]   underneath a lot of the different things that they were actually fighting about.
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:57.240]   So as a, for instance, there's the very typical housework argument.
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:01.800]   "Hey, how many loads of laundry do you need to do to make it fair for the time
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.800]   that I got up in the middle of the night because the kid threw up?"
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.520]   But then there was also fairness around things like, "So we just did Father's
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.800]   Day for an entire weekend with your parents.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:16.960]   Now we're going to go see my parents.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.720]   You want to leave on Saturday instead of on Friday?
[00:08:20.720 --> 00:08:21.920]   That's not fair.
[00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:25.840]   We need to spend equal amounts of time with each of our families."
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.760]   Or the version of, "We've been out with your friends for three weeks in a row.
[00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:32.600]   That's not fair.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.160]   What about, what about my friends?"
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.520]   And all of a sudden you could start to see these through lines where fairness
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.560]   was in some ways invisible and therefore insidious and polluting things.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.880]   It's so interesting you say this.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.840]   I think before we were chatting and before I read the book, in my mind, I thought
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:53.280]   Chris and I were actually very balanced.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.080]   I was like, "We've got this."
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:09:01.160]   And as I'm hearing about these things like the availability bias, for example, I
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:07.440]   realized that I many times will be the person on a more regular basis that says,
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.880]   "Hey, Chris, I've woken up.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:11.680]   I've made our daughter's breakfast.
[00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:12.640]   I've walked the dog.
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:13.840]   I've unloaded the dishwasher.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:14.920]   I got her out of the crib."
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.320]   And meanwhile, what I don't know is he's actually going through and pulling
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.720]   together all of our finances.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:22.200]   These things happen behind the scenes.
[00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.800]   I actually hate doing them and I have a deep appreciation for it, but because I
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:32.440]   don't really know what goes into it and I don't see it happening, I'm like, "Well,
[00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:33.640]   I'm Superwoman here.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   What are you doing?"
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.760]   I think it's really important to see that and to also just be gentle with
[00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.440]   ourselves that we fall into this mindset.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:48.800]   We wrote this book, we've been talking about it for the last year, and yet we
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.440]   fall into this mindset all the time.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   Yesterday, we had a snow day here in Colorado and our daughter couldn't go to
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.000]   school.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:58.720]   I was the one who had the more open calendar, so I ended up managing all the
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:09:59.440]   logistics.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:04.480]   And I found myself several times falling into that same mindset of, "This isn't
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.080]   fair.
[00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:06.920]   I'm the one who's doing everything.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:08.880]   Kaylee's just sitting there at work.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:11.120]   Why am I the one who has to do this?"
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:15.800]   And it's the mindfulness around seeing that, being gentle with yourself, and then
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.840]   shifting to where I ended up at the end of the day, which was, "Hey, we're trying
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.160]   to win together here.
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:24.280]   This is not a competition and we're definitely not trying to make everything
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:24.800]   fair."
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:31.680]   So it's like a default center of gravity, this idea of fairness that our mind is
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:34.240]   attracted to and falls into habitually.
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:38.480]   So I think you can be gentle with that and then just see it and shift.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.480]   So I definitely want to go into the tactics that people can use to make these
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:42.840]   shifts.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.040]   But before, I'm really curious, when you did the research, were there types of
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:52.640]   people, whether it's culture, ethnicity, personalities, where you saw that this
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.600]   was already happening or it was harder to do or kind of made it a different
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:57.280]   circumstance?
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:02.680]   In the interviews that we did, we interviewed as much diversity as we could
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:03.000]   find.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.040]   So we found a couple that was living out of a van, traveling around the world,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.560]   socioeconomic differences, cultural differences, race differences, LGBTQ+
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.200]   differences.
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:20.760]   And what we found was, one, as soon as you added kids to the mix, then fairness
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:25.160]   seemed a little bit more prevalent because time felt a little bit more
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:25.840]   scarce.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.640]   The second thing that we noticed is that, interestingly, gay couples actually had a
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:37.760]   little bit of an advantage because they had less of a historical hangover around
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:43.240]   expectations for what each of them might do because of traditional gender roles.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.680]   And so as they were defining, in some ways, anew, they got to create things in
[00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:52.800]   their relationship that felt to them like it helped them win together.
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.200]   And it wasn't that they never fell into fairness.
[00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:56.480]   That definitely happened.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.360]   But they had fewer things that they were bringing forward from the past that
[00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.520]   informed the way that should look so they could design it more skillfully for
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:06.120]   themselves.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:07.080]   Interesting.
[00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:10.360]   So I don't think either of those are things that people can just up and switch
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:10.960]   in their lives.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.800]   No.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.040]   If you have kids, you can't make those changes.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.320]   So I think that's a great segue to what should people be doing?
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.400]   What kinds of tactics can they do to achieve this 80/80?
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.560]   And maybe you could talk a little bit first more about what it means to have an
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:25.400]   80/80 marriage.
[00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:26.920]   Absolutely.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:29.720]   We were actually just talking this morning, knowing that we're on all the
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.520]   hacks, about some of these shifts.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:36.720]   And we made this distinction for the first time between what we think of as
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:38.880]   micro hacks and then meta hacks.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.120]   And if you think about the 80/80 marriage, there's all sorts of micro hacks that
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:47.760]   we'll get into that are small routines and habits you can build into your day.
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:53.040]   But there are two big meta hacks that I think are really important for grounding
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.640]   this in everyday life.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:58.440]   And the first is a meta hack that's all about mindset.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.600]   And that is this whole idea of 80/80, or we call it radical generosity.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:09.160]   So it's this idea of viewing your life together through this mindset of radical
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.120]   generosity instead of scorekeeping and fairness.
[00:13:13.680 --> 00:13:19.880]   And that macro level mindset has the ability to sort of put everything else in
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.480]   motion.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:23.880]   So the second of these is what we call structure.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:28.560]   So this is another big idea, which is about shifting from asking the question,
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.200]   what's best for me, to asking the question, what's best for us?
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:35.600]   We call it shared success, or you can think of it as winning together.
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.520]   And that's the orienting principle for how you build structures around finances
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.000]   and logistics and priorities and all those different things.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.960]   So if we go to just the first of those, because that's, I think, where it all
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:54.440]   starts, that meta hack of radical generosity, there's a few key elements of
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:54.800]   that.
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:57.440]   One is contribution.
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:01.640]   If you think about the essence of generosity, it's often about contributing
[00:14:01.640 --> 00:14:06.920]   to your partner, which is something we do, but we often do it from a mindset of
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:11.040]   fairness, which makes those acts of contribution land in a different way.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.720]   So one of these pieces is contribution.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:20.120]   Another is appreciation, which is basically shifting the way in which we see
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:21.240]   our life together.
[00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:26.440]   As everybody probably knows, when you're in a relationship long enough, you start
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:28.360]   to revert to this default mindset.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:32.640]   Neuroscientists call it the negativity bias, where you're essentially looking
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:34.280]   for everything your partner did wrong.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.040]   You're looking for ways in which they fell short, and appreciation is about
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:43.120]   flipping those glasses so that you're actually looking for what they did right,
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:45.760]   and then appreciating them for that when that happens.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.320]   And those two together are sort of where radical generosity starts.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.000]   It's almost like a call and response in music.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.680]   Contribution is the call, appreciation is the response.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.880]   It's easy to say, "Oh, of course I should just not keep score, and I should just
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:03.400]   have this generosity, appreciation."
[00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.200]   But like, how do you actually do that?
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.280]   Because sometimes you're sitting there, like Amy mentioned, she's done 10 things
[00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:15.520]   in the morning, and to be generous, she says, and balancing our finances, I might
[00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:18.960]   just be like, sleeping in or taking a long shower.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.400]   So...
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.000]   Playing Wordle in bed.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.400]   So how do you actually make that happen?
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.400]   Like, how do you actually put those changes into place?
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.000]   Are there triggers or cues that you can apply to make it easier?
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.080]   Absolutely.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.280]   The first around contribution, I think is to remember that we're playing the long
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:44.760]   game, that if I look at any slice in time, someone's doing more and someone's doing
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.760]   less, just because it doesn't actually work that every single hour we're working
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:50.200]   on the same things.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.120]   And so we want to take a long view.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:56.640]   Does this balance over days, weeks, months, years?
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:16:01.840]   For contribution specifically, I think it's really important to know what is your
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.160]   partner value?
[00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.600]   What do they care about as a contribution?
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:10.320]   And we joke sometimes that I could try to contribute to our relationship by doing
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:13.960]   cartwheels down the hallway, because doesn't that bring joy and delight to our
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:14.520]   family?
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.520]   And then Nate would say, that actually provides no value in our family.
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.920]   Please contribute differently.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:25.600]   It's an interestingly vulnerable experience to have the conversation with your
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:26.240]   partner.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:30.160]   What could I do that would feel meaningful to you?
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:36.240]   How could I contribute to you, to us, to our family in a way that would feel like
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.840]   you knew I really cared?
[00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:39.720]   And then internalizing that.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:42.760]   Micro habit, really specific.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.880]   We say, find one way to contribute every day.
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:47.480]   Start small.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:51.520]   You can build if you want to, but these are little things like, I'm a coffee
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:51.960]   drinker.
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:55.960]   If Nate turns on the Keurig in the morning, I am delighted.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.080]   It feels like that he loves me.
[00:16:58.560 --> 00:17:02.600]   This is noticing that socks have been left on the floor at the top of the
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.120]   stairs.
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:05.720]   And because I'm a neat freak, that makes me feel crazy.
[00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:07.240]   And moving them to a laundry basket.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.240]   These are teeny tiny things.
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:13.040]   But if you're wearing the glasses that say, how can I contribute in our
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.760]   relationship in a way that you care about?
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.320]   Doing that one thing builds the habit and that lets you continue doing it.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.080]   Well, and then tactically with appreciation, this is where you can do the
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.760]   kind of BJ Fogg habit stacking approach, which is what we do.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:32.080]   Where obviously appreciation can happen organically and spontaneously, and it's
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.480]   great when it does, but we're busy.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.560]   Life is crazy.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:38.240]   The world is crazy, so it doesn't always happen that way.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.640]   So one of the things we've done is at the end of every day, just before we go to
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.960]   bed, we're lying in bed.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:49.360]   We use that as our cue to do one appreciation for each other.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:54.040]   It takes like 30 seconds, really doesn't take much time at all, but it ends the
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:56.680]   day on this high note of appreciation.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.560]   And so that's another practice where it sounds abstract, but you can actually
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.280]   build it into certain things that you're already doing.
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.520]   Dinner, going to bed, waking up in the morning, whatever that might be for you.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:15.320]   My last favorite tiny tip around appreciation is to get a sticky note pad.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.040]   That in our house, we've gotten into leaving each other's sticky notes around.
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:21.560]   These do not have to be profound.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:26.640]   These can be things like good luck today on your podcast, or I love you, or hope
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.600]   you have a great day.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:30.000]   Good luck at the spelling bee, whatever it might be.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.760]   And what I love about this is once your kids get to be of the age where they can
[00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:35.480]   write, it gets contagious.
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:39.280]   And so the whole family can get on board with the sticky note game.
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:43.480]   Our daughter was watching that we were leaving sticky notes for each other on one
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.680]   another's bedside table.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:48.320]   And she got really excited about it, that she could write sticky notes.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.840]   And now we'll find for me as I love you, mama, sticky notes.
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:55.760]   My favorite is the one that fell on the toilet, but the sentiment was there.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.600]   I just want to know, is it disingenuous if you're like, oh, I'm going to set a
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.080]   calendar reminder every Thursday at 3 p.m.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.160]   to make sure that I show my appreciation?
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.720]   It feels sometimes like something like that would be like disingenuous because I
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:11.200]   needed the calendar reminder.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.480]   But is that, from what you found, not the case?
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.640]   I think that's a really important point.
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:19.720]   And this is a debate that we've actually had with various folks on Instagram.
[00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:25.200]   There's a view out there that everything in love needs to be spontaneous and it
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.120]   just has to happen organically.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:28.400]   And isn't that great?
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.360]   And that does work when you're first dating and you're 18 or you're in college or
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:39.960]   something. But we are advocates of the position that structure creates freedom
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:43.240]   within a relationship. Structure creates connection and intimacy.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:50.640]   So we are totally fans of the calendar reminder or scheduling date nights or even
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.120]   scheduling intimacy.
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:58.080]   I know that can be a controversial position, but in our life with kids and all
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:02.800]   the craziness that is the logistics that go into our day, sometimes that's the only
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:04.280]   way we can make these things happen.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.880]   I want to go back to something that you had talked about related to values.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:15.960]   And I'm curious how you think about the 80/80 marriage working when a couple has
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.120]   different values or standards.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.800]   I'll give two examples on both of our sides.
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:25.480]   One is I think it's really valuable to have a good sense of how much we spend.
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:30.000]   So I really like going and categorizing our transactions to know how much we spent
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:30.960]   in different categories.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.560]   Amy, on the other hand, doesn't love that process or probably think it's as worth it
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:37.240]   as I do.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:39.600]   That is an understatement of the year.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:44.880]   I'm like, we're clearly spending a lot, a lot less than we're saving.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.760]   So I think we're in an OK place.
[00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.800]   And Chris is like, no, no, no.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.000]   I've got to know every detail.
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.640]   The flip side is, I don't know if you guys know what Soylent is, but from my
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:58.440]   perspective, when I think about food and our kid, I'm like, well, our daughter, she
[00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:01.000]   can have yogurt or oatmeal every day.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.360]   Does she really need variety?
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:05.840]   I take a slightly different point of view.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:08.080]   I think it's so important and valuable for her.
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:09.840]   She just turned 18 months today.
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:15.360]   And I think it's incredibly valuable for her to experience different textures and
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.160]   flavors and colors and have that variety.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:25.080]   So the way that I prepare her food, I think, is vastly different than the way Chris
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.600]   approaches it. Both very clearly work.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:30.520]   But I'm curious to get your perspective on it.
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.240]   The first step is you have to start with a mindset of radical generosity because
[00:21:36.240 --> 00:21:41.360]   everything I'm about to say, if you start with a mindset of we're going to litigate
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.480]   this and one of us is going to be right and one of us is going to be wrong, we all
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:52.680]   lose. So assuming that we begin with this premise that we want to win together, the
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:56.320]   place to start is actually at the notion of values.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:03.360]   And values are actually deeper than I want our finances budgeted or I want our
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.880]   daughter to eat different textures of food.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:12.320]   Values, if you really stay with it with each other, are things like I want our child
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.840]   to have a variety of experiences.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.160]   And I imagine just having listened to this podcast that, Chris, a variety of
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.280]   experiences might be something that you could get on board with and food could be a
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.360]   subcategory of it.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:30.000]   Or things like I want to make sure that we have the resources so that we can enjoy our
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.680]   life. And Amy, I imagine you could say, oh, yeah, I could get on board with that as a
[00:22:33.680 --> 00:22:40.840]   value. If you can get to a place at the root where you do agree, it facilitates the
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.320]   details of the conversation.
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.000]   Then just completely structurally, we believe in a couple of different things.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.680]   One, sometimes the person who cares more gets to take the lead.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:59.040]   So if Chris cares more about knowing each line item, then he might get to take the
[00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:02.600]   lead in going back through the Amazon purchases and deciding which category they
[00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:08.120]   belong in. If you care more about the food that your daughter is eating, you might
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:10.800]   take the lead on creating those experiences.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.280]   And when it doesn't create conflict for the other person, I'm delighted to have you do
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:19.080]   those things, particularly if it doesn't require a lot from me.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.360]   Great. Sometimes, though, that's not quite enough.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:28.120]   And that's where we think having agreements and structures help facilitate it so it
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.280]   doesn't create conflict.
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:34.880]   So using money just because it's a great for instance, we think budgets are really
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:40.880]   useful. So couples will often get in conflict around how much are we saving versus
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.160]   how much are we spending and are we saving too much?
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.920]   Are you actually just being a penny pincher and you're a drag to be around or are we
[00:23:47.920 --> 00:23:49.680]   not saving enough? Are we being frivolous?
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:52.600]   Are we being irresponsible or we're not going to be able to have the resources we
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.480]   want for our life?
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:24:00.680]   And sitting down from that mindset of radical generosity to say, how much do we want
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:05.840]   to spend in these buckets because it's aligned with what we value?
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.720]   And that's where the connection happens.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:10.680]   Based on our values, what do we want to do?
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:15.440]   And creating some structure or frameworks around it helps take the conflict out of it.
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:20.800]   I want to pause for one second on the relationships and moving to a couple other
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.400]   questions and just ask, as you talk to couples about money, are there things you
[00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:29.480]   learned aside from the value of a budget that people should think about when they're
[00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:33.680]   talking about money, whether it's combining their finances or reviewing spending or
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.720]   creating rules?
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:38.120]   Are there things that came out of those conversations that are worth sharing?
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:45.400]   At the macro level, we found that money is very tightly interlinked with power, which
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:46.400]   is kind of obvious.
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:50.120]   But when we started asking couples about money, it was really interesting that they
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.680]   would say things like we interviewed a woman who admitted that because she makes more
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:01.400]   money, she decides where they go on vacation, because in her mind, it's this is my
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.640]   money. I get to decide.
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.280]   Right. So I wish everyone could see Amy's face right now.
[00:25:05.280 --> 00:25:06.720]   Yeah, she's like, what?
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.680]   So there are these really interesting dynamics of power where often in a couple, I
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:15.240]   mean, it's very rare that couples make the exact same amount of money.
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:20.280]   So often there's an imbalance there and there can be some really strange and
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.680]   interesting power dynamics that are worth being aware of.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:29.640]   And that's where, again, structure can be really valuable to the point about how you
[00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:33.160]   use money together, whether you share it or whether you have separate accounts.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:38.880]   We found that there are a lot of different ways to make it work, so long as there is
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:44.840]   some pot of money or resources that's commonly held, that you share together, that
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:46.520]   you can win together with.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:50.120]   And so one of the easiest approaches is just the all in approach.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:56.240]   We call it where you share all of your resources, but we also know couples who do
[00:25:56.240 --> 00:25:58.440]   that and have what are called side stashes.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:02.080]   So they have their own little personal allowance that they can use to spend on
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:03.040]   whatever they want.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:06.320]   The other partner doesn't get to criticize them or micromanage them.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:08.720]   And then there are couples who have separate accounts.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:14.000]   But the key with those separate accounts is to have some shared pool so that if one of
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:18.960]   you gets a promotion or one of you lands a big movie deal or book deal or whatever it
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:21.640]   is, you both win together in some way.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:27.600]   And is it OK if one partner takes on a responsibility almost exclusively?
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:31.000]   I know in a lot of relationships there's like the I like to manage the money and the
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.200]   investments and the savings.
[00:26:32.200 --> 00:26:36.360]   And in this model of ideal marriage, is that OK?
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:38.360]   Are there things that are exclusively owned?
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:43.840]   We think it works better if you can be really clear about your roles.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:51.320]   And so if we look at our macro hacks of mindset and structure underneath that is a
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.280]   roles piece.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:56.960]   Do we know who's doing what so that we aren't stepping on each other's toes,
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:58.920]   criticizing the way that somebody else is doing it?
[00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.320]   And are our roles balanced?
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.960]   I love, Amy, that you use the word balanced earlier.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.240]   It's not about fair.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:10.600]   If you write down everything that each of you are up to on a sheet of paper, which we
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.920]   actually did and it created a huge unlock for us.
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:19.200]   It was really valuable that when we did the initial exercise on the ledgers, if you
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.360]   will, mine was three X as long as Nate's.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:26.760]   And we looked at it and said, huh, it makes sense that this feels completely
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:27.680]   unsustainable.
[00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:32.000]   And then we looked at it not through the lens of how do we make it fair, but what do
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:33.560]   each of us care more about?
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:36.040]   What do each of us want to take on?
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.560]   What are each of us good at?
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.600]   And so running it through that sieve leads us back to what you were just describing,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   Chris, that one person in the relationship might love looking at investments, thinking
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:50.000]   about how they could be more strategic with those things.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.760]   They might care about balancing the budget to the penny or the dollar.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:56.680]   And the person on the other side says, I trust you completely.
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:59.320]   And there could be one person who really owns it.
[00:27:59.320 --> 00:28:05.120]   I think it is helpful to have awareness of what your partner is doing, not because you
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.680]   want to manage it for them or step on their toes, but because it helps us
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:12.200]   appreciate, wow, there's a lot of time and energy.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.400]   That went into that portfolio and it performed really well.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:18.200]   Thank you for doing that on our behalf.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:24.520]   It seems like with every business, you get to a certain size and the cracks start to
[00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:25.080]   emerge.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:29.600]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week and you have too many manual
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.160]   processes and there's no one source of truth.
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:38.400]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers, 37,000, 25, 1.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:39.760]   37,000.
[00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:43.280]   That's the number of businesses which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:45.680]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:50.200]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system, streamlining accounting, financial
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.520]   management, inventory, HR, and more.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:53.760]   25.
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:55.880]   NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.120]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less, close their books in days,
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:03.440]   not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.000]   And one, because your business is one of a kind.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:12.600]   So you get a customized solution for all your KPIs in one efficient system with one
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.440]   source of truth.

[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:21.720]   Everything you need to grow all in one place, which I can tell you from all the
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.520]   companies I've run, makes everything so much better.

[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:53.000]   There is nothing I love more than learning that something I enjoy is actually so good
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.200]   for you, and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:30:00.160]   It has so many health benefits, and I think one of the best and easiest ways to
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:03.040]   consume it is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.280]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted using only wild harvested leaves from 250
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.560]   year old tea trees, rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:18.800]   Then everything is triple toxin screened for pesticides, heavy minerals, and toxic
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:20.680]   mold commonly found in plants.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.840]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep, because they're all in pre-measured
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.680]   quantities that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds, and are so travel
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.160]   friendly.
[00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:35.400]   They have so many products, but lately I've been alternating between the green
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:40.120]   Pu-erh for mental clarity and energy, and the black Pu-erh, which helps kickstart
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:45.280]   digestion and metabolism with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good, and probably
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.920]   one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:50.920]   And if you need another reason, search for all the amazing research-backed benefits
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:55.320]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome, heart, blood sugar, and more, and then be
[00:30:55.320 --> 00:30:59.640]   happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated in polyphenols than all other teas in the
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:00.080]   world.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.040]   But you don't even have to take my word, or do any research, because Peak offers
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:07.440]   free US shipping, free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:13.240]   And for a limited time, you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver with 12 tea
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:19.320]   samples at my link at allthehacks.com/peek, that's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:24.880]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peek, P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.640]   I love the concept of hour, and I think that's incredibly helpful.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:39.000]   To get more tactical, is there a tool for organizing this concept of moving to the
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.960]   80/80 marriage?
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.120]   Is there a spreadsheet?
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   Are there other tools or sheets that you use in order to keep things organized and
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:50.520]   maintain that clarity around ownership and roles?
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:55.960]   There are actually a number of different exercises in the context of the book that
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.600]   allow you to do that sort of thing.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:01.760]   We don't have a spreadsheet, although we did have somebody email us a spreadsheet,
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.920]   which was like their detailed breakdown of roles.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:09.440]   But I think that what you can think about when it comes to these kinds of structures
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:15.000]   is building structure around any of those areas where you find you go into conflict,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.840]   or where you find it's an area that's more or less unconscious.
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:24.680]   And I think that's one of the big shifts here, is that for many of us, when we get
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:29.600]   into a relationship, we're coming from a place of unconsciousness and a lack of
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:30.560]   intentionality.
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:32.360]   Things are just happening by accident.
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:36.280]   When we would ask couples, "How did you design your structure of roles?"
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:40.880]   They would say, "I don't know, we just sort of winged it."
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.160]   And so that actually became a technical term for us.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:49.040]   We call that the winged approach, which almost every couple we've ever met adopts.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.160]   We certainly did.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:55.320]   And what we're doing with many of these different practices is we're going from
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:33:00.640]   that unconscious place of winging it, whether that's with roles or our priorities
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:04.480]   where we're just saying yes to everything that comes in, or our boundaries where
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.080]   we're saying yes to everything and no to nothing.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:11.400]   We're shifting from that unconscious wing it approach to something that's more
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.600]   intentional, more conscious, more designed.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:17.400]   And so I would say that's the key move.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.720]   And then the exercises are helpful.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:23.920]   For some couples, it is helpful to have a detailed budget and spreadsheets and
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:24.680]   things like that.
[00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:25.920]   For other couples, it's not.
[00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:29.480]   But I think the key move is just bringing in that structure and greater
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:30.440]   intentionality.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:35.800]   I think there's also, in some ways, a silly tool that really complements this,
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.040]   which is to name your team.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:42.600]   And this might have flashbacks to when you were at summer camp and you had to name
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:43.400]   your group of people.
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:48.640]   We've actually found it tremendously helpful as a way to differentiate between
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:50.400]   which entity we're talking about.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.520]   So our team name is Kajona.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.520]   It's just the first two letters of all of our names.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.320]   We've got K-A for Kaylee, we've got Jo for our daughter, and we've got N-A for
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:33:59.680]   Nate.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:04.040]   And we'll ask the question, what would be best for Kajona?
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.120]   And a simple example that actually was really profoundly life-changing for us
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:14.280]   was when she went to school and she was going to get off the bus at 3 p.m., Nate
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.880]   and I had a whole conversation about what we wanted to have happen.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:21.800]   And what was best for me was for Nate to be available every day at 3 p.m.
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:22.520]   to meet the bus.
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:27.480]   And what was best for Nate was for me to be available every day at 3 p.m.
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:28.320]   to meet the bus.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:33.600]   And we had really elaborate conversations about why it was individually best for
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:37.680]   each of us to have the other person do this task that neither of us wanted.
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:42.680]   And we were going to get nowhere if we stayed in that winning-for-me mentality.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:47.160]   Then we were able to take a step back and ask the question, what's best for
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:47.880]   Kajona?
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:52.840]   And it included our daughter, it included the whole family unit, it included some
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.160]   of the commitments that we've made.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:56.800]   And I'll let you talk about what happened.
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:02.760]   I think with that alternative framing, we realized that I was in a place
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.640]   professionally at the time where I could go down to 80%.
[00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.040]   It made sense for me.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:10.800]   Kaylee really needed to be working those hours.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   And so all of a sudden, when we shifted the frame, the solution was obvious.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.400]   And I was actually excited about it, you know, even though it was a loss for me,
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.960]   I guess, on my side of the ledger.
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:28.080]   But that is a just really powerful and simple example of how you can shift from
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:32.760]   asking what's best for me to what's best for us through a name that kind of
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.280]   orients you toward that.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.880]   The name itself pushes you toward that.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.640]   First of all, Chris, you and I need to come up with a pretty good family name
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:42.040]   here.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.680]   So that'll be task one.
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:44.200]   I love it.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:46.600]   Our daughter's name is Quinn.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.560]   So if we take your approach, it's gonna be a little tricky with the Q.U. in
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:50.880]   there.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:54.960]   It'll be a little tricky, but we're gonna get back to you on our family name.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:36:01.640]   But I think the question that stems from this whole bus conversation and conflict
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:07.920]   resolution that you all work through together is how does that change when life
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:08.680]   changes?
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:13.160]   So, for example, one of your roles may become more demanding at work for a
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:14.520]   shorter period of time.
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:22.240]   Or let's say I have a baby and clearly changes the time and availability I have
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.000]   to give towards the things that I previously was giving to.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:31.600]   How does that work when shifts in life change and therefore your availability
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.480]   and schedule changes to the things that you previously committed to?
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:35.680]   How do you approach that?
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.920]   We like to think of life as happening in chapters.
[00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:46.040]   And so having your values, having your priorities, having your boundaries, all
[00:36:46.040 --> 00:36:48.000]   of the things we say, what's our North Star?
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:50.040]   What are we saying yes to?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.920]   What are we saying no to?
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.320]   And how are each of us going to show up in the relationship?
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:37:02.160]   You revisit it at each chapter and a chapter could be we had a kid, a chapter
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:08.040]   could be one of us had a big shift in a job, a chapter could be our kids left.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.600]   Now we're empty nesters, a chapter could be now we live in a new city.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:13.320]   We moved.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   I think ideally, if it were only up to me, you would get to set your values,
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:20.720]   priorities, and it'd be a one and done.
[00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:22.360]   You could just coast from there on out.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:25.000]   I like systems that you press play and they just happen.
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:27.840]   That is not how this works in real life.
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:33.640]   And so giving permission to revisit things at a different point in time at a
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:38.200]   different chapter, or if you notice it's not working, that there's an
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.040]   invitation to come back to things.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:41.840]   Hey, we thought this was going to be awesome.
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:42.920]   Shoot.
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.720]   It didn't turn out the way that we had hoped.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.960]   Let's revisit it.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.880]   Let's reconsider.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:53.120]   Amy, I think that there's a reality check that happens each point along the way.
[00:37:53.680 --> 00:37:59.640]   We also, I'll let you add to this if you want, we believe in outsourcing when it
[00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:04.400]   makes sense and there are really skillful ways to do it, especially around things
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.680]   that create tension in the relationship.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:10.960]   So as a, for instance, the person who comes and helps us clean our house
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:15.840]   goes in marital wellbeing, that's the line item in the budget because we're so
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:20.440]   much happier as a couple when we're not fighting about whose turn it is to sweep
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:24.080]   the floor or to clean up whatever it might be, and so giving yourselves
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:27.880]   permission to that in a different chapter, there might be things that you
[00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:32.240]   stop doing that you have someone else do for you, or that just fall off the list
[00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:34.040]   because they're not as crucial anymore.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.960]   So outsourcing is something that I think we've embraced, especially
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:38.840]   as we've had children.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.720]   And earlier you said that you feel like you don't have time.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:43.760]   I genuinely think we have less time.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:45.840]   Like the day must've shrunk.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.160]   I'm not sure, but I'm curious if there are things that you've seen people
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:53.360]   outsource or you've outsourced yourself that might not be obvious.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:58.000]   And one I've shared a few times is that we never really considered or knew about
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.920]   the fact that you could hire someone.
[00:38:59.920 --> 00:39:03.440]   And we literally hired someone off of Craigslist to cook food and
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:05.400]   drop it off twice, once or twice a week.
[00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   We started it twice.
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.240]   Now we're back to once.
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.400]   And, and glass Tupperware in the fridge, you've got meals.
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.720]   That was crazy that we just never knew that was a thing.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:18.840]   And when we ran out of time, it's, it created a lot less conflict by not
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:22.520]   having to decide similar to yours, who's going to get off work early enough to
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:27.240]   prep dinner because it turns out kids eat about the same time that the senior
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:28.040]   citizens do.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.760]   So we got to stop work early.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:34.000]   Are there other things that people outsource that you've seen cleaning and
[00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:37.920]   cooking are too, but I'd love to know the others so we can experiment.
[00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:42.480]   I think there've been a couple of things that I'm not sure it's outsourcing per
[00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:45.520]   se, but that have really changed my experience of time.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:48.440]   And one is I often travel for work.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.080]   And so the back and forth to the airport, I'm not sure why, but I had in my head
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.240]   that I should drive myself to the airport and giving myself permission where now I
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:01.400]   am always in a Lyft or an Uber on the way to and from the airport.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:05.400]   I work in the back of the car or when my flights are late, I get to sleep in the
[00:40:05.400 --> 00:40:06.160]   back of the car.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:10.440]   That freedom of time has been a huge unlock for me.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.760]   Just that driving home at one o'clock in the morning.
[00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:17.160]   I don't do the adrenaline filled hour to then wonder why I can't fall asleep.
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:22.080]   When I walk through the door, I think another one is around food, but a clever
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   way of doing that when you have young kids.
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:29.840]   So I was just talking to a couple, they have a one year old and they were having
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.320]   that same time crunch around.
[00:40:31.320 --> 00:40:34.400]   We don't have enough time for cooking.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.720]   We're not eating good food.
[00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:40.160]   And they had hired a nanny and they realized they had never asked if she
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.520]   cooked and it turned out she loved to cook.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:48.280]   And it was like she wanted to actually spend the afternoons planning meals and
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:50.240]   getting food prepared for the evening.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:54.480]   So that was one where there was an interesting synergy between them and the
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:59.320]   care provider that allowed them to now have meals cooked for them every evening.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.640]   So I think there are a lot of clever things like that that are probably going
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.760]   to be different for each family, but there's absolutely so much room for
[00:41:06.760 --> 00:41:08.760]   creativity around outsourcing.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   That's amazing.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.920]   What this just reminded me of something a friend of mine told that is probably
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:13.600]   another good one.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:18.200]   He had a nanny and they had all of these people.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:21.640]   Someone yesterday was telling me, it's like once you move to the suburbs and
[00:41:21.640 --> 00:41:24.840]   sorry to be gender normative, I guess he was like, you just have a guy for
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:25.080]   everything.
[00:41:25.080 --> 00:41:28.400]   You got a lawn care guy, you got the sprinkler guy, you got this.
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:32.720]   And he was talking to his nanny and it was like, gosh, the nanny knows the most
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:33.520]   about the family.
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.320]   They're in the house every day.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:35.880]   They know everything.
[00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:39.720]   And one day, I don't remember how it clicked, but he found out
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:43.120]   that the nanny would be interested in making a little extra money and
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:45.160]   managing all of those things.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:48.840]   So that person now is like, I will make sure that the cleaner comes on a day
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:49.440]   that works.
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.880]   I will make sure that the yard people are here.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:53.600]   I'll tell them to text me.
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:56.640]   I'll make sure that we send them the PayPal when it's done.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:01.880]   And it was like, they basically, and it was, she wanted to do it.
[00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.160]   They basically have this kind of household manager.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:08.520]   But to find someone that wants to do all that for a couple hours a week is
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:09.600]   probably pretty difficult.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.400]   Because they have to learn so much about you.
[00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:16.040]   So if there's anyone in your family that's, if you have childcare, that
[00:42:16.040 --> 00:42:17.480]   could be an unlock if they're interested.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:22.120]   I think that the through line that's really powerful is being willing to ask
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:22.800]   the question.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:27.040]   Hey, are you interested in, Hey, is this thing important to you?
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:30.280]   Hey, would you be deeply offended if we dropped off all of our laundry at the
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.280]   laundromat and they folded it and cleaned it for us?
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:34.080]   Or are you okay with that?
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.200]   Just, I think there are sometimes internal obstacles around what we think is
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:40.360]   possible or what somebody might be interested in.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:45.560]   And then random non sequitur aside, I think a huge time saving that occurred
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.680]   in my life is I recognize that I have a black thumb.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.120]   And so I stopped trying to have plants live in our house and instead just bought
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:53.720]   fake ones.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.760]   I like how they look.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.720]   I'm delighted to have them around and giving myself permission to not have to
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:02.960]   keep it alive was, it was really actually psychologically soothing.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:07.920]   Kaylee, we are clearly caught from the same cloth because for the last several
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:14.200]   years, I would bring home even something as robust as a bamboo or a succulent.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:19.280]   And somehow months later, it's just shriveled up brown and dead.
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:23.440]   And finally, Chris was like, it does not make sense for us to continue spending
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:27.240]   money when you end up with this heartache of everything dying.
[00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:29.840]   You throw it out months later and you replace it all over.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:35.960]   So thanks to Ikea, Amazon, and a variety of other websites, we now have a bunch
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:38.720]   of very good looking fake plants.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:43.880]   And you're right, it still gives that really nice soothing vibe to the room.
[00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:47.720]   But it's very relaxing for me because it's zero maintenance.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:49.760]   The alternative was to get a plant guy.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:52.520]   And I was like, no, that's way too expensive, we don't need a plant guy.
[00:43:52.520 --> 00:43:54.880]   There are limits, there are limits to how many guys.
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.960]   And there's a principle here that I think is really important that is itself a hack.
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:05.120]   We have this exercise that we call the life report card exercise, which is really
[00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:06.200]   about priorities.
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.640]   And the idea is, imagine you were going to grade yourself on all of your various
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.520]   life endeavors, work and community service and parenting and all these different
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.000]   things.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   And the exercise isn't just a grade where you're getting A's and B's, but it's
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.280]   actually to shift your life report card so that you intentionally get more F's and
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.280]   D's and C's, which is kind of what you were saying.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:36.480]   You were unintentionally failing in cultivating greenery and plants in your
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:41.600]   house, and then you made the shift to intentionally fail to just say, you know
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:45.680]   what, I'm going to get an intentional F in that, I'm not going to put much energy
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.600]   into it anymore.
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:50.240]   And now I'm going to free up all this energy for other things in my life that
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:51.200]   really matter to me.
[00:44:51.200 --> 00:44:57.840]   And so that itself is this amazing hack, because so many of us are spending so much
[00:44:57.840 --> 00:45:01.920]   time and energy trying to do things that we're maybe not good at, that are not
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.960]   really adding much value to our lives, that we're doing for reasons of like
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.760]   historical accident or just obligation.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   And so intentionally failing can be another really powerful practice in
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.680]   marriage and in life.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:15.840]   I love that concept.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.120]   For many people listening, they'll go home and they'll implement some of this
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:21.160]   and they'll start being much more radically generous.
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:26.040]   But then let's say six, nine months from now, life's getting really busy.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:28.640]   It's so easy to fall into those old habits.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:35.600]   How do you stay aware or present in the moment right before you're keeping score
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:37.360]   when it's not top of mind?
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:40.760]   What tactics do you have for people to keep this going for the long haul?
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:46.640]   The idea of making it structurally part of your life is really valuable.
[00:45:46.640 --> 00:45:52.480]   So while you're on the post podcast, post reading the book high, putting that
[00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.960]   calendar reminder there, you know, every Thursday at 3 p.m.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:01.840]   or starting the practice where when you sit down for dinner, you start with an
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:07.840]   appreciation, building that in so that it becomes something that you just expect is
[00:46:07.840 --> 00:46:10.720]   a really good way to give it legs and give it some longevity.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:16.360]   There's also a piece that you're naming, which is around presence or mindfulness
[00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:23.760]   that this work is easier if you have a practice of being able to take a deep
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.840]   breath, see yourself in the moment and then choose how you're going to respond
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:30.160]   rather than just reacting.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:35.560]   So in that moment where you're doing the dishes after you've already made the meal,
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:39.160]   after you're the one who unloaded the dishwasher and got everything ready and
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:43.360]   you look around and you think to yourself, wait a second, this is not fair at all.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:48.920]   To be able to take that deep breath and reveal, hey, I'd love some help in the
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:55.000]   kitchen right now versus attacking your partner also helps it be sticky.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:00.600]   There's another habit I would add to that, which is carving out space for
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.880]   connection. And there are a lot of different ways to do this.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.320]   You could do the micro space where it's 15 minutes at the end of the day.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.200]   There's date night, which we hear about all the time, especially for parents.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:16.320]   But then there's if you have the opportunity, spending a day together or a
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:21.800]   weekend together. And what we find is that the momentum of life is such that it's
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:26.360]   often very difficult to have these conversations about, hey, how can we win
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.480]   more as a team?
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.200]   What do our values look like?
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:30.160]   What are our priorities?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:31.400]   Where are we not living up to those?
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.080]   Where can we make some adjustments in everyday life?
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.400]   There's so much happening that that conversation really isn't even on the
[00:47:37.400 --> 00:47:41.760]   table. But when you can carve out a little bit of space from the craziness of
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:46.840]   modern life, you know, a day or even just an evening, having that become a
[00:47:46.840 --> 00:47:52.200]   regular pattern gets you in that mindset of taking a step back, seeing the bigger
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.680]   picture. So I think that can also be really valuable.
[00:47:54.680 --> 00:47:56.680]   I would very much agree with that.
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:01.560]   I think one of the things that Chris took away, Chris and I took away after reading
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.680]   your book, and it's been incredibly helpful, is this concept of weekly
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:10.840]   scheduled date nights and these short weekend getaways.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:16.880]   So actually in about a weekend or two, we are doing a short just the two of us
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:20.520]   trip down to Southern California just to enjoy the sun and the two of us for a
[00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.920]   bit. So those things have have definitely helped.
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:27.440]   I'm curious, though, because, Kaylee, you had mentioned the concept of presence.
[00:48:27.440 --> 00:48:32.680]   And I think one of the things that for me certainly is very challenging is we've
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:37.080]   carved out these special moments for the two of us, whether it's a date night or a
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:43.440]   weekend away. But you have these very regular touch points, for example,
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:49.560]   dinnertime, where with technology now playing so deeply into our lives, it's
[00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:55.440]   easy to shift that focus towards work emails because now we all work from home.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:56.800]   Work never really ends.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:59.880]   And now you're multitasking, you're on technology.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:07.640]   And I find it incredibly hard to stay present and focused on the 80/80 piece of
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:11.600]   it. And some of these pretty critical moments because they happen so frequently.
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:17.000]   So I'm curious to get your perspective on how you feel technology has shifted
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.480]   people's ability to stay present in these moments.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.240]   Technology has definitely made it harder.
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:28.600]   You are not alone in being tempted by your phone at approximately every hour of
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:33.040]   every day. The dopamine that we get from that moment if someone needs me or I'm
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.920]   important or there's a notification is addictive by design.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:43.880]   And so one of the main things that we recommend for couples is to put your phone
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:47.360]   away because it's so hard to multitask.
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:50.480]   I would argue it's impossible to be present with your partner and present with
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.800]   something that's happening on your phone simultaneously.
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.560]   And it's actually one of the things that was in our interviews really sad to hear
[00:49:57.560 --> 00:50:01.280]   from people. Hey, so every night we crawl in bed at the same time and we both get
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:05.240]   on our phones and I'm scrolling Instagram and he's doing scrolling the news and we
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:09.560]   don't have a conversation because we're each on our own device doing our own thing.
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:14.600]   And so a couple of things that we highly recommend, number one, kick your phone out
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:19.160]   of the bedroom. It's much more likely that you'll have a meaningful conversation,
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.240]   that there will be intimacy if your phone is not there.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:27.600]   The second is if you can kick your phone out of whether it's date night, we actually
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:32.200]   do a date hike and we'll drop our daughter off at her grandparents house.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:38.000]   And I, I would say like 95 percent of the time I leave my phone behind and I do that
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.360]   because I am not good at staying present if my phone is there buzzing in my pocket.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.960]   Only once was there a medical emergency when I didn't have my phone and was off on
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:49.800]   a date hike and it turned out to be fine.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:54.480]   Somebody else picked up when the person called and my mom ended up being totally fine.
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:50:58.320]   But there was that moment like, see, I should never leave my phone back again.
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.880]   My mom needed me and I wasn't there.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:00.840]   She was fine.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:05.680]   And for that 90 minutes after date hike, there was a level of connection that isn't
[00:51:05.680 --> 00:51:10.160]   possible when we're trying to be two places at once and are there for nowhere.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:15.640]   We also learned from one of our interviews, there was a couple that told us about asking
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:21.680]   for permission, which initially I thought was a crazy idea, but we will now do this
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.520]   when we can.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:26.720]   We don't always do this, but what it looks like is, hey, is now a good time for me to
[00:51:26.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   send this text as we're driving together or hey, is now a good time for me to order
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:33.240]   these plane tickets as we drive together or whatever it might be.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:39.720]   But just having an actual conversation before you just habitually jump onto your
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:43.440]   device can be really powerful and lets your partner into the decision.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:48.840]   I think that happens a ton on date night too, where you're in a conversation, perhaps
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:52.560]   you're envisioning a vacation that you're going to take together, you know, whatever
[00:51:52.560 --> 00:51:55.240]   your QX couples trip is going to be.
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:52:00.360]   And there's a temptation because you can make it happen right then, to at date night
[00:52:00.360 --> 00:52:04.920]   right then, book the hotel, book the plane tickets, make sure that everything is set.
[00:52:04.920 --> 00:52:09.000]   And it actually takes you out of the intimacy of the moment that you have with your
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:09.920]   partner then.
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:13.400]   And if you ask permission, hey, do we want to handle this right now?
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:15.000]   I think it's going to take seven minutes.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.200]   That might be a choice, but at least then it's conscious versus unconscious.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:20.240]   I love that.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:23.680]   There's one thing in there that I took that I thought about, which was we do that
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:26.720]   sometimes where I'm like, okay, we're going to leave my phone or one of us.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   And when our daughter's 18 months and sometimes it's hard, but when you come
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:36.040]   back and you're like, all of a sudden you have 10 emails instead of taking my phone
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:39.560]   out and ending up on the news or ending up on like social media or something, I'm
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.600]   actually doing the thing.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.280]   I get home, I'm like, ooh, now I have 10 emails, not just one.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.400]   And so it kind of like took the small blips of, ooh, what's that?
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:47.160]   Ooh, what's that?
[00:52:47.160 --> 00:52:51.200]   To a goldmine of things, whether it's, you know, something happened.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:56.840]   And the other thing was I talked to another author named Nir Eyal, who wrote a
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:00.240]   book called Indistractable in, I think, episode 25.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:03.040]   And it was all about how to avoid distraction.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:07.000]   But one of the interesting things that I think can apply to a lot of what we
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.520]   discussed is that when you hit that moment of anything that's uncomfortable
[00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:17.560]   and default, like I'm going to go scroll my phone, when early on, when you're on
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.840]   the high after listening to this or reading the book, just pause for a moment
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.760]   and feel it and it makes it easier to understand it in the future.
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:28.720]   So if you're unloading the dishwasher after making breakfast, after walking the
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:33.360]   dog and you're feeling frustrated, it's like pause and like, it sounds a little
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:37.120]   crazy and Nate, you might have better tactics with all your mindfulness
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.160]   experience, but feel what it feels like to have that frustration, to have that
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.480]   urge so that you can better identify it in the future.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.640]   I love that.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.120]   And you're right.
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.200]   This is mindfulness in a nutshell.
[00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:54.840]   It's instead of following the stream of habit, which is what we normally do when
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:58.400]   we feel something uncomfortable, taking that moment to stay.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:04.960]   And what I like to do is to notice where is this happening in my body so that I
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.040]   get out of the thought stream, because if you're mind wandering about what's
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:10.400]   happening, that usually leads you out of the present moment.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:14.880]   So can I locate this in my body and can I notice that it's changing?
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:19.360]   Can I notice that the discomfort I'm feeling, the anxiety, if you really look
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:24.440]   carefully, there's an impermanence to it and a flow to it and a shifting to it.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:29.280]   And that can be really powerful for learning how to just stay in those
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:29.800]   moments.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:35.880]   And then like you, Chris, I love the idea of the sort of like double dopamine hit.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.960]   And this is something I've been doing lately.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:40.880]   One of my, it's not a marriage hack, it's just sort of a life hack.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:45.760]   Like you, I'm very interested in crypto and I have my own issues with news
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:50.680]   addiction and I could easily spend most of my day just looking at various
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.360]   financial things and the news.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.640]   And so what I've done is given myself permission to do that when the clock
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:59.480]   says p.m., but not when the clock says a.m.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:05.320]   And so when the clock says a.m., that's my time to stay with the discomfort.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:10.200]   But when the clock says p.m., I give myself free reign so that I'm not living
[00:55:10.200 --> 00:55:14.360]   in this kind of restrictive zone of no, never, never check the news, never check
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.360]   the crypto markets.
[00:55:15.360 --> 00:55:19.000]   But still, I'm restricting myself enough that I have that space for
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:19.640]   mindfulness.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:23.560]   I like having these rules where it's like, I'm telling my brain I can do this,
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:27.480]   just not now, because as much as we like to think that we're logical and
[00:55:27.480 --> 00:55:29.560]   rational, like sometimes our brains just aren't.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:33.040]   It's like, I'm logical, but my brain's not logical in this moment.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:38.480]   So being able to say, OK, for me, it's eating sweets and Amy has all the
[00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:39.680]   self-control and I have none.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:43.720]   And the thing that worked was saying, I can have a cookie.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:45.560]   And this was a, I think this was a hack.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:48.360]   I can't remember who said it, but it's going to be in five minutes.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:51.840]   So you don't you don't say no, you just give yourself permission to do it
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:52.360]   later.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.800]   And that urge subsides by the time five minutes comes around.
[00:55:55.800 --> 00:55:57.320]   I'm on I'm writing an email.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.000]   I'm doing something.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:55:59.880]   I'm on a walk and I don't need the cookie.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.640]   But, you know, my brain allows me to say no.
[00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:06.240]   If I say yes in the future, it's I don't understand it.
[00:56:06.240 --> 00:56:09.360]   There's probably a neuroscientist who could explain it better, but it works
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:09.720]   for me.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   There's a really crazy reciprocal hack, which is if you give yourself
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:20.400]   permission to quit exercising at the 10 minute mark that most of the time, if
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.960]   you set aside whatever it is, you're half an hour that you're going to
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.480]   exercise, but you give yourself permission.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:26.960]   If I hate this at five minutes, I could quit.
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:29.240]   Or if I hate this at 10 minutes, I could quit.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:32.680]   Most of the time you finish the workout because I'm already there.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:33.520]   I'm already doing it.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:35.640]   The endorphins finally hit and you keep going.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.280]   Love it.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.080]   You just said reciprocal.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:41.760]   So I there's one, this is a bit of a segue, but it's something we talked
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:45.840]   about briefly, but it's easy when we're both like, yeah, let's do this.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.080]   We're both on board.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:51.800]   What happens when someone's not on board or was on board and has fallen off board?
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:55.440]   We, in some ways are a case study of how this works.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:57.480]   When we got married, we were 26.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:01.200]   Kaylee had a job at Deloitte, a consulting firm.
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:02.640]   She managed her finances.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.440]   She had a 401k.
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:10.360]   I was a grad student at Princeton who lived in a dorm and cleaned it like twice a year.
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:12.440]   And so that was our entry point.
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:16.000]   And as a result, she became the over contributor.
[00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:17.880]   I became the under contributor.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:20.400]   She was the one interested in working on our marriage.
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:23.040]   I was the one who thought that was a total waste of time.
[00:57:23.040 --> 00:57:30.320]   And so it created this dynamic, which we call the reluctant partner dynamic, where
[00:57:30.320 --> 00:57:34.280]   one of the partners is super engaged and enthusiastic, and the other one is very
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:42.160]   reluctant. And what we found, and this is like a 10 or 15 year case study, so it has
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:47.280]   a happy ending. But what we found is that both of us had to look at our part in the
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:50.240]   dynamics. So I'll tell you what my part was, and maybe Kaylee can tell you what her
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:57.640]   part was. My part was that I had this kind of unwillingness to lean in and contribute
[00:57:57.640 --> 00:58:02.800]   more or become curious about ways in which I might become more engaged in the
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:08.600]   relationship. And I heard her feedback as constant nagging.
[00:58:08.600 --> 00:58:13.440]   And I responded in this very passive aggressive way where I said, you know what?
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:17.520]   It turns out anything I do is not enough, so I'm just not going to do anything.
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:19.840]   And that became the pattern.
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.200]   That was certainly the way I contributed to the pattern.
[00:58:22.200 --> 00:58:27.920]   Seeing my part was a really big deal because I set it up where I would ask him to do
[00:58:27.920 --> 00:58:30.800]   something. He wouldn't do it the way that I wanted him to do it.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:34.640]   So I would either redo it or I would nag him to do it the way that I wanted him to do
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:40.520]   it. And I can't imagine why he was so frustrated with the way that I was giving
[00:58:40.520 --> 00:58:41.680]   space for him to do things.
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:42.960]   I feel you. I feel you, Nate.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:50.680]   And so it was actually a really profound shift for us to take a look at where we were
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:54.760]   doing things and to actually give full ownership of things that I historically had
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:59:00.280]   owned and micromanaged and to say, I trust you to do it differently from me and to
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.040]   actually empower him to do so.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:06.600]   So finances is an interesting example where I was a bit more of the Chris in our
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.400]   relationship that I quite like it when things reconcile.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:13.400]   And I like being in the in the spreadsheet and in the details and knowing exactly what
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.320]   the purchase was.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:19.960]   And then I was mad at Nate all the time early on because he was making these purchases.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:21.080]   I didn't know what they were.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:25.280]   I felt like he was being irresponsible, but I actually gave him no insight and no power
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:27.240]   and no ability to do anything differently.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:32.600]   And so for us to make the shift where I actually turned over our personal finances to
[00:59:32.600 --> 00:59:37.160]   Nate and said, let me show you all the systems that I've been using for however many
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:41.160]   years that I've been doing it and to let there be ways that he did things really
[00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:47.240]   differently, owning my part and saying, if I control it, I can't be mad about the
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:51.200]   resistance. If I'm willing to let go, can I also empower with the tools rather than
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.840]   just expecting him to read my mind, which is a side note.
[00:59:55.160 --> 01:00:00.080]   I find that expecting partners to read our minds is one of the fastest ways to have
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.200]   conflict. Our ESP is just terrible.
[01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:08.240]   And yet the reliability of what do you mean you didn't know as an excuse or as an
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:10.080]   accusation is really fascinating.
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:16.000]   So if one person's really in and the other person's not, we think that owning how
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.920]   you're creating your own experience can really shift the dynamic super, super
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:28.080]   tactically. We think that you can stealth bring in 80/80 to your relationship by
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.040]   using some of the exercises that in some ways, the 80/80 marriage book, you can use
[01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:40.520]   as ideas for ways that you can, if you want to use hacks, sort of a hack in to how
[01:00:40.520 --> 01:00:41.800]   your marriage system is working.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:44.200]   Your partner might not be psyched.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:48.520]   And Amy, I thought it was so interesting that Chris brought the book home and you
[01:00:48.520 --> 01:00:51.160]   thought, oh, no, something's wrong.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:56.200]   We heard that over and over in a way that was completely fascinating.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.800]   Nace written New York Times was selling mindfulness books.
[01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.600]   I've written leadership books and people like to show them to us.
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:04.600]   Look, I have the 15 commitments on my bookshelf.
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.960]   But you bring in a marriage book and people start to go, oh, are we OK?
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:15.040]   And so sometimes handing them a book can feel a little scary.
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:17.200]   Instead, you can just do an exercise.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:19.080]   Hey, I was reading this book.
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:21.520]   It had an exercise around priorities.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.480]   It feels like we're both really overwhelmed.
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.320]   What do you think about sitting down and doing this exercise around a life report
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.760]   card where we try to get Fs?
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:31.960]   That could be kind of fun.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:36.360]   And after they've done something where there's a positive outcome, they're more
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.240]   willing to engage in some of the concepts or some of the other pieces that bring the
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:41.080]   whole thing together.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:44.640]   That's a very good takeaway.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:49.840]   There are definitely things that I think out of the gate from a pure communication
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:55.240]   perspective, I realized are just minor tweaks that made a significant difference.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:02:01.720]   But there are clearly some really good, as you call it, hacks or as Chris lives by
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.800]   hacks or tactics that we can certainly apply.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:06.960]   And hopefully those listening can apply as well.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:13.760]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact, and Trade Coffee is a great
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.560]   addition to your New Year routine.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.120]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:22.760]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources the best
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:26.680]   coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.

[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.600]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need it.
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:52.400]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but this last
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:57.280]   bag of beans from Drink Coffee Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the Moon, and
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:02:58.560]   it's so delicious.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.080]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.

[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:24.920]   Do you all remember episode 122 when I spoke to chef David Chang about leveling up your
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:25.800]   cooking at home?
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:28.280]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:31.680]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:36.920]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:41.000]   from Anyday, I'm a total convert and I'm excited to partner with them for this
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:41.480]   episode.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:46.320]   Anyday is glass cookware specifically designed to make delicious food from scratch
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.240]   in the microwave.
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:51.960]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.040]   simplifies the process so much.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:04:00.000]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.520]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:08.800]   And if you need a recipe suggestion to kick off your Anyday adventure, I highly
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.800]   recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[01:04:10.840 --> 01:04:12.240]   It is so good.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:17.000]   And if you haven't checked out the Matte Black IO collection they launched last
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.800]   year, you have to check it out.

[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:53.680]   Is there a thing to do to catch yourself?
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:58.120]   I think we're both, I would say, somewhat type A when there's something to do, we
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:00.760]   both definitely have an opinion on how to do it.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:07.440]   And so how do you share that feedback without frustrating the other person, I
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.600]   guess it's, oh, you're, you're not doing it the way I wanted you to do it.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:13.120]   And the default is like to tell someone.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:15.800]   And then that person often says, why am I even doing this?
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.360]   The experience Nate had.
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:20.240]   One option, as you mentioned, is to just completely give away control.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:24.520]   But there are some things where, whether it's, you know, cleanliness, the level of
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:29.480]   cleanliness or the variety of food, as we talked earlier, there's a lot of examples.
[01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:34.840]   How do you, without giving control completely, constructively give feedback in
[01:05:34.840 --> 01:05:35.760]   those circumstances?
[01:05:36.160 --> 01:05:40.040]   We have a practice that we call reveal and request, which I think is really
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:40.840]   helpful here.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:46.040]   And it's counter to the way we normally offer feedback in a relationship.
[01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:51.400]   So we were just talking this morning on our walk before this about how in
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:57.480]   relationships, our default mode is when something goes wrong, we point that our
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:01.400]   finger at the other person, and there's some form of blame or criticism that goes
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.080]   along with it.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.880]   Here's just an example.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.280]   We were on a radio show that was talking about the 80/80 marriage, and I thought
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:09.240]   this was so cool.
[01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.760]   And I was waiting all day to play this for Kaylee.
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:14.240]   And she came into the kitchen.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.080]   I told her about it.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:17.720]   She walked away before I could even play it for her.
[01:06:17.720 --> 01:06:19.800]   And I felt like totally disappointed.
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.200]   Like I had this great surprise that I was about to reveal and she just left.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:29.280]   And the default for me in that moment was to be like, I can't believe you just
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   walked away.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.720]   You always do this.
[01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.840]   You're too busy.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.440]   You need to slow down at work.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.720]   You need to be more present.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:37.840]   It was all about you, you, you, you, you.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:43.320]   And so the idea of reveal and request is a way of giving feedback where we start
[01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:46.320]   with our own individual experience in that moment.
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:51.040]   So I actually believe that I was able to shift in that particular moment where what
[01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:56.520]   that looks like is, hey, I was waiting all day to share this with you.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:07:02.280]   And I just feel sad that you walked away and I didn't get to play this for you.
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.200]   Can you come up in five minutes or can, can I play this for you now?
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:10.960]   And it's a reversal in the way that we usually give feedback in the sense that
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.280]   you're leading with vulnerability and what we often call an inarguable truth,
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:21.280]   which is just, I feel sad or I feel irritated or I feel anxious, whatever's
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:24.200]   happening in your body and your experience.
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:29.600]   So we found that that's a really powerful way to give feedback.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:33.600]   That's really different from judgment and criticism in the way that we're, we're
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.240]   generally giving feedback in life that we're almost wired to give feedback.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:41.720]   It requires a little bit more self-awareness in the moment.
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.760]   So hence the pause is really useful.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:46.800]   A different example with the same theme.
[01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:51.000]   I was really anxious and I'm walking around the house and I realize.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:57.840]   Clutter is not acceptable in this present state of anxiety, but rather than picking
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:01.160]   up everybody's stuff with an air of resentment and throwing it in whatever
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.800]   room I thought that it should belong in or throwing it in the garbage, which I
[01:08:04.800 --> 01:08:10.760]   have been known to do instead, I revealed and said, I'm feeling really anxious.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   Clutter is adding to my anxiety.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:18.520]   You could really help me out today by picking up a couple of the things that
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:24.000]   are around, especially those that I might step on in the kitchen and that let me,
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:28.320]   that let our daughter show up in a way that was so loving to me and that didn't
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.840]   turn into the like, mom, you suck.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.200]   Or the like, seriously, you need to handle your yourself.
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.080]   I'm really curious.
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   We've been talking a lot about some of the tactics and the mentalities and
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.920]   mindsets that go behind 80 80.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.960]   I'm curious.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:43.760]   Why not?
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:46.440]   Why is the book not a hundred hundred marriage?
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.560]   We thought long and hard about that because we had the same idea.
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:54.720]   If it's really about radical generosity and we're really trying to uproot our
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:59.720]   position in fairness and 50 50, then why not go all the way to a hundred, a hundred.
[01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:06.760]   And the reason we advocate for something more like 80 80 is that we think it's
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.800]   actually really important to carve out some space for yourself and that there's
[01:09:11.800 --> 01:09:15.240]   a way of underdoing radical generosity, which is what most of us do, but there's
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:16.520]   also a way of overdoing it.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:22.280]   So for instance, we talked to one individual who was a man who told us that
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:28.840]   he was so giving in his marriage that he felt like he just got on this bus and the
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:29.840]   bus was marriage.
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:31.280]   And then the bus was kids.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:34.480]   And then the bus was a career that he didn't really enjoy.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.160]   And he felt like he gave it all away.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.280]   He had no purpose.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:44.960]   And so we think it is really important to have your own sense of purpose, your own
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:47.040]   projects that you find really interesting.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:52.160]   Like I really enjoy playing Frisbee golf, which is super weird and random, but I
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:55.320]   don't expect that Kaylee is going to be out on the Frisbee golf course with me
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:55.840]   every day.
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:59.840]   That's part of that, that space that's carved out for me.
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:05.680]   So that's really why we call it 80 80 is that there, there is something really
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:09.280]   powerful and important about our own individual pursuits that we want to
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:09.800]   preserve.
[01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:14.680]   Yeah, we definitely have a few of those, but coming back to the 80 80 part and at
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.800]   the risk of needing to mark this episode explicit, at least with iTunes, I want to
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:22.040]   touch on the topic of sex.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:24.000]   You have a whole chapter on the book about it.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:25.600]   You haven't mentioned it once.
[01:10:25.600 --> 01:10:28.880]   You could have easily written this book without dedicating a chapter to it.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:29.720]   So I'm really curious.
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:32.960]   You mentioned a few things about scheduling intimacy.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.720]   Not everything has to be spontaneous.
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:38.640]   Would you talk about that chapter and what led you to put it in the book?
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.880]   When we thought about writing this book, we realized sex is an essential part of
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.080]   this whole equation, and we have used the word intimacy, which is kind of a code
[01:10:47.080 --> 01:10:50.840]   word that we've been using, but now we're going to go full out, call it sex.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:56.520]   And what I would say just to set this up is that we live in a culture where the
[01:10:56.520 --> 01:11:01.400]   predominant viewpoint on sex is that if it's not good or you want to have more
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.080]   and better sex, you need to resort to all sorts of tactics.
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:07.800]   I think Cosmo magazine is a great example of this.
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:12.440]   They have all these articles about five ways to have sex in a pool and five ways
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.400]   to pleasure your spouse, right?
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:20.520]   And they are selling a worldview that says basically the only thing holding you back
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:27.720]   from amazing intimacy is a bunny shaped vibrator or an orgasm cream or some
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.760]   Tantra class.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:33.880]   And I think that there is a sliver of truth in that, but we take a very different
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:38.360]   perspective, which is that sex is a reflection of the rest of your life.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:43.240]   So we have a line in there from a sex expert we interviewed where he said, "The
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:45.400]   way you do sex is the way you do life."
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:47.320]   That it's like a mirror image.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:54.120]   And what we think that means is that if you are living a life that's very
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:59.960]   unconscious together, where you feel constant resentment, that is going to show
[01:11:59.960 --> 01:12:01.480]   up in your sex.
[01:12:01.480 --> 01:12:06.840]   And likewise, if you're able to make this shift to more intentional structures and a
[01:12:06.840 --> 01:12:11.720]   mindset of radical generosity, all of these things that you're doing on the mindset
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:16.520]   and structure side of 80/80 are also going to show up because you're going to be more
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:21.160]   connected and that will be mirrored in your intimacy.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.840]   And so there are some practices there.
[01:12:22.840 --> 01:12:23.480]   Do you want to jump in?
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:26.280]   Well, I was going to say mostly the exact same thing.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:30.360]   When we're thinking about sex and the reflection that it is on your life, it's
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:36.280]   really interesting to just do a quick survey of how you're showing up in the line at
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.320]   Costco.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.520]   Are you laughing?
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.560]   Is it playful?
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:41.560]   Does it feel like each of you knows what you're doing?
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.720]   Do you care how your partner is feeling?
[01:12:43.720 --> 01:12:45.240]   That that will get reflected.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:48.920]   That there can be, and in the book we talk quite a bit about this, there can be check
[01:12:48.920 --> 01:12:49.800]   the box sex.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.520]   It's Thursday.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.040]   We should probably get that done.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.640]   Versus, hey, you're the person who I want to be with.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.520]   And on our date, we're talking about things that matter.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:13:00.920]   And there's attention and care.
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:05.240]   Then it's much more likely you're going to have attentive and caring sex.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:09.160]   I think there's some tactics, too, because that's what you're asking about.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:13.640]   So this is a really interesting tactic that's out there in the Instagram world and marriage
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:18.200]   and relationships that a lot of people swear by, which is the sex challenges.
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:25.000]   So a lot of couples will commit to having sex seven days in a row for a week or a month,
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.840]   or some couples have done it for a year.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:32.120]   What's interesting about that is it takes away the question, are we going to do it?
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.800]   It's just, oh, we're committing for seven days.
[01:13:33.800 --> 01:13:34.760]   We're going to do it.
[01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:37.400]   So that's an interesting tactic.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:43.320]   The other one that I think is really important is just a big issue around intimacy for most
[01:13:43.320 --> 01:13:46.280]   couples is drive discrepancy.
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:51.320]   And there's actually there's a technical term in psychology for this sexual drive discrepancy,
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:52.040]   SDD.
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.160]   What that means is that in most couples, there's a high drive and a low drive partner.
[01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:04.200]   And there's some really interesting power dynamics there around who's initiating, who's
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:04.760]   saying no.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:10.200]   And so one of the things that this sounds insignificant, but it's really powerful if
[01:14:10.200 --> 01:14:16.280]   you are the higher drive partner and you're trying to initiate and your partner says,
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.600]   no, there's a sting to that.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:24.120]   But if your partner says not tonight, but tomorrow night, yes.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:32.600]   That shift between a pure no and a no with a plan can be like life changing.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.720]   I mean, it just lands very differently for the high drive partner.
[01:14:35.720 --> 01:14:41.640]   So that's another tactic that couples could consider is like, how do we play with this
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.640]   power dynamic of high and low drive?
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:47.800]   There's also just the ways that you signal to each other.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:51.560]   So if you're having this conversation in front of your kids, you can develop a code like,
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:53.960]   hey, do you want to have tacos?
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.040]   And if your kid overhears, they're like, for dinner on Saturday.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:58.280]   Why?
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:14:59.640]   What were you talking about?
[01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:03.160]   But it gives you a way to start to initiate the conversation or use signals with each
[01:15:03.160 --> 01:15:03.640]   other.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:05.560]   Hey, did we light the candles in the room?
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:09.560]   That might be a signal to your partner so that they can start to get excited.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.520]   We also really like the idea of signaling to your partner as early in the day as you
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:20.840]   can send them a text, start the feeling set around sex early.
[01:15:20.840 --> 01:15:23.880]   So it's in some ways like extended foreplay.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:29.000]   So if you can go from relationship advice to sex advice, and you're clearly the types
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:30.120]   of people that optimize, right?
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.080]   You wrote a whole book about it.
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:32.440]   You interviewed hundreds of couples.
[01:15:32.440 --> 01:15:36.280]   I got to ask before we wrap, what other aspects of your life?
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:39.720]   We've talked a little bit about time management, but maybe there's a few others, whether they're
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:45.000]   hacks or routines or tricks that you'd like to share that you guys use to be happier or
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.640]   make your lives better, whether it's together or individually.
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:55.400]   For me, mindfulness is a central practice that I try to weave throughout my day in a
[01:15:55.400 --> 01:15:56.280]   number of different ways.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:01.160]   So I think about it as it's a formal practice, but also an informal practice.
[01:16:01.160 --> 01:16:09.480]   So what that looks like for me on a formal level is every day, I commit to 25 to 30 minutes
[01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:15.960]   of just some sort of mindfulness practice where I'm sitting, I'm either following my
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:18.600]   breath or doing more of an open awareness practice.
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:22.440]   I find that's like planting a seed at the beginning of my day.
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.680]   That's very different from the seed of Instagram or the seed of news binging or any of the
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.920]   other things that I find myself drawn to.
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:30.680]   So that's key.
[01:16:30.680 --> 01:16:35.960]   But then there's also the informal moment to moment practice that goes along with that
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:42.200]   of just trying throughout the day to build in these moments of mindfulness, especially
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:46.840]   around what we were talking about earlier, discomfort, emotions that I don't want to
[01:16:46.840 --> 01:16:54.600]   feel, just trying to use those as opportunities to really open to an experience that would
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:59.000]   otherwise feel unpleasant and I'd otherwise want to close to or run away from.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.880]   So I think for me, other than the relationship marriage stuff, I spend a lot of my time and
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.880]   mental energy and attention on that particular set of hacks.
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:12.280]   It feels in some ways meta.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.680]   Relationships are my hack.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:21.000]   And what I mean by that is I learn things because people I care about send me a podcast
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:22.520]   or send me a book to read.
[01:17:22.520 --> 01:17:25.080]   And then I internalize them because we talk about them.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:32.520]   I exercise most often because I'm walking with a friend and I care about that relationship.
[01:17:32.520 --> 01:17:38.360]   And so I use how much I value being with other people as a way to do some of the things that
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:43.720]   I should in my life, because in some ways I've bribed myself with a person or a relationship
[01:17:43.720 --> 01:17:44.760]   I care about.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.960]   You just mentioned other people.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:51.400]   So I have one follow-up, which is of all the things you learned about relationships in
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:52.440]   marriage, right?
[01:17:52.440 --> 01:17:57.880]   Are there things that are lessons that apply to relationships with friends or family that
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:17:59.960]   can improve those relationships or even at work?
[01:18:00.520 --> 01:18:01.880]   A hundred percent.
[01:18:01.880 --> 01:18:09.240]   That 80/80 works most naturally in a committed relationship because the idea of being a team
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:12.840]   and shared success is in some ways implicit in the relationship.
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:18.760]   But the tools themselves, that notion of what's your mindset with this person and do you approach
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:24.120]   them with radical generosity works absolutely in friendship and with family.
[01:18:24.120 --> 01:18:29.960]   One of my best friend's favorite things to text me is 80/80 because in our friendship,
[01:18:29.960 --> 01:18:33.000]   that's a mindset that we've really adopted with each other.
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:39.400]   It also works really well in teams and organizations, particularly the structure piece.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:44.120]   That if you can establish enough rapport, enough relational capital, that your mindset
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:50.200]   is that of assuming positive intent, which I think of as the corporate version of radical
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:56.360]   generosity, then it makes a ton of sense to set up your values, your priorities, your
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:19:02.280]   boundaries, your roles, all of those structural components work really well in professional
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:03.160]   settings.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.840]   You just have to take the sex piece out.
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:06.280]   Yes.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:07.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:07.880]   Very important.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:14.840]   Best hack of the episode is take the sex out of your work and family relationships.
[01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:16.840]   Certainly.
[01:19:16.840 --> 01:19:18.440]   Certainly removes the complication.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.720]   Kaylee and Nate, this has been phenomenal.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:25.080]   Aside from your book, where can people keep up with both of you online?
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:33.160]   Yeah, we have a website, 8080marriage.com, and we have free epic date night guide there.
[01:19:33.160 --> 01:19:38.120]   We do a newsletter every week where we just come up with random practices and ideas for
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:39.080]   couples.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.040]   So that's one place.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:44.680]   And then Instagram is the other main place to find us, 8080marriage on Instagram.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.800]   And so this is really funny.
[01:19:45.800 --> 01:19:49.560]   I was recently on a podcast where he said that they transcribed the interview.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:54.360]   And every time I said 8080, it translated it to ADHD.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:58.520]   So just to be really explicit, it's 8080.
[01:19:58.520 --> 01:20:00.040]   That's there's no slash.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.000]   There's nothing else.
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:02.920]   It's not attention deficit.
[01:20:02.920 --> 01:20:05.720]   Find us at 8080, that 8080 version.
[01:20:05.720 --> 01:20:09.160]   I actually read one of those transcripts, so I was very familiar.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:14.920]   OK, last thing is, can you leave everyone with each of you one epic date recommendation
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:16.040]   or suggestion?
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:18.520]   I would highly recommend Ditch Day.
[01:20:18.520 --> 01:20:21.640]   We wrote our most recent newsletter about it.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:23.720]   I had a crazy experience a couple of weeks ago.
[01:20:23.720 --> 01:20:25.320]   I was supposed to be in New York.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.600]   Flights got canceled.
[01:20:26.600 --> 01:20:27.880]   I ended up at home.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.520]   I persuaded this one to do a Ditch Day with me.
[01:20:30.520 --> 01:20:32.280]   And it was epic.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:39.880]   And my tip would be, don't just talk about the weather, which is the way we describe
[01:20:39.880 --> 01:20:44.920]   a lot of conversation that couples have, which is, hey, what's the weather like today?
[01:20:44.920 --> 01:20:46.760]   That's really negative seven this morning.
[01:20:46.760 --> 01:20:47.480]   That was crazy.
[01:20:47.480 --> 01:20:53.000]   So instead of talking about the external world, ask questions that invite the other person
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.520]   to talk about their internal world.
[01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.640]   How are you really doing?
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:57.080]   What's exciting for you right now?
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.280]   What are you afraid of?
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.240]   Just ask different questions would be my main tip.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.680]   You guys need your own 8080 card deck of cards with questions.
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.120]   There's your next product.
[01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:07.560]   There you go.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:08.840]   OK, this is awesome.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:10.680]   Thank you guys so much for being here.
[01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:11.640]   This was so much fun.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.440]   Thank you for having us.
[01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:13.560]   Thanks so much for having us.
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:17.320]   I really hope you enjoyed this episode.
[01:21:17.320 --> 01:21:19.080]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:24.040]   If you haven't already left a rating and a review for the show in Apple Podcasts or Spotify,
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.720]   I would really appreciate it, especially Spotify, since they just added podcast ratings.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:33.640]   And if you have any feedback on the show, questions for me, or just want to say hi,
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:37.880]   I'm chris@allthehacks.com or @hutchins on Twitter.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:38.920]   That's it for this week.
[01:21:38.920 --> 01:21:41.160]   I'll see you next week.
[01:21:41.720 --> 01:21:53.400]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love that goes deep on all things money.
[01:21:53.400 --> 01:21:57.240]   That means everything from money hacks to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:22:01.800]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast, and it's much more about building generational
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:06.120]   wealth and spending your money on the things you value than it is about clipping coupons
[01:22:06.120 --> 01:22:07.480]   to save a dollar.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:11.640]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew, who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:16.760]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:20.600]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December 2022.
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:25.480]   But recently I listened to an episode where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow
[01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:26.280]   your mind.
[01:22:26.280 --> 01:22:31.320]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials are not participating in their
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:32.920]   employer's retirement plan.
[01:22:32.920 --> 01:22:36.600]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:39.240]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:22:39.240 --> 01:22:43.080]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks to help you get better with your
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.760]   money and grow your wealth.
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:46.840]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:51.560]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you
[01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.480]   listen to podcasts and enjoy.
