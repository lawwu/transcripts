[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.700]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:10.640]   Hello and welcome to another episode of all the hats, a show about
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.520]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.400]   I'm Amy Fox, and I'm excited you're here today.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.880]   If you're confused and thinking I might've hired a professional voice
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.360]   actor to spice up this intro, you're wrong.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.520]   Amy's actually my wife and she's joining me to help co-host this episode.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.240]   Why?
[00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.880]   When I saw that our guests today were another married couple that liked
[00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.680]   doing their interviews together, I thought it would be so much
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.160]   more fun with all four of us.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.000]   So who's this married couple, Amy?
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.960]   Today we're joined by Nate and Kaylee Klemp, co-authors of a fantastic book
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.200]   called The 80/80 Marriage, a new model for a happier, stronger relationship.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.520]   When Chris first brought it home, it made me think he was trying to tell
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.000]   me things were not going well, but it ended up adding so much value to our lives.
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.720]   It must've added a lot to other people's lives too, because it was recently
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.800]   named as Editor's Choice Pick by the New York Times.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.320]   Now, who are Nate and Kaylee?
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.080]   Nate is an entrepreneur, a philosopher, a best-selling
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.840]   author, and mindfulness junkie.
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.960]   And Kaylee is a group facilitator, executive coach, and an expert in small
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.840]   group dynamics and leadership development.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.600]   In our conversation, we'll explore the history that's led couples from
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.200]   imbalance, to too much fairness, to what they call radical generosity.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.280]   We'll also get into the tools and tactics that make it easy to implement
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.200]   these changes in our own lives, so we can stop keeping score and
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.600]   have a lot more fun together.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.760]   I am excited for this conversation and frankly, just as excited that I get
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.080]   to do it with Amy as my co-host.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.480]   So let's jump in.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.720]   Nate, Kaylee, Amy, thank you so much for being here.
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.800]   Great to be here.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.240]   So excited to be with you.
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.600]   I love the way you approach the book at the beginning about the evolution
[00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.240]   from 80/20 to 80/80 and the stops in between.
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.520]   For anyone who hasn't read that, can you walk through
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.040]   that evolution for everyone?
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.840]   One of the things that inspired us to write this book is we felt like we were
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.040]   part of this generational shift that's happening in marriage.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.200]   If you look at your grandparents' marriage or maybe even your parents'
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.040]   marriage, it's likely that there's a very different structure and a very
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.160]   different mindset.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.240]   In the book, we call that 80/20.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.040]   It's the idea of one partner, generally the woman, doing about 80%.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.040]   Another partner, generally the man, doing something more like 20%.
[00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.280]   And so we're a part of this new generation, sort of Gen X, millennial,
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.880]   we're the ones getting married now, having kids, where all of a sudden the
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.400]   norm is egalitarian marriage.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.960]   There was just a recent Pew poll that was conducted that found 97% of Americans
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.200]   agree with the idea of equality in marriage.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:56.120]   So we are entering marriage with this idea that we want to be equals and in
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.840]   love, and that turns out to be a very difficult task because we have this kind
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   of default mindset that we talk a lot about in the book, where we try to
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.120]   achieve equality.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.320]   We certainly did this for about a decade in our marriage, and we interviewed
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.200]   about 100 couples, found this very common.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.320]   We try to achieve equality by making everything perfectly 50/50 fair, keeping
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.080]   score, and that's a recipe for all sorts of resentment and conflict.
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.520]   And what goes into these percents?
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.560]   Is it 80/20 of the household chores, 80/20, like, just so everyone has some
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.480]   context, what goes into those?
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:39.080]   So if you start with 50/50, trying to be perfectly equally fair, going back to
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.120]   80/20, we're looking at how are you contributing to the relationship?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.720]   And so that's where, historically, the woman was 80% responsible for the
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.680]   well-being of the relationship, and the man was less so.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.600]   As we go forward, then we look at 80/80, which we recognize the math doesn't
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.080]   actually work, but the whole idea is when we stop scorekeeping with 50/50, if
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.000]   that's our foil, and strive to contribute to the relationship at 80%, it's much
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.840]   more likely that where we land is going to be radically generous and feel
[00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:14.960]   like we're winning together.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.680]   So I'm very curious.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.320]   Why is it so challenging to achieve a balanced relationship?
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.880]   This was one of the key insights that led us to want to write this book.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.760]   We experienced in our own life that it was failing, but we
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.120]   couldn't really figure out why.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.480]   So then we started looking at the research in psychology, and we found out
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.280]   that there's a way in which our assessments of what is or isn't fair in
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.360]   relationship are clouded by all sorts of cognitive biases.
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.240]   And there are two that really stand out.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:52.400]   One is what psychologists call availability bias, which is just a fancy
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.240]   way of saying that all of my wonderful contributions to our life together, my
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.480]   drop-offs at school and taking out the trash, all of that information is
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:06.800]   available to me, but when it comes to what Kaylee does, it's a little fuzzy.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.640]   And so I have this tendency to systematically underestimate
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.320]   everything that Kaylee does.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.680]   And then in addition to that, there's this other cognitive bias, we call it
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.840]   the overestimation bias, where we have this tendency to overestimate the amount
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.280]   of time spent on things like childcare and housework.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.560]   So in other words, if I say it took me like 90 minutes to clean up the house,
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.760]   it was probably more like 45.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.240]   Both men and women do this.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.880]   The research finds that men do it more, but I think that's really important
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.800]   because what that means is that when we are arguing about fairness, we are
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:48.560]   essentially having an argument from total delusion based on really bad data.
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.400]   And that's why we keep arguing about it.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.280]   And there's no way out of that cycle of this sort of 50/50 downward
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.320]   spiral into fairness.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.440]   I think it's interesting that when we were interviewing couples, if we asked
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:06.280]   them directly, "Hey, do you guys ever fight about fairness?"
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.080]   They'd be like, "No, we never fight about that."
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.800]   But then as they would tell us stories, we started to recognize that fairness
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.280]   was underneath a lot of the different things that they were actually fighting
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.600]   about.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:24.680]   So as a, for instance, there's the very typical housework argument, "Hey, how
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.720]   many loads of laundry do you need to do to make it fair for the time that I got
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.280]   up in the middle of the night because the kid threw up?"
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:38.040]   But then there was also fairness around things like, "So we just did Father's
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:41.320]   Day for an entire weekend with your parents.
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:43.480]   Now we're going to go see my parents.
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.240]   You want to leave on Saturday instead of on Friday?
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.440]   That's not fair.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.360]   We need to spend equal amounts of time with each of our families."
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:58.280]   Or the version of, "We've been out with your friends for three weeks in a row.
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.120]   That's not fair.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.680]   What about, what about my friends?"
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:05.040]   And all of a sudden you could start to see these through lines where fairness
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.080]   was in some ways invisible and therefore insidious and polluting things.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:12.400]   It's so interesting you say this.
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.120]   I think before we were chatting and before I read the book, in my mind, I
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.800]   thought Chris and I were actually very balanced.
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.560]   I was like, "We've got this."
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:27.200]   And as I'm hearing about these things like the availability bias, for example,
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.800]   I realized that I many times will be the person on a more regular basis that
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.400]   says, "Hey, Chris, I've woken up.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.240]   I've made our daughter's breakfast.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.160]   I've walked the dog.
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.360]   I've unloaded the dishwasher.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.440]   I got her out of the crib."
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.840]   And meanwhile, what I don't know is he's actually going through and pulling
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.240]   together all of our finances.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.720]   These things happen behind the scenes.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:53.320]   I actually hate doing them and I have a deep appreciation for it, but because I
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:58.960]   don't really know what goes into it and I don't see it happening, I'm like, "Well,
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.160]   I'm superwoman here.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.200]   What are you doing?"
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:07.280]   I think it's really important to see that and to also just be gentle with
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.960]   ourselves that we fall into this mindset.
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:15.320]   We wrote this book, we've been talking about it for the last year, and yet we
[00:08:15.320 --> 00:08:16.960]   fall into this mindset all the time.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:20.960]   Yesterday, we had a snow day here in Colorado and our daughter couldn't go to
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:25.120]   school. I was the one who had the more open calendar, so I ended up managing all
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.120]   the logistics, and I found myself several times falling into that same mindset of,
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:31.600]   "This isn't fair.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.440]   I'm the one who's doing everything.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.400]   Kaylee's just sitting there at work.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:37.640]   Why am I the one who has to do this?"
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:42.320]   And it's the mindfulness around seeing that, being gentle with yourself, and then
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:46.360]   shifting to where I ended up at the end of the day, which was, "Hey, we're trying
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.680]   to win together here.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.800]   This is not a competition and we're definitely not trying to make everything
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:57.480]   fair." So it's like a default center of gravity, this idea of fairness that our
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.720]   mind is attracted to and falls into habitually.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.960]   So I think you can be gentle with that and then just see it and shift.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:08.960]   So I definitely want to go into the tactics that people can use to make these
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   shifts. But before, I'm really curious, when you did the research, were there
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.760]   types of people, whether it's culture, ethnicity, personalities, where you saw
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.800]   that this was already happening or it was harder to do or kind of made it a
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:23.720]   different circumstance?
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:29.160]   In the interviews that we did, we interviewed as much diversity as we could
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:32.960]   find. So we found a couple that was living out of a van, traveling around the
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.080]   world, socioeconomic differences, cultural differences, race differences, LGBTQ+
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:46.520]   differences. And what we found was, one, as soon as you added kids to the mix, then
[00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:51.480]   fairness seemed a little bit more prevalent because time felt a little bit
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:52.320]   more scarce.
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:58.160]   The second thing that we noticed is that, interestingly, gay couples actually had a
[00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:04.280]   little bit of an advantage because they had less of a historical hangover around
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.760]   expectations for what each of them might do because of traditional gender roles.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:15.280]   And so as they were defining in some ways anew, they got to create things in their
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   relationship that felt to them like it helped them win together.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.720]   And it wasn't that they never fell into fairness.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:23.000]   That definitely happened.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.880]   But they had fewer things that they were bringing forward from the past that
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:32.040]   informed the way that should look so they could design it more skillfully for
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:32.640]   themselves.
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:33.600]   Interesting.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.880]   So I don't think either of those are things that people can just up and switch
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:37.520]   in their lives.
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:38.320]   No.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.560]   If you have kids, you can't make those changes.
[00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:44.840]   So I think that's a great segue to what should people be doing?
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:47.920]   What kinds of tactics can they do to achieve this 80/80?
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.120]   And maybe you could talk a little bit first more about what it means to have an
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:51.960]   80/80 marriage.
[00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.440]   Absolutely.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:57.840]   We were actually just talking this morning, knowing that we're on all the hacks, about
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.040]   some of these shifts.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:03.720]   And we made this distinction for the first time between what we think of as micro
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.400]   hacks and then meta hacks.
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:10.640]   And if you think about the 80/80 marriage, there's all sorts of micro hacks that
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:14.280]   we'll get into that are small routines and habits you can build into your day.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.560]   But there are two big meta hacks that I think are really important for grounding
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.160]   this in everyday life.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:24.960]   And the first is a meta hack that's all about mindset.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.120]   And that is this whole idea of 80/80, or we call it radical generosity.
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.720]   So it's this idea of viewing your life together through this mindset of radical
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.640]   generosity instead of scorekeeping and fairness.
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:46.440]   And that macro level mindset has the ability to sort of put everything else in
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:47.000]   motion.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.440]   So the second of these is what we call structure.
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:55.120]   So this is another big idea, which is about shifting from asking the question,
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.720]   what's best for me, to asking the question, what's best for us?
[00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.120]   We call it shared success, or you can think of it as winning together.
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:08.200]   And that's the orienting principle for how you build structures around finances and
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.560]   logistics and priorities and all those different things.
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:14.520]   So if we go to just the first of those, because that's, I think, where it all
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:21.000]   starts, that meta hack of radical generosity, there's a few key elements of
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.320]   that.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.000]   One is contribution.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.200]   If you think about the essence of generosity, it's often about contributing
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:33.480]   to your partner, which is something we do, but we often do it from a mindset of
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:37.600]   fairness, which makes those acts of contribution land in a different way.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.280]   So one of these pieces is contribution.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:46.720]   Another is appreciation, which is basically shifting the way in which we see
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:47.800]   our life together.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.040]   As everybody probably knows, when you're in a relationship long enough, you start
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:54.920]   to revert to this default mindset.
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.400]   Neuroscientists call it the negativity bias, where you're essentially looking for
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.840]   everything your partner did wrong.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.600]   You're looking for ways in which they fell short, and appreciation is about
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:09.640]   flipping those glasses so that you're actually looking for what they did right
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.280]   and then appreciating them for that when that happens.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:15.840]   And those two together are sort of where radical generosity starts.
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:18.520]   It's almost like a call and response in music.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.400]   Contribution is the call.
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.200]   Appreciation is the response.
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:27.400]   It's easy to say, "Oh, of course I should just not keep score and I should just
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.920]   have this generosity, appreciation."
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:31.720]   But like, how do you actually do that?
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:35.760]   Because sometimes you're sitting there, like Amy mentioned, she's done 10 things
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:42.000]   in the morning, and to be generous, she says, and balancing our finances, I might
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.440]   just be like, sleeping in or taking a long shower.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:45.880]   So.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:47.480]   Playing wordle in bed.
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:49.880]   So how do you actually make that happen?
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.880]   Like, how do you actually put those changes into place?
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.480]   Are there triggers or cues that you can apply to make it easier?
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.560]   Absolutely.
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:04.760]   The first around contribution, I think is to remember that we're playing the long
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:11.240]   game, that if I look at any slice in time, someone's doing more and someone's doing
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.240]   less just because it doesn't actually work that every single hour we're working
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:16.680]   on the same things.
[00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.600]   And so we want to take a long view.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:23.120]   Does this balance over days, weeks, months, years?
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.320]   For contributions specifically, I think it's really important to know what is your
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.640]   partner value?
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.080]   What do they care about as a contribution?
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:36.800]   And we joke sometimes that I could try to contribute to our relationship by doing
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.440]   cartwheels down the hallway, because doesn't that bring joy and delight to our
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:41.000]   family?
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   And then Nate would say that actually provides no value in our family.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.440]   Please contribute differently.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:52.080]   It's an interestingly vulnerable experience to have the conversation with your
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:52.720]   partner.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:56.640]   What could I do that would feel meaningful to you?
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.720]   How could I contribute to you, to us, to our family in a way that would feel like
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.320]   you knew I really cared?
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.200]   And then internalizing that.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:09.240]   Micro habit, really specific.
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.360]   We say find one way to contribute every day.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.920]   Start small.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:18.000]   You can build if you want to, but these are little things like I'm a coffee
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:18.440]   drinker.
[00:15:18.440 --> 00:15:22.440]   If Nate turns on the Keurig in the morning, I am delighted.
[00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.560]   It feels like that he loves me.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.080]   This is noticing that socks have been left on the floor at the top of the
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:29.600]   stairs.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:32.960]   And because I'm a neat freak, that makes me feel crazy and moving them to a
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:33.720]   laundry basket.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:35.720]   These are teeny tiny things.
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.520]   But if you're wearing the glasses that say, how can I contribute in our
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.080]   relationship in a way that you care about doing that?
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:45.760]   One thing builds the habit and that lets you continue doing it.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.560]   Well, and then tactically with appreciation, this is where you can do the
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:55.920]   kind of BJ fog habit stacking approach, which is what we do where obviously
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:59.120]   appreciation can happen organically and spontaneously, and it's great when it
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.960]   does, but we're busy.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.040]   Life is crazy.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.080]   The world is crazy.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.720]   So it doesn't always happen that way.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.120]   So one of the things we've done is at the end of every day, just before we go to
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:11.440]   bed, we're lying in bed.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.840]   We use that as our cue to do one appreciation for each other.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:17.240]   It takes like 30 seconds.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.440]   Really doesn't take much time at all, but it ends the day on this high note of
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.280]   appreciation.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.160]   And so that's another practice where it sounds abstract, but you can actually
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.840]   build it into certain things that you're already doing.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:35.120]   Dinner, going to bed, waking up in the morning, whatever that might be for you.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:41.920]   My last favorite tiny tip around appreciation is to get a sticky note pad
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.640]   that in our house, we've gotten into leaving each other's sticky notes around.
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:48.200]   These do not have to be profound.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.280]   These can be things like good luck today on your podcast, or I love you, or hope
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.240]   you have a great day.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:56.640]   Good luck at the spelling bee, whatever it might be.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.400]   And what I love about this is once your kids get to be of the age where they can
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:02.120]   write, it gets contagious.
[00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:05.920]   And so the whole family can get on board with the sticky note game.
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.880]   Our daughter was watching that we were leaving sticky notes for each other on
[00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.320]   one another's bedside table, and she got really excited about it, that she could
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:18.560]   write sticky notes, and now will find for me as I love you, mama, sticky notes.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.480]   My favorite is the one that fell on the toilet, but the sentiment was there.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.280]   I just want to know, is it disingenuous if you're like, oh, I'm going to set a
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:29.760]   calendar reminder every Thursday at 3 p.m.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:32.840]   to make sure that I show my appreciation.
[00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:36.400]   It feels sometimes like something like that would be like disingenuous because I
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.880]   needed the calendar reminder.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:40.160]   But is that from what you found not the case?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.320]   I think that's a really important point.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:46.320]   And this is a debate that we've actually had with various folks on Instagram.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.760]   There is a view out there that everything in love needs to be spontaneous and it
[00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:53.680]   just has to happen organically.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:54.960]   And isn't that great?
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:58.800]   And that does work when you're first dating and you're 18 or you're in college
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:06.520]   or something. But we are advocates of the position that structure creates freedom
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:07.720]   within a relationship.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.800]   Structure creates connection and intimacy.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:17.200]   So we are totally fans of the calendar reminder or scheduling date nights or even
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.720]   scheduling intimacy.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:24.640]   I know that that can be a controversial position, but in our life with kids and all
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.800]   the craziness that that is, the logistics that go into our day, sometimes that's
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.840]   the only way we can make these things happen.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.440]   I want to go back to something that you had talked about related to values.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:42.520]   And I'm curious how you think about the 80/80 marriage working when a couple has
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.680]   different values or standards.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.360]   I'll give two examples on both of our sides.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:52.080]   One is I think it's really valuable to have a good sense of how much we spend.
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:56.600]   So I really like going and categorizing our transactions to know how much we spend
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.560]   in different categories.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:03.160]   Amy, on the other hand, doesn't love that process or probably think it's as worth it
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:03.840]   as I do.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:06.200]   That is an understatement of the year.
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:11.440]   I'm like, we're clearly spending a lot, a lot less than we're saving.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.320]   So I think we're in an okay place.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.360]   And Chris is like, no, no, no.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.520]   I've got to know every detail.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.160]   The flip side is, I don't know if you guys know what Soylent is, but from my
[00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:24.960]   perspective, when I think about food and our kid, I'm like, well, our daughter, she
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:27.480]   can have yogurt or oatmeal every day.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.880]   Does she really need variety?
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.360]   I take a slightly different point of view.
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.600]   I think it's so important and valuable for her.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:39.680]   She just turned 18 months today, and I think it's incredibly valuable for her to
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:45.640]   experience different textures and flavors and colors and have that variety.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:51.560]   So the way that I prepare her food, I think, is vastly different than the way Chris
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:52.240]   approaches it.
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.960]   Both very clearly work, but I'm curious to get your perspective on it.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:20:02.760]   The first step is you have to start with a mindset of radical generosity, because
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:07.880]   everything I'm about to say, if you start with a mindset of we're going to litigate
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:12.000]   this and one of us is going to be right, and one of us is going to be wrong, we all
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.440]   lose.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:19.760]   So assuming that we begin with this premise that we want to win together, the place to
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.840]   start is actually at the notion of values.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:29.920]   And values are actually deeper than I want our finances budgeted, or I want our
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:32.480]   daughter to eat different textures of food.
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:38.280]   Values, if you really stay with it with each other, are things like, I want our
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:42.440]   child to have a variety of experiences.
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.720]   And I imagine, just having listened to this podcast, that Chris, a variety of
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:49.800]   experiences might be something that you could get on board with, and food could be
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:50.960]   a subcategory of it.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.440]   Or things like, I want to make sure that we have the resources so that we can enjoy
[00:20:56.440 --> 00:20:57.000]   our life.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.680]   And I imagine you could say, oh yeah, I could get on board with that as a value.
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:07.400]   If you can get to a place at the root where you do agree, it facilitates the
[00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.840]   details of the conversation.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:14.520]   Then, just completely structurally, we believe in a couple different things.
[00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:19.200]   One, sometimes the person who cares more gets to take the lead.
[00:21:19.760 --> 00:21:25.560]   So, if Chris cares more about knowing each line item, then he might get to take the
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.120]   lead in going back through the Amazon purchases and deciding which category they
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:29.640]   belong in.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:35.160]   If you care more about the food that your daughter is eating, you might take the
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:37.360]   lead on creating those experiences.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:41.800]   And when it doesn't create conflict for the other person, I'm delighted to have you do
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:46.280]   those things, particularly if it doesn't require a lot from me, great.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.880]   Sometimes, though, that's not quite enough.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:54.680]   And that's where we think having agreements and structures help facilitate it so it
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.880]   doesn't create conflict.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:01.440]   So, using money just because it's a great for instance, we think budgets are really
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:02.160]   useful.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:07.640]   So, couples will often get in conflict around how much are we saving versus how
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.480]   much are we spending?
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.760]   And are we saving too much?
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.680]   Are you actually just being a penny pincher and you're a drag to be around?
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.360]   Or are we not saving enough?
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:16.280]   Are we being frivolous?
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.240]   Are we being irresponsible where we're not going to be able to have the resources we
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.120]   want for our life?
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:26.920]   And sitting down from that mindset of radical generosity to say, how much do we
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:32.440]   want to spend in these buckets because it's aligned with what we value?
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:34.320]   And that's where the connection happens.
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:37.280]   Based on our values, what do we want to do?
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.880]   And creating some structure or frameworks around it helps take the conflict out of
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.040]   it.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:47.360]   I want to pause for one second on the relationships and moving to a couple other
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.960]   questions and just ask, as you talk to couples about money, are there things you
[00:22:50.960 --> 00:22:56.040]   learned aside from the value of a budget that people should think about when they're
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:23:00.240]   talking about money, whether it's combining their finances or reviewing spending or
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.240]   creating rules?
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:04.680]   Are there things that came out of those conversations that are worth sharing?
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:12.000]   At the macro level, we found that money is very tightly interlinked with power, which
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:12.920]   is kind of obvious.
[00:23:12.920 --> 00:23:16.640]   But when we started asking couples about money, it was really interesting that they
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:22.000]   would say things like we interviewed a woman who admitted that because she makes
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.720]   more money, she decides where they go on vacation because in her mind, it's this is
[00:23:27.720 --> 00:23:28.280]   my money.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:29.160]   I get to decide.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:29.520]   Right.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.840]   So everyone gets the Amy's face right now.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:38.640]   She's like, so there are these really interesting dynamics of power where often in
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.760]   a couple, I mean, it's very rare that couples make the exact same amount of money.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:46.800]   So often there's an imbalance there and there can be some really strange and
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:50.200]   interesting power dynamics that are worth being aware of.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:56.160]   And that's where, again, structure can be really valuable to the point about how you
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:59.680]   use money together, whether you share it or whether you have separate accounts.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.240]   We found that there are a lot of different ways to make it work.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:10.360]   So long as there is some pot of money or resources that's commonly held that you
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.000]   share together, that you can win together with.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.640]   And so one of the easiest approaches is just the all in approach.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.880]   We call it where you share all of your resources.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:24.960]   But we also know couples who do that and have what are called side stashes.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.560]   So they have their own little personal allowance that they can use to spend on
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.520]   whatever they want.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:32.840]   The other partner doesn't get to criticize them or micromanage them.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.240]   And then there are couples who have separate accounts.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:40.400]   But the key with those separate accounts is to have some shared pool so that if one
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.960]   of you gets a promotion or one of you lands a big movie deal or book deal or
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.080]   whatever it is, you both win together in some way.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:54.080]   And is it OK if one partner takes on a responsibility almost exclusively?
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:57.480]   I know in a lot of relationships, there's like the I like to manage the money and the
[00:24:57.480 --> 00:24:58.640]   investments and the savings.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:02.840]   And in this model of ideal marriage, is that OK?
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   Are there things that are exclusively owned?
[00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:10.320]   We think it works better if you can be really clear about your roles.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:17.840]   And so if we look at our macro hacks of mindset and structure underneath that is a
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.800]   roles piece.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.480]   Do we know who's doing what so that we aren't stepping on each other's toes,
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.440]   criticizing the way that somebody else is doing it?
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.840]   And are our roles balanced?
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:30.480]   I love, Amy, that you use the word balanced earlier.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:31.760]   It's not about fair.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:37.120]   If you write down everything that each of you are up to on a sheet of paper, which we
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:42.800]   actually did and it created a huge unlock for us, it was really valuable that when we
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:48.520]   did the initial exercise on the ledgers, if you will, mine was three X as long as
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:53.240]   Nate's. And we looked at it and said, huh, it makes sense that this feels completely
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.120]   unsustainable.
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:58.480]   And then we looked at it not through the lens of how do we make it fair, but what do
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.000]   each of us care more about?
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:02.480]   What do each of us want to take on?
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.000]   What are each of us good at?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.040]   And so running it through that SIV leads us back to what you were just describing,
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.120]   Chris, that one person in the relationship might love looking at investments, thinking
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:16.520]   about how they could be more strategic with those things.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:20.280]   They might care about balancing the budget to the penny or the dollar.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.200]   And the person on the other side says, I trust you completely.
[00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:25.840]   And there could be one person who really owns it.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:31.640]   I think it is helpful to have awareness of what your partner is doing, not because you
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:35.200]   want to manage it for them or step on their toes, but because it helps us
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.360]   appreciate, wow, there's a lot of time and energy that went into that portfolio and it
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:41.920]   performed really well.
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:44.680]   Thank you for doing that on our behalf.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.400]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:50.080]   I get it.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.280]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably desperate for a good
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.680]   hang. So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:05.080]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor, Drizzly, the go-to app for
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.120]   drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.160]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.000]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.560]   It could be your dog's birthday, that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just want
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:18.880]   to celebrate that you got through another week.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.560]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:28.000]   which means you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.440]   yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:35.640]   selection of beer, wine and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.320]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family last
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:44.000]   week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but I found
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.640]   it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:51.680]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:55.560]   That's D-R-I-Z-Z-L-Y dot com today.
[00:27:55.560 --> 00:27:58.960]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:06.080]   Did you know that electrolyte deficiency or imbalance can cause headaches, cramps,
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:08.480]   fatigue, brain fog and weakness?
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.320]   Well, our sponsor today, Element, helps anyone stay hydrated without the sugar and
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:18.360]   other dodgy ingredients found in popular electrolyte and sports drinks.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:23.040]   I've been enjoying Element for the past year because it's a zero sugar electrolyte
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:27.760]   drink mix born from the growing body of research revealing that optimal health
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:32.520]   outcomes occur at sodium levels two to three times government recommendations.
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.520]   Element is formulated for anyone on a mission to restore health through hydration and
[00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:43.520]   even works when you're fasting or on a keto, low carb, whole food or paleo diet.
[00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.440]   And while you can always enjoy Element Cold, their new chocolate medley, which
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.720]   includes chocolate mint, chocolate chai and chocolate raspberry, is actually
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.600]   designed to be enjoyed hot.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:59.800]   Element is used by everyone from Olympic athletes to Navy SEAL teams to everyday
[00:28:59.800 --> 00:29:00.400]   parents.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:04.800]   And if you're not sure it's for you, don't worry because Element offers no
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:08.840]   questions asked refunds, so you can try it totally risk-free.
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:13.600]   And right now, Element is offering a free sample pack with any purchase.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.760]   That's eight single serving packets free with any Element order.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.640]   This is a great way to try all eight flavors.
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.840]   Get yours at allthehacks.com/lmnt.
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:27.600]   This deal is only available through my link.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:33.080]   You must go to allthehacks.com/elementlmnt.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:39.840]   I love the concept of our and I think that's that's incredibly helpful.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:47.280]   To get more tactical, is there a tool for organizing this concept of moving to the
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.200]   80/80 marriage?
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.360]   Is there a spreadsheet?
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:55.360]   Are there other tools or sheets that you use in order to keep things organized and
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.760]   maintain that clarity around ownership and roles?
[00:29:58.760 --> 00:30:04.120]   There are actually a number of different exercises in the context of the book that
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.800]   allow you to do that sort of thing.
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:09.960]   We don't have a spreadsheet, although we did have somebody email us a spreadsheet,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.120]   which was like their detailed breakdown of roles.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:17.680]   But I think that what you can think about when it comes to these kinds of structures
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:23.200]   is building structure around any of those areas where you find you go into conflict
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:28.040]   or where you find it's an area that's more or less unconscious.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.880]   And I think that's one of the big shifts here is that for many of us, when we get
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.800]   into a relationship, we're coming from a place of unconsciousness and a lack of
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.760]   intentionality.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.560]   Things are just happening by accident.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.480]   When we would ask couples, how did you design your structure of roles?
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.400]   They would say, I don't know.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.080]   We just sort of winged it.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:52.360]   And so that actually became a technical term for us.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.240]   We call that the winged approach, which almost every couple we've ever met adopts.
[00:30:57.240 --> 00:30:58.400]   We certainly did.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:03.560]   And what we're doing with many of these different practices is we're going from
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:08.880]   that unconscious place of winging it, whether that's with roles or our priorities,
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:12.720]   where we're just saying yes to everything that comes in or our boundaries, where
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:15.320]   we're saying yes to everything and no to nothing.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.640]   We're shifting from that unconscious wing it approach to something that's more
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.840]   intentional, more conscious, more designed.
[00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.640]   And so I would say that's the key move.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.920]   And then the exercises are helpful for some couples.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:32.920]   It is helpful to have a detailed budget and spreadsheets and things like that.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:34.120]   For other couples, it's not.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:37.720]   But I think the key move is just bringing in that structure and greater
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:38.680]   intentionality.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:44.000]   I think there's also, in some ways, a silly tool that really complements this,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.240]   which is to name your team.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:50.800]   And this might have flashbacks to when you were at summer camp and you had to name
[00:31:50.800 --> 00:31:51.600]   your group of people.
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:56.800]   We've actually found it tremendously helpful as a way to differentiate between
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.600]   which entity we're talking about.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.720]   So our team name is Kajona.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:03.720]   It's just the first two letters of all of our names.
[00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:05.160]   We've got K-A for Kaylee.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:07.880]   We've got Joe for our daughter, and we've got N-A for Nate.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:12.280]   And we'll ask the question, what would be best for Kajona?
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:17.360]   And a simple example that actually was really profoundly life-changing for us
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:22.520]   was when she went to school and she was going to get off the bus at 3 p.m., Nate
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:25.120]   and I had a whole conversation about what we wanted to have happen.
[00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:30.000]   And what was best for me was for Nate to be available every day at 3 p.m.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:30.760]   to meet the bus.
[00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.720]   And what was best for Nate was for me to be available every day at 3 p.m.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.600]   to meet the bus. And we had really elaborate conversations about why it was
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:44.880]   individually best for each of us to have the other person do this task that
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.920]   neither of us wanted.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:50.880]   And we were going to get nowhere if we stayed in that winning for me mentality.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:55.360]   Then we were able to take a step back and ask the question, what's best for
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.400]   Kajona? And it included our daughter.
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.280]   It included the whole family unit.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.360]   It included some of the commitments that we've made.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:05.000]   And I'll let you talk about what happened.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:10.960]   I think with that alternative framing, we realized that I was in a place
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:13.840]   professionally at the time where I could go down to 80 percent.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:15.240]   It made sense for me.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:19.040]   Kaylee really needed to be working those hours.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:24.040]   And so all of a sudden, when we shifted the frame, the solution was obvious.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:28.680]   And I was actually excited about it, you know, even though it was a loss for me,
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:30.200]   I guess, on my side of the ledger.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:36.360]   But that is a just really powerful and simple example of how you can shift from
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:41.000]   asking what's best for me to what's best for us through a name that kind of
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.520]   orients you toward that.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:45.120]   The name itself pushes you toward that.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:49.920]   First of all, Chris, you and I need to come up with a pretty good family name
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   here. So that'll be task one.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:52.440]   I love it.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:54.880]   Our daughter's name is Quinn.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:33:58.800]   So if we take your approach, it's going to be a little tricky with the QU in
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.520]   there. It'll be a little tricky, but we're going to get back to you on our
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:07.600]   family name. But I think the question that stems from this whole bus
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:13.000]   conversation and conflict resolution that you all work through together is how
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.960]   does that change when life changes?
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:21.440]   So, for example, one of your roles may become more demanding at work for a
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:28.480]   shorter period of time or let's say I have a baby and clearly changes the
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:32.560]   time and availability I have to give towards the things that I previously was
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:39.280]   giving to. How does that work when shifts in life change and therefore your
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.800]   availability and schedule changes to the things that you previously committed to?
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:44.000]   How do you approach that?
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.240]   We like to think of life as happening in chapters.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:54.360]   And so having your values, having your priorities, having your boundaries, all
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.320]   of the things we say, what's our North Star?
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.360]   What are we saying yes to?
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.240]   What are we saying no to?
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.640]   And how are each of us going to show up in the relationship?
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:06.120]   You revisit it at each chapter.
[00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:12.520]   And a chapter could be we had a kid, a chapter could be one of us had a big
[00:35:12.520 --> 00:35:16.360]   shift in a job, a chapter could be our kids left.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.920]   Now we're empty nesters, a chapter could be now we live in a new city.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:26.200]   We moved. I think ideally, if it were only up to me, you would get to set your
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:29.000]   values, priorities, and it'd be a one and done.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:30.680]   You could just coast from there on out.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:33.280]   I like systems that you press play and they just happen.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.120]   That is not how this works in real life.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:41.920]   And so giving permission to revisit things at a different point in time, at a
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:47.360]   different chapter, or if you notice it's not working, that there's an invitation to
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   come back to things.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.120]   Hey, we thought this was going to be awesome.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:52.960]   Shoot, it didn't turn out the way that we had hoped.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.200]   Let's revisit it.
[00:35:54.200 --> 00:35:55.160]   Let's reconsider.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:01.360]   Amy, I think that there's a reality check that happens each point along the way.
[00:36:01.360 --> 00:36:07.920]   We also, I'll let you add to this if you want, we believe in outsourcing when it
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:12.680]   makes sense. And there are really skillful ways to do it, especially around things
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.960]   that create tension in the relationship.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.720]   So as if, for instance, the person who comes and helps us clean our house goes in
[00:36:19.720 --> 00:36:24.360]   marital well-being, that's the line item in the budget because we're so much
[00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:28.840]   happier as a couple when we're not fighting about whose turn it is to sweep the
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:31.000]   floor or to clean up whatever it might be.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:35.160]   And so giving yourselves permission to that in a different chapter, there might be
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:40.040]   things that you stop doing that you have someone else do for you or that just fall
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:42.360]   off the list because they're not as crucial anymore.
[00:36:42.360 --> 00:36:46.720]   So outsourcing is something that I think we've embraced, especially as we've had
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:50.000]   children. And earlier you said that you feel like you don't have time.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.080]   I genuinely think we have less time.
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:54.120]   Like the day must have shrunk.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:58.480]   I'm not sure, but I'm curious if there are things that you've seen people
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.640]   outsource or you've outsourced yourself that might not be obvious.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:06.280]   And one I've shared a few times is that we never really considered or knew about
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.200]   the fact that you could hire someone.
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.440]   And we literally hired someone off of Craigslist to cook food and drop it off
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.720]   twice, once or twice a week.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.720]   We started it twice.
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.960]   Now we're back to once and glass tupperware in the fridge.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:22.040]   You've got meals. That was crazy that we just never knew that was a thing.
[00:37:22.040 --> 00:37:27.360]   And when we ran out of time, it's it created a lot less conflict by not having
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.120]   to decide, similar to yours, who's going to get off work early enough to prep
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:36.000]   dinner because it turns out kids eat about the same time that senior citizens
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:39.040]   do. So we've got to stop work early.
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:42.280]   Are there other things that people outsource that you've seen cleaning and
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.200]   cooking are too, but I'd love to know the others so we can experiment.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.560]   I think there have been a couple of things that I'm not sure it's outsourcing
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:53.760]   per se, but that have really changed my experience of time.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.720]   And one is I often travel for work.
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:38:00.360]   And so the back and forth to the airport, I'm not sure why, but I had in my head
[00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.040]   that I should drive myself to the airport and giving myself permission where now
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:09.680]   I am always in a Lyft or an Uber on the way to and from the airport.
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:13.680]   I work in the back of the car or when my flights are late, I get to sleep in the
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:18.720]   back of the car. That freedom of time has been a huge unlock for me.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:22.320]   Just that driving home at one o'clock in the morning, I don't do the adrenaline
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:26.600]   filled hour to then wonder why I can't fall asleep when I walk through the door.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:31.680]   I think another one is around food, but a clever way of doing that when you have
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:35.000]   young kids. So I was just talking to a couple.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.560]   They have a one year old and they were having that same time crunch around.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.640]   We don't have enough time for cooking.
[00:38:42.640 --> 00:38:43.960]   We're not eating good food.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:48.840]   And they had hired a nanny and they realized they had never asked if she cooked
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.760]   and it turned out she loved to cook.
[00:38:50.760 --> 00:38:56.280]   And it was like she wanted to actually spend the afternoons planning meals
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:58.480]   and getting food prepared for the evening.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:03.000]   So that was one where there was an interesting synergy between them and the care
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:07.600]   provider that allowed them to now have meals cooked for them every evening.
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.040]   So I think there are a lot of clever things like that that are probably going to be
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.600]   different for each family.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:17.040]   But there's absolutely so much room for creativity around outsourcing.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.920]   That's amazing. This just reminded me of something a friend of mine told that is
[00:39:20.920 --> 00:39:21.880]   probably another good one.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:26.480]   He had a nanny and they had all of these people.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:30.240]   Someone yesterday was telling me, it's like once you move to the suburbs and sorry
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:33.360]   to be gender normative, I guess he was like, you just have a guy for everything.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:36.680]   You got a lawn care guy, you got the sprinkler guy, you got this.
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:41.200]   And he was talking to his nanny and he was like, gosh, the nanny knows the most about
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.600]   the family. They're in the house every day.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.120]   They know everything. And one day, I don't remember how it clicked.
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:51.000]   But he found out that the nanny would be interested in making a little extra money
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.400]   and managing all of those things.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:57.320]   So that person now is like, I will make sure that the cleaner comes on a day that
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.120]   works. I will make sure that the yard people are here.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.840]   I'll tell them to text me.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.920]   I'll make sure that we send them the PayPal when it's up.
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:10.160]   And it was like they basically and it was she wanted to do it.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:12.440]   They basically had this kind of household manager.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:17.080]   But to find someone that wants to do all that for a couple hours a week is probably
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:19.720]   pretty difficult because they have to learn so much about you.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:24.720]   So if there's anyone in your family that's if you have child care, that could be an
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.800]   unlock if they're interested.
[00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:30.520]   I think that the through line that's really powerful is being willing to ask the
[00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:35.360]   question, are you interested in, hey, is this thing important to you?
[00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.600]   Hey, would you be deeply offended if we dropped off all of our laundry at the
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   laundromat and they folded it and cleaned it for us?
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.360]   Or are you OK with that?
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:47.000]   Just I think there are sometimes internal obstacles around what we think is possible
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.640]   or what somebody might be interested in.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:54.120]   And then random non sequitur aside, I think a huge time saving that occurred in my
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.960]   life is I recognize that I have a black thumb.
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:41:01.680]   And so I stopped trying to have plants live in our house and instead just bought fake
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:03.080]   ones. I like how they look.
[00:41:03.080 --> 00:41:07.480]   I'm delighted to have them around and giving myself permission to not have to keep it
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:11.240]   alive was it was really actually psychologically soothing.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:17.200]   Kaylee, we are clearly cut from the same cloth because for the last several years, I
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:22.520]   would bring home even something as robust as a bamboo or a succulent.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:27.600]   And somehow months later, it's just shriveled up brown and dead.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.760]   Yeah. And finally, Chris was like, it does not make sense for us to continue spending
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:36.680]   money. When you end up with this heartache of everything dying, you throw it out months
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.160]   later and you replace it all over.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:44.880]   So thanks to Ikea, Amazon and a variety of other websites, we now have a bunch of very
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:47.000]   good looking fake plants.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.160]   And you're right, it still gives that really nice, soothing vibe to the room.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.040]   But it's very relaxing for me because it's zero maintenance.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.080]   The alternative was to get a plant guy.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:41:59.760]   And I was like, no, that's way too expensive.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:00.840]   We don't need a plant guy.
[00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:03.200]   There are limits. There are limits to how many guys.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:08.240]   And there's a principle here that I think is really important that is itself a hack.
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:13.640]   We have this exercise that we call the life report card exercise, which is really about
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:18.440]   priorities. And the idea is, imagine you were going to grade yourself on all of your
[00:42:18.440 --> 00:42:23.480]   various life endeavors, work and community service and parenting and all these
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:28.960]   different things. And the exercise isn't just a grade where you're getting A's and
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:35.160]   B's, but it's actually to shift your life report card so that you intentionally get
[00:42:35.160 --> 00:42:39.560]   more F's and D's and C's, which is kind of what you were saying.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:45.960]   You were unintentionally failing in cultivating greenery and plants in your house, and
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.560]   then you made the shift to intentionally fail to just say, you know what, I'm going to
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.240]   get an intentional F in that.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.840]   I'm not going to put much energy into it anymore.
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:58.720]   And now I'm going to free up all this energy for other things in my life that really
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:04.760]   matter to me. And so that itself is this amazing hack, because so many of us are
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:09.480]   spending so much time and energy trying to do things that we're maybe not good at,
[00:43:09.480 --> 00:43:13.840]   that are not really adding much value to our lives, that we're doing for reasons of
[00:43:13.840 --> 00:43:16.960]   like historical accident or just obligation.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:22.600]   And so intentionally failing can be another really powerful practice in marriage and in
[00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:22.960]   life.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.160]   I love that concept.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:27.520]   For many people listening, they'll go home and they'll implement some of this and
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.440]   they'll start being much more radically generous.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:34.360]   But then let's say six, nine months from now, life's getting really busy.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:36.920]   It's so easy to fall into those old habits.
[00:43:36.920 --> 00:43:44.280]   How do you stay aware or present in the moment right before you're keeping score when
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:45.640]   it's not top of mind?
[00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:49.080]   What tactics do you have for people to keep this going for the long haul?
[00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:54.960]   The idea of making it structurally part of your life is really valuable.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:44:01.480]   So while you're on the post podcast, post reading the book high, putting that calendar
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:05.280]   reminder there every Thursday at 3 p.m.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.120]   or starting the practice where when you sit down for dinner, you start with an
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:16.240]   appreciation, building that in so that it becomes something that you just expect is a
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:19.000]   really good way to give it legs and give it some longevity.
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:25.400]   There's also a piece that you're naming, which is around presence or mindfulness, that
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:33.160]   this work is easier if you have a practice of being able to take a deep breath, see
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:37.760]   yourself in the moment and then choose how you're going to respond rather than just
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.280]   reacting. So in that moment where you're doing the dishes after you've already made
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:47.400]   the meal, after you're the one who unloaded the dishwasher and got everything ready and
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:51.640]   you look around and you think to yourself, wait a second, this is not fair at all.
[00:44:51.640 --> 00:44:57.520]   To be able to take that deep breath and reveal, hey, I'd love some help in the kitchen
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:03.200]   right now versus attacking your partner also helps it be sticky.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:09.440]   There's another habit I would add to that, which is carving out space for connection.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.080]   And there are a lot of different ways to do this.
[00:45:11.080 --> 00:45:15.520]   You could do the micro space where it's 15 minutes at the end of the day.
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:20.400]   There's date night, which we hear about all the time, especially for parents.
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:24.920]   But then there's if you have the opportunity spending a day together or a weekend
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:30.600]   together. And what we find is that the momentum of life is such that it's often very
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:35.720]   difficult to have these conversations about, hey, how can we win more as a team?
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.440]   What do our values look like?
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:39.640]   What are our priorities? Where are we not living up to those?
[00:45:39.640 --> 00:45:42.320]   Where can we make some adjustments in everyday life?
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:46.240]   There's so much happening that that conversation really isn't even on the table.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.920]   But when you can carve out a little bit of space from the craziness of modern life, you
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:57.120]   know, a day or even just an evening, having that become a regular pattern gets you in
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:00.880]   that mindset of taking a step back, seeing the bigger picture.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:02.920]   So I think that can also be really valuable.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   I would very much agree with that.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.760]   I think one of the things that Chris took away, Chris and I took away after reading
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:15.640]   your book, and it's been incredibly helpful, is this concept of weekly scheduled date
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.080]   nights and these short weekend getaways.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:25.480]   So actually in about a weekend or two, we are doing a short just the two of us trip
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:29.040]   down to Southern California just to enjoy the sun and the two of us for a bit.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.160]   So those things have have definitely helped.
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:35.680]   I'm curious, though, because, Kaylee, you had mentioned the concept of presence.
[00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:41.360]   And I think one of the things that for me certainly is very challenging is we've carved
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:45.680]   out these special moments for the two of us, whether it's a date night or a weekend
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:52.960]   away. But you have these very regular touch points, for example, at dinnertime, where
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:59.960]   with technology now playing so deeply into our lives, it's easy to shift that focus
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:03.600]   towards work emails because now we all work from home.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:05.000]   Work never really ends.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:08.040]   And now you're multitasking, you're on technology.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:16.120]   And I find it incredibly hard to stay present and focused on the 80/80 piece of it.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:19.800]   And some of these pretty critical moments because they happen so frequently.
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:25.920]   So I'm curious to get your perspective on how you feel technology has shifted people's
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.680]   ability to stay present in these moments.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.400]   Technology has definitely made it harder.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:37.120]   You are not alone in being tempted by your phone at approximately every hour of every
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:41.680]   day. The dopamine that we get from that moment, if someone needs me or I'm important
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:45.080]   or there's a notification, is addictive by design.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:52.400]   And so one of the main things that we recommend for couples is to put your phone away
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:55.520]   because it's so hard to multitask.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:58.680]   I would argue it's impossible to be present with your partner and present with
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.000]   something that's happening on your phone simultaneously.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:05.920]   And it's actually one of the things that was in our interviews really sad to hear from
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:09.680]   people. Hey, so every night we crawl in bed at the same time and we both get on our
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.760]   phones and I'm scrolling Instagram and he's doing scrolling the news.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:17.280]   And we don't have a conversation because we're each on our own device doing our own
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   thing. And so a couple of things that we highly recommend.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.360]   Number one, kick your phone out of the bedroom.
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:27.760]   It's much more likely that you'll have a meaningful conversation, that there will be
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.360]   intimacy if your phone is not there.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:36.000]   The second is if you can kick your phone out of whether it's date night, we actually do
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:40.320]   a date hike and we'll drop our daughter off at her grandparents' house.
[00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:44.840]   And I would say like 95 percent of the time I leave my phone behind.
[00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:50.880]   And I do that because I am not good at staying present if my phone is there buzzing in
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:55.800]   my pocket. Only once was there a medical emergency when I didn't have my phone and was
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:57.880]   off on date hike and it turned out to be fine.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.560]   Somebody else picked up when the person called and my mom ended up being totally fine.
[00:49:02.560 --> 00:49:06.400]   But there was that moment like, see, I should never leave my phone back again.
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:07.960]   My mom needed me and I wasn't there.
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:13.120]   She was fine. And for that 90 minutes after date hike, there was a level of connection
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:17.760]   that isn't possible when we're trying to be two places at once and are there for
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:22.720]   nowhere. We also learned from one of our interviews, there was a couple that told us
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:27.240]   about asking permission, which initially I thought was a crazy idea.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:30.560]   But we will now do this when we can.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:34.760]   We don't always do this, but what it looks like is, hey, is now a good time for me to
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:36.800]   send this text as we're driving together?
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:40.240]   Or hey, is now a good time for me to order these plane tickets as we drive together or
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:41.240]   whatever it might be?
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   But just having an actual conversation before you just habitually jump onto your
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:51.440]   device can be really powerful and lets your partner into the decision.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:56.920]   I think that happens a ton on date night, too, where you're in a conversation, perhaps
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.640]   you're envisioning a vacation that you're going to take together, you know, whatever
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:03.320]   your QX couple's trip is going to be.
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:08.440]   And there's a temptation because you can make it happen right then to at date night
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:13.000]   right then, book the hotel, book the plane tickets, make sure that everything is set.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.080]   And it actually takes you out of the intimacy of the moment that you have with your
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.480]   partner then. And if you ask permission, hey, do we want to handle this right now?
[00:50:21.480 --> 00:50:23.080]   I think it's going to take seven minutes.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.240]   That might be a choice, but at least then it's conscious versus unconscious.
[00:50:27.240 --> 00:50:31.440]   I love that. There's one thing in there that I took that I thought about, which was we
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:34.800]   do that sometimes where I'm like, OK, we're going to leave my phone or one of us.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.160]   And when our daughter's 18 months and sometimes it's hard, but when you come back
[00:50:39.160 --> 00:50:44.520]   and you're like, all of a sudden you have 10 emails instead of taking my phone out and
[00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:47.840]   ending up on the news or ending up on like social media or something, I'm actually
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.440]   doing the thing. I get home like, oh, now I have 10 emails, not just one.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:54.560]   And so it kind of like took the small blips of, oh, what's that?
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:59.360]   Oh, what's that? To a gold mine of things, whether it's, you know, something happened.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:05.160]   And the other thing was I talked to another author named Nir Eyal, who wrote a book
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:08.400]   called Indistractable in, I think, episode 25.
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:11.200]   And it was all about how to avoid distraction.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:16.440]   But one of the interesting things that I think can apply to a lot of what we discussed is
[00:51:16.440 --> 00:51:21.880]   that when you hit that moment of anything that's uncomfortable and default, like I'm
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:27.080]   going to go scroll my phone early on, when you're on the high after listening to this
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.920]   or reading the book, just pause for a moment and feel it.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:32.960]   And it makes it easier to understand it in the future.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:37.320]   So if you're unloading the dishwasher after making breakfast, after walking the dog and
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.960]   you're feeling frustrated, it's like pause and like it sounds a little crazy.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:46.600]   And Nate, you might have better tactics with all your mindfulness experience, but feel
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:52.280]   what it feels like to have that frustration, to have that urge so that you can better
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:53.680]   identify it in the future.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.280]   I love that. And you're right.
[00:51:55.280 --> 00:51:57.360]   This is mindfulness in a nutshell.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:03.280]   It's instead of following the stream of habit, which is what we normally do when we feel
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.560]   something uncomfortable, taking that moment to stay.
[00:52:06.560 --> 00:52:13.440]   And what I like to do is to notice where is this happening in my body so that I get out
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.840]   of the thought stream, because if you're mind wandering about what's happening, that
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.560]   usually leads you out of the present moment.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:23.040]   So can I locate this in my body and can I notice that it's changing?
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:28.120]   Can I notice that the discomfort I'm feeling, the anxiety, if you really look carefully,
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:32.600]   there's an impermanence to it and a flow to it and a shifting to it.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:37.920]   And that can be really powerful for learning how to just stay in those moments.
[00:52:37.920 --> 00:52:44.000]   And then like you, Chris, I love the idea of the sort of like double dopamine hit.
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:46.120]   And this is something I've been doing lately.
[00:52:46.120 --> 00:52:47.800]   One of my it's not a marriage hack.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:49.040]   It's just sort of a life hack.
[00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:55.320]   Like you, I'm very interested in crypto and I have my own issues with news addiction and
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:53:00.520]   I could easily spend most of my day just looking at various financial things in the news.
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:06.040]   And so what I've done is given myself permission to do that when the clock says p.m., but
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:07.600]   not when the clock says a.m.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:13.440]   And so when the clock says a.m., that's my time to stay with the discomfort.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:18.560]   But when the clock says p.m., I give myself free reign so that I'm not living in this
[00:53:18.560 --> 00:53:22.920]   kind of restrictive zone of no, never, never check the news, never check the crypto
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:27.120]   markets. But still, I'm restricting myself enough that I have that space for
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:31.440]   mindfulness. I like having these rules where it's like I'm telling my brain I can do
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:36.120]   this, just not now, because as much as we like to think that we're logical and rational,
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.720]   like sometimes our brains just aren't.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.200]   It's like I'm logical, but my brain's not logical in this moment.
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.080]   So being able to say, OK, for me, it's eating sweets.
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.840]   And Amy has all the self-control and I have none.
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:51.880]   And the thing that worked was saying, I can have a cookie.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:56.080]   And I think this was a hack, I can't remember who said it, but it's going to be in five
[00:53:56.080 --> 00:54:00.520]   minutes. So you don't say no, you just give yourself permission to do it later.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.680]   And that urge subsides.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:06.400]   By the time five minutes comes around, I'm writing an email, I'm doing something, I'm on
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.040]   a walk and I don't need the cookie.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:12.920]   But my brain allows me to say no if I say yes in the future.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.440]   I don't understand it.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.880]   There's probably a neuroscientist who could explain it better, but it works for me.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:23.560]   There's a really crazy reciprocal hack, which is if you give yourself permission to quit
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:29.960]   exercising at the 10 minute mark, that most of the time, if you set aside whatever it
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:32.680]   is, your half an hour that you're going to exercise, but you give yourself permission.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:35.160]   If I hate this at five minutes, I could quit.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:37.440]   Or if I hate this at 10 minutes, I could quit.
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:41.720]   Most of the time you finish the workout because I'm already there, I'm already doing it.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.840]   The endorphins finally hit and you keep going.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:44.620]   Love it.
[00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:46.240]   You just said reciprocal.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:51.360]   So there's one, this is a bit of a segue, but it's something we talked about briefly.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.080]   It's easy when we're both like, yeah, let's do this.
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:54:55.320]   We're both on board.
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:55:00.080]   What happens when someone's not on board or was on board and has fallen off board?
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:03.680]   We, in some ways, are a case study of how this works.
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   When we got married, we were 26.
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:09.440]   Kaylee had a job at Deloitte, a consulting firm.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:10.880]   She managed her finances.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.640]   She had a 401k.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:18.560]   I was a grad student at Princeton who lived in a dorm and cleaned it like twice a year.
[00:55:18.560 --> 00:55:20.680]   And so that was our entry point.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.240]   And as a result, she became the over-contributor.
[00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:26.120]   I became the under-contributor.
[00:55:26.120 --> 00:55:28.640]   She was the one interested in working on our marriage.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:31.280]   I was the one who thought that was a total waste of time.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:39.000]   And so it created this dynamic, which we call the reluctant partner dynamic, where one of the
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.200]   partners is super engaged and enthusiastic, and the other one is very reluctant.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:51.080]   And what we found, and this is like a 10 or 15 year case study, so it has a happy ending.
[00:55:51.080 --> 00:55:56.000]   But what we found is that both of us had to look at our part in the dynamic.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.960]   So I'll tell you what my part was, and maybe Kaylee can tell you what her part was.
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:08.040]   My part was that I had this kind of unwillingness to lean in and contribute more or become
[00:56:08.040 --> 00:56:11.760]   curious about ways in which I might become more engaged in the relationship.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:16.840]   And I heard her feedback as constant nagging.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:21.680]   And I responded in this very passive-aggressive way where I said, "You know what?
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:25.760]   It turns out anything I do is not enough, so I'm just not going to do anything."
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.080]   And that became the pattern.
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:30.440]   That was certainly the way I contributed to the pattern.
[00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:36.160]   Seeing my part was a really big deal because I set it up where I would ask him to do
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.040]   something, he wouldn't do it the way that I wanted him to do it.
[00:56:39.040 --> 00:56:43.000]   So I would either redo it or I would nag him to do it the way that I wanted him to do it.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:49.920]   And I can't imagine why he was so frustrated with the way that I was giving space for him to do things.
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.400]   I feel you.
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:51.160]   I feel you, Nate.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:59.240]   And so it was actually a really profound shift for us to take a look at where we were doing
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:03.440]   things and to actually give full ownership of things that I historically had owned and
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:09.000]   micromanaged and to say, "I trust you to do it differently from me," and to actually
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:10.200]   empower him to do so.
[00:57:10.200 --> 00:57:14.760]   So finances is an interesting example where I was a bit more of the Chris in our
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:17.560]   relationship, that I quite like it when things reconcile.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:21.640]   And I like being in the spreadsheet and in the details and knowing exactly what the
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.480]   purchase was.
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:28.120]   And then I was mad at Nate all the time early on because he was making these purchases.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:29.240]   I didn't know what they were.
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:33.440]   I felt like he was being irresponsible, but I actually gave him no insight and no power
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.400]   and no ability to do anything differently.
[00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:40.760]   And so for us to make the shift where I actually turned over our personal finances to
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:45.360]   Nate and said, "Let me show you all the systems that I've been using for however many
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:49.360]   years that I've been doing it," and to let there be ways that he did things really
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:55.400]   differently, owning my part and saying, "If I control it, I can't be mad about the
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:59.040]   resistance. If I'm willing to let go, can I also empower with the tools rather
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.320]   than just expecting him to read my mind?"
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:06.960]   Which is a side note, I find that expecting partners to read our minds is one of the
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.880]   fastest ways to have conflict.
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:11.360]   Our ESP is just terrible.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:16.320]   And yet the reliability of, "What do you mean you didn't know?" as an excuse or as
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.240]   an accusation is really fascinating.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:24.160]   So if one person's really in and the other person's not, we think that owning how
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:28.120]   you're creating your own experience can really shift the dynamic.
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:34.880]   Super, super tactically, we think that you can stealth bring in 80/80 to your
[00:58:34.880 --> 00:58:41.240]   relationship by using some of the exercises that in some ways the 80/80 marriage book
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:47.080]   you can use as ideas for ways that you can, if you want to use hacks, sort of like hack
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.960]   in to how your marriage system is working.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.360]   Your partner might not be psyched.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:56.680]   And Amy, I thought it was so interesting that Chris brought the book home and you
[00:58:56.680 --> 00:58:59.360]   thought, "Oh no, something's wrong."
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:04.400]   We heard that over and over in a way that was completely fascinating.
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.960]   Nace written New York Times was selling mindfulness books.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.760]   I've written leadership books and people like to show them to us.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:12.800]   "Look, I have the 15 commitments on my bookshelf."
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:18.160]   But you bring in a marriage book and people start to go, "Oh, are we okay?"
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:23.240]   And so sometimes handing them a book can feel a little scary.
[00:59:23.240 --> 00:59:25.400]   Instead, you can just do an exercise.
[00:59:25.800 --> 00:59:27.280]   "Hey, I was reading this book.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.680]   It had an exercise around priorities.
[00:59:29.680 --> 00:59:32.640]   It feels like we're both really overwhelmed.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:37.480]   What do you think about sitting down and doing this exercise around a life report
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:38.960]   card where we try to get Fs?
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.120]   That could be kind of fun."
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:44.520]   And after they've done something where there's a positive outcome, they're more
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.400]   willing to engage in some of the concepts or some of the other pieces that bring the
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:49.240]   whole thing together.
[00:59:49.240 --> 00:59:52.800]   That's a very good takeaway.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:57.400]   There are definitely things that I think out of the gate, from a pure
[00:59:57.400 --> 01:00:02.040]   communication perspective, I realized are just minor tweaks that made a
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:07.800]   significant difference, but there are clearly some really good, as you call it,
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:13.120]   hacks or as Chris lives by hacks or tactics that we can certainly apply and
[01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.160]   hopefully that those listening can apply as well.
[01:00:15.160 --> 01:00:21.480]   Sometimes the smallest changes make the biggest impact and Trade Coffee is a
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:23.760]   great addition to your new year routine.
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:26.360]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:30.440]   Trade is a subscription service we've been using for over a year that sources
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:34.880]   the best coffee across the country and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[01:00:34.880 --> 01:00:39.160]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters, so you can enjoy their
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:43.560]   craft from the comfort of your own home at a fraction of the cost of going out
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:44.200]   for coffee.
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:47.400]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.200]   Sign up for a subscription or try one of their starter packs today.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:55.600]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee just show up exactly when we need
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:55.800]   it.
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:01:00.280]   And over the past year, we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade, but this
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:04.880]   last bag of beans from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe, it's called Bark the
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.760]   Moon, and it's so delicious.
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:10.280]   So jumpstart this year by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:14.760]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag with select subscription plans when you
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.840]   visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:23.400]   That's allthehacks.com/trade for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:25.920]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:30.560]   How do you feel about your finances right this second?
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:34.000]   Research shows that if you're like 90% of Americans, you most
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:35.480]   likely have money anxiety.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:39.600]   In fact, that is one of the reasons I started a financial planning firm back in
[01:01:39.600 --> 01:01:40.560]   2016.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:44.200]   And when we shut the company down, we did extensive research on the financial
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.400]   service company we wanted to recommend to our clients, and we landed on Facet,
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.720]   and I'm excited they're sponsoring today's episode.
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:55.520]   Facet has turned the financial planning industry on its head, making financial
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:58.720]   planning accessible to everyone, not just the most wealthy.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.440]   And one of the things I hated about this industry is that so many financial
[01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:06.640]   advisors charge based on a high percentage of your assets, but not Facet.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:11.400]   They only charge a flat annual membership fee, which means you actually keep more
[01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:12.400]   of what you invest.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:17.120]   And they match you with your own CFP professional who uses industry leading
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:21.440]   technology and is backed by a team of experts across investments, taxes, and
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:21.800]   more.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:26.760]   So tackle the uncertainty you're feeling about your finances and replace it with
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.480]   some real confidence about your money.
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:31.320]   Go to allthehacks.com/facet.
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:33.240]   That's F-A-C-E-T.
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.400]   I made sure to let them know you're on your way and they'll even waive the $250
[01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.960]   enrollment fee for all of you.
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:43.760]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/facet, F-A-C-E-T.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.960]   Don't leave your finances up to chance.
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:48.520]   Facet Wealth is an SEC registered investment advisor.
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.000]   This is not an offer to buy or sell securities, nor is it investment, legal,
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:52.840]   or tax advice.
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:55.560]   Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.160]   Terms and conditions may apply.
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:03:02.240]   I just want to thank you quick for listening to and supporting the show.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:05.080]   Your support is what keeps this show going.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:10.120]   To get all of the URLs, codes, deals, and discounts from our partners, you can
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:13.040]   go to allthehacks.com/deals.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.480]   So please consider supporting those who support us.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:19.800]   Is there a thing to do to catch yourself?
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.400]   I think we're both, I would say, somewhat type A.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.680]   When there's something to do, we both definitely have an opinion on how to do
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:26.880]   it.
[01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:33.560]   And so how do you share that feedback without frustrating the other person, I
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:33.800]   guess?
[01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:36.760]   It's like, "Oh, you're not doing it the way I wanted you to do it."
[01:03:36.760 --> 01:03:39.280]   And the default is to tell someone.
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:41.960]   And then that person often says, "Why am I even doing this?"
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.520]   The experience Nate had.
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:46.400]   One option, as you mentioned, is to just completely give away control.
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:50.640]   But there are some things where, whether it's cleanliness, the level of
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:54.840]   cleanliness, or the variety of food, as we talked earlier, there's a lot of
[01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:55.640]   examples.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:04:00.880]   How do you, without giving control completely, constructively give feedback
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   in those circumstances?
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:06.200]   We have a practice that we call reveal and request, which I think is really
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.000]   helpful here.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:12.160]   And it's counter to the way we normally offer feedback in a relationship.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:17.560]   So we were just talking this morning on our walk before this about how, in
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:23.640]   relationships, our default mode is when something goes wrong, we point our
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:27.360]   finger at the other person, and there's some form of blame or criticism that
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:28.240]   goes along with it.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.040]   Here's just an example.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.120]   We were on a radio show that was talking about the 80/80 marriage.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:35.400]   And I thought this was so cool.
[01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:37.920]   And I was waiting all day to play this for Kaylee.
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:40.400]   And she came into the kitchen.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.240]   I told her about it.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:43.880]   She walked away before I could even play it for her.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.960]   And I felt, like, totally disappointed.
[01:04:45.960 --> 01:04:49.400]   Like, I had this great surprise that I was about to reveal, and she just left.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:55.240]   And the default for me in that moment was to be like, "I can't believe you
[01:04:55.240 --> 01:04:56.440]   just walked away.
[01:04:56.440 --> 01:04:57.880]   You always do this.
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.000]   You're too busy.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:00.560]   You need to slow down at work.
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:01.840]   You need to be more present.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:03.960]   It was all about you, you, you, you, you."
[01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:09.440]   And so the idea of reveal and request is a way of giving feedback where we start
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:12.440]   with our own individual experience in that moment.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:16.960]   So I actually believe that I was able to shift in that particular moment, where
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:22.600]   what that looks like is, "Hey, I was waiting all day to share this with you.
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:28.360]   And I just feel sad that you walked away and I didn't get to play this for you."
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.320]   "Can you come up in five minutes?"
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:32.400]   Or, "Can I play this for you now?"
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:37.160]   And it's a reversal in the way that we usually give feedback in the sense that
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:42.480]   you're leading with vulnerability and what we often call an inarguable truth,
[01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:47.080]   which is just, "I feel sad," or, "I feel irritated," or, "I feel anxious,"
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.360]   whatever's happening in your body and your experience.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:56.600]   So we found that that's a really powerful way to give feedback that's really
[01:05:56.600 --> 01:06:00.640]   different from judgment and criticism and the way that we're generally giving
[01:06:00.640 --> 01:06:03.400]   feedback in life, that we're almost wired to give feedback.
[01:06:03.400 --> 01:06:07.880]   It requires a little bit more self-awareness in the moment.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.920]   So hence, the pause is really useful.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:15.880]   A different example with the same theme, I was really anxious and I'm walking
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:20.840]   around the house and I realized clutter is not acceptable in this present state
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:25.520]   of anxiety, but rather than picking up everybody's stuff with an air of
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:29.280]   resentment and throwing it in whatever room I thought that it should belong in
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:32.000]   or throwing it in the garbage, which I have been known to do.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Instead, I revealed and said, "I'm feeling really anxious.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.960]   Clutter is adding to my anxiety.
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.720]   You could really help me out today by picking up a couple of the things that
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:47.880]   are around, especially those that I might step on in the kitchen."
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:53.160]   And that let Nate, that let our daughter show up in a way that was so loving to
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:57.080]   me and that didn't turn into the like, "Mom, you suck."
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:00.440]   Or the like, "Seriously, you need to handle yourself."
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:01.320]   I'm really curious.
[01:07:01.320 --> 01:07:06.320]   We've been talking a lot about some of the tactics and the mentalities and
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.160]   mindsets that go behind 80/80.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:12.680]   I'm curious, why is the book not a 100/100 marriage?
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:16.800]   We thought long and hard about that because we had the same idea.
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.960]   If it's really about radical generosity and we're really trying to uproot our
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:26.000]   position in fairness and 50/50, then why not go all the way to 100/100?
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:33.040]   And the reason we advocate for something more like 80/80 is that we think it's
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:38.080]   actually really important to carve out some space for yourself and that there's
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.520]   a way of underdoing radical generosity, which is what most of us do, but there's
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:42.800]   also a way of overdoing it.
[01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:48.440]   So for instance, we talked to one individual who was a man who told us that
[01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:54.920]   he was so giving in his marriage that he felt like he just got on this bus, and
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:59.280]   the bus was marriage, and then the bus was kids, and then the bus was a career
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:03.320]   that he didn't really enjoy, and he felt like he gave it all away.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:04.440]   He had no purpose.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:11.120]   And so we think it is really important to have your own sense of purpose, your own
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:13.200]   projects that you find really interesting.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:18.320]   I really enjoy playing Frisbee golf, which is super weird and random, but I
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:21.480]   don't expect that Kaylee's going to be out on the Frisbee golf course with me
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:22.000]   every day.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   That's part of that space that's carved out for me.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:32.440]   So that's really why we call it 80/80, is that there is something really powerful
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:36.000]   and important about our own individual pursuits that we want to preserve.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:40.840]   Yeah, we definitely have a few of those, but coming back to the 80/80 part and at
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:46.960]   the risk of needing to mark this episode explicit, at least with iTunes, I want to
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.200]   touch on the topic of sex.
[01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:50.160]   You have a whole chapter on the book about it.
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.720]   You haven't mentioned it once.
[01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:55.000]   You could have easily written this book without dedicating a chapter to it.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:55.880]   So I'm really curious.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:59.080]   You mentioned a few things about scheduling intimacy.
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:00.880]   Not everything has to be spontaneous.
[01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:04.760]   Would you talk about that chapter and what led you to put it in the book?
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:10.000]   When we thought about writing this book, we realized sex is an essential part of
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:10.880]   this whole equation.
[01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.960]   And we have used the word intimacy, which is kind of a code word that we've been
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.000]   using, but now we're going to go full out, call it sex.
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:22.640]   And what I would say just to set this up is that we live in a culture where the
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:27.600]   predominant viewpoint on sex is that if it's not good or you want to have more and
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.200]   better sex, you need to resort to all sorts of tactics.
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:33.920]   I think Cosmo Magazine is a great example of this.
[01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:38.560]   They have all these articles about five ways to have sex in a pool and five ways
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:41.520]   to pleasure your spouse, right?
[01:09:41.520 --> 01:09:46.640]   And they are selling a worldview that says basically the only thing holding you back
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:53.840]   from amazing intimacy is a bunny shaped vibrator or an orgasm cream or some
[01:09:53.840 --> 01:09:54.880]   Tantra class.
[01:09:54.880 --> 01:09:59.760]   And I think that there is a sliver of truth in that, but we take a very
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:04.480]   different perspective, which is that sex is a reflection of the rest of your life.
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:09.400]   So we have a line in there from a sex expert we interviewed where he said, "The
[01:10:09.400 --> 01:10:11.560]   way you do sex is the way you do life."
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:13.480]   That it's like a mirror image.
[01:10:14.120 --> 01:10:20.320]   And what we think that means is that if you are living a life that's very
[01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:26.160]   unconscious together, where you feel constant resentment, that is going to show
[01:10:26.160 --> 01:10:27.680]   up in your sex.
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:33.000]   And likewise, if you're able to make this shift to more intentional structures and a
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.400]   mindset of radical generosity, all of these things that you're doing on the
[01:10:37.400 --> 01:10:42.160]   mindset and structure side of 80/80 are also going to show up because you're going
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:46.960]   to be more connected and that will be mirrored in your intimacy.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.080]   And so there are some practices there.
[01:10:49.080 --> 01:10:49.680]   Do you want to jump in?
[01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.600]   Well, I was going to say mostly the exact same thing.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:56.480]   When we're thinking about sex and the reflection that it is on your life, it's
[01:10:56.480 --> 01:11:02.120]   really interesting to just do a quick survey of how you're showing up in the
[01:11:02.120 --> 01:11:03.040]   line at Costco.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.640]   Are you laughing?
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:05.680]   Is it playful?
[01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:07.840]   Does it feel like each of you knows what you're doing?
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.760]   Do you care how your partner is feeling?
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:13.600]   That that will get reflected, that there can be, and in the book we talk quite
[01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:16.000]   about about this, there can be check the box sex.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:16.800]   It's Thursday.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:21.560]   We should probably get that done versus, hey, you're the person who I want to be
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:21.800]   with.
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:24.800]   And on our date, we're talking about things that matter.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:27.040]   And there's attention and care.
[01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:31.560]   Then it's much more likely you're going to have attentive and caring sex.
[01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:35.400]   I think there's some tactics, too, because that's what you're asking about.
[01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:39.000]   So this is a really interesting tactic that's that's out there in the Instagram
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.840]   world and marriage and relationships that a lot of people swear by, which is
[01:11:42.840 --> 01:11:44.240]   these sex challenges.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:50.280]   So a lot of couples will commit to having sex seven times, seven days in a row for
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.840]   a week or a month, or some couples have done it for a year.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.320]   What's interesting about that is it takes away the question, are we going to do it?
[01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:00.120]   It's just, oh, we're committing for seven days.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:00.680]   We're going to do it.
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:03.240]   So that's an interesting tactic.
[01:12:03.240 --> 01:12:08.640]   The other one that I think is really important is just a big issue around
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.480]   intimacy for most couples is drive discrepancy.
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:16.760]   And there's actually there's a technical term in psychology for this sexual drive
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:18.360]   discrepancy, SDD.
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:22.880]   What that means is that in most couples, there's a high drive and a low drive
[01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:28.920]   partner. And there's some really interesting power dynamics there around who's
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.240]   initiating, who's saying no.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:35.920]   And so one of the things that this sounds insignificant, but it's really powerful.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:41.960]   If you are the higher drive partner and you're trying to initiate and your partner
[01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:44.920]   says no, there's a sting to that.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:50.560]   But if your partner says not tonight, but tomorrow night, yes.
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:58.680]   That shift between a pure no and a no with a plan can be like life changing.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.560]   I mean, it just lands very differently for the high drive partner.
[01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:07.680]   So that's another tactic that couples could consider is like, how do we play with
[01:13:07.680 --> 01:13:09.960]   this power dynamic of high and low drive?
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:13.800]   There's also just the ways that you signal to each other.
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.520]   So if you're having this conversation in front of your kids, you can develop a code
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.840]   like, hey, do you want to have tacos?
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:24.200]   And if your kid overhears, they're like for dinner on Saturday.
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:25.680]   Why? What were you talking about?
[01:13:25.680 --> 01:13:29.360]   But it gives you a way to start to initiate the conversation or use signals with each
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:31.960]   other. Hey, did we light the candles in the room?
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:35.920]   That might be a signal to your partner so that they can start to get excited.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:40.760]   We also really like the idea of signaling to your partner as early in the day as you
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:47.040]   can send them a text, start the feeling set around sex early.
[01:13:47.040 --> 01:13:49.720]   So it's in some ways like extended foreplay.
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:55.280]   So if you can go from relationship advice to sex advice and you're clearly the types
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:56.400]   of people that optimize, right?
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   You wrote a whole book about it.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:58.800]   You interviewed hundreds of couples.
[01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:03.200]   I got to ask before we wrap, what other aspects of your life we've talked a little
[01:14:03.200 --> 01:14:06.400]   bit about time management, but maybe there's a few others, whether they're hacks or
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:11.440]   routines or tricks that you'd like to share that you guys use to be happier or make
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:13.920]   your lives better, whether it's together or individually.
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:21.640]   For me, mindfulness is a central practice that I try to weave throughout my day in a
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.520]   number of different ways. So I think about it as it's a formal practice, but also an
[01:14:26.520 --> 01:14:28.880]   informal practice. So what that looks like for me.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:37.200]   On a formal level is every day I commit to twenty five to thirty minutes of just some
[01:14:37.200 --> 01:14:43.120]   sort of mindfulness practice where I'm sitting, I'm either following my breath or
[01:14:43.120 --> 01:14:44.800]   doing more of an open awareness practice.
[01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:48.360]   I find that's like planting a seed at the beginning of my day.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.720]   That's very different from the seed of Instagram or the seed of news, binging or any
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:55.280]   of the other things that I I find myself drawn to.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:56.640]   So that's key.
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:15:02.280]   But then there's also the informal moment to moment practice that goes along with that
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:08.480]   of just trying throughout the day to build in these moments of mindfulness, especially
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.000]   around what we were talking about earlier, discomfort, emotions that I don't want to
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.360]   feel, just trying to use those as opportunities to really open to an experience that
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.920]   would otherwise feel unpleasant and I'd otherwise run or want to close to or run away
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:30.080]   from. So I think for me, like that's other than the relationship, marriage stuff, I
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:36.160]   spend a lot of my time and mental energy and attention on that particular set of hacks.
[01:15:36.160 --> 01:15:40.880]   It feels in some ways meta relationships are my hack.
[01:15:40.880 --> 01:15:46.600]   And what I mean by that is I learn things because people I care about send me a
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.040]   podcast or send me a book to read, and then I internalize them because we talk about
[01:15:51.040 --> 01:15:57.560]   them. I exercise most often because I'm walking with a friend and I care about that
[01:15:57.560 --> 01:16:03.920]   relationship. And so I use how much I value being with other people as a way to do some
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.600]   of the things that I should in my life, because in some ways I've bribed myself with a
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:10.600]   person or a relationship I care about.
[01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.160]   You just mentioned other people.
[01:16:12.160 --> 01:16:17.560]   So I have one follow up, which is of all the things you learned about relationships in
[01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:22.360]   marriage, right, are there things that are lessons that apply to relationships with
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:26.280]   friends or family that can improve those relationships or even at work?
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:34.080]   A hundred percent that 80/80 works most naturally in a committed relationship because
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.880]   the idea of being a team and shared success is in some ways implicit in the
[01:16:37.880 --> 01:16:43.280]   relationship. But the tools themselves, that notion of what's your mindset with this
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:49.200]   person and do you approach them with radical generosity works absolutely in friendship
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:54.680]   and with family. One of my best friend's favorite things to text me is 80/80 because
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.800]   in our friendship, that's a mindset that we've really adopted with each other.
[01:16:58.800 --> 01:17:04.920]   It also works really well in teams and organizations, particularly the structure
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:09.680]   piece. But if you can establish enough rapport, enough relational capital that your
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:15.440]   mindset is that of assuming positive intent, which I think of as the corporate version
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:21.680]   of radical generosity, then it makes a ton of sense to set up your values, your
[01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:23.800]   priorities, your boundaries, your roles.
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.000]   All of those structural components work really well in professional settings.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:31.080]   You just have to take the sex piece out.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.160]   Yes. Yeah, that's very important.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.080]   Best hack of the episode is take the sex out of your work and family relationships.
[01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:44.840]   Certainly, certainly removes the complication.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.920]   Kaylee and Nate, this has been phenomenal.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:51.400]   Aside from your book, where can people keep up with both of you online?
[01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:58.840]   Yeah, we have a website 8080marriage.com and we have like free epic date night guide
[01:17:58.840 --> 01:18:03.440]   there. And we do a newsletter every week where we just come up with random practices
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:04.920]   and ideas for couples.
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:06.280]   So that's one place.
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:10.720]   And then Instagram is the other main place to find us 8080marriage on Instagram.
[01:18:10.720 --> 01:18:12.080]   And so this is really funny.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:15.800]   I was recently on a podcast where he said that they transcribed the interview.
[01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.280]   And every time I said 8080, it translated it to ADHD.
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:24.760]   So just to be really explicit, it's 8080.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:26.320]   That's there's no slash.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.320]   There's nothing else.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.880]   It's not attention deficit.
[01:18:28.880 --> 01:18:32.040]   Find us at 8080, that 8080 version.
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:35.240]   I actually read one of those transcripts, so I was very familiar.
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:41.200]   OK, last thing is, can you leave everyone with each of you one epic date recommendation
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:44.800]   or suggestion? I would highly recommend Ditch Day.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.600]   We wrote our most recent newsletter about it.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:49.960]   I had a crazy experience a couple of weeks ago.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:51.480]   I was supposed to be in New York.
[01:18:51.480 --> 01:18:52.840]   Flights got canceled.
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:53.840]   I ended up at home.
[01:18:53.840 --> 01:18:56.440]   I persuaded this one to do a ditch day with me.
[01:18:56.440 --> 01:18:58.640]   And it was epic.
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:06.280]   And my tip would be, don't just talk about the weather, which is the way we describe
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:11.160]   a lot of conversation that couples have, which is, hey, what's the weather like today?
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:13.040]   It was negative seven this morning.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:13.760]   That was crazy.
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:18.280]   You know, there was so instead of talking about the external world, ask questions that
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.720]   invite the other person to talk about their internal world.
[01:19:20.720 --> 01:19:21.920]   How are you really doing?
[01:19:21.920 --> 01:19:23.400]   What's exciting for you right now?
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:24.480]   What are you afraid of?
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:27.080]   Just ask different questions would be my main tip.
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.000]   You guys need your own 80/80 card deck of cards with questions.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.400]   There's your next product.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:33.520]   There you go.
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:35.040]   OK, this is awesome.
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:36.600]   Thank you guys so much for being here.
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:37.880]   This was so much fun.
