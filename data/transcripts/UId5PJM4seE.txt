[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880]   The companies we fund, when they get to scale, they tend to get
[00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.800]   pulled into the managerial orbit.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.920]   They tend to get pulled into the managerial matrix, which by the way,
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.400]   is when they stop being able to build new things, which is what causes the
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.440]   smart and aggressive people at those companies to leave and then come back
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.360]   to us and raise money and start a new right bourgeois capitalist company.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.160]   And so basically, like I viewed it as, I don't know, the economy is like 99%
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.440]   managerial, and if we can just keep the 1% of the old model alive,
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:24.720]   we'll keep getting new things.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.440]   If the 1%, by the way, if we get snuffed, like if venture capital ever gets snuffed,
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.960]   it's outlawed or whatever, it just fails, right?
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.360]   And there is no more venture capital.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.880]   There's no more tech startups or whatever.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.760]   And then at that point, the economy is going to be 100% managerial.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.600]   And at that point, there will be no innovation forever.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.160]   I think people might think they want that.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.280]   I don't think they actually want that.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.480]   I don't think we want to live in that world.
