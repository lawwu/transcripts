[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks.
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.320]   I'm Chris Hutchins, I'm excited you're here.
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.600]   Two weeks ago, I did an episode
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.880]   that was a bit of a combination
[00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.520]   of questions you've sent in, hacks you've shared,
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.000]   some takeaways from some recent trips I've taken,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.360]   some of the latest deals on points and miles,
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.120]   and honestly, there was so much good content to cover
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.560]   that I didn't even get to the questions about money
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:25.440]   and a lot of the other categories in life,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.760]   and we focused mostly on travel.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.200]   So today, I wanna do another similar episode,
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.040]   but dive into a lot of money and life questions.
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.680]   Things like where to put cash, whether it's T-bills,
[00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.700]   high-yield savings, CD ladders,
[00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.360]   even things like Wealthfront's new bond portfolio,
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.920]   for anyone who had iBonds, what to do about them,
[00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.200]   when to sell them.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.220]   I'll talk a little bit about some bank bonuses,
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.240]   which actually could be a compelling alternative
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.400]   to earning interest, share some hacks from listeners,
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.880]   and then on the life side, I've got a few fun things
[00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.800]   on food, especially on how to save money on meat.
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.040]   I've also done a really big deep dive on cell phone plans.
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:01.520]   I've gotten a lot of questions from you all
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.840]   that I wanna dive into, and then a few other hacks
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.320]   on personal data, photo storage, and a lot more,
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.600]   but to kick us off, I wanna share a few wins
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.160]   that listeners have sent in.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.680]   So the first came in as a review on Apple Podcasts
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.240]   from Timit687.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.440]   Thanks for writing that review.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.200]   I really appreciate these reviews.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.500]   I'm gonna start highlighting them,
[00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.640]   so if you wanna write them in
[00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.640]   with something interesting in the topic,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.480]   I'd love to share them on the show.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.960]   I just wanna give him a shout out.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.800]   He started listening to this show about three months ago,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.520]   and he's already earned over half a million points.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.240]   He's already taken two free trips and more to come.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.040]   I wish I had your contact info,
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.960]   because I would ask you how you earned those points
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.880]   so I could share more to everyone here,
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.320]   but great work there.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.620]   So glad you've been able to take so many trips.
[00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.840]   Really excited for you.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.760]   Next was from Brian, who was staying
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.000]   at the Broadmoor Hotel in Colorado Springs.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.560]   He did what I've always recommended,
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.200]   book directly with the hotel, email them in advance,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.720]   let them know he's coming and how excited he is for the trip,
[00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.320]   and while he didn't actually get an upgrade this time,
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.240]   he ended up getting champagne, nuts, chocolates,
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.640]   and free desserts at all his meals at the hotel,
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.960]   which was amazing.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.900]   And finally, Drew was on a hybrid personal work trip
[00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.940]   where the work part got canceled
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.040]   and he needed to book a flight home himself.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.860]   The cheapest flight out there was about $400,
[00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.360]   but he found the same flights
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.920]   on American Airlines' website for only 7,500 points,
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.000]   which ended up being over five cents of value per point,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.800]   which is an amazing option.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.040]   For those who don't know, American Airlines miles
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.080]   are some of the hardest to come by.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.420]   The main ways to get them are flying American,
[00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.840]   signing up for an American Airlines credit card,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.560]   or getting a Bilt card,
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.600]   because Bilt is the only transferable point
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.560]   that transfers to American.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.200]   It's one of the reasons I'm so happy to have Bilt points
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.380]   because American has such great value in so many cases
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.160]   and they're just so hard to come by.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.620]   If you're interested in the Bilt card,
[00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.320]   which, by the way, also lets you earn points on rent,
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:52.760]   three points per dollar on dining,
[00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.740]   and two per dollar on travel,
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.000]   you can go to allthehacks.com/bilt and check out that card.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.060]   Those are a couple quick wins I wanted to share,
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.460]   so let's jump into the topic of money right after this.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.000]   So first off, as much as this is a topic
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.720]   that's come up quite a few times,
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.340]   I feel like changes in the market affect the answer enough
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.680]   that it's worth addressing again.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.520]   And it's the question of what to do with cash.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.200]   And I'll define what to do with cash
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.440]   as what to do with money that you think you need
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.800]   in less than five years,
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.860]   because for me, long-term savings,
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.920]   things I don't need to touch for five years,
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.840]   I put in my Wealthfront Investment account,
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.200]   invest it in the market.
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.120]   But for short-term money that I wanna earn a return on,
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.720]   I feel like there are a few options.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.840]   The traditional option that I think many people
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.100]   have done in the past is high-yield savings accounts,
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.720]   but there's also CDs and treasury bills,
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.840]   which have been really popular lately.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.560]   The way I think about it is,
[00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.640]   ultimately, I'm looking for a combination of return,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.520]   but actually after-tax return,
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.920]   because there are some tax benefits
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.140]   of some of these options,
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:54.000]   but I'm also looking for liquidity and ease of use.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.800]   So I'll start with high-yield savings.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.760]   It's typically the easiest option
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.360]   because it's transferring money into an account.
[00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.960]   There's no buying, there's no trading,
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.380]   there's no locking up.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.400]   Obvious downside is that you're not locking in any rates.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.940]   So if rates were to change,
[00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.680]   your interest rate would change immediately.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.320]   For high-yield savings, there are so many options.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:14.200]   I'll link to a post from Doctor of Credit,
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.460]   which has a list of every high-yield savings option compared.
[00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.200]   Personally, I keep all of my high-yield savings cash
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.700]   in my Wealthfront cash account.
[00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.660]   If you have an individual cash account at Wealthfront,
[00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.500]   there's a big advantage that you can also do
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:26.980]   a lot of things you can't do
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.940]   in most high-yield savings accounts,
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.300]   which is you can do bill pay,
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.060]   you can take money out from an ATM.
[00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.900]   It functions very much like a checking account
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.900]   and has all the typical checking features.
[00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.260]   And so you can use that account
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.000]   to direct deposit your paycheck,
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.940]   to pay your bills and do everything normally,
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.620]   and still earn high yield.
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.320]   So from a simplicity standpoint,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.860]   I think the individual cash account at Wealthfront is great.
[00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.860]   If you sign up with a link at allthehacks.com/wfcash,
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.560]   for the first three months,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:57.240]   you'll get an additional 50 basis points,
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.440]   meaning the 4.8% rate they are marketing
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:01.880]   will get bumped up to 5.3.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.120]   That's not my referral link.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.020]   Actually, it's the referral link from All The Hacks members.
[00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.760]   It's a unique link that any member
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.660]   who sent in their referral link,
[00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.360]   it cycles through them randomly.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.560]   So you'll be supporting other All The Hacks listeners
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:14.840]   by using that link.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.320]   But if you wanna add your links
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.040]   and you're an All The Hacks member, send it to me.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.320]   If you're not, check out allthehacks.com/join.
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.640]   Now, I think high yield savings accounts
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.920]   might be the easiest,
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.040]   but if you want a little bit higher return,
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.240]   CDs and treasuries are an option
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   that I think a lot of people have been talking about lately.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.280]   Depending on the day you look at it,
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.420]   CDs and treasuries might have the same rate,
[00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:37.120]   one might be slightly better, one might be slightly worse.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:39.500]   The durations are not exactly the same,
[00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.560]   but I think they're very similar.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.480]   I think CDs have an advantage of being a little simpler
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   because you just put the money in your bank,
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.040]   it's very clear how it all works,
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.200]   and treasuries feel a little bit more complicated.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.440]   If you buy them directly from an auction,
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.160]   that process can feel overwhelming.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.280]   You can buy them on the secondary market
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.840]   through your brokerage firm, which makes it a little easier,
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.460]   or you can even just buy an ETF that holds them,
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.480]   something like SGOV, or you can even buy a mutual fund,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.680]   a money market fund that holds treasuries as well,
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.280]   like VUSXX.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.520]   So I think those are the options out there.
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.400]   I have a slight edge for treasuries
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.040]   because I live in California,
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.400]   we have high state taxes,
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.520]   and treasuries are state tax exempt.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.400]   So that gives a return boost
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.000]   because I'm not paying an extra 10% of taxes
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.760]   on the return from those treasuries.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.040]   As for whether you want to buy the ETF
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:28.960]   or buy the treasuries directly at auction
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.740]   or buy them in the secondary,
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.760]   I'm gonna leave that up to you.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.640]   But if you have a specific term in mind
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.880]   and you wanna lock that interest rate in,
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   you can directly buy those specific duration treasuries.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.800]   So you could buy a one-year treasury
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:42.920]   and lock in that rate for one year.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.280]   So if you have a specific duration in mind,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.240]   that can make sense.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.040]   But if you just wanna park money,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.720]   you don't have a duration in mind,
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.080]   you live in a high tax state,
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.820]   so you appreciate that state tax exemption
[00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:55.160]   for treasury bills,
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.160]   putting it in an ETF or a money market fund
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.480]   that invests in treasuries
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.920]   is not gonna be that different of an outcome,
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.720]   certainly correlated the same,
[00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.880]   and might be a lot easier for you.
[00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:06.660]   The one that I've used is SGOV,
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:08.440]   but there are a lot of other ones out there,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.160]   so feel free to take a look.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.040]   Similarly, I got a question from Dan
[00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:13.560]   about CD laddering,
[00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.760]   and he's looking at some options there.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.200]   The way a CD typically works
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.200]   is you can invest an amount of money,
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:20.200]   get a return,
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.800]   but you agree to lock it up for a certain period of time.
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.040]   But if you do need to take that money out early,
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.740]   you'll probably forfeit some number of months of interest
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.700]   as a penalty.
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.520]   But if you're someone who likes to lock up
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:33.140]   that interest rate for a long period of time,
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:34.800]   you could buy a five-year CD
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.580]   and know that you're gonna get that return for five years,
[00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.840]   which is a pretty compelling thing
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:41.640]   for people who don't wanna take any interest rate risk,
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:43.640]   but it means you don't have access to that cash
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:45.900]   without some form of penalty earlier.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.880]   And when interest rates change in the future,
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:49.840]   you have a little bit of risk that at that point in time
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:51.000]   when you're reinvesting,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.280]   rates have gone down.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:55.360]   And so you're concentrating the entire reinvestment risk,
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.920]   if it were a five-year CD,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.460]   at that five-year mark.
[00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:01.040]   So one option is called CD laddering,
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.120]   which the end outcome would be,
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.760]   and I'm gonna use one example of doing it over five years,
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:08.800]   the end goal would be to end up with five-year CDs,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:10.800]   but that start every five years
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:14.200]   so that every year you're reinvesting 20% of your money
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.440]   and you're spreading out that reinvestment risk,
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:17.880]   and then also every year,
[00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:21.040]   you get the chance to take out 20% of your money
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.720]   without having a penalty.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.280]   And so the way you would implement that
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.520]   is you would buy a one, two, three, four,
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:28.160]   and five-year CD now,
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.680]   and in the end of one year,
[00:08:29.680 --> 00:08:31.800]   buy another five-year CD with that money,
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.720]   and then the end of two years do the same thing
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:37.640]   until you've got rolling five-year CDs every single year.
[00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.200]   I think if you're someone who likes
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.880]   taking less interest rate risk,
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:42.840]   someone who likes to lock in that interest rate
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:45.920]   for five years, maybe wants a little more liquidity,
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.600]   and wants to spread out that reinvestment risk
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.720]   over five years, instead of knowing that every five years
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.080]   you're gonna lock that up, that could make sense.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:56.560]   For me, as much as I would love to lock in a great rate
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:58.600]   for five years, I don't like locking my money up
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.120]   for that long, so it's not a product I've played with.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.680]   I don't have a strong opinion for or against it,
[00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:04.800]   but I think you need to be someone
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.160]   who really wants to lock interest rates in for a long time,
[00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.480]   not need access to capital for a long time,
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.400]   and want to spread out your reinvestment risk
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:13.780]   for it to make sense.
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:16.420]   But speaking of locking your rate in for a while,
[00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:19.200]   if you are someone who has a very, very defined need
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.000]   for money, let's say I need $100,000 in 12 months,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.600]   and you know you don't need access to that money,
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.920]   that's where I think it could make sense
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.860]   to use a product like a one-year treasury bill
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.040]   or a one-year CD, because you can lock that interest rate in
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.320]   and not have to worry, because let's say the market corrects
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.960]   and rates go down lower and lower,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:41.400]   you will be in a place to continue to get that interest
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.460]   no matter what, so you can plan on it.
[00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.720]   However, if interest rates continue to rise,
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:48.020]   you would not get those higher interest rates.
[00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.480]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.020]   I get it, life comes at you fast, but trust me,
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:58.900]   your friends are probably desperate for a good hang.
[00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:02.960]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:04.920]   Just make sure you do it the easy way
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.880]   and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:10.560]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.400]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.240]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.660]   It could be your dog's birthday,
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.640]   that the sun finally came out,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.100]   or maybe you just wanna celebrate
[00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.180]   that you got through another week.
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.280]   With Drizzly, you can make hosting easy
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.820]   by taking the drink run off your to-do list,
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.600]   which means you can entice your friends
[00:10:28.600 --> 00:10:31.680]   to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.360]   And since I know you like a good deal,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:35.920]   Drizzly compares prices on their massive selection
[00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.880]   of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.920]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.760]   while we were hosting family last week,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:44.840]   not only could I get an Italian Amaro
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.480]   delivered in less than an hour,
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.940]   but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.000]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.880]   or go to drizzly.com.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:02.140]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:03.980]   (air whooshing)
[00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.380]   There are only a few brands I use almost every single day,
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:08.940]   and Viore is one of them.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:10.820]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.900]   for this episode.
[00:11:11.900 --> 00:11:15.140]   Viore makes performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:16.780]   Everything is designed to work out in,
[00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.340]   but it doesn't look or feel like it at all.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:21.120]   And it is so freaking comfortable,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:23.220]   you will wanna wear it all the time.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.040]   Seriously, I'm pretty sure it's more comfortable
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:26.740]   than whatever you're wearing right now,
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:29.340]   unless it's Viore, in which case you know what I mean.
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.780]   And it's not just for men.
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:34.180]   My wife, Amy, is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.820]   My personal favorite is the Sunday Performance Joggers.
[00:11:36.820 --> 00:11:38.260]   I think I have three pairs of them,
[00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:39.740]   and they're probably the most comfortable pants
[00:11:39.740 --> 00:11:40.820]   I've ever owned.
[00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:42.620]   Their products are incredibly versatile
[00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.700]   and can be used for just about any activity,
[00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:46.600]   whether it's running, training, yoga,
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.780]   but they're also great for lounging.
[00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:52.020]   Or I even wear their MetaPants out to a nice dinner.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:54.980]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:56.300]   And for all the Hacks listeners,

[00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.060]   Hopefully that was helpful thinking about cash
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:21.580]   and cash-like options.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:24.300]   But what happens if you wanna take a little bit more risk?
[00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:27.020]   Brian and Sean both wrote in asking what I think
[00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:29.100]   of Wealthfront's new bond portfolio.
[00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:31.220]   And while I haven't used it yet,
[00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.940]   I will take a little bit of time
[00:12:32.940 --> 00:12:35.460]   to explain my quick thoughts.
[00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.220]   So first off, the idea of the product was,
[00:12:38.220 --> 00:12:42.060]   what exists between a stock investing account and cash?
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.700]   What if I don't wanna take all the risk
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.000]   of investing in the stock market,
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.920]   but I wanna take a little bit more risk
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.700]   for a little bit more return than just investing in cash
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:52.260]   or treasury bills or cash-like alternatives?
[00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.420]   So Wealthfront created an automated bond portfolio
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:56.260]   that has some of the same features,
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:59.000]   tax loss harvesting, automated rebalancing,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.500]   as the investment account,
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.260]   but it targets a higher yield than cash
[00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.780]   and a much lower volatility.
[00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.140]   So right now they say that they target a 3% volatility.
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:09.500]   It's an interesting product
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.660]   that I haven't quite figured out how it fits in my world.
[00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.260]   One advantage is that some of those bonds being held
[00:13:15.260 --> 00:13:18.340]   are in treasuries and U.S. government securities.
[00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:20.320]   So you do get a tax benefit there
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.380]   if you live in a state with high state taxes.
[00:13:23.380 --> 00:13:27.220]   But I had a conversation with my old co-founder
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:29.000]   about how to think about this.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.800]   And the point he made was that high-yield bonds
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.280]   are very similar to regular bonds,
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.960]   except for the fact that you're also taking
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.440]   a little bit of risk in the company,
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.780]   which is essentially similar to equity risk.
[00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.840]   His perspective was he would be more interested
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:46.080]   in just taking a smaller percentage of equity risk
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:49.420]   instead of having a entire portfolio of bonds
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:51.240]   with some corporate bonds and high-yield bonds.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.680]   What if you just made a portfolio
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.400]   that was 90% treasuries and 10% stocks?
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:57.520]   And we were trying to figure out
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.000]   why that wasn't an obvious thing that people did.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.960]   And we came to the conclusion that high-yield bonds
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   actually have a marketed yield.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:08.840]   So because there is a yield, like a 30-day SEC yield
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.800]   for corporate bonds and high-yield bonds,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.280]   you're actually able to create a number
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.960]   that you can use to market the return of the portfolio,
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.200]   which Wealthfront does and shows a 5.75%
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.840]   blended 30-day yield on the website.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:23.000]   You can't do that with stocks.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.800]   Stocks don't have an advertised yield.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.240]   So I actually think one of the reasons
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:28.520]   that this product is a little easier
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.080]   is you can just explain what that risk reward looks like
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.040]   in an easier way than you could
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:37.840]   with a 90% government bond, 10% equity portfolio.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:40.080]   Functionally, they're probably a little bit similar,
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:43.560]   but the argument was if you want risk, go for equities.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:46.120]   If you want stable income, go for government securities,
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.640]   and maybe don't do something in the middle.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.240]   I don't have much more that I could add
[00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:52.120]   on the automated bond portfolio right now,
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.400]   but by no means do I think it would be
[00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:56.320]   a bad investment decision to use a product like this.
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.280]   Certainly lots of smart investors out there
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:00.680]   are investing in corporate bonds, high-yield bonds,
[00:15:00.680 --> 00:15:02.360]   so it's not a product that I think
[00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:04.640]   someone would be crazy to use,
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:06.320]   but I just have to ask myself
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.360]   if I do want more risk than cash,
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.960]   and by cash, I mean treasuries and CDs and high-yield savings,
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:14.440]   I could just put some of the money in equities
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:16.960]   and not try to create something in between,
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.120]   but for some people, I think it's just much easier
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.360]   to have an automated thing
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.560]   that fits that kind of middle ground
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.240]   and not need to go buy some equities
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:27.120]   and combine them with another portfolio,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:29.400]   potentially in another account or another brokerage firm.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.640]   So hopefully that helps to make sense
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:33.160]   of everything I talked about,
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.080]   but I did actually wanna go to a completely different idea,
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.080]   which is a little bit more work,
[00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:41.280]   but might actually result in a higher return for cash,
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:43.040]   and that's bank bonuses.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.880]   So Tyler wrote in saying he got a $750 bonus
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   for parking $15,000 in a U.S. bank account for 60 days.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:54.040]   Now, if you look at that return,
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:56.440]   $750 on $15,000 is a 5% return,
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:59.880]   but getting that in about two months instead of 12 months
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:04.000]   means that the effective annual rate is 30%.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.920]   So if you want to earn the highest amount of yield
[00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:10.080]   on your cash, and you're willing to go through the hoops
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:13.160]   of opening up a new account, transferring your money there,
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.360]   and earning interest in the form of leaving that money there
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:19.400]   and getting a bonus and closing the account,
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:21.600]   I think it seems like that actually might be
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.640]   one of the best options.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.200]   And I looked through a few other options.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:26.800]   There are a ton of banks that offer cash bonuses
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.120]   for opening up checking and savings accounts.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.160]   I actually worked with a company called Bank Bonus
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.880]   to set up a site to find them all and sort them.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:37.200]   So if you go to allthehacks.com/bankbonus,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.000]   you can see all the different bonuses.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.920]   And the way I would think about it is take the bonus,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.840]   divide it by the balance you need to maintain
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.800]   to get the interest rate you're gonna get,
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:46.160]   but then divide that interest rate
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   by the number of days you need to have it in the account
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.200]   and multiply it by 365
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.480]   to get an effective annual interest rate.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.280]   So on one hand, I look at this and I think,
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:58.480]   wow, it's a great way to get a 30% return on cash,
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.200]   but you're only getting it for 60 days.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.360]   And a lot of these bonuses are for accounts
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.200]   where you can put 10 or $20,000 in,
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.760]   but it's not an unlimited amount.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:10.160]   If you had $20,000 and you wanted to earn the most interest
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.600]   you could in a year, you'd probably have to open up
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   five or six accounts across the year and you'd be okay.
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.560]   But if you had $200,000, you need to open up
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:21.800]   somewhere between 30 to 60 accounts throughout the year,
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:23.280]   which is just too much work for me
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:25.960]   and I imagine most people to earn that extra return.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.760]   Now, because I mentioned how much I love American Miles,
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.840]   I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about one other bank bonus,
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:34.800]   which comes from Basque Bank, who I have an account at.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   And the difference between Basque Bank and other banks
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.560]   is that they pay their interest in American Airlines Miles,
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:42.480]   which as I mentioned earlier, are very hard to get.
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.680]   And the offer that they have is if you deposit $50,000
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.000]   and they have lower tiers as well,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.160]   you earn 20,000 American Airlines Miles
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.080]   after you've kept that money in there for 180 days.
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.080]   But on top of that, you also earn 2.5 miles
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.640]   per dollar per year.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.640]   So if you put $50,000 in for 180 days,
[00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:01.320]   you're gonna earn a little over
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:03.960]   81,000 American Airlines Miles.
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.820]   So what's 81,000 American Airlines Miles worth?
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:08.160]   Depending on who you ask,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.260]   well, if you're able to get the value that Drew was,
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:12.280]   it's worth about $4,000.
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.480]   But if you look at the PointsGuys valuations,
[00:18:14.480 --> 00:18:19.120]   which is about 1.6 cents per point, it's about $1,300.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.840]   Now, if you put that same $50,000
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.640]   just in the Wealthfront Cash account, earning 4.8%,
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.260]   you'd get about $1,200.
[00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.100]   So in this case,
[00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.680]   you're not actually getting that much more value.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:32.080]   Now, if you factor in taxes,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.200]   it probably goes up a little higher
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.600]   because they actually value the miles for tax purposes
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.760]   at 0.42 cents per mile,
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.560]   which is much lower than the 1.6 cents per point
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:43.440]   we talked about earlier.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:46.400]   So your tax bill on that will be a little smaller
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.000]   than your tax bill would be if you had earned cash.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:49.840]   But at the end of the day,
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:51.200]   this is not really gonna be an option
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.040]   to earning a much higher return
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.820]   as much as it is an option to earn a type of point
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:57.200]   that is much harder to get.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:58.440]   Okay, I think that covers
[00:18:58.440 --> 00:19:00.800]   a lot of the options related to cash.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.320]   The one follow-on to that that I'll include
[00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:04.560]   is about I-bonds.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:07.520]   In the past, we've talked on the show about buying I-bonds
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.240]   because when inflation was high,
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.240]   you could earn a yield as high as 9.62%,
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:14.560]   and that was locked in for six months.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.400]   But inflation has dropped,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:17.720]   and Nathan wrote in asking,
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:19.640]   "When do we actually sell these I-bonds?"
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:20.960]   He sent a good article,
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.200]   and so I thought I'd just help anyone who bought I-bonds
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:24.400]   think about how to do this,
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:25.880]   and I'll explain it with the example
[00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:27.120]   of how I'm thinking about it.
[00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:31.120]   So I bought my first batch of I-bonds in December 2021,
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:32.240]   and the way that works
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.880]   is that the interest rate on those I-bonds
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.260]   adjusts every December and June.
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:37.240]   So for the first six months,
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:39.680]   I was earning a little over 7%.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:43.640]   The next six months, I was earning 9.6%, then 6.4%.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:46.480]   And finally, starting in June 2023,
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:49.160]   that interest rate dropped to 3.38%,
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.960]   which is much lower than I can get elsewhere,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.020]   and I would normally like to take that money out.
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.440]   However, the way I-bonds work
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   is that if you take your money out before five years are up,
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.880]   you lose the last three months of interest.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.960]   So what I wanna do is make sure
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.440]   that I lose three months of the 3.38% interest,
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:08.600]   not three months of the 6.48% interest.
[00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:12.020]   So for me, that means I'm gonna let June, July, and August,
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:15.120]   those first three months of earning 3.38%,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.460]   be those months that I don't wanna earn interest on,
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:19.160]   and on September 1st, in a few days,
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.800]   I'm gonna withdraw all of the funds
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:22.800]   from that first I-bond investment.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:25.920]   I bought another tranche of I-bonds in April 2022.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:28.360]   Those adjust every April and October.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:31.880]   October this year is when that rate will drop to 3.38,
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.560]   or whatever the rate is at the time,
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:35.900]   and I'll leave it in there for October, November, December,
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.140]   and take it out in January 2024.
[00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.480]   There's a great blog post
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.980]   that I'm gonna link to in the show notes
[00:20:40.980 --> 00:20:43.400]   that will show you exactly if you bought them this month,
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.220]   this is probably the month you'd wanna sell them,
[00:20:45.220 --> 00:20:47.880]   if you wanna follow a similar strategy to what I'm doing,
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:48.760]   so that's really helpful.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:50.800]   So hopefully for anyone who has I-bonds
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:52.120]   that's trying to figure that out,
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.480]   this will make it a lot easier.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.600]   On the topic of money, I've got a couple quick things.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.780]   First, thank you, Russ, for writing in.
[00:20:57.780 --> 00:21:00.160]   Russ shared that most people don't realize
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.800]   they can negotiate a mortgage rate
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.200]   directly with their broker.
[00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.960]   So his hack is to get a rate quote
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.480]   from three to four lenders,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.200]   then pick the broker he likes best,
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:10.080]   and ask them to beat the lowest rate
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:12.280]   with the lowest fees to get your business.
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.560]   It got him a 2.75 rate for 30 years,
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.400]   obviously much earlier when rates were a lot lower,
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.920]   and he also got some lender credits towards closing,
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.360]   so definitely can't hurt to ask,
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:25.240]   and probably a good strategy in today's market.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:28.000]   Next, I wanna talk a little bit about auto insurance.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.440]   I've done a whole episode on it,
[00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.440]   it was episode number 104,
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.040]   but interestingly enough,
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.560]   our USAA auto policy just came up for renewal,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:40.480]   and it went from about $1,700 every six months,
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:44.960]   and it went up over $750 over six months.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.960]   When I first saw this, I was so frustrated,
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.040]   because we spent all this time trying to get the best rate,
[00:21:49.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   and here it is going up almost 40% by $750 every six months,
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:58.160]   by what would ultimately be over $1,500 a year.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.200]   And so I called USAA, big credit to them
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:04.640]   for picking up my phone call at 7.30 in the evening,
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:08.000]   and helping me understand that when their policies renew,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.200]   if you specify lower than the average mileage amount,
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:14.120]   sometimes you need to re-specify your mileage amount.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:16.800]   So the default is 12,000 miles a year,
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:20.160]   but we had had our policies set up for our two cars
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.580]   at 3,500 and 5,000 miles per year each,
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:26.420]   so when I regave them those numbers,
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:30.280]   all of a sudden the rate went back down almost $670,
[00:22:30.280 --> 00:22:33.520]   so the rate had ultimately only really gone up $100
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:36.620]   for the six-month policy, which was such a relief.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.200]   So two important things.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.120]   One, if you drive less than 12,000 miles a year
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.400]   on any of your vehicles,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.600]   you really should be telling your insurance company,
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.600]   and if you've already told your insurance company,
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.080]   make sure you keep it updated every single year.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:51.640]   Finally, if you do have a Tesla,
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.340]   I highly recommend you sign up for Teslify.
[00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:56.560]   I'll get a free month if you use my link,
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.720]   which is allthehacks.com/teslafi.
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.160]   It's $5 a month,
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.440]   and it's basically an entire web dashboard for your car.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.040]   Yes, you have to authorize your car data to Teslify.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.160]   There is a complicated way
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.940]   that you could build this all yourself with the Tesla API,
[00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:13.520]   but ultimately you get access
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.400]   to all your car's information online,
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:19.400]   and that means all the drives, all the history,
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:22.080]   how energy-efficient it was, odometer readings.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:23.820]   So when I wanted to make sure
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:25.980]   that I was giving USAA an accurate reading
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:27.780]   of how many miles we used for the car,
[00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.420]   I was actually able to go into this dashboard
[00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.940]   and say how many miles did we use in the last 12 months
[00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:36.160]   and see the exact odometer readings,
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:37.740]   which, kind of crazy,
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.460]   were within three or 4% of the estimates I gave USAA.
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:45.400]   So you can also do a bunch of other interesting stuff
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:47.980]   like tag your rides business and personal,
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.820]   get access to your charging,
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.020]   and even if you give them the right authorization,
[00:23:52.020 --> 00:23:55.080]   you can control your car in certain ways from the web
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:56.780]   and set up rules to do different things.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.960]   It's really cool.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:00.480]   Definitely recommend checking it out if you're a Tesla owner
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:02.000]   and like to nerd out on data,
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.820]   and especially because you get an easy way
[00:24:03.820 --> 00:24:05.280]   to track your odometer readings.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.560]   While we're on the topic of cars,
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:08.840]   I definitely wanna let everyone know
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.080]   that two episodes ago when I talked about a hack
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:12.360]   by renting an electric car
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.680]   and not having to pay to refuel the car
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.040]   because they didn't charge for it,
[00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:19.120]   it turns out that my experience does not match reality.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:20.960]   So thanks to Zach, Tyler, and Robert
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.440]   for reminding me that was not the case.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:27.720]   Hertz does have a fee if you bring your car in below 70%.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.920]   They charge $35.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.300]   A lot of other companies do something similar.
[00:24:32.300 --> 00:24:34.360]   So I was completely mistaken.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:36.780]   I very much apologize for it.
[00:24:36.780 --> 00:24:38.840]   I did look back at my Hertz receipt
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:40.900]   and when I picked up the car,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:42.640]   it said it was at eight of eight charge
[00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.600]   when I dropped it off, even though it was at about 40%,
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.400]   it said it was at eight of eight charge.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.860]   So I had assumed that was not the case.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:51.800]   I'd had another friend have a similar experience,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:54.200]   but it turns out that you actually need to
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.480]   with Hertz return it above 10%,
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.800]   but anything below 70
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.080]   and you're gonna have to pay that $35 fee.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.480]   So not a hack for anyone.
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:04.760]   Definitely don't recommend trying to return your car
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.280]   with less unless you're willing to pay the fee,
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:09.520]   which honestly, when you're renting a car,
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:12.440]   having to go find a charger and then sit and wait to charge
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.600]   probably just isn't worth it.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:16.240]   And you still do have to pay for that charge as well.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.860]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:21.500]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:23.220]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:25:23.220 --> 00:25:24.680]   being proactive about this year
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:27.340]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.020]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.180]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:25:31.180 --> 00:25:34.540]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:37.040]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.640]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.060]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:25:42.060 --> 00:25:44.980]   that gives you personalized guidance to maximize deductions,
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:46.520]   tax credits and savings,
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:49.220]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.460]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:53.380]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:55.460]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.700]   And best of all, you can have this transparent,
[00:25:57.700 --> 00:25:59.460]   open communication with your team
[00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.380]   in whatever way works best for you,
[00:26:01.380 --> 00:26:03.740]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:05.900]   in Slack or scheduling a call.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.180]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:09.260]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:10.780]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.600]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:16.480]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:18.360]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:21.960]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.860]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:25.300]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:26:25.300 --> 00:26:27.820]   you can skip the wait list and get started today.
[00:26:27.820 --> 00:26:32.140]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:36.040]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.220]   Now that we have three people working full-time
[00:26:40.220 --> 00:26:42.540]   on All The Hacks, it's more important than ever
[00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:45.020]   to have a central place for everything we're doing,
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.620]   whether that's planning episodes, tracking projects,
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:50.900]   recording listener questions, or really anything else.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.020]   And for us, that place is Notion,
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.580]   who I'm so grateful to have as our sponsor today
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:57.500]   because I truly love the product.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.820]   And it's not just for work.
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.040]   We manage our entire personal life in Notion as well.
[00:27:02.040 --> 00:27:03.220]   But for the last few months,
[00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:05.220]   I've been learning how to use Notion AI,
[00:27:05.220 --> 00:27:08.080]   and I can't emphasize enough how much time I'm saving
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:10.260]   by letting AI do the tedious work
[00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.480]   so I can focus on the creative work.
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.060]   Notion AI helps you work faster, write better,
[00:27:15.060 --> 00:27:16.980]   and think bigger doing tasks
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.500]   that normally take you hours and just seconds.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.140]   And the best part is that Notion combines your notes
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.700]   and docs into one space that's simple
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:27.180]   and beautifully designed with the power of AI
[00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.860]   built right into the product,
[00:27:28.860 --> 00:27:31.020]   not a separate AI tool or browser tab
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.060]   you have to copy and paste between.

[00:28:13.060 --> 00:28:14.880]   So now I wanna jump through a bunch
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:17.020]   of awesome hacks people have shared with me
[00:28:17.020 --> 00:28:19.340]   and a few things that I've been noticing
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.980]   that are really across the board.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:22.580]   The first one's a little bit personal.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:23.660]   So about a year ago,
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.240]   I went through a pretty crazy period of time
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:28.820]   where I went deep on everything security,
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:30.020]   identity protection.
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:32.740]   I published episode 78 and it was my action list
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:34.580]   of everything you can do to protect your identity,
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.460]   your accounts, credit, and family.
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.480]   If you haven't listened,
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.420]   it was the culmination of a lot of research
[00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:41.980]   and I think a really helpful episode from a lot of people.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:43.940]   And one of those things was that there are data brokers
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:45.940]   out there selling your personal information
[00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:47.100]   every single day.
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.820]   So to get that data removed,
[00:28:48.820 --> 00:28:51.420]   I used Delete.me and had such a good experience
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.040]   that I partnered with them for the show.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:54.700]   So one of the things Delete.me does
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.180]   is over the course of the year,
[00:28:56.180 --> 00:28:57.640]   they're constantly checking to see
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:00.260]   if there's more information of yours getting exposed
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.860]   and removing that as well.
[00:29:01.860 --> 00:29:03.540]   I'll be honest, I was a little skeptical
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:07.300]   at the beginning of how much data would really pop up.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.320]   So I thought it's been about a year,
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:10.780]   let's go look into it.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:12.160]   And so interestingly enough,
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:14.380]   every single time Delete.me has checked,
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:16.920]   that was in December, March, and June,
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:20.620]   there were 14, 15, and 16 different listings of mine
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:21.700]   that have popped up.
[00:29:21.700 --> 00:29:23.980]   So on average, there've been 45 listings of mine
[00:29:23.980 --> 00:29:25.960]   pop up over the last nine months
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.740]   with my phone number or email or address
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.600]   or other personal information.
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:33.080]   Thank you Delete.me for actually proactively going out
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.140]   and removing all of them.
[00:29:34.140 --> 00:29:35.980]   I haven't had to think about it at all
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.140]   and I'm keeping my information off the internet.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.140]   My wife, Amy, who may be because she is just less out there
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:42.500]   on the internet than me,
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.860]   has only had 28 pop up over the last nine months,
[00:29:45.860 --> 00:29:47.520]   but it's still not zero.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:51.180]   So first off, data brokers, I despise you.
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:53.340]   Please stop selling my information to the internet.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:55.220]   Please stop saying you're gonna take it down
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.740]   and then putting it back up.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:58.140]   I wish that you didn't exist
[00:29:58.140 --> 00:30:00.420]   and I honestly wish those companies went out of business
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.420]   because it's so infuriating.
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.820]   But also thank you Delete.me
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:05.440]   for helping continue to remove it.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.660]   I'm so excited to continue to partner with them.
[00:30:07.660 --> 00:30:09.140]   I love the service.
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:10.180]   If you want 20% off,
[00:30:10.180 --> 00:30:12.460]   you can go to allthehacks.com/deleteme
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.740]   and get your data removed from the web as well.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:16.960]   So next I wanna share a hack related to food
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.300]   that comes from Maxine,
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:21.660]   which really was something I never expected to think about.
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.340]   And she cooks 90% of her meals at home
[00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:25.460]   and she's a big believer
[00:30:25.460 --> 00:30:27.260]   that the quality of the ingredients matter.
[00:30:27.260 --> 00:30:29.820]   And the hack she's been using for almost a decade
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:31.500]   to save time, save money
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:34.040]   and maximize feeling good about her choices
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:37.580]   is buying meat by the animal from local farmers.
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:39.180]   I know it sounds a little crazy,
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:42.060]   but every year she fills a nine cubic foot freezer
[00:30:42.060 --> 00:30:43.700]   with a whole lamb, half a pig
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:46.420]   and an eighth of a cow that she gets from local farms,
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.260]   which still leaves leftover room for fish, chicken,
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:51.220]   anything else she buys throughout the year.
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:52.600]   She said it saves a ton of time
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.580]   'cause she only buys the meat once a year.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:56.220]   And while it might not be cheaper
[00:30:56.220 --> 00:30:58.260]   than discount grocery store meat,
[00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.120]   buying in bulk is much cheaper
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.860]   than comparable quality meat at a farmer's market
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:04.460]   or a store like Whole Foods.
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:07.060]   It's super convenient because it's all divided up
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.820]   like you would want at a grocery store,
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:11.820]   putting two pork chops or a pound package of ground beef.
[00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:14.540]   So she effectively every week just shops her freezer
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:16.260]   instead of shopping the grocery store.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.900]   And she loves that she gets to actually work directly
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.140]   with local farmers, local businesses
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:23.300]   and get meat that just tastes better
[00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.060]   and feels like the right way that we should be buying meat.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:27.520]   So I haven't tried this yet though.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:29.300]   She wrote to me that there are so many options
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.460]   in the Bay Area,
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.460]   but she's also written an entire book about it.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:34.020]   It's called "There's a Cow in My Freezer,
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:35.820]   The Complete Guide to Buying, Storing
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.980]   and Enjoying Pasture Raised Meat in Bulk."
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:38.940]   She's got a website.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:40.500]   I'll link to both in the show notes
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.580]   if you wanna check it out.
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:44.820]   Really interesting hack that we're thinking about trying.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:46.740]   Another couple of cooking hacks from Len
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:48.880]   were one, buy a bench scraper.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:50.100]   I totally agree.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:52.000]   We have one that just makes it so easy
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.860]   to clean the counters and move things you chop up around.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.140]   I'll link to the one he suggested in the show notes.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:00.860]   He also said buy three to four cheaper paring knives
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:02.180]   that work really well,
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.020]   but you can also just throw in the dishwasher
[00:32:04.020 --> 00:32:06.160]   and you don't have to worry about hand washing them,
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:08.780]   which I know a lot of fancy knives suggest you do.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.280]   And then next, when it comes to herbs,
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.600]   if you treat them like flowers,
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.540]   you can keep them fresh a lot longer.
[00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:15.660]   So wash them, put them stem side down
[00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.020]   into a glass of water,
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.500]   maybe even put some in the fridge.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:20.980]   He said parsley and cilantro do better there,
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.420]   whereas things like basil and mint
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:23.500]   stay better on the counter.
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.020]   So Len, thanks for those cooking hacks.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:27.060]   Super helpful, really appreciate it.
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:28.560]   Next comes from Brad,
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.860]   and he's built a really interesting productivity tool
[00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:35.460]   for Gmail that actually is the first thing I've seen
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:38.500]   that's made me consider switching off of Superhuman.
[00:32:38.500 --> 00:32:39.960]   I gave him my candid feedback
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:42.540]   that I'm not sure it would actually bring me to switch.
[00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:44.100]   I'm such a big fan of Superhuman,
[00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.940]   but if you're not using Superhuman and you want a tool
[00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:51.340]   that will basically use AI to auto-generate replies
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:53.700]   as drafts to emails in your inbox,
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.860]   which is kind of like having your own personal assistant,
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.200]   you should definitely check it out.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.700]   It's called Ready to Send.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:00.020]   Let me know what you think.
[00:33:00.020 --> 00:33:02.740]   I'm still using Superhuman for a bunch of other reasons,
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.560]   so I haven't gotten to check it out yet,
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:05.780]   but it's called Ready to Send.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:06.920]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.060]   Next, Yelena sent in a service I'd never heard of
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:11.340]   called Return Queen,
[00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:13.580]   which just automates and makes super easy
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.540]   the process of monthly returns.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:16.840]   They even sync with Amazon
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.860]   to make sure you're on top of returns,
[00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.460]   notifying you before a return window ends.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:25.260]   They charge $99 a year, 19 a month, or $9 a pickup,
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.460]   and they just pick up all your returns from your house.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.300]   You don't have to drive to UPS or FedEx or any of that.
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.500]   It's called Return Queen.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.140]   I'll link to it in the show notes.
[00:33:33.140 --> 00:33:35.900]   And then next, I got an email from Jamie
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.420]   about a service called Evidation.
[00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:40.300]   I'm probably mispronouncing that,
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.740]   but you link your health apps
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:43.860]   like Aura, Apple Health, and Runkeeper,
[00:33:43.860 --> 00:33:46.220]   and they track your progress and give you points.
[00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:47.940]   And every time you get to 10,000 points,
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.060]   you can redeem another $10 gift card.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.360]   He says he ends up getting a gift card every few months,
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:53.500]   not having to do anything,
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   and they just stack up in the background.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:56.940]   He shared his referral link,
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.480]   which I'll put in the show notes.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.220]   You could support Jamie and check it out
[00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:01.400]   and earn some money as well.
[00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:04.460]   Now, I know the last episode like this was all about travel,
[00:34:04.460 --> 00:34:07.220]   and I was intending to not cover travel at all here,
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:09.300]   but a few things popped up in the last few weeks
[00:34:09.300 --> 00:34:10.520]   that I wanted to cover.
[00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:14.380]   First, a huge negative change to the Amex Platinum card.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:16.420]   I am so disappointed by this.
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:20.120]   It really sucks, especially because starting this year,
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:23.060]   the Platinum card stopped giving guest access
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:25.260]   to the Centurion Lounge for cardholders,
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.900]   which basically means that if you're traveling
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:28.780]   with your partner or your kids,
[00:34:28.780 --> 00:34:31.180]   unless they have their own Platinum cards
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:33.060]   or your kids are under two,
[00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.300]   you can't bring them into the lounge
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.260]   unless you pay $50 for adults
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.380]   and $30 for kids two to, I think, 12.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:42.360]   So the best fix for that has always just been
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.100]   to add them as authorized users,
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.060]   which Amex actually charged $175
[00:34:47.060 --> 00:34:49.000]   for three authorized users.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.500]   Now, caveat, it's not the best option for young kids
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.860]   because you need to be 13 to be an authorized user,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.620]   but for a spouse or for older kids, it's worked well.
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:35:00.260]   However, Amex has changed that price,
[00:35:00.260 --> 00:35:04.260]   and now instead of $175 per year for three authorized users,
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.840]   it's $195 per authorized user.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:11.060]   So huge knock to the card, I think,
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.740]   takes away a lot of the value of being able
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:15.100]   to let your spouse, friends, or family
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.760]   into the lounge with you.
[00:35:16.760 --> 00:35:20.100]   If you do spend $75,000 a year on your Platinum card,
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.580]   you can get that guest access turned back on for your card.
[00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:25.460]   I believe it's up to two guests.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.760]   But at the end of the day,
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:27.840]   the number of points you're gonna give up
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.340]   spending $75,000 on your Platinum card
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:31.860]   is not worth that cost.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.900]   I'd rather just pay the $30 to $50 for a guest
[00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:36.860]   or use your priority pass to go to a lounge
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:37.960]   where guests are free.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.060]   When the VentureX card gives you four free authorized users
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:44.460]   and the Chase Reserve gives you $75 per authorized user,
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:47.580]   it seems like this pricing from Amex is a little crazy,
[00:35:47.580 --> 00:35:51.220]   but at the end of the day, it's changed, it's what happens.
[00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:53.940]   If you already have multiple authorized users on your card,
[00:35:53.940 --> 00:35:56.460]   like I do, when that next renewal comes around,
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.900]   you'll probably get a notice that the price is going up
[00:35:58.900 --> 00:36:01.300]   and I will very subsequently cancel
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.900]   those authorized user cards.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.220]   And in fact, Amy right now has an Amex Platinum card as well
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:07.980]   and we were thinking of canceling it
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:11.180]   because I had those three authorized user slots
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.540]   and a really good friend of mine
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:13.980]   and my sister were on there.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.340]   And when you have to divide that cost by two or three
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.740]   if my wife came over, it was pretty reasonable.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.820]   But now that it's gonna be so expensive,
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:23.860]   given all the benefits and perks of the Platinum card,
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:25.980]   I think we're just gonna keep both of them,
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:28.660]   get access and we'll have to figure out
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:30.440]   what we do when we're traveling with kids
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.040]   'cause $60 is just probably not worth it.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.740]   So maybe we won't keep both,
[00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:37.180]   who knows what we'll end up doing, so stay tuned.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:39.220]   Then the last two things I wanna talk about on travel.
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:42.660]   One, I went on a trip to Denver for podcast movement,
[00:36:42.660 --> 00:36:43.800]   really awesome to get to meet
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:45.180]   a lot of interesting podcasters,
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.300]   come up with ideas for where the show could go
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.380]   and things we could do.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.380]   But when I went to go check in on the United app,
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:52.420]   I saw a pop-up for a United game
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:55.020]   where it said turn this United play game on,
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.620]   book two flights and get 4,500 miles.
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:36:59.860]   And the only caveat was you have to book the flights
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:02.040]   after you click the activation.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.620]   And I had just booked the flights three or four days before.
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:06.260]   So just quick reminder,
[00:37:06.260 --> 00:37:08.740]   if you're booking flights for any airline,
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.460]   open their app, go to their website,
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.740]   see if there are any promotions.
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:13.100]   Normally I'm pretty good at this,
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.260]   but definitely will lose out on 4,500 points
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:18.100]   that I could have gotten by opening an app
[00:37:18.100 --> 00:37:20.380]   and clicking a button, which is a huge bummer.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:23.260]   Last, the Marriott Bonvoy boundless card
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:27.260]   has come back with a five night free bonus
[00:37:27.260 --> 00:37:29.180]   after you spend $5,000.
[00:37:29.180 --> 00:37:31.460]   Those five nights come in the form of certificates
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.740]   that are good at properties up to 50,000 points a night.
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.360]   Though if you have Marriott points,
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.900]   you can bump that up with your own points to 65,000 a night.
[00:37:39.900 --> 00:37:44.380]   That offer is not on our allthehacks.com/cards page.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:46.380]   So I'm just gonna link to it in the show notes.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:47.500]   It's a unique offer,
[00:37:47.500 --> 00:37:50.340]   but I wanna make sure that you guys get the best offers.
[00:37:50.340 --> 00:37:52.860]   So like I always say, if you're signing up for a card
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:54.460]   and you wanna use our card links,
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.820]   I would greatly appreciate it.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:37:57.940]   It helps support me and the show,
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:37:59.860]   but I wanna make sure you get the best deal.
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:02.660]   So if I find better deals, I'll always share them with you.
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.660]   So that deal's in the show notes,
[00:38:04.660 --> 00:38:06.220]   but anytime you're looking at cards,
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:09.540]   allthehacks.com/cards are all of our links for cards.
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:11.100]   And usually they have the best deals,
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:12.740]   but in this rare case, they don't.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:13.580]   So I know I mentioned
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.900]   that we were gonna cover cell phone plans.
[00:38:14.900 --> 00:38:17.380]   So I'm gonna record that as a bonus episode.
[00:38:17.380 --> 00:38:19.300]   Expect that coming out soon.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:20.140]   One other thing,
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.860]   if you're going back and listening to old episodes,
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.700]   Spotify has this program
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.820]   where you can turn on programmatic ads for old episodes.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.820]   So I've long said that all the ads that I read,
[00:38:31.820 --> 00:38:33.820]   where I talk about brands, I talk about services,
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:36.900]   those are all products and services that I use.
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:38.700]   I've tested, I've talked to people,
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:41.580]   I've liked, so that's how I think about advertisers.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:44.220]   But for the first 50, 60 episodes of the podcast,
[00:38:44.220 --> 00:38:45.940]   I didn't have advertisers.
[00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.500]   And so I've gone back and just put ads
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:51.220]   that I've recorded for brands I work with in there
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:53.620]   just to help give them a little extra boost.
[00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.100]   It's a free thing that I do for those advertisers,
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:57.820]   but Spotify has this feature
[00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:00.980]   that I talked to someone working at Spotify about this week
[00:39:00.980 --> 00:39:03.340]   where you can turn on programmatic ads,
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.300]   you can choose the categories they're in
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.260]   and have them run any place
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:09.820]   you don't already have ads in your catalog.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:12.540]   So I'm gonna go ahead and experiment with turning that on.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.100]   I don't know how it'll affect the listener experience.
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.180]   I don't know what kinds of ads you'll hear,
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:20.500]   though I've explicitly excluded many of the categories.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:21.780]   And so if you hear any ads,
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.080]   listening to episodes in the back catalog,
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:25.380]   let me know what you think.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:28.740]   It is a way to add a little bit of extra revenue to the show,
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:30.980]   which now that Amy is working here full-time
[00:39:30.980 --> 00:39:32.440]   is a great addition.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:34.180]   I have no idea how much it is.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:36.380]   At the end of the day, I really care about the show
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.860]   being very high quality and feeling like a show
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.040]   that everyone enjoys and wants to listen to.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.380]   So let me know your feedback about those ads
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.800]   so I can decide whether it makes sense
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.240]   to keep them on long-term.
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.100]   I think that's all I have this week.
[00:39:49.100 --> 00:39:50.860]   There was a ton of stuff people wrote in,
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.540]   hacks, ideas, questions that didn't make it in.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.100]   Expect that the next time.
[00:39:55.100 --> 00:39:57.580]   Continue sending in questions, hacks, deals,
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:00.700]   anything you want, podcast@allthathacks.com.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.480]   Thank you so much for listening.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:03.620]   I'll see you next week.
[00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:08.520]   (whooshing)
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
