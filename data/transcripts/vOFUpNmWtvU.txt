[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   So when I talk about storytelling, I'm not telling people how to tell the story of how they came to be in this piece and why this is going to work for someone.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.400]   I see a lot of that. It's a terrible idea because nobody wants your story to be wordsmith for them, right?
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:22.400]   They want to get to the point, they want to get to the point. If I'm there to be entertained, okay, wordsmith me, make it fun.
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.160]   But if I want something from you, or you want something from me, can we just get to the point, right?
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:34.600]   Here's what it is. Then you want to know how it works. Then once you understand it, you want to know, could that be real?
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:41.040]   Would that actually do what you think it is? Oh, yeah? Okay, well, how do I get that? Or how does this actually get there?
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:49.000]   Like, that's what a story builds, right? That's how storytelling in Hollywood works. You inform people and lead them to the conclusion.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.600]   That's all Hollywood storytelling is, is leading people to the conclusion you want.
