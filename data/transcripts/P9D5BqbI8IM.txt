[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   This is Psalm 77 from the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.440]   My voice rises to God, and I must cry aloud.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.280]   My voice rises to God, and He will hear me.
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.560]   In the day of my distress, I sought the Lord.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.340]   In the night my hand was stretched out without weariness.
[00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.440]   My soul refused to be comforted.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:29.560]   I remember God, and I am disturbed.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680]   I muse, and my spirit faints.
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.040]   You have held my eyelids open.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.000]   I am so troubled that I cannot speak.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.040]   I give thought to the days of old, the years of long ago.
[00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.360]   I remember my music in the night.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.600]   I am musing with my heart, and my spirit is searching.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.160]   Will the Lord reject evermore?
[00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.120]   And will He not be favorable again?
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.400]   Has His loving kindness ceased forever?
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.520]   Has His word ended from generation to generation?
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.080]   Has God forgotten to be gracious?
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.600]   Or has He in anger shut up His compassion?
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.800]   Then I said, "It is my grief that the right hand of the Most High has changed.
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.840]   I shall remember the deeds of YAH.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.160]   Surely I will remember your wonders of old.
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.480]   I will meditate on all your work and muse on your deeds.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.400]   O God, your way is holy.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.120]   What God is great like God.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.480]   You are the God who works wonders.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.040]   You have made known your strength among the peoples.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.400]   You have by your arm redeemed your people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.760]   The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you.
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.320]   They were in anguish.
[00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.320]   The deeps also trembled.
[00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.040]   The clouds poured out water.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.240]   The skies gave forth a sound.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.720]   Your arrows went here and there.
[00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.840]   The sound of your thunder was in the whirlwind.
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.160]   The lightnings lit up the world.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.000]   The earth trembled and shook.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.280]   Your way was in the sea and your paths in the mighty waters, but your footprints were
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.200]   not known.
[00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.760]   You led your people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760]   Amen.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   Amen.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.760]   Amen.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:24.760]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
