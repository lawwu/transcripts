[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   The last tactic in this section is backup flights.
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:05.700]   And so if you have enough points and miles in different programs,
[00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.300]   especially now that a lot of programs have very, very flexible cancellation policies,
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.180]   I will every now and then, when I think it might be necessary, book a backup flight.
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.840]   We've all probably been at the airport in a scenario where a flight was canceled or significantly delayed.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:26.300]   If you already have a backup booked and that backup can be canceled up until departure for no penalty,
[00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.880]   there's not a lot of reason not to do it as long as you don't need those points and miles.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.160]   And so I remember when we were coming back from Hawaii, I just booked a second flight.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.980]   Just in case we show up and something was canceled and we wanted to get home, we had it.
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.720]   Turns out nothing was wrong, canceled the flight, got all the points back.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.700]   Again, keep in mind, transfers to programs are irreversible.
[00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.440]   So this doesn't work well if you want to make sure you keep your points as flexible as possible.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.600]   But if you already have points, especially in programs like Delta, American, Alaska, and United,
[00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.360]   where booking and canceling has no penalties and no fees,
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.600]   then this is something I use all the time just to make sure we're backed up.
