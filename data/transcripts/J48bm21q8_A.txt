[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960]   The following is a conversation with Barry Barish,
[00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.440]   a theoretical physicist at Caltech,
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.280]   and the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.360]   for his contributions to the LIGO detector
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.760]   and the observation of gravitational waves.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.080]   LIGO, or the Laser Interferometer
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.200]   Gravitational Wave Observatory,
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.380]   is probably the most precise measurement device
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.240]   ever built by humans.
[00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.120]   It consists of two detectors
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.520]   with four kilometer long vacuum chambers
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.240]   situated 3,000 kilometers apart,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.360]   operating in unison to measure a motion
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.220]   that is 10,000 times smaller than the width of a proton.
[00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.720]   It is the smallest measurement ever attempted by science,
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.840]   a measurement of gravitational waves
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.260]   caused by the most violent and cataclysmic events
[00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.560]   in the universe,
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.080]   occurring over tens of millions of light years away.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.600]   To support this podcast,

[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.400]   This is the Lex Friedman Podcast,
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.140]   and here is my conversation with Barry Barish.
[00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.080]   You've mentioned that you were always curious
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.360]   about the physical world,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.600]   and that an early question you remember stood out
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.200]   where you asked your dad,
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.400]   "Why does ice float on water?"
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:19.800]   And he couldn't answer.
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.320]   And this was very surprising to you.
[00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.560]   So you went on to learn why.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.920]   Maybe you can speak to what are some early questions
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.760]   in math and physics that really sparked your curiosity?
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.800]   - Yeah, that memory is
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.240]   kind of something I use to illustrate
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.200]   something I think that's common in science,
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.340]   is that people that do science somehow have maintained,
[00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.000]   maintained something that kids always have.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.120]   A small kid, eight years old or so,
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.000]   asks you so many questions usually,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.760]   typically that you consider them pests,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.160]   tell them to stop asking so many questions.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:08.000]   And somehow our system manages to kill that in most people.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.460]   So in school, we make people do study and do their things,
[00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.040]   but not to pester them by asking too many questions.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.680]   And I think, not just myself,
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.840]   but I think it's typical of scientists like myself
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.920]   that have somehow escaped that.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.280]   Maybe we're still children,
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.080]   or maybe we somehow didn't get it beaten out of us.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.580]   But I think it's, I teach in college level,
[00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.640]   and it's, to me, one of the biggest deficits
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.340]   is the lack of curiosity, if you want,
[00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.520]   that we've beaten out of them,
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.520]   'cause I think it's an innate human quality.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.600]   - Is there some advice or insights you can give
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.240]   to how to keep that flame of curiosity going?
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.280]   - I think it's a problem of both parents,
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.800]   and the parents should realize
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.480]   that's a great quality we have,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.120]   that you're curious and that's good.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.880]   Instead, we have expressions like curiosity killed the cat.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.960]   And more, but I mean, basically,
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.160]   it's not thought to be a good thing.
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.140]   You get, curiosity killed the cat means
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.240]   if you're too curious, you get in trouble.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.560]   - I don't like cats anyway, so maybe it's a good thing.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.000]   - Yeah, yeah, that, to me, needs to be solved,
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.520]   really, in education and in homes.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.540]   That realization that there's certain human qualities
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.320]   that we should try to build on and not destroy,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.720]   one of them is curiosity.
[00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.160]   Anyway, back to me and curiosity,
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.760]   I was a pest and asked a lot of questions.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.000]   My father generally could answer them at that age.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.800]   And the first one I remember that he couldn't answer
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.600]   was not a very original question,
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:56.520]   but basically that ice is made out of water,
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.500]   and so why does it float on water?
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.320]   And he couldn't answer it.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.160]   And it may not have been the first question,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.400]   it's the first one that I remember.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.880]   And that was the first time that I realized
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   that to learn and answer your own curiosity or questions,
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   there's various mechanisms.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.720]   In this case, it was going to the library
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.080]   or asking people who know more and so forth,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.600]   but eventually you do it by what we call research.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.280]   But it's driven by,
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.800]   if you're, hopefully you ask good questions,
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.000]   if you ask good questions
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.360]   and you have the mechanisms to solve them,
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.360]   then you do what I do in life, basically.
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.680]   Not necessarily physics,
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.560]   and it's a great quality in humans and we should nurture it.
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.960]   - Do you remember any other kind of, in high school,
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.320]   maybe early college, more basic physics ideas
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.880]   that sparked your curiosity
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.400]   or mathematics or science in general?
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.400]   - I wasn't really into science until I got to college,
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.820]   to be honest with you.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.680]   But just staying with water for a minute,
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.160]   I remember that I was curious
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.040]   why, what happens to water?
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.680]   You know, it rains and there's water in a wet pavement
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.120]   and then the pavement dries out.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.240]   What happened to this water that came down?
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.000]   And I didn't know that much.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   And then eventually I learned in chemistry or something,
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.600]   water's made out of hydrogen and oxygen.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.680]   Those are both gases,
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.800]   so how the heck does it make this substance, this liquid?
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   (both laugh)
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.180]   - Yeah, so that has to do with states of matter.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.280]   I know perhaps LIGO and the thing
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.760]   for which you've gotten the Nobel Prize
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:49.400]   and the things much of your life work
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.000]   perhaps was a happy accident in some sense
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.040]   in the early days,
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.200]   but is there a moment where you looked up to the stars
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:59.800]   and also the same way you wondered about water,
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.120]   wondered about some of the things
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:03.480]   that are out there in the universe?
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:07.600]   - Oh yeah, I think everybody looks and is in awe
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   and is curious about what it is out there.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.560]   And as I learned more, I learned, of course,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.960]   that we don't know very much about what's there.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.400]   And the more we learn, the more we know we don't know.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.760]   I mean, we don't know what the majority
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.360]   of anything is out there.
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.680]   It's all what we call dark matter, dark energy.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.480]   And that's one of the big questions.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.120]   20 years when I was a student, those weren't questions.
[00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.120]   So we even know less in a sense
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.000]   the more we look.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.400]   So of course, I think that's one of the areas
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.960]   that almost it's universal.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.680]   People see the sky, they see the stars
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.840]   and they're beautiful and see it looks different
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:51.920]   on different nights.
[00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:54.800]   And it's a curiosity that we all have.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:59.240]   - What are some questions about the universe
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:03.280]   that in the same way that you felt about the ice,
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.760]   that today, you mentioned to me offline,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:08.760]   you're teaching a course on the frontiers of science,
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:10.360]   frontiers of physics.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:12.920]   What are some questions, outside the ones
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.420]   we'll probably talk about, that kind of,
[00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:21.920]   yeah, fill you with, get your flame of curiosity up
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:26.680]   and firing up, fill you with awe?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.520]   - Well, first I'm a physicist, not an astronomer.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.480]   So I'm interested in the physical phenomenon, really.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   So the question of dark matter and dark energy,
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:39.680]   which we probably won't talk about,
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:43.200]   are recent, they're in the last 20, 30 years,
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.420]   or certainly dark energy.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.880]   Dark energy is a complete puzzle.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.520]   It goes against what you will ask me about,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.720]   which is general relativity
[00:07:53.720 --> 00:07:55.840]   and Einstein's general relativity.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.120]   It basically takes something that he thought was,
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.240]   what he called a constant, which isn't,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.160]   and if that's even the right theory,
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:10.840]   and it represents most of the universe.
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.760]   And then we have something called dark matter,
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.280]   and there's good reason to believe
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:18.720]   it might be an exotic form of particles.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.280]   And that is something I've always worked on,
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.320]   on particle accelerators and so forth.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.440]   And it's a big puzzle, what it is.
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.040]   It's a bit of a cottage industry
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.820]   in that there's lots and lots of searches.
[00:08:30.820 --> 00:08:34.120]   But it may be a little bit like,
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.840]   looking for a treasure under rocks or something.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.320]   It's hard to, we don't have really good guidance,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.480]   except that we have very, very good information
[00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.500]   that it's pervasive and it's there.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.800]   And that it's probably particles, small,
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.220]   that evidences all of those things.
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.440]   But then the most logical solution doesn't seem to work,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.040]   something called supersymmetry.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:05.560]   - And do you think the answer could be
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   something very complicated?
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.840]   - You know, I like to hope that,
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.420]   think that most things that appear complicated
[00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:17.560]   are actually simple, if you really understand them.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:21.360]   I think we just don't know at the present time,
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.680]   and it isn't something that affects us.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.480]   It does affect, it affects how the stars
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:29.160]   go around each other and so forth,
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.400]   'cause we detect that there's missing gravity.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.520]   But it doesn't affect everyday life at all.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   I tend to think and expect, maybe,
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.600]   and that the answers will be simple,
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.500]   we just haven't found it yet.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.140]   - Do you think those answers might change
[00:09:47.140 --> 00:09:51.240]   the way we see other sources of gravity, black holes,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:56.240]   the way we see the parts of the universe that we do study?
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.400]   - It's conceivable.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:01.440]   The black holes that we've found in our experiment,
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.040]   and we're trying now to understand the origin of those,
[00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:10.500]   it's conceivable, but not, doesn't seem the most likely
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.280]   that they were primordial,
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:14.280]   that is, they were made at the beginning.
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.480]   And in that sense, they could represent
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.840]   at least part of the dark matter.
[00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:20.280]   So there can be connections.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.880]   Dark black holes, or how many there are,
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:25.640]   how much of the mass they encompass
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.520]   is still pretty primitive, we don't know.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:30.560]   - So before I talk to you more about black holes,
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.380]   let me take a step back to,
[00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:34.800]   I actually went to high school in Chicago,
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:39.800]   and would go to take classes at Fermilab,
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.320]   watch the buffalo and so on.
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.960]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:45.820]   - So let me ask about, you mentioned that Enrico, for me,
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.400]   was somebody who was inspiring to you
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.880]   in a certain kind of way.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.560]   Why is that, can you speak to that?
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:53.920]   - Sure.
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:55.680]   He was amazing, actually.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.600]   He's the last, this is not the,
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.080]   I'll come to the reason in a minute,
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.020]   but he had a big influence on me at a young age.
[00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:11.480]   But he was the last physicist of note
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.360]   that was both an experimental physicist
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.720]   and a theorist at the same time.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:20.520]   And he did two amazing things within months.
[00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:25.520]   In 1933, we didn't really know what the nucleus was,
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:32.560]   what radioactive decay was, what beta decay was,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:36.480]   when electrons come out of a nucleus.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.840]   And near the end of 1933,
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:45.560]   the neutron had just been discovered,
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.400]   and that meant that we knew a little bit more
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:49.040]   about what the nucleus is,
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:51.440]   that it's made out of neutrons and protons.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.120]   The neutron wasn't discovered till 1932.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.160]   And once we discovered that there was a neutron and proton,
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:00.600]   and they made the nucleus,
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:02.840]   and then there are electrons that go around,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:05.080]   the basic ingredients were there.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:09.600]   And he wrote down not only just the theory,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   a theory, but a theory that lasted decades
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.240]   and has only been improved on of beta decay,
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.320]   that is, the radiation.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.320]   He did this, came out of nowhere,
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:24.360]   and it was a fantastic theory.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:27.460]   He submitted it to "Nature" magazine,
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:32.460]   which was the primary best place to publish even then.
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.680]   And it got rejected as being too speculative.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:42.400]   And so he went back to his drawing board in Rome
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.920]   where he was, added some to it, made it even longer,
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.680]   'cause it's really a classic article,
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:53.680]   and then published it in the local Italian journal
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.720]   for physics and the German one.
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:01.040]   At the same time, in January of 1932,
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.440]   Giulio and Curie, for the first time,
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.600]   saw artificial radioactivity.
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.160]   This was an important discovery
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.640]   because radioactivity had been discovered much earlier.
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.880]   And they had X-rays, and you shouldn't be using them,
[00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:19.000]   but there was radioactivity.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.040]   People knew it was useful for medicine.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:25.440]   But radioactive materials are hard to find,
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:27.040]   and so it wasn't prevalent.
[00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:29.920]   But if you could make them, then they had great use.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:34.420]   And Giulio and Curie were able to bombard aluminum
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:38.120]   or something with alpha particles
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:41.560]   and find that they excited something
[00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:46.280]   that decayed and had some half-life and so forth,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.960]   meaning it was the artificial version,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:51.680]   or let's call it not a natural version,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   an induced version of radioactive materials.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:14:02.320]   And Fermi somehow had the insight,
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:06.980]   and I still can't see where he got it,
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:09.560]   that the right way to follow that up
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.920]   was not using charged particles like alphas and so forth,
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.800]   but use these newly discovered neutrons
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:19.440]   as the bombarding particle.
[00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:21.440]   Seemed impossible.
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:22.980]   They barely had been seen.
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:26.480]   It was hard to get very many of them.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:28.820]   But it had the advantage that they don't,
[00:14:28.820 --> 00:14:34.660]   they're not charged, so they go right into the nucleus.
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:37.720]   And that turned out to be the experimental work
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:40.700]   that he did that won him the Nobel Prize.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:43.080]   And it was the first step in fission,
[00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:45.640]   discovery of fission.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:48.840]   And he did this two completely different things,
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:52.200]   an experiment that was a great idea
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:55.000]   and a tremendous implementation,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.760]   because how do you get enough neutrons?
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:01.040]   And then he learned quickly that not only do you want
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.260]   neutrons, but you want really slow ones.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.000]   He learned that experimentally,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.840]   and he learned how to make slow ones,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.740]   and then they were able to make,
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:14.740]   go through the periodic table and make lots of particles.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:17.120]   He missed on fission at the moment,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.920]   but he had the basic information,
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.920]   and then fission followed soon after that.
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:23.040]   - Forgive me for not knowing,
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:27.700]   but is the birth of the idea of bombarding neutrons,
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:33.360]   is that an experimental idea?
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:34.840]   Was it born out of an experiment,
[00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:35.880]   he just observed something,
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.240]   or is this an Einstein-style idea
[00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:40.760]   where you come up from basic intuition?
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.120]   - I think it took a combination,
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.700]   because he realized that neutrons had a characteristic
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:50.160]   that would allow them to go all the way into the nucleus
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.720]   when we didn't really understand
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.820]   what the structure was of all this.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:16:00.080]   So that took an understanding or recognition
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.120]   of the physics itself of how a neutron interacts
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.800]   compared to say an alpha particle
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.440]   that Giulio and Curie had used.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:11.960]   And then he had to invent a way to have enough neutrons,
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.760]   and he had a team of associates,
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.960]   and he pulled it off quite quickly.
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.840]   So it was pretty astounding.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:25.020]   - And probably, maybe you can speak to it,
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:28.720]   his ability to put together the engineering aspects
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:31.280]   of great experiments and doing the theory,
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.760]   they probably fed each other.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:36.360]   I wonder, can you speak to why we don't see more of that?
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:38.540]   Is that just really difficult to do?
[00:16:38.540 --> 00:16:40.120]   - It's difficult to do, yeah.
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:44.320]   I think in both theory and experiment,
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.540]   in physics anyway,
[00:16:45.540 --> 00:16:51.480]   it was conceivable if you had the right person to do it,
[00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.920]   and no one's been able to do it since.
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:55.020]   So I had the dream that that was
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.880]   what I was gonna be like, Fermi.
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.320]   - So you love both sides of it, the theory and the experiment.
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.320]   - Yeah, I never liked the idea that you did experiments
[00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.040]   without really understanding the theory,
[00:17:04.040 --> 00:17:07.920]   or the theory should be related very closely to experiments.
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.480]   And so I've always done experimental work
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.140]   that was closely related to the theoretical ideas.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:16.760]   - I think I told you I'm Russian,
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:18.720]   so I'm gonna ask some romantic questions.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:23.260]   But is it tragic to you that he's seen
[00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:25.360]   as the architect of the nuclear age,
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:28.640]   that some of his creations led to potentially,
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.640]   some of his work has led to potentially still
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:36.000]   the destruction of the human species,
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.920]   some of the most destructive weapons?
[00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:39.740]   - Yeah.
[00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:43.600]   I think even more general than him,
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.320]   I gave you all the virtues of curiosity a few minutes ago.
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:49.380]   There's an interesting book
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.280]   called "The Ratchet of Curiosity."
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   You know, a ratchet is something that goes in one direction.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:58.880]   And that is written by a guy who's probably a sociologist
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:00.720]   or philosopher or something.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:04.440]   And he picks on this particular problem, but other ones,
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:07.520]   and that is the danger of knowledge, basically.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:10.200]   You're curious, you learn something.
[00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:12.520]   So it's a little bit like curiosity killed the cat.
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.400]   You have to be worried about whether you can handle
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.840]   new information that you get.
[00:18:16.840 --> 00:18:19.660]   So in this case, the new information had to do
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:23.000]   with really understanding nuclear physics.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.200]   And that information, maybe we didn't have
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.200]   the sophistication to know how to keep it under control.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.400]   Yeah, and Fermi himself was a very apolitical person.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:40.200]   So he wasn't very driven by,
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.480]   or at least he appears in all of his writing,
[00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:44.680]   the writing of his wife,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.380]   the interactions that others had with him
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.100]   as either he avoided it all or he was pretty apolitical.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.120]   I mean, he just saw the world through
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.240]   kind of the lens of a scientist.
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.520]   But he asked if it's tragic.
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:19:01.960]   The bomb was tragic, certainly on Japan,
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.520]   and he had a role in that.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:06.660]   So I wouldn't want it as my legacy, for example.
[00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.160]   - I mean, but brought it to the human species
[00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:14.280]   that it's the ratchet of curiosity that we,
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.180]   we do stuff just to see what happens.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.200]   That curiosity, that in sort of my area
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:27.440]   of artificial intelligence, that's been a concern.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:29.960]   There, on a small scale, on a silly scale,
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:33.280]   perhaps currently, there's constantly
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.160]   unintended consequences.
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.920]   You create a system and you put it out there
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.040]   and you have intuitions about how it will work.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.500]   You have hopes how it will work,
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.520]   but you put it out there just to see what happens.
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:45.360]   - Yeah.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.840]   - And in most cases, because artificial intelligence
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:49.780]   is currently not super powerful,
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.780]   it doesn't create large-scale negative effects.
[00:19:54.780 --> 00:19:58.060]   But that same curiosity, as it progresses,
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.560]   might lead to something that destroys the human species.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.840]   And the same may be true for bioengineering.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.840]   There's people that engineer viruses
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:14.920]   to protect us from viruses, to see how do,
[00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:17.880]   how close is this to mutating so it can jump to humans?
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   Or going, or engineering defenses against those.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.380]   And it seems exciting, and the application,
[00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.880]   the positive applications are really exciting at this time,
[00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:33.120]   but we don't think about how that runs away
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:34.580]   in decades to come.
[00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.500]   - Yeah, and I think it's the same idea
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.700]   as this little book, "The Ratchet of Science,"
[00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.300]   the ratchet of curiosity.
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:47.420]   I mean, whether you pursue, take curiosity
[00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:51.300]   and let artificial intelligence or machine learning
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.500]   run away with having its solutions to whatever you want,
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.820]   or we do it, is, I think, a similar consequence.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:03.700]   - I think, from what I've read about Enrico Fermi,
[00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:08.340]   he became a little bit cynical about the human species
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:09.940]   towards the end of his life,
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.080]   both having observed what he observed.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.860]   - Well, he didn't write much.
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:15.860]   I mean, he died young.
[00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.540]   He died soon after the World War.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:24.620]   There was already the work by Teller
[00:21:24.620 --> 00:21:26.540]   to develop the hydrogen bomb,
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:28.900]   and I think he was a little cynical of that,
[00:21:28.900 --> 00:21:32.220]   pushing it even further, and the rising tensions
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.220]   between the Soviet Union and the US,
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:36.460]   and it looked like an endless thing.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:38.980]   But he didn't say very much, but a little bit,
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.820]   as you said, that--
[00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.700]   - Yeah, there's a few clips to sort of maybe pick
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.260]   on a bad mood, but in a sense that,
[00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.860]   almost like a sadness, a melancholy sadness,
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   to a hope that waned a little bit about that,
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:59.540]   perhaps we can do, like, this curious species
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.320]   can find the way out.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.080]   - Well, especially, I think, people who worked
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.080]   like he did at Los Alamos and spent years of their life
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:09.060]   somehow had to convince themselves
[00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:12.740]   that dropping these bombs would bring lasting peace.
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:13.580]   - Yes, and it did.
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.900]   - And it didn't, yeah.
[00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:19.620]   - As a small interesting aside,
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.500]   it'd be interesting to hear if you have opinions on this,
[00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:26.060]   his name is also attached to the Fermi Paradox,
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:29.300]   which asks if there's, you know,
[00:22:29.300 --> 00:22:31.100]   with, it's a very interesting question,
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:35.540]   which is, it does seem, if you sort of reason, basically,
[00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:39.300]   that there should be a lot of alien civilizations out there
[00:22:39.300 --> 00:22:43.820]   if the human species, if Earth is not that unique,
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:47.400]   by basic, no matter the values you pick,
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.200]   it's likely that there's a lot of alien civilizations
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:53.620]   out there, and if that's the case,
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.220]   why have they not at least obviously visited us
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:00.820]   or sent us loud signals that everybody can hear?
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:03.960]   - Fermi's quoted as saying, sitting down at lunch,
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:08.960]   I think it was with Teller and Herb York,
[00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:13.660]   who was kind of one of the fathers of the atomic bomb,
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:15.500]   and he sat down and he says something like,
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:16.860]   "Where are they?"
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:17.780]   - Yeah.
[00:23:17.780 --> 00:23:20.100]   - Which meant, where are these other,
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.100]   and then he did some numerology where he calculated,
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.660]   you know, how many, what they knew about how many
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:33.220]   galaxies there are and how many stars
[00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.540]   and how many planets there are like the Earth
[00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:36.780]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:40.500]   That's been done much better by somebody named Drake,
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:42.460]   and so people usually refer to the,
[00:23:42.460 --> 00:23:44.180]   I don't know whether it's called the Drake formula
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:46.660]   or something, but it has the same conclusion.
[00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:49.260]   The conclusion is it would be a miracle
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:51.860]   if there weren't other, you know,
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:55.180]   the statistics are so high that how can we be singular
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:56.020]   and separate?
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:24:01.700]   That, so probably there is,
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:04.580]   well, there's almost certainly life somewhere.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:07.300]   Maybe there was even life on Mars a while back,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:12.300]   but intelligent life, probably white,
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.340]   or we saw, so, you know, the statistics say that.
[00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:19.060]   Communicating with us, I think that it's harder
[00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:20.600]   than people think.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:27.820]   We might not know the right way to expect the communication,
[00:24:27.820 --> 00:24:34.280]   but all the communication that we know about,
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:35.780]   travels at the speed of light,
[00:24:35.780 --> 00:24:40.340]   and we don't think anything can go faster
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:41.180]   in the speed of light.
[00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:44.220]   That limits the problem quite a bit,
[00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.940]   and it makes it difficult to have any
[00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:49.420]   back and forth communication.
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.140]   You could send signals like we try to or look for,
[00:24:53.140 --> 00:24:55.500]   but to have any communication, it's pretty hard
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.700]   when it has to be close enough that the speed of light
[00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.180]   would mean we could communicate with each other,
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:05.720]   and I think, and we didn't even understand that.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:07.960]   I mean, we're an advanced civilization,
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.660]   but we didn't even understand that
[00:25:09.660 --> 00:25:12.900]   a little more than 100 years ago.
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:17.900]   So, are we just not advanced enough, maybe,
[00:25:17.900 --> 00:25:22.720]   to know something about that's the speed of light?
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.560]   Maybe there's some other way to communicate
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.000]   that isn't based on electromagnetism.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.760]   I don't know.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:31.960]   Gravity seems to be also have the same speed.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.360]   That was a principle that Einstein had,
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.800]   and something we've measured, actually.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.640]   - So, is it possible, I mean,
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.760]   so we'll talk about gravitational waves,
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:45.760]   and in some sense, there's a brainstorming going on,
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:50.440]   which is like, how do we detect the signal?
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:51.840]   Like, what would a signal look like,
[00:25:51.840 --> 00:25:52.960]   and how would we detect it?
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.440]   And that's true for gravitational waves.
[00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:57.600]   That's true for basically any physics phenomena.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:25:59.640]   You have to predict that that signal should exist.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.980]   You have to have some kind of theory
[00:26:00.980 --> 00:26:03.280]   and model why that signal should exist.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.360]   I mean, is it possible that aliens
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:07.400]   are communicating with us via gravity?
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   Like, why not?
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:15.020]   - Well, yeah, it's true, why not?
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:17.280]   For us, it's very hard to detect
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.080]   these gravitational effects.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.560]   They have to come from something pretty,
[00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:24.120]   that has a lot of gravity, like black holes.
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:27.460]   But we're pretty primitive at this stage.
[00:26:29.340 --> 00:26:34.200]   There's very reputable physicists
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.680]   that look for a fifth force,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:38.120]   one that we haven't found yet.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.320]   Maybe it's the key.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:42.440]   - What would that look like?
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.200]   What would a fifth force of physics look like, exactly?
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.160]   - Well, usually, they think it's probably a long-range,
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.400]   longer-range force than we have now.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:55.500]   But there are reputable colleagues of mine
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:58.240]   that spend their life looking for a fifth force.
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:27:00.140]   - So, longer-range than gravity?
[00:27:00.140 --> 00:27:01.820]   Is it like super long?
[00:27:01.820 --> 00:27:04.020]   - It doesn't fall off like one over r-squared,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.580]   but maybe separately.
[00:27:06.580 --> 00:27:10.740]   Gravity, Newton taught us, goes like inversely,
[00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.180]   one over the square of the distance apart you are.
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.420]   So, it falls pretty fast.
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:15.240]   - That's okay.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.820]   So, now we have a theory of what consciousness is.
[00:27:16.820 --> 00:27:19.940]   It's just the fifth force of physics.
[00:27:19.940 --> 00:27:20.780]   - Yeah.
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:21.600]   - There we go.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.680]   That's a good hypothesis.
[00:27:26.260 --> 00:27:31.260]   Speaking of gravity, what are gravitational waves?
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.340]   This may be start from the basics.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:37.720]   - We learned gravity from Newton, right?
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:39.640]   You and you were young.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.620]   You were told that if you jumped up,
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:42.920]   the Earth pulled you down.
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:47.300]   And when the apple falls out of the tree,
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:48.720]   the Earth pulls it down.
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:52.420]   And maybe you even asked your teacher why,
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:55.600]   but most of us accepted that.
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:57.800]   That was Newton's picture,
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.720]   the apple falling out of the tree.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.280]   But Newton's theory never told you
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:04.400]   why the apple was attracted to the Earth.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.980]   That was missing in Newton's theory.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.200]   Newton's theory also,
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:12.900]   Newton recognized at least one of the two problems,
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:13.740]   I'll tell you.
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:15.540]   One of them is, there's more than those,
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.520]   but one is, why does the Earth,
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:22.360]   what's the mechanism by which the Earth pulls the apple
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:25.500]   or holds the moon when it goes around, whatever it is?
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:27.800]   That's not explained by Newton,
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:30.960]   even though he has the most successful theory of physics ever
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:35.040]   went 200 and some years with nobody ever seeing a violation.
[00:28:35.040 --> 00:28:38.080]   - But he accurately describes the movement of an object
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:41.080]   falling down to Earth, but he's not answering why that,
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:43.120]   what's, 'cause it's a distance, right?
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:46.900]   - He gives a formula, which it's a product
[00:28:46.900 --> 00:28:50.140]   of the Earth's mass, the apple's mass,
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.920]   inversely proportional to the square
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:53.440]   of the distance between,
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.400]   and then the strength he called capital G,
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:58.480]   the strength he couldn't determine,
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.080]   but it was determined 100 years later.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.160]   But no one ever saw a violation of this
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.120]   until a possible violation, which Einstein fixed,
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.240]   which was very small,
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:10.680]   that has to do with Mercury going around the sun,
[00:29:10.680 --> 00:29:14.320]   the orbit being slightly wrong,
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:17.800]   if you calculate it by Newton's theory.
[00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   But so, like most theories then in physics,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.480]   you can have a wonderful one like Newton's theory,
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:30.480]   it isn't wrong, but you have to have an improvement on it
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:33.900]   to answer things that it can't answer.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:37.680]   And in this case, Einstein's theory is the next step.
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:41.240]   We don't know if it's anything like a final theory
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:45.520]   or even the only way to formulate it either,
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.520]   but he formulated this theory, which he released in 1915.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:55.320]   He took 10 years to develop it,
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.600]   even though in 1905, he solved three or four
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:00.320]   of the most important problems in physics
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.420]   in a matter of months,
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:03.480]   and then he spent 10 years on this problem
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.300]   before he let it out, and this is called general relativity,
[00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:10.520]   it's a new theory of gravity, 1915.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:15.520]   In 1916, Einstein wrote a little paper
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:21.520]   where he did not do some fancy derivation,
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.520]   instead he did, what I would call it,
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:31.080]   he used his intuition, which he was very good at too,
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:37.040]   and that is he noticed that if he wrote the formulas
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:40.120]   for general relativity in a particular way,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.220]   they looked a lot like the formulas
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:43.900]   for electricity and magnetism.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:48.680]   Being Einstein, he then took the leap
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.680]   that electricity and magnetism,
[00:30:50.680 --> 00:30:53.200]   we discovered only 20 years before that,
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.360]   in the 1880s, have waves.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:59.600]   Of course, that's light and electromagnetic waves,
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.560]   radio waves, everything else.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:04.880]   So he said if the formulas look similar,
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.600]   then gravity probably has waves too.
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.080]   - That's such a big leap, by the way,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.440]   I mean, maybe you can correct me,
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:15.080]   but that just seems like a heck of a leap.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:18.960]   - Yeah, and it was considered to be a heck of a leap.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:22.800]   So first, that paper was, except for this intuition,
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:27.800]   was poorly written, had a serious mistake,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:31.240]   it had a factor of two wrong in the strength of gravity,
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:34.440]   which meant if we used those formulas, we would,
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.440]   and two years later, he wrote a second paper
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.720]   and in that paper, it turns out to be important for us
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:47.880]   because in that paper, he not only fixed his factor
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.160]   of two mistake, which he never admitted,
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:53.840]   he just wrote it, fixed it like he always did,
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:58.360]   and then he told us how you make gravitational waves,
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.080]   what makes gravitational waves.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.480]   And you might recall in electromagnetism,
[00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:06.800]   we make electromagnetic waves in a simple way,
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.160]   you take a plus charge and minus charge,
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.360]   you oscillate like this
[00:32:10.360 --> 00:32:12.800]   and that makes electromagnetic waves.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:15.760]   And a physicist named Hertz made a receiver
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:18.960]   that could detect the waves and put it in the next room.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:21.140]   He saw them and moved forward and backward
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.160]   and saw that it was wave-like.
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:27.880]   So Einstein said it won't be a dipole like that,
[00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:29.360]   it'll be a four-pole thing,
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.400]   and that's what, it's called a quadrupole moment
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.640]   that gives the gravitational wave.
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.240]   So he saw that again by insight, not by derivation.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.480]   That set the table for what you needed to do to do it.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:44.640]   At the same time, in the same year,
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.080]   Schwarzschild, not Einstein,
[00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.440]   said there were things called black holes.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.720]   So it's interesting that that came the same.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.640]   - So what year was that?
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:54.660]   - 1915.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.140]   - It was in parallel.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:33:00.160]   I should probably know this,
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.760]   but did Einstein not have an intuition
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.320]   that there should be such things as black holes?
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:05.840]   - That came from Schwarzschild.
[00:33:05.840 --> 00:33:07.320]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:09.400]   - Yeah, so Schwarzschild,
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.160]   who was a German theoretical physicist,
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:15.080]   he got killed in the war, I think,
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.600]   in the First World War two years later or so.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:21.760]   He's the one that proposed black holes,
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   that there were black holes.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.380]   - That feels like a natural conclusion
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:27.200]   of general relativity, no?
[00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:28.040]   Or is that not?
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:30.600]   - Well, it may seem like it,
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:32.560]   but I don't know about a natural conclusion.
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:36.760]   It's a result of curved space-time, though.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:39.000]   - Right, but it's such a weird result
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:41.640]   that you might have to, it's a special--
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.720]   - Yeah, it's a special case.
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:46.920]   So I don't know.
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.120]   Anyway, Einstein then,
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.640]   an interesting part of the story
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.920]   is that Einstein then left the problem.
[00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:57.360]   Most physicists, because it really wasn't derived,
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:59.920]   he just made this, didn't pick up on it,
[00:33:59.920 --> 00:34:01.560]   or general relativity much,
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:05.720]   because quantum mechanics became the thing in physics.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.720]   And Einstein only picked up this problem again
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:12.640]   after he immigrated to the US.
[00:34:12.640 --> 00:34:15.420]   So he came to the US in 1932,
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:19.160]   and I think in 1934 or '35,
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.980]   he was working with another physicist called Rosen,
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:24.520]   who he did several important works with,
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:26.840]   and they revisited the question.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   And they had a problem that most of us as students
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.560]   always had, that studied general relativity.
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.320]   General relativity's really hard
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.620]   because it's four-dimensional instead of three-dimensional.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:41.280]   And if you don't set it up right,
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:44.720]   you get infinities, which don't belong there.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:48.560]   We call them coordinate singularities as a name.
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.260]   But if you get these infinities,
[00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:52.040]   you don't get the answers you want.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:55.960]   And he was trying to derive now,
[00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:59.560]   general relativity from general relativity,
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:01.160]   gravitational waves.
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:04.320]   And in doing it, he kept getting these infinities.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.560]   And so he wrote a paper with Rosen
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:11.000]   that he submitted to our most important journal,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.080]   Physical Review Letters.
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:17.960]   And that when it was submitted to Physical Review Letters,
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   it was entitled, "Do Gravitational Waves Exist?"
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.600]   A very funny title to write
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   20 years after he proposed they exist.
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:29.760]   But it's because he had found these singularities,
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:31.840]   these infinities.
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:36.840]   And so the editor at that time,
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:41.920]   and part of it that I don't know is peer review.
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:45.200]   We live and die by peer review as scientists
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:46.480]   send our stuff out.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:49.600]   We don't know when peer review actually started
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.200]   or what peer review Einstein ever experienced
[00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.280]   before this time.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.500]   But the editor of Physical Review sent this out for review.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:35:59.780]   He had a choice.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.200]   He could take any article and just accept it.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:05.640]   He could reject it or he could send it for review.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:07.120]   - Right, I believe the editors
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:08.600]   used to have much more power.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:09.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:12.040]   And he was a young man, his name was Tate.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.360]   And he ended up being editor for years.
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.160]   But so he sent this for review
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:22.120]   to a theoretical physicist named Robertson
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.160]   who was also in this field of general relativity
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.060]   who happened to be on sabbatical at that moment at Caltech.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:31.080]   Otherwise his institution was Princeton
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:33.740]   where Einstein was.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:38.320]   And he saw that the way they set up the problem,
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.800]   the infinities were like I make it as a student
[00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.160]   'cause if you don't set it up right in general relativity,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.480]   you get these infinities.
[00:36:46.480 --> 00:36:51.040]   And so he reviewed the article and gave an illustration
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:52.000]   that if they set it up
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   on what are called cylindrical coordinates,
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.080]   these infinities went away.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.900]   The editor of Physical Review
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.420]   was obviously intimidated by Einstein.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:05.540]   He wrote this really not a letter back
[00:37:05.540 --> 00:37:07.180]   like I would get saying,
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.900]   you're screwed up in your paper.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.620]   Instead, it was kind of,
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:16.540]   what do you think of the comments of our referee?
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:20.620]   Einstein wrote back, it's a well-documented letter,
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.940]   wrote back a letter to Physical Review
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:26.220]   saying I didn't send you the paper
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.440]   to send it to one of your so-called experts,
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:30.360]   I sent it to you to publish.
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.640]   I withdraw the paper.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:37.360]   And he never published again in that journal.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.560]   That was 1936.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.320]   Instead, he rewrote it
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:45.120]   with the fixes that were made,
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:47.840]   changed the title and published it
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:50.520]   in what was called the Franklin Review
[00:37:50.520 --> 00:37:55.160]   which is the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.540]   which is Benjamin Franklin Institute
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:00.480]   which doesn't have a journal now but did at that time.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.020]   So the article is published.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.700]   It's the last time he ever wrote about it.
[00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:06.740]   It remained controversial.
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:11.740]   So it wasn't until close to 1960, 1958
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.940]   where there was a conference
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:20.500]   that brought together the experts in general relativity
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.380]   to try to sort out whether there was
[00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:27.780]   whether it was true
[00:38:27.780 --> 00:38:30.180]   that there were gravitational waves or not.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:34.180]   And there was a very nice derivation
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:39.180]   by a British theorist from the heart of the theory
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:42.460]   that gets gravitational waves.
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.780]   And that was number one.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.500]   The second thing that happened at that meeting
[00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.020]   is Richard Feynman was there.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:53.260]   And Feynman said, well, if there's typical Feynman,
[00:38:53.260 --> 00:38:54.980]   if there's gravitational waves,
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:57.020]   they need to be able to do something.
[00:38:57.020 --> 00:38:58.700]   Otherwise, they don't exist.
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:00.540]   So they have to be able to transfer energy.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:04.180]   So he made a idea of a Gedanken experiment
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.460]   that is just a bar with a couple of rings on it.
[00:39:08.460 --> 00:39:11.060]   And then if a gravitational wave goes through it,
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:12.320]   distorts the bar.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:17.180]   And that creates friction on these little rings.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:19.180]   And that's heat and that's energy.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.580]   So that meant--
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:21.660]   - Is that a good idea?
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:22.820]   It sounds like a good idea.
[00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.300]   - Yeah, it means that he showed
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:28.260]   that with the distortion of space-time,
[00:39:28.260 --> 00:39:31.620]   you could transfer energy just by this little idea.
[00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:33.620]   And it was shown theoretically.
[00:39:33.620 --> 00:39:38.620]   So at that point, it was believed theoretically
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:43.340]   then by people that gravitational waves should exist.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.620]   - No, we should be able to detect them.
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:47.100]   - We should be able to detect them,
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.660]   except that they're very, very small.
[00:39:50.660 --> 00:39:53.140]   - So what kind of, there's a bunch of questions here,
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:58.140]   but what kind of events would generate gravitational waves?
[00:39:58.140 --> 00:40:01.340]   - You have to have this, what I call quadrupole moment.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:06.220]   That comes about if I have, for example,
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:08.580]   two objects that go around each other like this,
[00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:13.300]   like the Earth around the Sun or the Moon around the Earth.
[00:40:13.300 --> 00:40:15.680]   Or in our case, it turns out to be two black holes
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.660]   going around each other like this.
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:18.700]   - So how's that different
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:20.780]   than basic oscillation back and forth?
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:22.300]   Is it just more common in nature to have--
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.100]   - Oscillation is a dipole moment.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.620]   - So it has to be in three-dimensional space
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.740]   and kind of oscillation.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:28.940]   - So you have to have something that's three-dimensional
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:31.580]   that'll give what I call a quadrupole moment
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:33.140]   that's just built into this.
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.380]   - And luckily in nature, you have stuff--
[00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:37.460]   - And luckily, things exist.
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:40.340]   And it is luckily because the effect is so small
[00:40:40.340 --> 00:40:43.420]   that you could say, look, I can take a barbell
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:49.060]   and spin it, right, and detect the gravitational waves.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:52.300]   But unfortunately, no matter how much I spin it,
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:54.220]   how fast I spin it-- - Oh, interesting.
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.900]   - So I know how to make gravitational waves,
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.700]   but they're so weak, I can't detect them.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.060]   So we have to take something that's stronger
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.120]   than I can make.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.980]   Otherwise, we would do what Hertz did
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:06.580]   for electromagnetic waves, go in our lab,
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:09.060]   take a barbell, put it on something, spin it.
[00:41:09.060 --> 00:41:10.100]   - Can I ask a dumb question?
[00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:14.140]   So a single object that's weirdly shaped,
[00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:15.660]   does that generate gravitational waves?
[00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:18.900]   So if it's rotating?
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.580]   - Sure, it-- - But it's just
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:23.020]   much weaker signal. - It's weaker.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:25.380]   Well, we didn't know what the strongest signal would be
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.840]   that we would see.
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:30.380]   We targeted seeing something called neutron stars,
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:31.700]   actually, because black holes,
[00:41:31.700 --> 00:41:32.980]   we don't know very much about.
[00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.740]   It turned out we were a little bit lucky.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:37.900]   There was a stronger source, which was the black holes.
[00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.840]   - Well, another ridiculous question.
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:42.920]   So you say waves.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.600]   What does a wave mean?
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.880]   Like the most ridiculous version of that question is,
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.000]   what does it feel like to ride a wave
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:54.960]   as you get closer to the source?
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:57.920]   Or experience it?
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.880]   - Well, if you experience a wave,
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:02.180]   imagine that this is what happens to you.
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:04.960]   I don't know what you mean by getting close.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.280]   It comes to you.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.760]   So it's like this light wave or something
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.600]   that comes through you.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:14.880]   So when the light hits you, it makes your eyes detect it.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.240]   I flashed it.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:17.120]   What does this do?
[00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:20.960]   It's like going to the amusement park,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.440]   and they have these mirrors.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.800]   You look in this mirror, and you look short and fat,
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:28.160]   and the one next to you makes you tall and thin, okay?
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.760]   Imagine that you went back and forth
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:33.480]   between those two mirrors once a second.
[00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:35.120]   That would be a gravitational wave
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:36.800]   with a period of once a second.
[00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:40.360]   If you did it 60 times a second, go back and forth.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.720]   And then that's all that happens.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.880]   It makes you taller and shorter and fatter back and forth
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:47.640]   as it goes through you
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.280]   at the frequency of the gravitational wave.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.840]   So the frequencies that we detect
[00:42:52.840 --> 00:42:56.200]   are higher than one a second, but that's the idea.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:59.480]   So, and the amount is small.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.440]   - Amount is small, but if you're closer
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:07.440]   to the source of the wave, is it the same amount?
[00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:11.000]   - Yeah, it doesn't dissipate.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.160]   - It doesn't dissipate.
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:16.040]   Okay, so it's not that fun of an amusement ride.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:19.000]   - Well, it does dissipate, but it doesn't,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.520]   it doesn't, it's just, it's proportional to the distance.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.360]   - Right, it's not--
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.360]   - It's not a big power or something.
[00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.080]   - Gotcha, so, but it would be a fun ride
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:31.960]   if you get a little bit closer, or a lot closer.
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.040]   I mean, like, I wonder what the,
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:36.800]   okay, this is a ridiculous question, but I have you here.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:38.240]   (laughs)
[00:43:38.240 --> 00:43:40.840]   Like, the getting fatter and taller,
[00:43:40.840 --> 00:43:44.840]   I mean, that experience, for some reason,
[00:43:44.840 --> 00:43:45.960]   that's mind-blowing to me,
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:50.960]   'cause it brings the distortion of space-time to you.
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:55.400]   I mean, space-time is being morphed, right?
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.280]   Like, this is a wave. - That's right.
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:43:59.880]   - That, how, that's so weird.
[00:43:59.880 --> 00:44:01.280]   - And we're in space, so we're affected by it.
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:03.880]   - Yeah, we're in space, and now it's moving.
[00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:06.040]   I don't know what to do with it.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.280]   - I mean, does it, okay.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:10.360]   How much do you think about
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:14.760]   the philosophical implications of general relativity?
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.280]   Like, that we're in space-time,
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.560]   and it can be bent by gravity?
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:24.080]   Like, is that just what it is?
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:26.440]   Are we supposed to be okay with this?
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.600]   'Cause, like, Newton, even Newton is a little weird, right?
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:31.320]   But that at least, like, makes sense.
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.160]   That's our physical world.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:36.600]   You know, when an apple falls, it makes sense.
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.680]   But, like, the fact that entirety
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:42.360]   of the space-time we're in can bend.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:46.200]   - Well-- - That's, that's,
[00:44:46.200 --> 00:44:47.040]   that's really mind-blowing.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.560]   - Well, let me make another analogy.
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:51.080]   - This is a therapy session for me at this point.
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.040]   - Yeah, right, another analogy.
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:53.880]   - Thank you.
[00:44:53.880 --> 00:44:56.120]   - So, imagine you have a trampoline.
[00:44:56.120 --> 00:44:56.960]   - Yes.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.600]   - Okay.
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.720]   What happens if you put a marble on a trampoline?
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:02.080]   Doesn't do anything, right?
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:03.760]   - No.
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:04.800]   - Just sit. - Maybe a little bit,
[00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:05.760]   but not much.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.480]   - Yeah, I mean, just if I drop it,
[00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.320]   it's not gonna go anywhere.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.840]   Now, imagine I put a bowling ball
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:12.440]   at the center of the trampoline.
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:15.640]   Now, I come up to the trampoline,
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:17.880]   and I put a marble on, what happens?
[00:45:17.880 --> 00:45:21.560]   - It'll roll towards the bowling ball.
[00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:24.640]   - All right, so what's happened is the presence
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:29.080]   of this massive object distorted the space
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.820]   that the trampoline did.
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.000]   This is the same thing that happens
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.400]   to the presence of the earth, the earth and the apple.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:40.240]   The presence of the earth affects the space around it,
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:43.960]   just like the bowling ball on the trampoline.
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:45.640]   - Yeah, this doesn't make me feel better.
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:48.240]   I'm referring from the perspective of an ant
[00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.140]   walking around on that trampoline.
[00:45:50.140 --> 00:45:54.720]   Then some guy just dropped a ball,
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:56.520]   and not only dropped a ball, right?
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.000]   It's not just dropping a bowling ball.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:02.300]   It's making the ball go up and down,
[00:46:02.300 --> 00:46:04.600]   or doing some kind of oscillation thing,
[00:46:04.600 --> 00:46:06.540]   where it's like waves.
[00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:08.460]   And that's so fundamentally different
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.660]   from the experience on being on flatland
[00:46:10.660 --> 00:46:12.460]   and walking around and just finding
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.660]   delicious sweet things as ant does.
[00:46:14.660 --> 00:46:16.380]   And it just feels like, to me,
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:18.340]   from a human experience perspective,
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.900]   completely, it's humbling.
[00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:22.740]   It's truly humbling.
[00:46:22.740 --> 00:46:25.100]   - It's humbling, but we see that kind of phenomenon
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:25.940]   all the time.
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:29.040]   Let me give you another example.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:33.040]   Imagine that you walk up to a still pond.
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:33.880]   - Yes.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:34.700]   - Okay?
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:39.240]   Now I throw, you throw a rock in it, what happens?
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.120]   The rock goes in, sinks to the bottom, fine,
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.800]   and these little ripples go out, and they travel out.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.360]   That's exactly what happens.
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:52.000]   I mean, there's a disturbance, which is these safe,
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.600]   the bowling ball, or black holes,
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:58.060]   and then the ripples, they go out in the water.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:46:59.960]   They're not, they don't have any,
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:02.600]   they don't have the rock, any pieces of the rock.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:04.400]   - You see, the thing is, I guess,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:08.220]   what's not disturbing about that is it's a,
[00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:11.160]   I mean, it's a, I guess, a flat, two-dimensional surface
[00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:12.780]   that's being disturbed.
[00:47:12.780 --> 00:47:15.400]   Like, for a three-dimensional surface,
[00:47:15.400 --> 00:47:19.920]   three-dimensional space to be disturbed feels weird.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:20.900]   - It's even worse.
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:23.520]   It's four-dimensional, because it's space and time.
[00:47:23.520 --> 00:47:24.920]   - Yeah.
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.600]   - So that's why you need Einstein,
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:28.120]   is to make it four-dimensional.
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:29.400]   - To make it okay?
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:30.800]   - No, to make it.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:32.240]   - To make it four-dimensional?
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.480]   - Yeah, to take the same phenomenon
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.440]   and look at it in all of space and time.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:43.440]   Anyway, luckily for you and I and all of us,
[00:47:43.440 --> 00:47:46.220]   the amount of distortion is incredibly small.
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:52.400]   So it turns out that if you think of space itself,
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.360]   now this is gonna blow your mind too,
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:56.680]   if you think of space as being like a material,
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:59.960]   like this table, it's very stiff.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.080]   You know, we have materials that are very pliable,
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.720]   materials that are very stiff.
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.560]   So space itself is very stiff.
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:08.600]   So when gravitational waves come through it,
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:11.200]   luckily for us, it doesn't distort it so much
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.880]   that it affects our ordinary life very much.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:18.000]   - No, I mean, that's great.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.080]   That's great, I thought there was something bad coming.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:20.920]   No, this is great. - No, not bad.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:21.760]   - That's great news.
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:25.400]   So I mean, perhaps we evolved as life on Earth
[00:48:25.400 --> 00:48:30.480]   to be such that for us, this particular set
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:35.480]   of effects of gravitational waves is not that significant.
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.280]   Maybe that's why-- - It is.
[00:48:37.280 --> 00:48:42.280]   You probably used this effect today or yesterday.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.640]   So it's pervasive.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:47.040]   Well-- - You mean gravity
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.640]   or the way, or external?
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:51.440]   'Cause I only-- - Curvature of space
[00:48:51.440 --> 00:48:53.400]   and time. - Curvature of space, how?
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:55.800]   I only care personally as a human, right?
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.920]   The gravity of Earth.
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:59.080]   - But you use it every day almost.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.800]   - Oh, it's curving. - Because, no, no, no.
[00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:04.360]   It's in this thing.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:07.040]   Every time it tells you where you are.
[00:49:07.040 --> 00:49:09.960]   How does it tell you where you are?
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:12.840]   It tells you where you are because we have 24 satellites
[00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:15.640]   or some number that are going around in space
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:20.400]   and it asks how long it takes the being
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:23.320]   to go to the satellite and come back the signal
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:26.200]   to different ones and then it triangulates
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:27.440]   and tells you where you are.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.720]   And then if you go down the road,
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:30.120]   it tells you where you are.
[00:49:30.120 --> 00:49:32.760]   Do you know that if you did that with the satellites
[00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:35.040]   and you didn't use Einstein's equations--
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:37.280]   - Oh, no, you wouldn't-- - You won't get
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.240]   the right answer, that's right.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:43.640]   And in fact, if you take a road that's say 10 meters wide,
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.720]   I've done these numbers, and you ask how long
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:49.020]   you'd stay on the road if you didn't make the correction.
[00:49:49.020 --> 00:49:52.400]   For general relativity, this thing you're poo-pooing,
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:55.560]   'cause you're using every day, you'd go off the road
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.600]   a minute. - You'd go off the road.
[00:49:56.600 --> 00:49:57.440]   Well, actually, that might be my problem.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:50:00.640]   - So you use it, so don't poo-poo it.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:02.320]   - Well, I think I'm using an Androids,
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.120]   and maybe, and the GPS doesn't work that well,
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.240]   so maybe I'm using Newton's physics,
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:08.400]   so I need to upgrade to general relativity.
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:14.280]   So, gravitational waves and Einstein had,
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:17.440]   wait, Feynman really does have a part in this story?
[00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:20.500]   Was that one of the first kind of experimental
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.180]   proposed detect gravitational waves?
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:24.500]   - Well, he did what we call a Godunkin experiment,
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:27.700]   that's a thought experiment, okay, not a real experiment.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:31.020]   But then, after that, then people believe
[00:50:31.020 --> 00:50:32.860]   gravitational waves must exist.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:35.940]   You can kind of calculate how big they are, there's tiny.
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:38.200]   And so, people started searching.
[00:50:38.200 --> 00:50:41.000]   The first idea that was used was Feynman's idea,
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.200]   oh, a variant of it.
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:48.060]   And it was to take a great big, huge bar of aluminum,
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:52.920]   and then put around, and it's made like a cylinder,
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:56.120]   and then put around it some very, very sensitive detectors
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:59.440]   so that if a gravitational wave happened to go through it,
[00:50:59.440 --> 00:51:01.600]   it would go (mimics electric shock)
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:04.860]   and you'd detect the extra strain that was there.
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:09.320]   And that was this method that was used until we came along.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   It wasn't a very good method to use.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.560]   - And what was the, so we're talking about
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.040]   a pretty weak signal here.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.400]   - Yeah, that's why that method didn't work.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:22.820]   - So what, can you tell the story of figuring out
[00:51:22.820 --> 00:51:25.560]   what kind of method would be able to detect
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:28.980]   this very weak signal of gravitational waves?
[00:51:28.980 --> 00:51:35.180]   - So, remembering what happens when you go
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:39.620]   to the amusement park, that it's gonna do something like
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.720]   stretch this way and squash that way,
[00:51:41.720 --> 00:51:44.080]   squash this way and stretch this way.
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:48.360]   We do have an instrument that can detect that kind of thing.
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:49.960]   It's called an interferometer.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:56.040]   And what it does is it just basically takes usually light,
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:51:59.760]   and the two directions that we're talking about,
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:02.060]   you send light down one direction
[00:52:02.060 --> 00:52:04.320]   and the perpendicular direction.
[00:52:04.320 --> 00:52:08.280]   And if nothing changes, it takes the same,
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.960]   and the arms are the same length.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.040]   It just goes down, bounces back.
[00:52:13.040 --> 00:52:16.000]   And if you invert one compared to the other, they cancel.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.800]   So there's nothing happens.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.280]   But if it's like the amusement park
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.520]   and one of the arms got, you know, it got shorter and fatter
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:25.960]   so it took longer to go horizontally
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.700]   than it did to go vertically.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:31.000]   Then when they come back, when the light comes back,
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.400]   that comes back somewhat out of time.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:37.040]   And that basically is the scheme.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:42.040]   The only problem is that that's not done very accurately
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:45.920]   in general, and we had to do it extremely accurately.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:50.920]   - So what's the difficulty of doing so accurately?
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:56.800]   - Okay, so the measurement that we have to do
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:52:58.760]   is a distortion in time.
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:00.440]   How big is it?
[00:53:00.440 --> 00:53:04.160]   One, it's a distortion that's one part in 10 to the 21.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:06.120]   That's 21 zeros and a one.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.400]   Okay? - Wow.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:11.840]   And so this is like a delay in the thing coming back?
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.760]   - It's one of them coming back after the other one,
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:19.020]   but the difference is just one part in 10 to the 21.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:23.320]   So for that reason, we make it big.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.720]   Let the arms be long.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.980]   Okay, so one part in 10 to the 21.
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:31.280]   In our case, it's kilometers long.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.120]   So we have an instrument that's like kilometers
[00:53:33.120 --> 00:53:35.000]   in one direction, kilometers in the other.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.440]   - How many kilometers are we talking about?
[00:53:36.440 --> 00:53:37.440]   Four kilometers?
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:39.400]   - Four kilometers in each direction.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:44.600]   If you take then one part in 10 to the 21,
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.840]   we're talking about measuring something
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:51.460]   to 10 to the minus 18 meters.
[00:53:51.460 --> 00:53:54.880]   (Lex laughing)
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:55.720]   - Okay.
[00:53:55.720 --> 00:53:58.200]   - Now to tell you how small that is,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.000]   the proton thing we're made of,
[00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:03.040]   which you can't go and grab so easily,
[00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.560]   is 10 to the minus 15 meters.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.720]   So this is one 1,000th the size of a proton.
[00:54:08.720 --> 00:54:10.560]   That's the size of the effect.
[00:54:10.560 --> 00:54:15.160]   Einstein himself didn't think this could be measured.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.520]   Have you ever seen?
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.640]   Actually, he said that,
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:22.720]   but that's because he didn't anticipate modern lasers
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:25.900]   and techniques that we developed.
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:31.720]   - Okay, so maybe can you tell me a little bit
[00:54:31.720 --> 00:54:33.160]   what you're referring to as LIGO,
[00:54:33.160 --> 00:54:37.400]   the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory.
[00:54:37.400 --> 00:54:39.520]   What is LIGO?
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:42.040]   Can you just elaborate kind of the big picture view here
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:44.320]   before I ask you specific questions about it?
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.720]   - Yeah, so in the same idea that I just said,
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:52.560]   we have two long vacuum pipes,
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.820]   10 to four kilometers long, okay?
[00:54:55.820 --> 00:55:00.580]   We start with a laser beam and we divide the beam
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:02.920]   going down the two arms,
[00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:04.840]   and we have a mirror at the other end,
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:06.560]   reflects it back.
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:09.600]   It's more subtle, but we bring it back.
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:12.560]   If there's no distortion in space-time
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:14.120]   and the lengths are exactly the same,
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.120]   which we calibrate them to be,
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:17.520]   then when it comes back,
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:20.880]   if we just invert one signal compared to the other,
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.040]   they'll just cancel.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.900]   So we see nothing, okay?
[00:55:24.900 --> 00:55:28.240]   But if one arm got a little bit longer than the other,
[00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:30.480]   then they don't come back at exactly the same time.
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:31.920]   They don't exactly cancel.
[00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.080]   That's what we measure.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:37.440]   So to give a number to it,
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:40.040]   we have to do that to,
[00:55:40.040 --> 00:55:42.240]   we have the change of length
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.920]   to be able to do this 10 to the minus 18 meters
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:48.080]   to one part in 10 to the 12th.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.280]   And that was the big experimental challenge
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.280]   that required a lot of innovation to be able to do.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:59.640]   - You gave a lot of credit to, I think,
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:02.680]   Caltech and MIT for some of the technical developments
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.400]   within this project.
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:07.120]   Is there some interesting things you can speak to
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:12.600]   at the low level of some cool stuff that had to be solved?
[00:56:12.600 --> 00:56:14.040]   Like what are we talking?
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.920]   I'm a software engineer, so all of this,
[00:56:16.920 --> 00:56:19.200]   I have so much more respect for everything done here
[00:56:19.200 --> 00:56:20.520]   than anything I've ever done.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.560]   So it's just code.
[00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:26.360]   - So I'll give you an example of doing
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:32.360]   mechanical engineering at a better,
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.960]   at a basically mechanical engineering and geology
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:37.860]   and maybe at a level.
[00:56:37.860 --> 00:56:40.560]   So what's the problem?
[00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.000]   The problem is the following,
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.280]   that I've given you this picture of an instrument
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.400]   that by some magic, I can make good enough
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:49.880]   to measure this very short distance.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:53.400]   But then I put it down here, it won't work.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.240]   And the reason it doesn't work
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:58.300]   is that the earth itself is moving all over the place
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:56:59.400]   all the time.
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:01.720]   You don't realize it, it seems pretty good to you.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:02.560]   - I get it.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.840]   - But it's moving all the time.
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:08.360]   So somehow it's moving so much that we can't deal with it.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:11.700]   We happen to be trying to do the experiment here on earth,
[00:57:11.700 --> 00:57:12.980]   but we can't deal with it.
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:17.720]   So we have to make the instrument isolated from the earth.
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:18.900]   - Oh no.
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:21.520]   - At the frequencies we're at, we've got to float it.
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.680]   That's a mechanical, that's an engineering problem,
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:24.840]   not a physics problem.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:27.560]   - So when you actually, like we're doing,
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.640]   we're having a conversation on a podcast right now,
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:33.160]   there's, and people who record music work with this,
[00:57:33.160 --> 00:57:34.880]   how to create an isolated room.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:39.240]   And they usually build a room within a room,
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.940]   but that's still not isolated.
[00:57:40.940 --> 00:57:43.080]   In fact, they say it's impossible to truly isolate
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:45.940]   from sound, from noise and stuff like that.
[00:57:45.940 --> 00:57:50.940]   But that's like one step of millions that you took
[00:57:50.940 --> 00:57:55.040]   is building a room inside a room.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:56.920]   You basically have to isolate all.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.960]   - Now this is actually an easier problem.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.680]   It's just have to do it really well.
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.920]   So making a clean room is really a tough problem
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:06.120]   because you have to put a room inside a room.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   You have to, this is really simple engineering, our physics.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.360]   Okay, so what do you have to do?
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.520]   How do you isolate yourself from the earth?
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:21.520]   First, we work at, we're not looking at all frequencies
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:22.560]   for gravitational waves.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.280]   We're looking at particular frequencies
[00:58:25.280 --> 00:58:27.680]   that you can deal with here on earth.
[00:58:27.680 --> 00:58:29.480]   So what frequencies would those be?
[00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:32.320]   You were just talking about frequencies.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:35.400]   - I mean, I don't-- - We know by evolution.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:39.600]   Our bodies know, it's the audio band, okay?
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.840]   The reason our ears work where they work
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.580]   is that's where the earth isn't going,
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.120]   making too much noise.
[00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:47.560]   - Okay, so the reason our ears work the way they work
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:49.640]   is 'cause this is where it's quiet.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:50.920]   - That's right.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:55.920]   So if you go to one hertz instead of 10 hertz,
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.600]   it's the earth is really moving around.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.000]   So somehow we live in a, what we call the audio band.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.480]   It's tens of hertz to thousands of hertz.
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:09.520]   That's where we live, okay?
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.000]   If we're gonna do an experiment on the earth--
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.880]   - Might as well do it in the-- - It's the same frequency.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.400]   That's where the earth is the quietest.
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.120]   So we have to work in that frequency.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:21.240]   So we're not looking at all frequencies, okay?
[00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:25.620]   So the solution for the shaking of the earth
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:28.680]   to get rid of it is pretty mundane.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:32.520]   If we do the same thing that you do
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:35.640]   to make your car drive smoothly down the road.
[00:59:35.640 --> 00:59:38.900]   So what happens when your car goes over a bump?
[00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:41.360]   Early cars did that, they bounced.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:43.900]   Okay, but you don't feel that in your car.
[00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:46.440]   So what happened to that energy?
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:48.240]   You can't just disappear energy.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.520]   So we have these things called shock absorbers in the car.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.760]   What they do is they absorb,
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:56.480]   they take the thing that went like that
[00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.760]   and they basically can't get rid of the energy
[00:59:58.760 --> 01:00:01.960]   but they move it to very, very low frequency.
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:06.960]   So what you feel isn't, you feel it go smoothly, okay?
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:13.520]   All right, so we also work at this frequency.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.960]   So we basically, why don't we have to do anything
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:19.240]   other than shock absorbers?
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:23.900]   So we made the world's fanciest shock absorbers, okay?
[01:00:23.900 --> 01:00:28.340]   Not just like in your car where there's one layer of them.
[01:00:28.340 --> 01:00:30.440]   They're just the right squishiness and so forth.
[01:00:30.440 --> 01:00:32.480]   They're better than what's in the cars.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:34.080]   And we have four layers of it.
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:36.680]   So whatever shakes and gets through the first layer,
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.320]   we treat it in a second, third, fourth layer.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:41.360]   - So it's a mechanical engineering problem.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.200]   - Yeah, that's what I said.
[01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.680]   So it's a real--
[01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:45.240]   - There's no weird tricks to it
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:47.520]   like a chemistry type thing or--
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.680]   - No, no, just well, the right squishiness,
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:52.040]   you need the right material inside.
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:55.400]   And ours look like little springs, but they're--
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:57.120]   - Springs, they're springs?
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.000]   So like legitimately like shock absorbers?
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.520]   - Yeah.
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:02.440]   - What?
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:03.280]   Okay.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:07.480]   - Okay, and this is now experimental physics at its limit.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.200]   Okay, so you do this and we make
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.240]   the world's fanciest shock absorbers,
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.440]   just mechanical engineering.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:15.920]   - Just mechanical engineering, this is hilarious.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.200]   - But we weren't good enough
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:20.120]   to discover gravitational waves.
[01:01:20.120 --> 01:01:26.120]   So we did another, we added another feature.
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:30.640]   And it's something else that you're aware of,
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:34.800]   probably have one, and that is to get rid of noise.
[01:01:34.800 --> 01:01:38.440]   You've probably noise, which is you don't like.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:39.920]   And that's the same principle
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:43.080]   that's in these little Bose earphones.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.440]   - Noise canceling?
[01:01:44.440 --> 01:01:45.520]   - Noise canceling.
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:48.200]   So how do they work?
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:50.080]   They basically, you go on an airplane
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:54.360]   and they sense the ambient noise from the engines
[01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:56.640]   and cancel it 'cause it's just the same
[01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.040]   over and over again, they cancel it.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:00.920]   And when the stewardess comes and asks you
[01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:03.680]   whether you want coffee or tea or a drink or something,
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.360]   you hear her fine 'cause she's not ambient,
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.000]   she's a signal, so.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:09.560]   - Are we talking about active canceling?
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.920]   Like where the actual-- - Active canceling.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:13.880]   - So-- - This is, okay.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:14.960]   - So another-- - Don't tell me
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:18.000]   you have active canceling on this.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.080]   - Yeah, yeah. - Besides the shock absorbers.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:23.440]   - So inside this array of shock absorbers,
[01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.240]   you asked for some interesting--
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.960]   - This is awesome. (laughs)
[01:02:27.960 --> 01:02:31.920]   - So inside this, it's harder than the earphone problem,
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.560]   but it's just engineering.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.760]   We have to see, measure not just
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.200]   that the engines still made noise,
[01:02:40.200 --> 01:02:43.320]   but the earth is shaking, it's moving in some direction.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.000]   So we have to actually tell not only
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:47.520]   that there's noise and cancel it,
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.100]   but what direction it's from.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:52.040]   So we put this array of seismometers
[01:02:52.040 --> 01:02:55.760]   inside this array of shock absorbers
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:03:00.760]   and measure the residual motion and its direction.
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:05.680]   And we put little actuators that push back against it
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:06.520]   and cancel it.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.240]   - This is awesome.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.200]   So you have the actuators and you have the thing
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.120]   that is sensing the vibrations,
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.520]   and then you have the actuators that adjust to that
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:18.440]   and do so in perfect synchrony.
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:19.920]   - Yeah. - What--
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:21.080]   - If it all works right.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:24.080]   And so how much do we reduce the shaking of the earth?
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.400]   - I mean-- - One part in 10 to the 12th.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:32.260]   - One part in 10-- - So what gets through us
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.160]   is one part in 10 to the 12th.
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:38.920]   That's pretty big reduction.
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:41.160]   You don't need that in your car, but that's what we do.
[01:03:41.160 --> 01:03:43.400]   And so that's how isolated we are from the earth.
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   And that was the biggest, I'd say, technical problem
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.280]   outside of the physics instrument, the interferometer.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:53.040]   - Can I ask you a weird question here?
[01:03:53.040 --> 01:03:55.760]   You make it very poetically and humorously.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:58.880]   You're saying it's just a mechanical engineering problem,
[01:03:58.880 --> 01:04:02.880]   but is this one of the biggest precision
[01:04:04.800 --> 01:04:07.600]   mechanical engineering efforts ever?
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.880]   I mean, this seems exceptionally difficult.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.400]   - It is, and so it took a long time.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:16.960]   And I think nobody seems to challenge the statement
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:19.800]   that this is the most precise instrument
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.640]   that's ever been built, LIGO.
[01:04:21.640 --> 01:04:25.160]   - I wonder what listening to Led Zeppelin sounds
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.280]   on this thing, 'cause it's so isolated.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.200]   I mean, this is like, I don't know.
[01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:34.000]   - No background noise. - No back, it's, wow.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.480]   - Wow, wow.
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:40.040]   So when you were first conceiving this,
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:44.320]   I would probably, if I was knowledgeable enough,
[01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:48.240]   kind of laugh off the possibility that this is even possible.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:53.200]   I'm sure, like how many people believe that this is possible?
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.960]   Did you believe this was possible?
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:55.800]   - I did.
[01:04:55.800 --> 01:04:58.400]   I didn't know that we needed,
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.400]   for sure that we needed active when we started.
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:03.120]   We did just passive, but we were doing the,
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:07.000]   tests to develop the active,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:09.680]   to add as a second stage, which we ended up needing.
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:13.320]   But there was a lot of, you know,
[01:05:13.320 --> 01:05:15.680]   now there was a lot of skepticism.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:18.440]   A lot of us, especially astronomers,
[01:05:18.440 --> 01:05:20.560]   felt that money was being wasted,
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:22.560]   as we were also expensive.
[01:05:22.560 --> 01:05:24.440]   Doing what I told you is not cheap.
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.960]   So it was kind of controversial.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.400]   It was funded by the National Science Foundation.
[01:05:30.800 --> 01:05:33.600]   - Can you just linger on this just for a little longer?
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:36.000]   The actuator thing, the active canceling.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:42.040]   Do you remember like little experiments
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.200]   that were done along the way to prove to the team,
[01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:47.800]   to themselves that this is even possible?
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.560]   So from our, because I work with quite a bit of robots,
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:54.320]   and to me, the idea that you could do it this precisely
[01:05:54.320 --> 01:05:57.720]   is humbling and embarrassing, frankly.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.360]   Because like, this is another level of precision
[01:06:02.360 --> 01:06:07.360]   that I can't even, 'cause robots are a mess.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:12.400]   And this is basically one of the most precise robots ever.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.560]   Right, so like, is there,
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.600]   do you remember any like small-scale experiments
[01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.000]   that were done that just made this as possible?
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.800]   - Yeah, and larger scale.
[01:06:22.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   We made a test, that also has to be in vacuum, too,
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:31.760]   but we made test chambers that had this system in it,
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:34.840]   our first mock of this system, so we could test it.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:40.160]   And optimize it and make it work.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:42.080]   But it's just a mechanical engineering problem.
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:45.160]   - Okay. (laughs)
[01:06:45.160 --> 01:06:47.600]   Humans are just ape descendants, I gotcha.
[01:06:47.600 --> 01:06:49.760]   I gotcha.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.560]   Is there any video of this?
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:56.280]   Like some kind of educational purpose visualizations
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:06:58.240]   of this active canceling?
[01:06:58.240 --> 01:07:00.400]   - I don't think so.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.040]   - I mean, does this live on?
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.560]   - Well, we worked for parts of it, for the active canceling,
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:10.920]   we worked for the instruments,
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:12.880]   for the sensor and instruments,
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:17.600]   we worked with a small company near where you are,
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:20.160]   'cause it was our MIT people that got them,
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.760]   that were interested in the problem
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:25.320]   because they thought they might be able to commercialize it
[01:07:25.320 --> 01:07:29.360]   for making staple tables to make microelectronics,
[01:07:29.360 --> 01:07:33.240]   for example, which are limited by how stable the table is.
[01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:36.160]   I mean, at this point, it's a little expensive.
[01:07:36.160 --> 01:07:40.000]   - So you never know, you never know where this leads.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.440]   So maybe on the,
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:47.440]   let me ask you, just sticking at it a little longer,
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.000]   this silly old mechanical engineering problem,
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:54.880]   what was, to you, kind of the darkest moment
[01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:59.240]   of what was the hardest stumbling block
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.880]   to get over on the engineering side?
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.040]   Like, was there any time where there was a doubt,
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:05.800]   where it's like, I'm not sure we would be able to do this,
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:09.080]   a kind of a engineering challenge that was hit?
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:09.920]   Do you remember anything like that?
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.760]   - I think the one that,
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:18.200]   my colleague at MIT, Ray Weiss, worked on so hard
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:21.920]   and was much more of a worry than this.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.280]   This is only a question, if you're not doing well enough,
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.120]   you have to keep making it better somehow.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:33.120]   But this whole huge instrument has to be in vacuum.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:37.840]   And the vacuum tanks are this big around.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:41.440]   And so it's the world's biggest high vacuum system.
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:45.100]   And so how do you make it, first of all?
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:50.160]   How do you make this four meter long sealed vacuum system?
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:51.080]   It has to be made out of--
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:52.000]   - Four kilometers long.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.120]   - Four kilometers long, would I say something else?
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:54.960]   - Meters.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.200]   - Four kilometers long.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.040]   - Big difference.
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:09:00.080]   - Yeah, and so, but to make it, yeah,
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:05.000]   we started with a roll of stainless steel,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.680]   and then we roll it out like a spiral
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:11.360]   so that there's a spiral weld on it.
[01:09:11.360 --> 01:09:14.640]   Okay, so the engineering was fine, we did that.
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:17.080]   We worked through very good companies
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:18.860]   and so forth to build it.
[01:09:18.860 --> 01:09:23.860]   But the big worry was, what if you develop a leak?
[01:09:23.860 --> 01:09:29.880]   This is a high vacuum, not just vacuum system.
[01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.400]   Typically in a laboratory, if there's a leak,
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:37.400]   you put helium around the thing you have,
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:41.080]   and then you detect where the helium is coming in.
[01:09:41.080 --> 01:09:42.960]   But if you have something as big as this,
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.560]   you can't surround it with helium.
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.880]   - So you might not actually even know that there's a leak
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:47.960]   and it will be affecting--
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.960]   - Well, we can measure how good the vacuum is,
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:56.400]   so we can know that, but a leak can develop,
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:59.120]   and then we don't, how do we fix it,
[01:09:59.120 --> 01:10:00.800]   or how do we find it?
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:03.640]   And so that was, you asked about a worry,
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.480]   that was always a really big worry.
[01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:09.840]   - What's the difference between a high vacuum and a vacuum?
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:11.320]   What is high vacuum?
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:15.400]   That's like some delta close to vacuum?
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:16.760]   Is it some threshold?
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   - Well, there's a unit, high vacuum is when the vacuum
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:24.040]   and the units that are used, which are TORs,
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.440]   there's 10 to the minus nine.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:26.280]   - Gotcha.
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:31.340]   - High vacuum is usually used in small places.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:35.200]   The biggest vacuum system, period,
[01:10:35.200 --> 01:10:38.320]   is at CERN in this big particle accelerator,
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.840]   but the high vacuum, where they need really good vacuum
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:43.920]   so particles don't scatter in it, is smaller than ours.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.920]   So ours is a really large high vacuum system.
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:50.440]   - I don't know, this is so cool.
[01:10:50.440 --> 01:10:53.440]   I mean, this is basically by far
[01:10:53.440 --> 01:10:57.280]   the greatest listening device ever built by humans.
[01:10:57.280 --> 01:11:01.000]   The fact that like descendants of apes could do this,
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.300]   that evolution started with single cell organisms.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.640]   I mean, is there any more, I'm a huge,
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.240]   theory is like, yeah, yeah, but like bridges,
[01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:13.360]   when I look at bridges from a civil engineering perspective,
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:15.600]   it's one of the most beautiful creations by human beings.
[01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:19.120]   It's physics, you're using physics to construct objects
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.920]   that can support huge amount of mass.
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.080]   And it's like structural, but it's also beautiful
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.460]   in that humans can collaborate to create that
[01:11:26.460 --> 01:11:27.360]   throughout history.
[01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:29.920]   And then you take this on another level.
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:36.040]   This is like, this is like exciting to me beyond measure
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.880]   that humans can create something so precise.
[01:11:39.880 --> 01:11:43.040]   - But another concept lost in this, you just said,
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.760]   you started talking about single cell.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:46.320]   - Yeah. - Okay.
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.480]   You have to realize this discovery that we made
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:50.080]   that everybody's bought off on,
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:55.080]   happened 1.3 billion years ago, somewhere.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.800]   And then the signal came to us.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.840]   1.3 billion years ago, we were just converting on the earth
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:03.520]   from single cell to multi-cell life.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.640]   So when this actually happened,
[01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:09.080]   this collision of two black holes, we weren't here.
[01:12:09.080 --> 01:12:09.920]   We weren't even close to being here.
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.160]   - And we're both developing slowly.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:15.280]   - There were single, yeah, we were going from single cell
[01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.880]   to multi-cell life at that point.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.880]   - All to meet up at this point.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.720]   - Yeah.
[01:12:19.720 --> 01:12:23.540]   - Wow, that's like, that's almost romantic.
[01:12:23.540 --> 01:12:26.040]   - It is.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:30.720]   - Okay, so on the human side of things,
[01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:35.080]   it's kind of fascinating 'cause you're talking about
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   over a thousand people team for LIGO.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:38.920]   - Yeah.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:42.520]   - You started out with around a hundred
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.180]   and you've for parts of the time at least led this team.
[01:12:47.180 --> 01:12:51.160]   What does it take to lead a team like this
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:56.160]   of incredibly brilliant theoreticians and engineers
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:59.400]   and just a lot of different parties involved,
[01:12:59.400 --> 01:13:02.680]   a lot of egos, a lot of ideas.
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:06.000]   You had this funny example, I forget where,
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:09.780]   where in publishing a paper, you have to all agree
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:13.500]   on like the phrasing of a certain sentence
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:15.480]   or the title of the paper and so on.
[01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:17.300]   That's a very interesting, simple example.
[01:13:17.300 --> 01:13:19.300]   I'd love you to speak to that, but just in general,
[01:13:19.300 --> 01:13:23.140]   how, what does it take to lead this kind of team?
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:28.140]   - Okay, I think the general idea is one we all know.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:34.500]   You wanna get where the sum of something
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.440]   is more than the individual parts is what we say, right?
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:40.600]   - Yeah.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:42.120]   - So that's what you're trying to achieve.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:42.960]   - Yes.
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.760]   - Okay, how do you do that actually?
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:49.000]   Mostly if we take multiple objects or people,
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:51.560]   I mean, you put them together, the sum is less.
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.400]   - Yes.
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:53.240]   - Why?
[01:13:53.240 --> 01:13:54.480]   Because they overlap.
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:58.160]   So you don't have individual things that,
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:00.880]   this person does that, this person does that,
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:03.440]   then you get exactly the sum.
[01:14:03.440 --> 01:14:07.040]   But what you want is to develop where you get more
[01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:09.400]   than what the individual contributions are.
[01:14:09.400 --> 01:14:10.520]   We know that's very common.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:13.260]   People use that expression everywhere.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.420]   And it's the expression that has to be kind of built
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.560]   into how people feel it's working.
[01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:23.960]   Because if you're part of a team and you realize
[01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.680]   that somehow the team is able to do more
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.820]   than the individuals could do themselves,
[01:14:28.820 --> 01:14:32.700]   then they buy on kind of in terms of the process.
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:37.700]   So that's the goal that you have to have is to achieve that.
[01:14:37.700 --> 01:14:44.440]   And that means that you have to realize parts
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:50.160]   of what you're trying to do that require,
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:51.840]   not that one person couldn't do it.
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:56.060]   It requires the combined talents to be able to do something
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:58.180]   that neither of them could do themselves.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:15:00.080]   And we have a lot of that kind of thing.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.580]   And I think, I mean, build into some
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:05.460]   of the examples that I gave you.
[01:15:05.460 --> 01:15:10.460]   And so how do you then, so the key almost
[01:15:10.460 --> 01:15:13.980]   in anything you do is the people themselves, right?
[01:15:13.980 --> 01:15:18.980]   So in our case, the first and most important was to attract,
[01:15:18.980 --> 01:15:24.100]   to spend years of their life on this,
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:26.940]   and the best possible people in the world to do it.
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:30.840]   So the only way to convince them is that somehow
[01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:34.840]   it's better and more interesting for them
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:37.040]   than what they could do themselves.
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:40.560]   And so that's part of this idea.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:42.240]   - I got you, yeah, that's powerful.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.160]   But nevertheless, there's best people in the world,
[01:15:45.160 --> 01:15:46.160]   there's egos.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.880]   Is there something to be said about managing egos?
[01:15:48.880 --> 01:15:51.920]   - Oh, that's, the human problem's always the hardest.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:55.840]   And so that's an art, not a science, I think.
[01:15:55.840 --> 01:16:00.380]   I think the fact here that combined,
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:05.380]   there's a romantic goal that we had to do something
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:06.980]   that people hadn't done before,
[01:16:06.980 --> 01:16:11.980]   which was important scientifically and a huge challenge,
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:19.940]   enabled us to say, take and get,
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.680]   I mean, what we did, just to take an example,
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.100]   we used the light to go in this thing, comes from lasers.
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:27.640]   We need a certain kind of laser.
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:30.720]   So the kind of laser that we used,
[01:16:30.720 --> 01:16:35.720]   there were three different institutions in the world
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:37.800]   that had the experts that do this,
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:40.080]   maybe in competition with each other.
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:44.280]   So we got all three to join together and work with us
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.200]   to work on this, as an example.
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:50.500]   So that you had, and they had the thing
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.320]   that they were working together on a kind of object
[01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:55.160]   that they wouldn't have otherwise,
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.460]   and were part of a bigger team
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.280]   where they could discover something
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.080]   that isn't even engineers.
[01:17:01.080 --> 01:17:03.160]   These are engineers that do lasers,
[01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:07.080]   and they're part of our laser physicists.
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   - So could you describe the moment or the period of time
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:18.400]   when finally this incredible creation of human beings
[01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.620]   led to a detection of gravitational waves?
[01:17:21.620 --> 01:17:22.580]   - It's a long story.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:26.020]   Unfortunately, this is a part that we started--
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:28.380]   - Failures along the way kind of thing, or what?
[01:17:28.380 --> 01:17:31.040]   - All failures, that's all, it's built into it.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:31.880]   - Okay.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:32.700]   - If you're not--
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:34.500]   - Just mechanical engineering.
[01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:35.900]   (both laughing)
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:38.380]   - You build on your failures, that's expected.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:40.680]   So we're trying things that no one's done before.
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:43.580]   So it's technically not just gravitational waves,
[01:17:43.580 --> 01:17:46.340]   and so it's built on failures.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.480]   But anyway, we did, before MEVE,
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:54.480]   and the people did R&D on the concepts.
[01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:58.240]   But starting in 1994, we got money
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:01.100]   from the National Science Foundation to build this thing.
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.820]   It took about five years to build it.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:09.820]   So by 1999, we had built the basic unit.
[01:18:09.820 --> 01:18:15.160]   It did not have active seismic isolation at that stage.
[01:18:15.160 --> 01:18:18.360]   It didn't have some other things that we have now.
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.760]   What we did at the beginning was
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:29.640]   stick to technologies that we had at least enough knowledge
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:35.000]   that we could make work or had tested in our own laboratories.
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:37.840]   And so then we put together the instrument,
[01:18:37.840 --> 01:18:39.840]   we made it work.
[01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:41.700]   It didn't work very well, but it worked.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:44.680]   And we didn't see any gravitational waves.
[01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:46.360]   Then we figured out what limited us,
[01:18:46.360 --> 01:18:51.360]   and we went through this every year for almost 10 years,
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:54.080]   never seeing gravitational waves.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:59.080]   We would run it, looking for gravitational waves for months,
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.760]   learn what limited us, fix it for months,
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.320]   and then run it again.
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.680]   Eventually, we knew we had to take another big step,
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:12.160]   and that's when we made several changes,
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:16.400]   including adding these active seismic isolation,
[01:19:16.400 --> 01:19:17.900]   which turned out to be a key.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:23.960]   And we fortunately got the National Science Foundation
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:27.640]   to give us another couple hundred million dollars,
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:31.480]   a hundred million more, and we rebuilt it,
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:34.560]   or fixed, or improved it.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:39.560]   And then in 2015, we turned it on,
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.560]   and we almost instantly saw this first collision
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:51.960]   of two black holes.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:58.600]   And then we went through a process of,
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.240]   do we believe what we've seen?
[01:20:00.240 --> 01:20:02.040]   - Yeah, I think you're one of the people
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:03.080]   that went through that process.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:05.200]   Sounds like some people immediately believed it.
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.040]   - Yeah.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:07.320]   - And then you were like, "It's disgusting."
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.920]   - So as human beings, we all have different reactions
[01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:13.320]   to almost anything, and so quite a few of my colleagues
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:15.560]   had a eureka moment immediately.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.400]   I mean, it's--
[01:20:16.400 --> 01:20:18.360]   - It's amazing.
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:22.600]   - The figure that we put in our paper,
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   first is just data.
[01:20:25.600 --> 01:20:28.920]   We didn't have to go through fancy computer programs
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.080]   to do anything.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:35.080]   And we showed next to it the calculations
[01:20:35.080 --> 01:20:37.760]   of Einstein's equations, and it looks just like
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:38.800]   what we detected.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:39.640]   - Wow.
[01:20:39.640 --> 01:20:41.360]   - And we did it in two different detectors
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:44.760]   halfway across the US, so it was pretty convincing.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:49.800]   But you don't wanna fool yourself.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:54.800]   So we had, being a scientist, we had, for me,
[01:20:54.800 --> 01:20:57.240]   we had to go through and try to understand
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:20:59.040]   that the instrument itself, which was new,
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:02.720]   I said we had rebuilt it, couldn't somehow generate
[01:21:02.720 --> 01:21:04.720]   things that looked like this.
[01:21:04.720 --> 01:21:08.160]   That took some tests, and then the second,
[01:21:08.160 --> 01:21:12.360]   you'll appreciate more, we had to somehow convince ourselves
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.440]   we weren't hacked in some clever way.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.880]   - Cybersecurity question.
[01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:18.480]   - Yeah, even though we're not on the internet.
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.320]   - Yeah, no, it can be physical access too.
[01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:24.400]   Yeah, that's fascinating.
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:26.080]   It's fascinating that you would think about that.
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:29.440]   I mean, not enough.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.520]   I mean, 'cause it matches prediction,
[01:21:35.520 --> 01:21:37.400]   so the chances of it actually being manipulated
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:40.400]   is very, very low, but nevertheless.
[01:21:40.400 --> 01:21:42.960]   - We still could have disgruntled all the graduate students
[01:21:42.960 --> 01:21:45.200]   who had worked with us earlier that--
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:47.600]   - Who want you to, I don't know how that's supposed
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:48.520]   to embarrass you.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:50.760]   I suppose, yeah, I suppose I see,
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:55.520]   but about what I think you said, within a month,
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:57.240]   you kind of convinced yourselves officially.
[01:21:57.240 --> 01:21:59.360]   - Within a month, we convinced ourselves.
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:03.200]   We kept 1,000 collaborators quiet during that time.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:04.400]   Then we spent another--
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:05.240]   - That's funny.
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:09.160]   - Month or so trying to understand what we'd seen
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:12.640]   so that we could do the science with it
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:14.520]   instead of just putting it out to the world
[01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.880]   and let somebody else understand
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:18.960]   that it was two black holes and what it was.
[01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:22.160]   - The fact that 1,000 collaborators were quiet
[01:22:22.160 --> 01:22:23.800]   is a really strong indication
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:25.640]   that this is a really close-knit team.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.860]   - Yeah, and they're around the world.
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:33.160]   - Well, either strong-knit or tight-knit
[01:22:33.160 --> 01:22:36.480]   or a strong dictatorship or something.
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:37.880]   - Yeah, either fear or love.
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:38.960]   You can rule by fear or love.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:39.800]   - Yeah, right.
[01:22:39.800 --> 01:22:41.800]   - You can go back to Machu Belly.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:43.300]   All right, well, this, I mean,
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:48.700]   this is really exciting that that was,
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:52.080]   that's a success story 'cause it didn't have
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.640]   to be a success story, right?
[01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:57.320]   I mean, eventually, perhaps you could say it'll be an event,
[01:22:57.320 --> 01:23:00.080]   but it could have taken it over a century to get there.
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:01.240]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.240]   It's, and it's only downhill now, kind of.
[01:23:06.240 --> 01:23:10.040]   (both laughing)
[01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.320]   - What do you mean it's only,
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:12.600]   you mean with gravitational waves?
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.240]   - Well, yeah, we've now,
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:18.960]   we now, well, now we're off because of the pandemic,
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:20.400]   but when we turned off,
[01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.600]   we were seeing some sort of gravitational wave event
[01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.520]   each week.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.760]   Now we're fixing, we're fixing,
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:31.200]   we're adding features where it'll probably be,
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:32.720]   when we turn back on next year,
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.880]   it'll probably be every one every couple of days,
[01:23:35.880 --> 01:23:37.160]   and they're not all the same.
[01:23:37.160 --> 01:23:40.720]   So it's learning about what's out there in gravity
[01:23:40.720 --> 01:23:42.640]   instead of just optics.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.020]   And so it's all great.
[01:23:46.020 --> 01:23:47.520]   We're only limited by,
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:50.640]   the fantastic thing,
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:53.760]   other than that this is a great field
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.600]   and it's all new and so forth,
[01:23:55.600 --> 01:23:57.520]   is that experimentally,
[01:23:57.520 --> 01:24:02.520]   the great thing is that we're limited by technology
[01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.920]   and technical limitations, not by science.
[01:24:06.920 --> 01:24:12.640]   So the, another,
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:17.640]   a really important discovery that was made before ours
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.240]   was what's called the Higgs boson,
[01:24:19.240 --> 01:24:21.800]   made on the big accelerator at CERN.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:23.280]   You know, this huge accelerator,
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.680]   they discovered a really important thing.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.160]   It's, you know, we have Einstein's equation,
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.000]   E equals MC squared.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:33.360]   So energy makes mass or mass can make energy,
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360]   and that's the bomb.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:38.280]   But the mechanism by which that happens,
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:42.780]   not vision, but how do you create mass from energy,
[01:24:42.780 --> 01:24:49.560]   was never understood until there was a theory of it
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:54.040]   about 70 years ago now.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.560]   And so they discovered it's named after a man named Higgs.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:00.520]   It's called the Higgs boson.
[01:25:00.520 --> 01:25:02.700]   And so it was discovered,
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:04.360]   but since that time,
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.880]   and I worked on those experiments,
[01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:07.720]   since that time,
[01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.040]   they haven't been able to progress very much further,
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:12.120]   a little bit, but not a lot further.
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:14.440]   And the difference is that we're really lucky
[01:25:14.440 --> 01:25:17.360]   in what we're doing,
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:21.640]   in that there you see this Higgs boson,
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.400]   but there's tremendous amount of other physics that goes on,
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:25.720]   and you have to pick out the needle
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.280]   in the haystack kind of physics.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.920]   You can't make the physics go away, it's there.
[01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:34.080]   In our case, we have a very weak signal,
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.360]   but once we get good enough to see it,
[01:25:36.360 --> 01:25:40.080]   it's weak compared to where we've reduced the background,
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:44.000]   but the background is not physics, it's just technology.
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.120]   It's getting ourselves better isolated from the earth
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.640]   or getting a more powerful laser.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   And so since 2015, when we saw the first one,
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:59.020]   we continually can make improvements
[01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:03.200]   that are enabling us to turn this into a real science
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:05.920]   to do astronomy, a new kind of astronomy.
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.720]   It's a little like astronomy.
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.400]   I mean, Galileo started the field.
[01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:16.640]   I mean, he basically took lenses that were made for classes
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:20.280]   and he didn't invent the first telescope,
[01:26:20.280 --> 01:26:25.280]   but made a telescope, looked at Neptune
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:27.720]   and saw that it had four moons.
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:31.120]   That was the birth of not just using your eyes
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:33.800]   to understand what's out there.
[01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:34.720]   And since that time,
[01:26:34.720 --> 01:26:37.200]   we've made better and better telescopes, obviously,
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:39.740]   and astronomy thrives.
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:44.040]   And in a similar way, we're starting to be able to crawl,
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:47.560]   but we're starting to be able to do that
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:49.920]   with gravitational waves.
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:53.560]   And it's gonna be more and more that we can do
[01:26:53.560 --> 01:26:55.600]   as we can make better and better instruments,
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.340]   because as I say, it's not limited by-
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:00.960]   - Physics. - Picking it out of others.
[01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:02.600]   Yeah, it's not limited by the physics.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.880]   - So you have an optimism about engineering,
[01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:09.880]   that as human progress marches on,
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.500]   engineering will always find a way
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:17.380]   to build a large enough device,
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:19.700]   accurate enough device to detect the-
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:21.500]   - As long as it's not limited by physics,
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.740]   yeah, they'll do it.
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:30.340]   - So you, two other folks, and the entire team
[01:27:31.260 --> 01:27:35.440]   won the Nobel Prize for this big effort.
[01:27:35.440 --> 01:27:39.420]   There's a million questions I can ask for,
[01:27:39.420 --> 01:27:41.900]   but looking back,
[01:27:41.900 --> 01:27:51.260]   where does the Nobel Prize fit into all of this?
[01:27:51.260 --> 01:27:54.720]   If you think hundreds of years from now,
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:59.160]   I venture to say that people will not remember
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.740]   the winners of a prize.
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:03.480]   But they'll remember creations like these.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:05.560]   Maybe I'm romanticizing engineering.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:09.440]   But I guess I wanna ask,
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:11.840]   how important is the Nobel Prize in all of this?
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:16.200]   - Well, that's a complicated question.
[01:28:16.200 --> 01:28:20.880]   As a physicist, it's something,
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   if you're trying to win a Nobel Prize, forget it,
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:27.240]   because they give one a year.
[01:28:27.240 --> 01:28:31.140]   So there's been 200 physicists
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:33.340]   who have won the Nobel Prize since 1900.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:36.320]   And so that's, you know,
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:39.300]   so things just have to fall right.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.260]   So your goal cannot be to win a Nobel Prize.
[01:28:42.260 --> 01:28:43.480]   It wasn't my dream.
[01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:49.420]   It's tremendous for science.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.940]   I mean, why the Nobel Prize for a guy
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:55.300]   that made dynamite and stuff is what it is,
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:56.140]   it's a long story.
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:29:00.160]   But it's the one day a year where actually the science
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:04.320]   that people have done is all over the world and so forth.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.360]   Forget about the people again.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.840]   It is really good for science.
[01:29:08.840 --> 01:29:10.040]   - Celebrating science.
[01:29:10.040 --> 01:29:13.760]   - It celebrates science for several days,
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.200]   different fields, chemistry, medicine, and so forth.
[01:29:18.200 --> 01:29:21.680]   And everybody doesn't understand everything about these.
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.280]   They're generally fairly abstract,
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.000]   but then it's on the front page
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.240]   of newspapers around the world.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:29.920]   So it's really good for science.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:32.080]   It's not easy to get science on the front page
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:33.120]   of the New York Times.
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:34.180]   It's not there.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:36.780]   Should be, but it's not.
[01:29:36.780 --> 01:29:42.460]   And so the Nobel Prize is important in that way.
[01:29:42.460 --> 01:29:46.640]   It's otherwise, you know,
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:49.500]   I have a certain celebrity that I didn't have before.
[01:29:52.400 --> 01:29:54.240]   - And now you get to be a celebrity
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:55.440]   that advertises science.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:59.520]   It's a mechanism to remind us how incredible,
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:02.800]   how much credit science deserves in everything we do.
[01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:04.880]   - Well, it has a little bit more.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:07.720]   One thing I didn't expect, which is good,
[01:30:07.720 --> 01:30:12.040]   is that we have a government,
[01:30:12.040 --> 01:30:16.160]   I'm not picking on ours necessarily,
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:17.480]   but it's true of all governments,
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.800]   are not run by scientists.
[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:23.640]   In our case, it's run by lawyers and businessmen.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.200]   Okay?
[01:30:25.200 --> 01:30:27.920]   And at best, they may have an aide or something
[01:30:27.920 --> 01:30:29.560]   that knows a little science.
[01:30:29.560 --> 01:30:34.240]   So our country is, and all countries,
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:39.240]   are hardly to take into account science
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:42.760]   in making decisions.
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.080]   - Yes. - Okay.
[01:30:44.080 --> 01:30:48.240]   And having a Nobel Prize,
[01:30:48.240 --> 01:30:53.240]   the people in those positions actually listen.
[01:30:53.240 --> 01:30:55.800]   So you have more influence.
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:57.640]   I don't care whether it's about global warming
[01:30:57.640 --> 01:30:59.080]   or what the issue is.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.720]   There's some influence which is lacking otherwise.
[01:31:02.720 --> 01:31:06.400]   And people pay attention to what I say.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:07.840]   If I talk about global warming,
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:11.240]   they wouldn't have before I had the Nobel Prize.
[01:31:11.240 --> 01:31:13.880]   - Yeah, this is very true.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:15.720]   You're like the celebrities who talk.
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:19.080]   Celebrity has power.
[01:31:19.080 --> 01:31:20.400]   - Celebrity has power.
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:22.120]   - And that's-- - And that's a good thing.
[01:31:22.120 --> 01:31:23.240]   - That's a good thing, yeah.
[01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.160]   - Singling out people, I mean, on the other side of it,
[01:31:26.160 --> 01:31:29.520]   singling out people has all kinds of,
[01:31:29.520 --> 01:31:32.760]   whether it's for Academy Awards or for this,
[01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.680]   have unfairness and arbitrariness and so forth and so on.
[01:31:36.680 --> 01:31:41.120]   So that's the other side of the coin.
[01:31:41.120 --> 01:31:41.960]   - Just like you said,
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:45.320]   especially with the huge experimental projects like this,
[01:31:45.320 --> 01:31:47.880]   it's a large team and it does,
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:50.240]   the nature of the Nobel Prize is singles out
[01:31:50.240 --> 01:31:52.240]   a few individuals to represent the team.
[01:31:52.240 --> 01:31:55.560]   Nevertheless, it's a beautiful thing.
[01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:59.600]   What are ways to improve LIGO in the future,
[01:31:59.600 --> 01:32:01.520]   increase the sensitivity?
[01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:04.640]   I've seen a few ideas that are kind of fascinating.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:06.640]   Is, are you interested in them?
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:09.480]   Sort of looking, I'm not speaking about five years.
[01:32:09.480 --> 01:32:11.660]   Perhaps you could speak to the next five years,
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:13.800]   but also the next hundred years.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:17.080]   - Yeah, so let me talk to both the instrument
[01:32:17.080 --> 01:32:19.040]   and the science, okay?
[01:32:19.040 --> 01:32:21.000]   Since that's, they go hand in hand.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.920]   I mean, the thing that I said is if we make it better,
[01:32:23.920 --> 01:32:28.040]   we see more kinds of weaker objects and we do astronomy,
[01:32:28.040 --> 01:32:28.880]   okay?
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:32.920]   We're very motivated to make a new instrument,
[01:32:32.920 --> 01:32:36.400]   which will be a big step, the next step,
[01:32:36.400 --> 01:32:39.320]   like making a new kind of telescope or something.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:43.600]   And the ideas of what that instrument should be
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   haven't converged yet.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.280]   There's different ideas in Europe.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:52.280]   They've done more work to kind of develop the ideas,
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:56.640]   but they're different from ours and we have ideas.
[01:32:56.640 --> 01:32:59.000]   So, but I think over the next few years,
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:01.120]   we'll develop those.
[01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:02.560]   The idea is to make an instrument
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:06.000]   that's at least 10 times better than what we have,
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.720]   what we can do with this instrument,
[01:33:07.720 --> 01:33:09.480]   10 times better than that.
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:13.120]   10 times better means you can look 10 times further out.
[01:33:13.120 --> 01:33:18.160]   10 times further out is a thousand times more volume.
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:22.400]   So, you're seeing much, much more of the universe.
[01:33:22.400 --> 01:33:26.680]   The big change is that if you can see far out,
[01:33:26.680 --> 01:33:28.760]   you see further back in history.
[01:33:28.760 --> 01:33:30.600]   - Yeah, you're traveling back in time.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.480]   - Yeah, and so we can start to do what we call cosmology
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:39.360]   instead of astronomy or astrophysics.
[01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:43.440]   Cosmology is really the study of the evolution of the-
[01:33:43.440 --> 01:33:45.360]   - Oh, interesting, yeah.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.440]   - And so then you can start to hope
[01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.640]   to get to the important problems
[01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:56.440]   having to do with how the universe began,
[01:33:56.440 --> 01:33:58.120]   how it evolved and so forth,
[01:33:58.120 --> 01:34:03.120]   which we really only study now with optical instruments
[01:34:04.440 --> 01:34:08.320]   or electromagnetic waves.
[01:34:08.320 --> 01:34:12.040]   And early in the universe, those were blocked
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:15.040]   because basically it wasn't transparent,
[01:34:15.040 --> 01:34:17.800]   so the photons couldn't get out
[01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:19.920]   when everything was too dense.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:21.720]   - What do you think, sorry, on this tangent,
[01:34:21.720 --> 01:34:24.600]   what do you think an understanding of gravitational waves
[01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:27.160]   from earlier in the universe can help us understand
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:28.880]   about the Big Bang and all that kind of stuff?
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:30.760]   - Yeah, yeah, that's, so-
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:35.760]   - But it's a non, it's another perspective on the thing.
[01:34:35.760 --> 01:34:38.800]   Is there some insights you think could be revealed
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:41.120]   just to help a layman understand?
[01:34:41.120 --> 01:34:43.040]   - Sure, first, we don't understand,
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.160]   we use the word Big Bang,
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:45.840]   we don't understand the physics
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:48.340]   of what the Big Bang itself was.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:55.240]   So I think my, and in the early stage,
[01:34:55.240 --> 01:34:58.260]   there were particles and there was a huge amount of gravity
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:00.200]   and mass being made.
[01:35:00.200 --> 01:35:05.200]   And so the big, so I'll say two things.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:09.360]   One is, how did it all start?
[01:35:09.360 --> 01:35:10.200]   How did it happen?
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:12.080]   And I'll give you at least one example
[01:35:12.080 --> 01:35:15.800]   that we don't understand, but we should understand.
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:17.720]   We don't know why we're here.
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:19.620]   - Yes, no, we do not.
[01:35:19.620 --> 01:35:23.080]   - I don't mean it philosophically.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.080]   I mean it in terms of physics, okay?
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:27.220]   Now, what do I mean by that?
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:30.600]   If I go into my laboratory at CERN or somewhere
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:33.880]   and I collide particles together or put energy together,
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:36.200]   I make as much antimatter as matter.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:41.840]   Antimatter then annihilates matter and makes energy.
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:46.840]   So in the early universe, you made somehow,
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:51.100]   somehow a lot of matter and antimatter,
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:52.760]   but there was an asymmetry.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:55.680]   Somehow there was more matter and antimatter.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:35:58.200]   The matter and antimatter annihilated each other,
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.660]   at least that's what we think.
[01:35:59.660 --> 01:36:01.800]   And there was only matter left over,
[01:36:01.800 --> 01:36:05.960]   and we live in a universe that we see this all matter.
[01:36:05.960 --> 01:36:07.360]   We don't have any idea.
[01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:09.900]   We have an ideas, but we don't have any,
[01:36:09.900 --> 01:36:12.280]   we don't have any way to understand that
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:15.360]   at the present time with the physics that we know.
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:16.680]   - Can I ask a dumb question?
[01:36:16.680 --> 01:36:21.680]   Does antimatter have anything like a gravitational field
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:24.020]   to send signals?
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:29.960]   So how does this asymmetry of matter, antimatter,
[01:36:29.960 --> 01:36:33.680]   could be investigated or further understood
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:35.480]   by observing gravitational fields
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:37.640]   or weirdnesses in gravitational fields?
[01:36:37.640 --> 01:36:42.380]   - I think that in principle, if there were, you know,
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:47.020]   anti-neutron stars instead of just neutron stars,
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:49.620]   we would see different kind of signals,
[01:36:49.620 --> 01:36:52.120]   but it didn't get to that.
[01:36:52.120 --> 01:36:54.640]   We live in a universe that we've done enough
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:57.080]   looking 'cause we don't see matter,
[01:36:57.080 --> 01:37:00.120]   anti-protons anywhere, no matter what we look at,
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.160]   that it's all made out of matter.
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:05.160]   There is no antimatter except when we go in our laboratories.
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.200]   So, but when we go in our laboratories,
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:11.360]   we make as much antimatter as matter.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:13.220]   So there's something about the early universe
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:15.400]   that made this asymmetry.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:17.740]   So we can't even explain why we're here,
[01:37:17.740 --> 01:37:18.720]   that's what I meant.
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.560]   - Yeah.
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:22.880]   - Physics-wise, not, you know,
[01:37:22.880 --> 01:37:26.960]   not in terms of how we evolved and all that kind of stuff.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:27.800]   So-
[01:37:27.800 --> 01:37:30.240]   - So there might be inklings of,
[01:37:30.240 --> 01:37:36.160]   of some of the physics that gravitational-
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:40.160]   - So gravitational waves don't get obstructed like light.
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.840]   So I said light only goes to 300,000 years.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:44.560]   So it goes back to the beginning.
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:46.520]   So if you could study the early universe
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:49.440]   with gravitational waves, we can't do that yet.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:52.780]   Then it took 400 years to be able to do that
[01:37:52.780 --> 01:37:56.640]   with optical, but then you can really understand
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:38:00.500]   the very, maybe understand the very early universe.
[01:38:00.500 --> 01:38:05.500]   So in terms of questions like why we're here
[01:38:05.500 --> 01:38:09.800]   or what the Big Bang was, we should be,
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.680]   we can in principle study that with gravitational waves.
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:15.440]   So to keep moving in this direction,
[01:38:15.440 --> 01:38:20.440]   it's a unique kind of way to understand our universe.
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:23.220]   - Do you think there's more Nobel Prize level ideas
[01:38:23.220 --> 01:38:25.380]   to be discovered in relation to-
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:26.660]   - I'd be shocked if there-
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:27.500]   - Gravitational waves.
[01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.100]   - If there isn't, not even going to that,
[01:38:30.100 --> 01:38:31.820]   which is a very long range problem.
[01:38:31.820 --> 01:38:36.820]   But I think that we only see with electromagnetic waves
[01:38:36.820 --> 01:38:39.700]   4% of what's out there.
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:45.020]   There must be, we looked for things
[01:38:45.020 --> 01:38:47.180]   that we knew should be there.
[01:38:47.180 --> 01:38:52.180]   There should be, I would be shocked
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:57.520]   if there wasn't physics, objects, science,
[01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:59.600]   and with gravity that doesn't show up
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.000]   in everything we do with telescopes.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.300]   So I think we're just limited
[01:39:05.300 --> 01:39:09.700]   by not having powerful enough instruments yet to do this.
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:11.760]   - Do you have a preference?
[01:39:11.760 --> 01:39:16.760]   I keep seeing this E. Lisa idea.
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:18.100]   - Yeah.
[01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:23.100]   - Do you have a preference for earthbound
[01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:27.140]   or spacefaring mechanisms for-
[01:39:27.140 --> 01:39:28.180]   - They're complementary.
[01:39:28.180 --> 01:39:29.020]   It's a little bit like-
[01:39:29.020 --> 01:39:29.860]   - A signal.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:32.300]   - It's completely analogous
[01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:34.300]   to what's been done in astronomy.
[01:39:34.300 --> 01:39:37.340]   So astronomy from the time of Galileo
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:40.420]   was done with visible light.
[01:39:40.420 --> 01:39:41.260]   - Yeah.
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:45.180]   - The big advances in astronomy in the last 50 years
[01:39:45.180 --> 01:39:46.340]   are because we have instruments
[01:39:46.340 --> 01:39:49.940]   that look at the infrared, microwave,
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:51.700]   ultraviolet, and so forth.
[01:39:51.700 --> 01:39:55.620]   So looking at different wavelengths has been important.
[01:39:55.620 --> 01:39:58.460]   Basically going into space means
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:00.760]   that we'll look at instead of the audio band,
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.580]   which we look at, as we said, on the earth's surface,
[01:40:03.580 --> 01:40:05.780]   we'll look at lower frequencies.
[01:40:05.780 --> 01:40:07.860]   So it's completely complementary
[01:40:07.860 --> 01:40:10.880]   and it starts to be looking at different frequencies
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:12.680]   just like we do with astronomy.
[01:40:14.460 --> 01:40:17.100]   - It seems almost incredible to me engineering-wise,
[01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:19.140]   just like on earth, to send something
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:23.860]   that's kilometers across into space.
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:26.540]   Is that harder to engineer?
[01:40:26.540 --> 01:40:28.460]   - It actually is a little different.
[01:40:28.460 --> 01:40:31.820]   It's three satellites separated
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:34.020]   by hundreds of thousands of kilometers.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:38.360]   And they send a laser beam from one to the other.
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:43.360]   And if the triangle changes shape a little bit,
[01:40:44.020 --> 01:40:46.060]   they detect that from a passage.
[01:40:46.060 --> 01:40:48.700]   - Did you say hundreds of thousands of kilometers?
[01:40:48.700 --> 01:40:49.540]   - Yeah.
[01:40:49.540 --> 01:40:51.240]   - Sending lasers to each other.
[01:40:51.240 --> 01:40:54.340]   (laughing)
[01:40:54.340 --> 01:40:56.460]   Okay.
[01:40:56.460 --> 01:40:57.460]   - It's just engineering.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:01.620]   - Is it possible though?
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:02.460]   - Yes. - Is it doable?
[01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.660]   - Yes.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:04.500]   - Okay.
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:10.100]   That's just incredible 'cause they have to maintain,
[01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:12.180]   I mean, the precision here is probably,
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:14.380]   there might be some more, what is it?
[01:41:14.380 --> 01:41:16.900]   Maybe noise is a smaller problem.
[01:41:16.900 --> 01:41:20.180]   I guess there's no vibration to worry about,
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:21.940]   like seismic stuff.
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:23.820]   So getting away from earth, maybe you get away from--
[01:41:23.820 --> 01:41:25.180]   - Yeah, those parts are easier.
[01:41:25.180 --> 01:41:27.320]   They don't have to measure it as accurately
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:28.600]   at low frequencies.
[01:41:28.600 --> 01:41:33.580]   But they have a lot of tough engineering problems.
[01:41:33.580 --> 01:41:40.900]   In order to detect that the gravitational waves
[01:41:40.900 --> 01:41:44.180]   affect things, the sensors have to be
[01:41:44.180 --> 01:41:46.620]   what we call free masses, just like ours,
[01:41:46.620 --> 01:41:48.140]   are isolated from the earth.
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:51.100]   They have to isolate it from the satellite.
[01:41:51.100 --> 01:41:53.220]   And that's a hard problem.
[01:41:53.220 --> 01:41:55.540]   They have to do that pretty, not as well as we have to do it
[01:41:55.540 --> 01:41:57.100]   but very well.
[01:41:57.100 --> 01:41:59.620]   And they've done a test mission
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:01.800]   and the engineering seems to be,
[01:42:01.800 --> 01:42:04.400]   at least in principle, in hand.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:07.260]   This'll be in the 2030s when it--
[01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:08.500]   - 2030s? - Yeah.
[01:42:08.500 --> 01:42:10.700]   - This is incredible.
[01:42:10.700 --> 01:42:13.600]   This is incredible.
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:17.260]   Let me ask about black holes.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:20.020]   So what we're talking about is observing
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:24.740]   orbiting black holes.
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:28.940]   I saw the terminology of binary black hole systems.
[01:42:28.940 --> 01:42:30.260]   - Binary black holes.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.940]   - That's when they're dancing?
[01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:33.780]   Okay.
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:34.620]   - They're both going around each other
[01:42:34.620 --> 01:42:36.180]   just like the earth around the sun.
[01:42:36.180 --> 01:42:38.600]   - Okay, is that weird that there's black holes
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:40.100]   going around each other?
[01:42:40.100 --> 01:42:43.100]   - So the finding binary systems of stars
[01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.980]   is similar to finding binary systems of--
[01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:46.820]   - Of black holes.
[01:42:46.820 --> 01:42:48.220]   - Well, they were once stars.
[01:42:48.220 --> 01:42:55.900]   So we haven't said what a black hole is physically yet.
[01:42:55.900 --> 01:42:56.900]   - Yeah, what's a black hole?
[01:42:56.900 --> 01:43:01.260]   - So black hole is, first it's a mathematical concept
[01:43:01.260 --> 01:43:05.660]   or a physical concept, and that is a region of space.
[01:43:05.660 --> 01:43:07.380]   So it's simply a region of space
[01:43:07.380 --> 01:43:10.820]   where the curvature of space-time
[01:43:10.820 --> 01:43:13.220]   in the gravitational field is so strong
[01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:18.240]   that nothing can get out, including light.
[01:43:18.240 --> 01:43:23.980]   And there's light gets bent in the gravitation,
[01:43:23.980 --> 01:43:26.420]   if the space-time is warped enough.
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:29.660]   And so even light gets bent around and stays in it.
[01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:31.500]   So that's the concept of a black hole.
[01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:35.140]   So it's not a, and maybe you can make,
[01:43:35.140 --> 01:43:39.620]   maybe it's a concept that didn't say how they come about.
[01:43:39.620 --> 01:43:43.500]   And there could be different ways they come about.
[01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.900]   The ones that we are seeing,
[01:43:45.900 --> 01:43:50.180]   there's a, we're not sure.
[01:43:50.180 --> 01:43:52.540]   That's what we're trying to learn now is what they,
[01:43:52.540 --> 01:43:57.160]   but the general expectation is that they come,
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:44:01.300]   these black holes happen when a star dies.
[01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:03.780]   So what does that mean that a star dies?
[01:44:03.780 --> 01:44:04.720]   What happens?
[01:44:05.320 --> 01:44:06.720]   A star like our sun
[01:44:06.720 --> 01:44:11.940]   basically makes heat and light by fusion.
[01:44:11.940 --> 01:44:15.960]   It's made of, and as it burns,
[01:44:15.960 --> 01:44:18.920]   it burns up the hydrogen and then the helium,
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:22.020]   and then, and slowly works its way up
[01:44:22.020 --> 01:44:25.820]   to the heavier and heavier elements that are in the star.
[01:44:25.820 --> 01:44:27.960]   And when it gets up to iron,
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:30.680]   the fusion process doesn't work anymore.
[01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:34.100]   And so the stars die, and that happens to stars.
[01:44:34.100 --> 01:44:37.360]   And then they do what's called a supernova.
[01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:41.000]   What happens then is that a star is a delicate balance
[01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.840]   between an outward pressure from fusion
[01:44:43.840 --> 01:44:46.360]   and light and burning,
[01:44:46.360 --> 01:44:49.020]   and an inward pressure of gravity
[01:44:49.020 --> 01:44:52.560]   trying to pull the masses together.
[01:44:52.560 --> 01:44:55.100]   Once it burns itself out, it goes,
[01:44:55.100 --> 01:44:57.840]   and it collapses, and that's a supernova.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.720]   When it collapses, all the mass that was there
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:04.000]   is in a very much smaller space.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.480]   And if a star, if you do the calculations,
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:09.580]   if a star is big enough,
[01:45:09.580 --> 01:45:12.920]   that can create a strong enough gravitational field
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:14.040]   to make a black hole.
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:16.400]   Our sun won't.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:19.280]   It's too small. - Too small.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.940]   - And we don't know exactly what,
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:25.540]   but it's usually thought that a star has to be
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:29.820]   at least three times as big as our sun
[01:45:29.820 --> 01:45:32.320]   to make a black hole, but that's the physical way there.
[01:45:32.320 --> 01:45:33.960]   You can make black holes.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:35.960]   That's the first explanation
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:42.040]   that one would give for what we see,
[01:45:42.040 --> 01:45:44.320]   but it's not necessarily true.
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:45.540]   We're not sure yet.
[01:45:45.540 --> 01:45:48.680]   - What we see in terms of, for the origins of black holes?
[01:45:48.680 --> 01:45:52.880]   - No, the black holes that we see in gravitational waves.
[01:45:52.880 --> 01:45:54.960]   - But you're also looking for the ones
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:56.800]   who are binary solar systems.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:58.680]   - So they're binary systems,
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:01.000]   but they could have been made from binary stars,
[01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.800]   so there's binary stars around, so that's--
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:06.280]   - Gotcha, so the first explanation
[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:07.680]   is that that's what they are.
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:08.520]   - Gotcha.
[01:46:08.520 --> 01:46:14.920]   - Other explanation, but what we see has some puzzles.
[01:46:14.920 --> 01:46:17.560]   This is kind of the way science works, I guess.
[01:46:17.560 --> 01:46:24.280]   We see heavier ones than up to,
[01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:28.900]   we've seen one system that was 140 times
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.280]   the mass of our own sun.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:35.040]   That's not believed to be possible
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:39.240]   with the parent being a big star
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:41.840]   because big stars can only be so big,
[01:46:41.840 --> 01:46:45.600]   or they are unstable.
[01:46:45.600 --> 01:46:49.280]   It's just the fact that they live in an environment
[01:46:49.280 --> 01:46:51.320]   that makes them unstable.
[01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.880]   So the fact that we see bigger ones,
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:56.080]   they maybe come from something else.
[01:46:56.080 --> 01:47:01.080]   It's possible that they were made in a different way
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:04.480]   by little ones eating each other up,
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.400]   or maybe they were made,
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.120]   or maybe they came with the Big Bang,
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.480]   what we call primordial,
[01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:12.960]   which means they're really different,
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.080]   they came from that.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.640]   We don't know at this point.
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:17.160]   If they came with the Big Bang,
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:20.440]   then maybe they account for what we call dark matter
[01:47:20.440 --> 01:47:21.280]   or some of it.
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.040]   - Hmm, like there was a lot of them,
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:26.240]   if they came with, 'cause there's a lot of dark matter.
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:27.480]   - Yeah.
[01:47:27.480 --> 01:47:29.960]   - But will gravitational waves give you
[01:47:29.960 --> 01:47:34.480]   any kind of intuition about the origin of these oscillating?
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:37.840]   - We think that if we see the distributions,
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.680]   enough of them,
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:41.000]   the distributions of their masses,
[01:47:41.000 --> 01:47:43.640]   the distributions of how they're spinning.
[01:47:43.640 --> 01:47:45.360]   So we can actually measure
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.360]   when they're going around each other,
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:49.960]   whether they're spinning like this or--
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:51.040]   - The direction of the spin?
[01:47:51.040 --> 01:47:52.360]   Or no, the orientation.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:55.760]   - Whether the whole system has any wobbles.
[01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:57.280]   - What?
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:47:59.480]   So this is now, okay.
[01:48:00.080 --> 01:48:01.440]   We're doing that.
[01:48:01.440 --> 01:48:03.760]   - And then you're constantly kind of crawling back
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:04.600]   and back in time.
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:06.280]   - And we're crawling back in time
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:08.720]   and seeing how many there are as we go back.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:10.600]   And so do they point back to--
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:13.040]   - So you're like, what is that discipline called?
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.080]   Cartography or something?
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:18.800]   You're like mapping the early universe
[01:48:18.800 --> 01:48:21.960]   via the lens of gravitational waves.
[01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.280]   - Not yet the early universe,
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:24.160]   but at least back in time.
[01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.680]   - Earlier, right.
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:30.680]   So black holes are this mathematical phenomenon,
[01:48:30.680 --> 01:48:33.320]   but they come about in different ways.
[01:48:33.320 --> 01:48:35.400]   We have a huge black hole
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:39.080]   at the center of our galaxy and other galaxies.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:40.840]   Those probably were made some other way.
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:43.520]   We don't know when the galaxies themselves
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.600]   had to do with the formation of the galaxies.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:47.120]   We don't really know.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:50.400]   So the fact that we use the word black hole,
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.960]   the origin of black holes might be quite different
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:56.080]   depending on how they happen.
[01:48:56.080 --> 01:48:58.600]   They just have to in the end have a gravitational field
[01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:00.440]   that will bend everything in.
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:04.040]   - How do you feel about black holes as a human being?
[01:49:04.040 --> 01:49:08.080]   There's this thing that's nearly infinitely dense,
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:12.000]   doesn't let light escape.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:13.400]   Isn't that kind of terrifying?
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:15.760]   Feels like the stuff of nightmares.
[01:49:15.760 --> 01:49:17.960]   - I think it's an opportunity.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:20.400]   - To do what exactly?
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:21.360]   (laughing)
[01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:24.960]   - So like the early universe is an opportunity.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:26.680]   If we can study the early universe,
[01:49:26.680 --> 01:49:28.480]   we can learn things like I told you.
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:33.120]   And here again, we have an embarrassing situation in physics.
[01:49:33.120 --> 01:49:37.120]   We have two wonderful theories of physics,
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:41.480]   one based on quantum mechanics, quantum field theory.
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:45.320]   And we can go to a big accelerator like at CERN
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:47.080]   and smash particles together
[01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:51.400]   and almost explain anything that happens beautifully
[01:49:51.400 --> 01:49:54.800]   using quantum field theory and quantum mechanics.
[01:49:54.800 --> 01:49:56.840]   Then we have another theory of physics
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:58.120]   called general relativity,
[01:49:58.120 --> 01:50:00.680]   which is what we've been talking about most of the time,
[01:50:00.680 --> 01:50:05.640]   which is fantastic at describing things at high velocities,
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:10.280]   long distances, and so forth.
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:15.280]   So that's not the way it's supposed to be.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:17.920]   We're trying to create a theory of physics,
[01:50:17.920 --> 01:50:20.200]   not two theories of physics.
[01:50:20.200 --> 01:50:21.640]   So we have an embarrassment
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:24.520]   that we have two different theories of physics.
[01:50:24.520 --> 01:50:27.840]   People have tried to make a unified theory,
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:29.040]   what they call a unified theory.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:32.400]   You've heard those words for decades.
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:33.480]   They still haven't.
[01:50:33.480 --> 01:50:37.360]   That's been primarily done theoretically
[01:50:37.360 --> 01:50:40.060]   or people actively do that.
[01:50:40.920 --> 01:50:45.880]   My personal belief is that like much of physics,
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:47.760]   we need some clues.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:49.600]   So we need some experimental evidence.
[01:50:49.600 --> 01:50:52.280]   So where is there a place?
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.520]   If we go to CERN and do those experiments,
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.620]   gravitational waves or general relativity don't matter.
[01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:01.160]   If we go to study our black holes,
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:03.560]   elementary particle physics doesn't matter.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.440]   We're studying these huge objects.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:07.840]   So where might we have a place
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.960]   where both phenomenon have to be satisfied?
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:12.920]   An example is black holes.
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:13.920]   - Inside black holes.
[01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:15.060]   - Yeah.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:17.000]   So we can't do that today.
[01:51:17.000 --> 01:51:18.840]   But when I think of black hole,
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:22.440]   it's a potential treasure chest
[01:51:22.440 --> 01:51:27.440]   of understanding the fundamental problems of physics
[01:51:27.440 --> 01:51:31.320]   and maybe can give us clues
[01:51:31.320 --> 01:51:34.440]   to how we bring the embarrassment
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:36.720]   of having two theories of physics together.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:39.880]   That's my own romantic idea.
[01:51:39.880 --> 01:51:41.400]   - What's the worst that could happen?
[01:51:41.400 --> 01:51:42.400]   It's so enticing.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.920]   Just go in and look.
[01:51:43.920 --> 01:51:47.680]   Do you think, how far are we away from figuring out
[01:51:47.680 --> 01:51:50.200]   the unified theory of physics,
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.600]   a theory of everything?
[01:51:51.600 --> 01:51:52.720]   What's your sense?
[01:51:52.720 --> 01:51:54.360]   Who will solve it?
[01:51:54.360 --> 01:51:56.200]   Like what discipline will solve it?
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:57.040]   - Yeah.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:04.400]   I think so little progress has been made
[01:52:05.240 --> 01:52:10.240]   without more experimental clues, as I said,
[01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:16.000]   that we're just not able to say that we're close
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:20.680]   without some clues.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.560]   The most popular theory these days
[01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:28.640]   that might lead to that is called string theory.
[01:52:28.640 --> 01:52:29.480]   - Yeah.
[01:52:29.480 --> 01:52:32.880]   - And the problem with string theory is it works,
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:35.840]   it solves a lot of beautiful mathematical problems
[01:52:35.840 --> 01:52:37.560]   we have in physics.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:42.560]   And it's very satisfying theoretically,
[01:52:42.560 --> 01:52:49.220]   but it has almost no predictive,
[01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:50.960]   maybe no predictive ability
[01:52:50.960 --> 01:52:55.960]   because it is a theory that works in 11 dimensions.
[01:52:55.960 --> 01:53:00.000]   We live in a physical world of three space
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.040]   and one time dimension.
[01:53:02.040 --> 01:53:05.920]   In order to make predictions in our world
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.520]   with string theory,
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:11.260]   you have to somehow get rid of these other seven dimensions.
[01:53:11.260 --> 01:53:13.960]   That's done mathematically
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:15.760]   by saying they curl up on each other
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:19.840]   on scales that are too small to affect anything here.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:22.040]   But how you do that, and that's okay,
[01:53:22.040 --> 01:53:23.400]   that's an okay argument,
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:26.140]   but how you do that is not unique.
[01:53:26.140 --> 01:53:29.680]   So that means if I start with that theory
[01:53:29.680 --> 01:53:31.400]   and I go to our world here,
[01:53:31.400 --> 01:53:33.800]   I can't uniquely go to it.
[01:53:33.800 --> 01:53:35.280]   - Which means it's not predictive.
[01:53:35.280 --> 01:53:36.600]   - It's not predictive.
[01:53:36.600 --> 01:53:37.880]   - And that's actually--
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:39.800]   - And that's a killer, that's a killer.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.240]   - And string theory is,
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:43.200]   it seems like from my outsider's perspective
[01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:45.080]   has lost favor over the years,
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:46.760]   perhaps because of this very idea.
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:48.280]   - Yeah, it's a lack of predictive power.
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:52.080]   I mean, science has to connect to something
[01:53:52.080 --> 01:53:56.280]   where you make predictions as beautiful as it might be.
[01:53:56.280 --> 01:53:57.800]   So I don't think we're close.
[01:53:57.800 --> 01:54:01.840]   I think we need some experimental clues.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.680]   It may be that information
[01:54:04.680 --> 01:54:07.920]   on something we don't understand presently at all,
[01:54:07.920 --> 01:54:11.200]   like dark energy, or probably not dark matter,
[01:54:11.200 --> 01:54:14.520]   but dark energy or something might give us some ideas.
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:17.120]   But I don't think we're,
[01:54:17.120 --> 01:54:22.120]   I can't envision right now in the short term,
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:27.520]   meaning the horizon that we can see
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:30.600]   how we're gonna bring these two theories together.
[01:54:30.600 --> 01:54:35.000]   - A kind of two-part question,
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:38.080]   maybe just asking the same thing in two different ways.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:40.200]   One question is,
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:45.200]   do you have hope that humans will colonize the galaxy,
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.720]   so expand out, become a multi-planetary species?
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:51.200]   Another way of asking that,
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:54.160]   from a gravitational and a propulsion perspective,
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:55.560]   do you think we'll come up with ways
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:57.160]   to travel closer to the speed of light,
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:59.760]   or maybe faster than the speed of light,
[01:54:59.760 --> 01:55:02.400]   which would make it a whole heck of a lot easier
[01:55:02.400 --> 01:55:06.120]   to expand out into the universe?
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:06.960]   - Yeah.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:10.680]   Well, I think,
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:15.640]   that's very futuristic.
[01:55:15.640 --> 01:55:17.880]   I think we're not that far from being able
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:21.840]   to make a one-way trip to Mars.
[01:55:21.840 --> 01:55:25.760]   That's then a question of,
[01:55:26.760 --> 01:55:30.560]   whether people are willing to send somebody
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.640]   on a one-way trip.
[01:55:31.640 --> 01:55:33.240]   - Oh, I think they are.
[01:55:33.240 --> 01:55:36.040]   There's a lot of, the Explorer's burned bright
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:36.880]   and with their hearts.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:37.720]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:55:37.720 --> 01:55:38.560]   - There's a lot of people willing to die
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:42.080]   for the opportunity to explore new territory.
[01:55:42.080 --> 01:55:45.440]   - Yeah, so, you know,
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:49.960]   this recent landing on Mars is pretty impressive.
[01:55:49.960 --> 01:55:51.960]   They have a little helicopter that can fly around.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.000]   You can imagine,
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:56.600]   you can imagine in the not too distant future
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:55:57.800]   that you could have,
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:01.080]   I don't think civilizations colonizing,
[01:56:01.080 --> 01:56:02.240]   I can envision,
[01:56:02.240 --> 01:56:06.360]   but I can envision something more like the South Pole.
[01:56:06.360 --> 01:56:09.080]   We haven't colonized Antarctica,
[01:56:09.080 --> 01:56:12.960]   'cause it's all ice and cold and so forth,
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:16.360]   but we have stations.
[01:56:16.360 --> 01:56:18.600]   So we have a station that's self-sustaining
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.800]   at the South Pole.
[01:56:19.800 --> 01:56:21.160]   I've been there.
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:22.000]   It has--
[01:56:22.000 --> 01:56:22.840]   - Wow, really?
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:23.840]   - Yeah.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:24.920]   - What's that like?
[01:56:24.920 --> 01:56:29.960]   'Cause there's parallels there to go to Mars.
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:31.920]   - It's fantastic.
[01:56:31.920 --> 01:56:33.440]   - What's the journey like?
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:36.080]   - The journey involves going,
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.800]   the South Pole station is run in the US
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:43.040]   by the National Science Foundation.
[01:56:43.040 --> 01:56:46.520]   I went because I was on the National Science Board
[01:56:46.520 --> 01:56:49.520]   that runs the National Science Foundation.
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:52.440]   And so you get a VIP trip if you're healthy enough
[01:56:52.440 --> 01:56:55.040]   to the South Pole to see it,
[01:56:55.040 --> 01:56:57.200]   which I took.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:57:00.640]   You fly from the US to Australia,
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:05.640]   to Christ Church in Australia, Southern Australia.
[01:57:05.640 --> 01:57:11.240]   And from there you fly to McMurdo Station,
[01:57:11.240 --> 01:57:12.480]   which is on the coast.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:15.720]   And it's the station with about a thousand people
[01:57:15.720 --> 01:57:17.440]   right on the coast of Antarctica.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:21.560]   It's about a seven or eight hour flight,
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:23.040]   and they can't predict the weather.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:28.040]   So when I flew from Christ Church to McMurdo Station,
[01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:29.720]   they tell you in advance,
[01:57:29.720 --> 01:57:32.400]   you do it in a military aircraft,
[01:57:32.400 --> 01:57:33.720]   they tell you in advance
[01:57:33.720 --> 01:57:36.240]   that they can't predict whether they can land
[01:57:36.240 --> 01:57:37.720]   'cause they have to land on--
[01:57:37.720 --> 01:57:39.440]   - That's reassuring.
[01:57:39.440 --> 01:57:44.440]   - Yeah, and so about halfway the pilot got on and said,
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:48.360]   "Sorry, this is a," they call it a boomerang flight.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:50.920]   You know, a boomerang goes out and comes back.
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:53.760]   So we had to stay a little while in Christ Church,
[01:57:53.760 --> 01:57:56.980]   but then we eventually went to McMurdo Station
[01:57:56.980 --> 01:58:00.360]   and then flew to the South Pole.
[01:58:00.360 --> 01:58:04.140]   The South Pole itself is,
[01:58:04.140 --> 01:58:07.760]   when I was there, it was minus 51 degrees.
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:08.700]   That was summer.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:14.600]   It has zero humidity.
[01:58:14.600 --> 01:58:20.800]   And it's about,
[01:58:21.800 --> 01:58:23.640]   11,000 feet altitude
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:28.120]   because it's never warm enough for anything to melt.
[01:58:28.120 --> 01:58:29.600]   So it doesn't snow very much,
[01:58:29.600 --> 01:58:33.200]   but it's about 11,000 feet of snowpack.
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:36.040]   So you land in a place that's high altitude,
[01:58:36.040 --> 01:58:39.080]   cold as could be,
[01:58:39.080 --> 01:58:41.920]   and incredibly dry,
[01:58:41.920 --> 01:58:45.280]   which means you have a physical adjustment.
[01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:51.480]   The place itself is fantastic.
[01:58:51.480 --> 01:58:54.680]   They have this great station there.
[01:58:54.680 --> 01:58:56.680]   They do astronomy at the South Pole.
[01:58:56.680 --> 01:58:58.320]   - Nature-wise, is it beautiful?
[01:58:58.320 --> 01:59:01.400]   What's the experience like?
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:03.000]   Or is it like visiting any town?
[01:59:03.000 --> 01:59:05.000]   - No, it's very small.
[01:59:05.000 --> 01:59:08.160]   There's only less than 100 people there
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:09.440]   even when I was there.
[01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:13.600]   There were about 50 or 60 there,
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:16.260]   and in the winter there's less, half of that.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.100]   Their winter.
[01:59:17.100 --> 01:59:19.280]   - It gets real cold.
[01:59:19.280 --> 01:59:20.940]   - It gets really cold, yeah.
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:25.440]   But it's a station.
[01:59:25.440 --> 01:59:30.800]   I mean, we haven't gone beyond that.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:32.480]   On the coast of Antarctica,
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.480]   they have greenhouses and they're self-sustaining
[01:59:35.480 --> 01:59:36.640]   in McMurdo Station,
[01:59:36.640 --> 01:59:39.400]   but we haven't really settled more
[01:59:39.400 --> 01:59:42.320]   than that kind of thing in Antarctica,
[01:59:42.320 --> 01:59:47.320]   which is a big country,
[01:59:47.320 --> 01:59:52.460]   or a big plot, a big piece of land.
[01:59:52.460 --> 01:59:58.220]   So I can't envision kind of colonizing
[01:59:58.220 --> 02:00:00.140]   at people living so much,
[02:00:00.140 --> 02:00:04.740]   as much as I can see the equivalent
[02:00:04.740 --> 02:00:06.180]   of the South Pole Station.
[02:00:06.180 --> 02:00:07.780]   - Well, in the computing world,
[02:00:07.780 --> 02:00:11.020]   there's an idea of backing up your data,
[02:00:11.020 --> 02:00:13.040]   and then you wanna do off-site backup
[02:00:13.040 --> 02:00:18.420]   to make sure that if your whole house burns down,
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:21.220]   that you can have a backup off-site of the data.
[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:25.380]   I think the difference between Antarctica and Mars
[02:00:25.380 --> 02:00:27.560]   is Mars is an off-site backup.
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:29.120]   That if we have nuclear war,
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:31.560]   whatever the heck might happen here on Earth,
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:33.640]   it'd be nice to have a backup elsewhere.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:35.720]   And it'd be nice to have a large enough colony
[02:00:35.720 --> 02:00:38.120]   where we sent a variety of people,
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:43.120]   except a few silly astronauts in suits,
[02:00:43.120 --> 02:00:45.140]   have an actual vibrant,
[02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:49.120]   get a few musicians and artists up there,
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:52.420]   get a few, maybe one or two computer scientists.
[02:00:52.420 --> 02:00:53.720]   Those are essential.
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:56.160]   Maybe even a physicist, but I'm not sure.
[02:00:56.160 --> 02:00:57.440]   - Yeah, maybe not.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:00.520]   So that comes back to something you talked about earlier,
[02:01:00.520 --> 02:01:03.640]   which is the Fermi's paradox,
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:05.740]   because you talked about having to escape.
[02:01:07.640 --> 02:01:11.720]   And so the missing, one number you don't know how to use
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:15.160]   in Fermi's calculation, or Drake, who's done it better,
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:17.360]   is how long do civilizations last?
[02:01:17.360 --> 02:01:18.200]   - Yeah.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:22.860]   - We've barely gotten to where we can communicate
[02:01:22.860 --> 02:01:25.200]   with electricity and magnetism,
[02:01:25.200 --> 02:01:28.320]   and maybe we'll wipe ourselves out pretty soon.
[02:01:28.320 --> 02:01:29.720]   - Are you hopeful in general?
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:31.560]   Like you think we've got another couple hundred years
[02:01:31.560 --> 02:01:32.400]   at least?
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:34.360]   Are you worried?
[02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:39.280]   - Well, no, I'm hopeful,
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:42.440]   but I don't know if I'm hopeful in the long term.
[02:01:42.440 --> 02:01:43.280]   If you say,
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:51.720]   are we able to go for another couple thousand years?
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:52.680]   I'm not sure.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:56.480]   I think we have where we started,
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:01:58.080]   the fact that we can do things
[02:01:58.080 --> 02:02:00.780]   that don't allow us to kind of keep going,
[02:02:00.780 --> 02:02:04.040]   or there can be, whether it ends up being a virus
[02:02:04.040 --> 02:02:07.040]   that we create, or it ends up being the equivalent
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:09.680]   of nuclear war, or something else.
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:12.980]   It's not clear that we can control things well enough.
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:15.520]   - So speaking of really cold conditions,
[02:02:15.520 --> 02:02:20.080]   and not being hopeful, and eventual suffering,
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:22.360]   and destruction of the human species,
[02:02:22.360 --> 02:02:24.560]   let me ask you about Russian literature.
[02:02:24.560 --> 02:02:27.120]   You mentioned, how's that for a transition?
[02:02:27.120 --> 02:02:28.320]   I'm doing my best here.
[02:02:28.320 --> 02:02:31.520]   You mentioned that you used to love literature
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:34.040]   when you were younger, and you were even,
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:36.600]   or hoping to be a writer yourself,
[02:02:36.600 --> 02:02:38.240]   that was the motivation.
[02:02:38.240 --> 02:02:41.280]   And some of the books I've seen that you listed
[02:02:41.280 --> 02:02:46.280]   that were inspiring to you was from Russian literature,
[02:02:46.280 --> 02:02:50.880]   like I think Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Solzhenitsyn.
[02:02:50.880 --> 02:02:52.280]   - Yeah, right.
[02:02:52.280 --> 02:02:55.000]   - Maybe in general you can speak to your fascination
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:57.240]   with Russian literature, or in general,
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:02:58.760]   what you picked up from those.
[02:02:59.960 --> 02:03:02.360]   - Not surprised you picked up on the Russian literature.
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:03.720]   - I'm sorry. - With your background,
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:04.880]   but that's okay.
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:06.920]   (both laughing)
[02:03:06.920 --> 02:03:08.240]   When I--
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.720]   - You should be surprised I didn't make
[02:03:09.720 --> 02:03:11.400]   the entire conversation about this.
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:13.000]   That's the real surprise.
[02:03:13.000 --> 02:03:20.880]   - I didn't really become a physicist,
[02:03:20.880 --> 02:03:24.160]   or want to go in science, until I started college.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:27.360]   So when I was younger, I was good at math,
[02:03:27.360 --> 02:03:29.720]   and that kind of stuff, but I didn't really,
[02:03:29.720 --> 02:03:32.120]   I came from a family, nobody went to college,
[02:03:32.120 --> 02:03:34.580]   and I didn't have any mentors.
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:38.240]   But I liked to read when I was really young.
[02:03:38.240 --> 02:03:41.200]   And so when I was very young, I read,
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:44.840]   I always carried around a pocketbook and read it.
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:48.200]   And my mother read these mystery stories,
[02:03:48.200 --> 02:03:49.800]   and I got bored by those eventually.
[02:03:49.800 --> 02:03:51.640]   And then I discovered real literature,
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:55.320]   I don't know at what age, but about 12 or 13.
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:58.920]   And so then I started reading good literature,
[02:03:58.920 --> 02:04:02.160]   there's nothing better than Russian literature, of course.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:03.000]   - Thank you.
[02:04:03.000 --> 02:04:05.360]   I heard you. - Reading good literature.
[02:04:05.360 --> 02:04:10.360]   So I read quite a bit of Russian literature at that time.
[02:04:10.360 --> 02:04:19.880]   And so you asked me about, well, I don't know,
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:22.080]   I'll say a few words, Dostoevsky.
[02:04:22.080 --> 02:04:23.920]   So what about Dostoevsky?
[02:04:23.920 --> 02:04:28.920]   For me, Dostoevsky was important in,
[02:04:28.920 --> 02:04:33.320]   I mean, I've read a lot of literature
[02:04:33.320 --> 02:04:35.840]   'cause it's kind of the other thing I do with my life.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:39.080]   And he made two incredible,
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:41.560]   and in addition to his own literature,
[02:04:41.560 --> 02:04:45.300]   he influenced literature tremendously by having,
[02:04:45.300 --> 02:04:49.180]   I don't know how to pronounce, polyphony.
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:52.160]   So he's the first real serious author
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:54.700]   that had multiple narrators.
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:05:00.360]   And he absolutely is the first.
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.240]   And he also was the first,
[02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:07.360]   he began existential literature.
[02:05:07.360 --> 02:05:11.960]   So the most important book that I've read in the last year
[02:05:11.960 --> 02:05:14.520]   when I've been forced to be isolated
[02:05:14.520 --> 02:05:17.160]   was existential literature.
[02:05:17.160 --> 02:05:21.560]   I decided to reread "Camus, The Plague."
[02:05:21.560 --> 02:05:23.800]   - Oh yeah, that's a great book.
[02:05:23.800 --> 02:05:26.040]   - It's a great book, and it's right now to read it.
[02:05:26.040 --> 02:05:27.180]   It's fantastic. - I think that book
[02:05:27.180 --> 02:05:29.320]   is about love, actually.
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:32.360]   Love for humanity, for all men.
[02:05:32.360 --> 02:05:36.120]   - It has all the, if you haven't read it in recent years,
[02:05:36.120 --> 02:05:37.580]   I had read it before, of course,
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:41.280]   but to read it during this, 'cause it's about a plague,
[02:05:41.280 --> 02:05:43.600]   so it's really fantastic to read now.
[02:05:43.600 --> 02:05:47.440]   But that reminds me of, he was a great existentialist,
[02:05:47.440 --> 02:05:50.960]   but the beginning of existential literature was Dostoevsky.
[02:05:50.960 --> 02:05:51.840]   - Dostoevsky, yeah.
[02:05:51.840 --> 02:05:54.520]   - So in addition to his own great novels,
[02:05:54.520 --> 02:05:59.520]   he had a tremendous impact on literature.
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:02.040]   - And there's also, for Dostoevsky,
[02:06:02.040 --> 02:06:04.660]   unlike most other existentialists,
[02:06:04.660 --> 02:06:07.320]   he was, at least in part, religious.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:11.280]   I mean, religiosity permeated his idea.
[02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:13.560]   I mean, one of my favorite books of his is "The Idiot,"
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.840]   which is a Christ-like figure in there.
[02:06:16.840 --> 02:06:19.000]   - Well, there's Prince Mishkin, is that his name?
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:19.840]   - Prince Mishkin, yeah.
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:20.680]   - Yeah, Mishkin.
[02:06:20.680 --> 02:06:21.500]   - Yeah, Mishkin.
[02:06:21.500 --> 02:06:22.340]   - Yeah.
[02:06:22.340 --> 02:06:24.040]   - That's one thing about,
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:25.920]   so you read it in English, I presume?
[02:06:25.920 --> 02:06:26.760]   - Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:28.100]   - Yeah, so that's the names,
[02:06:28.100 --> 02:06:29.240]   that's what gets a lot of people,
[02:06:29.240 --> 02:06:31.160]   is there's so many names, so hard to pronounce,
[02:06:31.160 --> 02:06:33.040]   you have to remember all of them.
[02:06:33.040 --> 02:06:35.440]   It's like, you have the same problem.
[02:06:35.440 --> 02:06:38.320]   - But he was a great character, so that, yeah.
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:42.840]   - I kind of, I have a connection with him,
[02:06:42.840 --> 02:06:47.280]   'cause I often, the title of the book, "The Idiot,"
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:50.760]   is, I kind of, I often call myself an idiot,
[02:06:50.760 --> 02:06:53.760]   'cause that's how I feel, I feel so naive about this world,
[02:06:53.760 --> 02:06:57.780]   and I'm not sure why that is,
[02:06:57.780 --> 02:06:59.720]   maybe it's genetic or so on,
[02:06:59.720 --> 02:07:03.440]   but I have a connection,
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:05.120]   a spiritual connection to that character.
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:05.960]   - To Mishkin.
[02:07:05.960 --> 02:07:08.320]   - To Mishkin, yeah, that you're just--
[02:07:08.320 --> 02:07:10.120]   - But he was far from an idiot.
[02:07:10.120 --> 02:07:12.920]   - No, in some sense, in some sense.
[02:07:14.520 --> 02:07:17.360]   But in another sense, maybe not of this world.
[02:07:17.360 --> 02:07:19.160]   - In another sense, he was, yeah.
[02:07:19.160 --> 02:07:21.240]   I mean, he was a bumbler, a bunker.
[02:07:21.240 --> 02:07:25.520]   - But you also mentioned Solzhenitsyn,
[02:07:25.520 --> 02:07:27.840]   very interesting, did--
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:29.880]   - And he always confused me, of course,
[02:07:29.880 --> 02:07:34.000]   he was really, really important
[02:07:34.000 --> 02:07:38.000]   in writing about Stalin,
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:42.400]   and first getting in trouble,
[02:07:42.400 --> 02:07:47.400]   and then later he wrote about Stalin in a way,
[02:07:47.400 --> 02:07:51.360]   I forget what the book was,
[02:07:51.360 --> 02:07:54.400]   in a way that was very critical of Lenin.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.320]   - Yeah, he's evolved through the years,
[02:07:58.320 --> 02:08:00.600]   and he actually showed support for Putin eventually.
[02:08:00.600 --> 02:08:05.200]   It was a very interesting transition he took,
[02:08:05.200 --> 02:08:09.080]   no, journey he took through thinking about Russia
[02:08:09.080 --> 02:08:11.160]   and the Soviet Union,
[02:08:11.160 --> 02:08:16.160]   but I think what I get from him is basic,
[02:08:16.160 --> 02:08:19.400]   it's like Viktor Frankl has this "Man's Search for Meaning,"
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:20.880]   I have a similar kind of sense
[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:27.320]   of the cruelty of human nature,
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:29.360]   cruelty of indifference,
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:31.400]   but also the ability to find happiness
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:33.720]   in the small joys of life,
[02:08:33.720 --> 02:08:37.320]   that's something, there's nothing like a prison camp
[02:08:37.320 --> 02:08:40.280]   that makes you realize you could still be happy
[02:08:40.280 --> 02:08:41.720]   with a very, very little.
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.880]   - Well, yeah, his description of how to make,
[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:49.240]   how to go through a day and actually enjoy it
[02:08:49.240 --> 02:08:51.920]   in a prison camp is pretty amazing.
[02:08:51.920 --> 02:08:52.760]   - Yeah.
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:53.760]   - Oh, and some prison camp,
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:55.440]   I mean, it's the worst of the worst.
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:56.520]   - The worst of the worst.
[02:08:56.520 --> 02:08:59.760]   And also just, you do think about
[02:08:59.760 --> 02:09:02.840]   the role of authoritarian states,
[02:09:02.840 --> 02:09:09.120]   in hopeful, idealistic systems
[02:09:09.120 --> 02:09:12.000]   somehow leading to the suffering of millions.
[02:09:12.000 --> 02:09:15.920]   And I, you know, this might be arguable,
[02:09:15.920 --> 02:09:20.460]   but I think a lot of people believe that Stalin,
[02:09:20.460 --> 02:09:22.580]   I think genuinely believed that he's doing good
[02:09:22.580 --> 02:09:25.920]   for the world, and he wasn't.
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:27.920]   This is a very valuable lesson that
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:32.620]   even evil people think they're doing good.
[02:09:32.620 --> 02:09:36.440]   Otherwise it's too difficult to do the evil.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.520]   The best way to do evil is to believe,
[02:09:38.520 --> 02:09:40.800]   frame it in a way like you're doing good.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.600]   And then this is a very clear picture of that,
[02:09:44.600 --> 02:09:46.340]   which is the Gulags.
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:51.000]   And Solzhenitsyn is one of the best people to reveal that.
[02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:51.840]   - Yeah.
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:56.680]   The most recent thing I read, it isn't actually fiction,
[02:09:56.680 --> 02:09:59.400]   was the woman, I can't remember her name,
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:03.840]   who got the Nobel Prize about within the last five years.
[02:10:03.840 --> 02:10:06.260]   I don't know whether she's Ukrainian or Russian,
[02:10:06.260 --> 02:10:09.920]   but their interviews, have you read that?
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:12.920]   - Interview of Ukrainian survivors of--
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:16.040]   - Well, I think she may be originally Ukrainian.
[02:10:16.040 --> 02:10:19.300]   The book's written in Russian and translated into English,
[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:23.000]   and many of the interviews are in Moscow and places.
[02:10:23.000 --> 02:10:24.400]   But she won the Nobel Prize
[02:10:24.400 --> 02:10:26.720]   within the last five years or so.
[02:10:26.720 --> 02:10:28.760]   But what's interesting is that
[02:10:28.760 --> 02:10:32.740]   these are people of all different ages,
[02:10:32.740 --> 02:10:36.480]   all different occupations and so forth,
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:39.800]   and they're reflecting on their reaction
[02:10:39.800 --> 02:10:43.940]   to basically the present Soviet system,
[02:10:43.940 --> 02:10:45.480]   the system they live with before.
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:50.180]   There's a lot of looking back by a lot of them with,
[02:10:50.180 --> 02:10:56.120]   well, it being much better before.
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.020]   - Yeah.
[02:11:00.020 --> 02:11:02.720]   I don't know what,
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:05.260]   in America, we think we know the right answer,
[02:11:05.260 --> 02:11:08.580]   what it means to build a better world.
[02:11:08.580 --> 02:11:10.200]   I'm not so sure.
[02:11:10.200 --> 02:11:12.520]   I think we're all just trying to figure it out.
[02:11:12.520 --> 02:11:14.560]   - Yeah, there's-- - We're doing our best.
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:15.720]   - I think you're right.
[02:11:15.720 --> 02:11:20.740]   - Is there advice you can give to young people today,
[02:11:20.740 --> 02:11:24.760]   besides reading Russian literature at a young age,
[02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:27.760]   about how to find their way in life,
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:30.840]   how to find success in career or just life in general?
[02:11:31.840 --> 02:11:36.840]   - Uh, I just,
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:41.240]   my own belief, it may not be very deep,
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:42.080]   but I believe it.
[02:11:42.080 --> 02:11:43.920]   I think you should follow your dreams,
[02:11:43.920 --> 02:11:45.880]   and you should have dreams,
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:47.960]   and follow your dreams if you can,
[02:11:47.960 --> 02:11:49.920]   to the extent that you can.
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:52.840]   And we spend a lot of our time
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:54.760]   doing something with ourselves,
[02:11:54.760 --> 02:11:57.280]   in my case, physics, in your case, I don't know,
[02:11:57.280 --> 02:11:59.960]   whatever it is, machine learning and this.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:02.220]   (chuckles)
[02:12:02.220 --> 02:12:06.400]   We should, yeah, I should have fun.
[02:12:06.400 --> 02:12:07.960]   - What was, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:10.960]   follow your dreams, what dream did you have?
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:14.600]   'Cause there's-- - Well, originally I was--
[02:12:14.600 --> 02:12:16.120]   - 'Cause you didn't follow your dream.
[02:12:16.120 --> 02:12:16.960]   I thought you were supposed to be a writer.
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:17.960]   - Well, I changed along the way.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:20.320]   I was gonna be, but I changed.
[02:12:20.320 --> 02:12:22.920]   - What happened? - That was what happened?
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:26.920]   Oh, I read, I decided to take
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.360]   the most serious literature course in my high school,
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:31.320]   which was a mistake.
[02:12:31.320 --> 02:12:33.880]   I'd probably be a second-rate writer now.
[02:12:33.880 --> 02:12:37.080]   - Could be a Nobel Prize-winning writer.
[02:12:37.080 --> 02:12:42.080]   - And the book that we read,
[02:12:42.080 --> 02:12:47.460]   even though I had read Russian novels,
[02:12:47.460 --> 02:12:52.460]   I was 15, I think, cured me from being a novelist.
[02:12:52.460 --> 02:12:54.640]   - Destroyed your dream? - Yes.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.720]   - Cured you, okay, what was the book?
[02:12:56.720 --> 02:12:59.240]   - "Moby Dick." - Okay.
[02:12:59.240 --> 02:13:01.440]   - So why "Moby Dick?" - Yeah, why?
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:06.160]   - And so I've read it since, and it's a great novel.
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:07.760]   Maybe it's as good as the Russian novels.
[02:13:07.760 --> 02:13:08.680]   - I've never made it through.
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:11.040]   I, well, it was too boring, it was too long.
[02:13:11.040 --> 02:13:14.160]   - Okay, your words are gonna mesh with what I say.
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:15.400]   - Excellent. - And you may have
[02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:17.800]   the same problem at a older age.
[02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:19.440]   - Maybe that's why I'm not a writer. (laughs)
[02:13:19.440 --> 02:13:24.080]   - It may be, so the problem is, "Moby Dick" is,
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:27.000]   what I remember was there was a chapter
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:29.560]   that was maybe 100 pages long,
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:33.920]   all describing this, why there was Ahab and the white whale,
[02:13:33.920 --> 02:13:35.880]   and it was the battle between Ahab
[02:13:35.880 --> 02:13:39.400]   with his wooden peg leg and the white whale.
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:41.840]   And there was a chapter that was 100 pages long,
[02:13:41.840 --> 02:13:44.340]   in my memory, I don't know how long it really was,
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:48.920]   that described in detail the great white whale
[02:13:48.920 --> 02:13:51.160]   and what he was doing and what his fins were like
[02:13:51.160 --> 02:13:54.880]   and this and that, and it was so incredibly boring,
[02:13:54.880 --> 02:13:57.360]   the word you used, that I thought,
[02:13:57.360 --> 02:14:00.320]   if this is great literature, screw it.
[02:14:00.320 --> 02:14:02.400]   - Oh, fascinating. - Okay?
[02:14:02.400 --> 02:14:04.200]   Now, why did I have a problem?
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:07.280]   I know now in reflection, because I still read a lot,
[02:14:07.280 --> 02:14:11.960]   and I read that novel, you know,
[02:14:11.960 --> 02:14:16.960]   after I was 30 or 40 years old,
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:20.520]   and the problem was simple, I diagnosed what the problem was.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:25.400]   I, that novel, in contrast to the Russian novels,
[02:14:25.400 --> 02:14:29.040]   which are very realistic and, you know, point of view,
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:31.560]   is one huge metaphor.
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:32.900]   - Oh, yeah.
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:35.880]   - At 15 years old, I probably didn't know the word,
[02:14:35.880 --> 02:14:38.160]   and I certainly didn't know the meaning of a metaphor.
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:40.040]   - Yeah, like, why do I care about a fish?
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:41.760]   Why are you telling me all about this fish?
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:44.040]   - Exactly, it's one big metaphor,
[02:14:44.040 --> 02:14:48.240]   so reading it later as a metaphor, I could really enjoy it.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:50.020]   But the teacher gave me the wrong book,
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:51.120]   or maybe it was the right book,
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:53.000]   'cause I went into physics, and so,
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:58.320]   but it was truly, I think, I may oversimplify,
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.600]   but it was really that I was too young to read that book,
[02:15:00.600 --> 02:15:03.560]   because, not too young to read the Russian novels,
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:06.120]   interestingly, but too young to read that,
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:08.160]   because I probably didn't even know the word,
[02:15:08.160 --> 02:15:11.400]   and I certainly didn't understand it as a metaphor.
[02:15:11.400 --> 02:15:12.240]   - Well, in terms of fish,
[02:15:12.240 --> 02:15:14.400]   I recommend people read "Old Man and the Sea,"
[02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:17.480]   much shorter, much better, still a metaphor, though, so,
[02:15:17.480 --> 02:15:19.800]   but you can read it just as a story
[02:15:19.800 --> 02:15:24.180]   about a guy catching a fish, and it's still fun to read.
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:30.300]   I had the same experience as you, not with Moby Dick,
[02:15:30.300 --> 02:15:32.980]   but later in college, I took a course on James Joyce.
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:34.580]   Don't ask me why.
[02:15:34.580 --> 02:15:36.060]   I was majoring in computer science,
[02:15:36.060 --> 02:15:37.940]   I took a course on James Joyce,
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:42.500]   and I was kept being told that he is widely considered,
[02:15:42.500 --> 02:15:46.800]   by many considered, to be the greatest literary writer
[02:15:46.800 --> 02:15:48.860]   of the 20th century.
[02:15:48.860 --> 02:15:51.840]   And I kept reading, I think, so his short story is,
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:54.060]   "The Dead," I think it's called, it was very good.
[02:15:54.060 --> 02:15:56.580]   Well, not very good, but pretty good.
[02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:58.300]   And then, "Ulysses." - It's actually very good.
[02:15:58.300 --> 02:15:59.140]   - It is very good.
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:00.900]   I mean, "The Dead," the final story,
[02:16:00.900 --> 02:16:02.380]   still rings with me today.
[02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:06.260]   But then, "Ulysses" was, I got through "Ulysses"
[02:16:06.260 --> 02:16:08.660]   with the help of some Cliff Notes and so on, but,
[02:16:08.660 --> 02:16:11.340]   and so I did "Ulysses" and then "Finnegan's Wake."
[02:16:11.340 --> 02:16:13.740]   The moment I started "Finnegan's Wake,"
[02:16:13.740 --> 02:16:15.900]   I said, "This is stupid.
[02:16:17.420 --> 02:16:21.660]   That's when I went full into, I don't know,
[02:16:21.660 --> 02:16:24.780]   that's when I went full Kafka, Bukowski,
[02:16:24.780 --> 02:16:27.340]   like people who just talk about the darkness
[02:16:27.340 --> 02:16:30.680]   of the human condition in the fewest words possible,
[02:16:30.680 --> 02:16:35.680]   and without any of the music of language.
[02:16:35.680 --> 02:16:38.580]   So it was a turning point as well.
[02:16:38.580 --> 02:16:40.820]   I wonder when is the right time
[02:16:40.820 --> 02:16:45.060]   to appreciate the beauty of language.
[02:16:45.060 --> 02:16:47.220]   Like even Shakespeare, I was very much off-put
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:48.700]   by Shakespeare in high school,
[02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:52.020]   and only later started to appreciate its value
[02:16:52.020 --> 02:16:52.860]   in the same way.
[02:16:52.860 --> 02:16:55.800]   Let me ask you a ridiculous question.
[02:16:55.800 --> 02:16:58.140]   - Okay.
[02:16:58.140 --> 02:17:02.820]   - I mean, because you've read Rush Literature,
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:05.800]   let me ask this one last question.
[02:17:05.800 --> 02:17:09.540]   I might be lying, there might be a couple more,
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:12.340]   but what do you think is the meaning of this whole thing?
[02:17:12.340 --> 02:17:16.660]   You got a Nobel Prize for looking out
[02:17:16.660 --> 02:17:18.580]   into the, trying to reach back
[02:17:18.580 --> 02:17:20.660]   into the beginning of the universe,
[02:17:20.660 --> 02:17:22.780]   listening to the gravitational waves,
[02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:26.380]   but that still doesn't answer the why.
[02:17:26.380 --> 02:17:29.280]   Why are we here?
[02:17:29.280 --> 02:17:32.440]   Beyond just the matter and antimatter.
[02:17:32.440 --> 02:17:35.340]   The philosophical question.
[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:39.340]   - The philosophical question about the meaning of life
[02:17:39.340 --> 02:17:41.560]   I'm probably not really good at.
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:44.340]   I think that
[02:17:44.340 --> 02:17:45.180]   the
[02:17:45.180 --> 02:17:50.200]   the individual meaning,
[02:17:50.200 --> 02:17:55.140]   I would say rather simplistically,
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:59.300]   is whether you've made a difference,
[02:17:59.300 --> 02:18:00.900]   a positive difference, I'd say,
[02:18:00.900 --> 02:18:02.880]   for anything besides yourself.
[02:18:02.880 --> 02:18:09.180]   Meaning you could have been important to other people,
[02:18:09.180 --> 02:18:11.860]   or you could have discovered gravitational waves
[02:18:11.860 --> 02:18:13.580]   that matters to other people or something,
[02:18:13.580 --> 02:18:17.340]   but something beyond just existing on the Earth
[02:18:17.340 --> 02:18:18.420]   as an individual.
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:23.100]   So your life has meaning if you have affected
[02:18:23.100 --> 02:18:29.900]   either knowledge or people or something beyond yourself.
[02:18:29.900 --> 02:18:33.220]   - Do you-- - That's a simplistic
[02:18:33.220 --> 02:18:36.220]   statement, but it's about as good as I can have.
[02:18:36.220 --> 02:18:41.220]   - That may, in all of its simplicity, it may be very true.
[02:18:42.380 --> 02:18:43.600]   Do you think about,
[02:18:43.600 --> 02:18:47.900]   does it make you sad that this ride ends?
[02:18:47.900 --> 02:18:49.660]   Do you think about your mortality?
[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:51.640]   - Yeah.
[02:18:51.640 --> 02:18:54.100]   - Are you afraid of it?
[02:18:54.100 --> 02:18:59.100]   - I'm not exactly afraid of it, but saddened by it.
[02:18:59.100 --> 02:18:59.920]   And
[02:18:59.920 --> 02:19:04.780]   you know, I'm old enough to know that
[02:19:04.780 --> 02:19:08.180]   I've lived most of my life,
[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:09.000]   and
[02:19:10.780 --> 02:19:12.820]   I enjoy being alive.
[02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:15.500]   I can imagine being sick and not wanting to be alive,
[02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:16.420]   but I'm not.
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:18.140]   And so
[02:19:18.140 --> 02:19:20.940]   I'm--
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:22.940]   - It's been a good ride.
[02:19:22.940 --> 02:19:26.180]   - Yeah, and I'm not happy to see it come to an end.
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:27.980]   I'd like to see it prolong.
[02:19:27.980 --> 02:19:28.820]   But
[02:19:28.820 --> 02:19:31.060]   I don't,
[02:19:31.060 --> 02:19:36.980]   I don't fear the dying itself,
[02:19:36.980 --> 02:19:38.260]   or that kind of thing.
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:40.740]   It's more I'd like to prolong
[02:19:40.740 --> 02:19:45.260]   what is, I think, a good life
[02:19:45.260 --> 02:19:48.060]   that I'm living and still living.
[02:19:48.060 --> 02:19:49.160]   - That's kind of,
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:53.740]   it's sad to think that the fineness of it
[02:19:53.740 --> 02:19:57.820]   is the thing that makes it special.
[02:19:57.820 --> 02:20:02.480]   And also sad to,
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:06.420]   to me at least, it's kind of,
[02:20:06.420 --> 02:20:08.260]   I don't think I'm using too strong of a word,
[02:20:08.260 --> 02:20:10.820]   but it's kind of terrifying, the uncertainty of it.
[02:20:10.820 --> 02:20:14.660]   The mystery of it, you know.
[02:20:14.660 --> 02:20:15.820]   - The mystery of death.
[02:20:15.820 --> 02:20:18.220]   - The mystery of it, yeah, of death.
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:20.000]   When we're talking about the mystery of black holes,
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:22.460]   that's somehow distant, that's somehow out there.
[02:20:22.460 --> 02:20:24.620]   And the mystery of our own--
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:27.580]   - But even life, the mystery of consciousness,
[02:20:27.580 --> 02:20:31.020]   I find so hard to deal with too.
[02:20:31.020 --> 02:20:32.860]   I mean, it's not as painful.
[02:20:32.860 --> 02:20:36.700]   I mean, we're conscious, but the whole magic of life,
[02:20:36.700 --> 02:20:38.700]   we can understand, but consciousness,
[02:20:38.700 --> 02:20:43.460]   where we can actually think and so forth, it's pretty--
[02:20:43.460 --> 02:20:45.100]   - It seems like such a beautiful gift
[02:20:45.100 --> 02:20:48.440]   that it really sucks that we get to let go of it,
[02:20:48.440 --> 02:20:49.980]   we have to let go of it.
[02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:51.980]   What do you hope your legacy is?
[02:20:51.980 --> 02:20:53.620]   As I'm sure they will.
[02:20:53.620 --> 02:20:54.740]   Aliens, when they visit,
[02:20:54.740 --> 02:20:58.220]   and humans have destroyed all of human civilization.
[02:20:58.220 --> 02:21:00.580]   Aliens read about you in an encyclopedia
[02:21:00.580 --> 02:21:02.140]   that we'll leave behind.
[02:21:02.140 --> 02:21:03.660]   What do you hope it says?
[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:06.100]   - Well, I would hope they,
[02:21:06.100 --> 02:21:10.780]   to the extent that they evaluated me,
[02:21:10.780 --> 02:21:13.940]   felt that I helped move science forward
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:17.140]   as a tangible contribution,
[02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:21.060]   and that I served as a good role model
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:24.260]   for how humans should live their lives.
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:27.340]   - And were part of creating
[02:21:27.340 --> 02:21:32.340]   one of the most incredible things humans have ever created.
[02:21:32.340 --> 02:21:33.940]   - So yes, there's the science,
[02:21:33.940 --> 02:21:35.680]   that's the Fermi thing, right?
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:38.220]   - And the instrument, I guess.
[02:21:38.220 --> 02:21:39.060]   - And the instrument.
[02:21:39.060 --> 02:21:41.940]   The instrument is a magical creation,
[02:21:41.940 --> 02:21:44.980]   not just by a human, by a collection of humans.
[02:21:44.980 --> 02:21:47.740]   The collaboration is,
[02:21:47.740 --> 02:21:53.140]   that's humanity at its best.
[02:21:53.140 --> 02:21:59.340]   I do hope we last quite a bit longer,
[02:21:59.340 --> 02:22:04.340]   but if we don't, this is a good thing to remember humans by.
[02:22:04.340 --> 02:22:06.420]   At least they built that thing.
[02:22:06.420 --> 02:22:08.580]   That's pretty impressive.
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:10.100]   Barry, this was an amazing conversation.
[02:22:10.100 --> 02:22:12.100]   Thank you so much for wasting your time
[02:22:12.100 --> 02:22:14.420]   in explaining so many things so well.
[02:22:14.420 --> 02:22:15.740]   I appreciate your time today.

[02:22:26.060 --> 02:22:28.180]   And now, let me leave you with some words
[02:22:28.180 --> 02:22:31.540]   from Werner Heisenberg, a theoretical physicist
[02:22:31.540 --> 02:22:34.440]   and one of the key pioneers of quantum mechanics.
[02:22:34.440 --> 02:22:39.500]   "Not only is the universe stranger than we think,
[02:22:39.500 --> 02:22:42.420]   "it is stranger than we can think."
[02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:46.500]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:49.080]   (upbeat music)
[02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:51.660]   (upbeat music)
