[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.600]   Well, how does Jesus change our relationship to the Old Testament?
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.400]   It's a question we get all the time.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.680]   Here's two recent examples, Micah in Buffalo, New York.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.680]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.680]   What role did the Ten Commandments play in the life and ministry of the New Testament
[00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.680]   Church?
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.000]   If these commandments are part of God's conditional covenant with the nation of Israel, which
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.800]   was broken, is there any abiding use for these commands in evangelism or moral instruction?"
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.200]   Here's another version of the same question from a listener named Pat.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.760]   "Pastor John, are there any helpful rules of thumb for interpreting which particular
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.760]   commandments in the Old Testament apply to Christians today and why?
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.920]   For example, Leviticus 18 and 19 contain various commandments against sexual immorality and
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.920]   child sacrifice.
[00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.400]   I think it's safe to say that most listeners of the show would agree that these commandments
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.760]   apply to the Christian today.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.480]   However, the same chapter is worn against wearing a garment that is made of two kinds
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.240]   of material, rounding off the hair on your temples, and forbidding tattoos.
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.120]   Are there any helpful ways to approach the Old Testament that would help make sense of
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.440]   these various commandments?"
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.240]   Pastor John, how do you come at these questions like these from Micah and Pat?
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:26.560]   The question I am trying to answer is basically how should New Testament Christians who believe
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:34.800]   in Jesus Christ, the Messiah, appropriate Old Testament laws in our day?
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:42.140]   I would start by saying even the writers of the Old Testament would agree that it would
[00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:50.320]   be contrary to the Old Testament to appropriate Old Testament laws after the Messiah has come
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.400]   as though He hadn't come.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.480]   Amen.
[00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.800]   Even Old Testament authors would say that.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.120]   And the Messiah has come.
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:09.000]   Jesus Christ is the Messiah, and therefore we dare not simply appropriate the Old Testament
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.700]   laws for our lives as though He had not come.
[00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:23.300]   So let me point to four ways that the New Testament talks about the change in how we
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.800]   use the Old Testament laws since Jesus has come.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.000]   Here's the first one.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.460]   The simplest way to see the massive implications of His coming is to realize that when He died,
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:43.740]   when Christ died for our sins, He put an end to the entire sacrificial system of the Old
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:51.520]   Testament because the sacrifice of all those animals and the performance of all those rituals
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.060]   in the temple or tabernacle were pointing toward a great final sacrifice described in
[00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.160]   Isaiah 53 when the Messiah comes.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.560]   So hundreds of commandments and rules regarding animal sacrifices and priestly activity are
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.920]   brought to an end, fulfilled, as Jesus says in Matthew 5:17, by Jesus' life and death
[00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.040]   as our final sacrifice and our final high priest.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.620]   This is what the book of Hebrews is written to show.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.140]   For example, Hebrews 7, 27, He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.900]   daily, first for His own sins and then for those of the people, since He did this once
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.900]   for all.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.040]   That's one of the most important phrases in Hebrews, "once for all," when He offered
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.100]   up Himself.
[00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.820]   That phrase "once for all" is so important.
[00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.260]   Track it down in all of its uses in Hebrews.
[00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:00.420]   So here's the second massive change that came about with the coming of Jesus that points
[00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.380]   to a change in how the law is used.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:12.940]   Jesus is forming a new people of God made up not only of Jews but of all the peoples
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.060]   of the world who believe in Him.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.060]   So at the end of the book of Matthew, "Go make disciples of all nations," Jews and all
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.140]   the other thousands of people groups on the planet.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:35.140]   So the time is past for God's focusing primarily on Israel as His redeemed covenant people,
[00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.140]   which He did for 2,000 years.
[00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:43.840]   The new covenant has been inaugurated with the blood of Jesus, Luke 22, 20, which includes
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.580]   everyone who believes in the Messiah and has a new heart.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:54.580]   So Jesus spoke these ominous words in Matthew 21, 43.
[00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:02.760]   He said, "The kingdom of God will be taken away from you," addressing the Jewish leaders
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.580]   as representative of Israel.
[00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.380]   "Will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits."
[00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.660]   That's the church, which includes any Jews who believe.
[00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.260]   So all the nations and all the Jews who believe are the new fruit-producing people, and the
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:25.340]   shift has happened from the focus on Israel to the focus on this new people of God.
[00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:32.660]   The implication this has for the appropriation of the Old Testament laws is that all the
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:40.980]   laws which had as their design a ritual distinction between Israel and the nations have come to
[00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.780]   an end because those nations are now being folded into the very people of God, and the
[00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.340]   cultural stumbling blocks are being removed, like circumcision, like food and dietary laws,
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.020]   like the weaving together of two different fabrics that you're not supposed to wear in
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.620]   order to show that there's a distinction between Israel and the nations.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.140]   And Jesus says explicitly in Mark 7, 19, "All foods are now clean for you."
[00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:17.980]   A third way to see the change that Jesus has brought about is that he now goes behind the
[00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:28.260]   Old Testament mosaic laws to God's original design in creation, and argues that the law
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:38.620]   in some cases was a temporary compromise with sin, but in the beginning it was not so.
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.460]   It was different.
[00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.300]   That's the way he deals in the Old Testament, for example, with the laws of divorce.
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.100]   I think the same thing with polygamy.
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:56.580]   He says the law permitting divorce was "owing to your hardness of heart."
[00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:04.260]   And then he reaches back to Genesis 2, 24 to say, "When God made man one flesh, let
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:09.940]   no one separate this union," Mark 10, 4 through 6.
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:18.260]   So there's this creational dimension which in the coming of Jesus takes precedent over
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.700]   the legal compromises in the Old Testament.
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:26.340]   Here's the fourth and last thing I'll say.
[00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:32.860]   The fourth way to see how things have changed with the coming of Christ is to realize that
[00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:42.100]   Christ by his death and his indwelling Spirit have put our relationship with God on a new
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:43.100]   footing.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:49.060]   The mosaic law doesn't have the same standing for those who have died with Christ and risen
[00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.900]   to walk in newness of life.
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:54.540]   The key passage here is Romans 7, 4 and 6.
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.420]   It goes like this.
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:08:05.700]   You have died to the law through the body of Christ so that you may belong to another.
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:10.660]   So once you belong to the law, now you belong to another, namely to him who has been raised
[00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.180]   from the dead in order that we may bear fruit for God.
[00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:20.860]   In other words, there's a new footing, a new way to pursue righteousness, and it isn't
[00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:22.620]   list keeping or law keeping.
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:26.980]   It's bearing fruit because you belong to Jesus Christ.
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:33.460]   Now verse 6, "Now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive,
[00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:41.940]   so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit, not in the old way of the written code."
[00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:47.700]   This doesn't mean that commandments have no place in the Christian life.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.020]   For example, 1 Corinthians 7, 19, "Neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision,
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.300]   but keeping the commandments of God," which is a puzzling text because circumcision was
[00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.540]   a command, right?
[00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:05.300]   So he's making some kind of distinction there of what commandments are still binding and
[00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:06.380]   which aren't.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.920]   Or 1 John 5, 3, "This is the love of God, that we keep his commandments, and his commandments
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.660]   are not burdensome."
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:23.980]   So last question then is, within this fourth way of looking at the change, what criteria
[00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:30.620]   does the New Testament give us for appropriating God's abiding commandments?
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.220]   And let me mention just three.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.780]   One, love.
[00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:40.860]   I'm thinking of Matthew 22, 40, "On these two commandments, love God and love your neighbor,
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:45.700]   depend all the law and the prophets."
[00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:53.220]   Or Matthew 12, 7, "If you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice,'
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:56.020]   you would not have condemned the guiltless."
[00:09:56.020 --> 00:10:07.540]   In other words, there are mercy and law commandments which sum up the entire legal, moral code
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:10.780]   and become a guideline for us today.
[00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.100]   Number two, sound doctrine in accord with the gospel.
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:21.980]   I'm thinking of 1 Timothy 1, 8, "Now we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully,"
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:29.340]   and gives a list of commandments and says, "Whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine."
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.020]   So that's what laws are for.
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:33.220]   What is contrary to sound doctrine?
[00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:39.860]   And then he adds, "In accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God."
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.740]   What laws accord with this?
[00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:48.460]   And finally, third, what is rooted in nature as God created it.
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.180]   That's how he argues in 1 Timothy 2, 13 as it relates to woman's authority over man,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:58.340]   and that's how he argues in Romans 1 with regard to homosexuality.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:11:03.100]   Now there are more pointers in the New Testament for how to appropriate the Old Testament laws,
[00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:06.340]   but these may suffice to point the way.
[00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.340]   And I think if I were helping a child—I want to try to make it real simple now as
[00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:18.420]   I close—if I were helping a child read the Bible, I would say something like this, "Honey,
[00:11:18.420 --> 00:11:27.620]   some things commanded in the Old Testament are not what we are supposed to do today.
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:34.180]   They were right and what God's people were supposed to do in that day, but now Jesus
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:38.420]   has come and important things have changed."
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:42.220]   And you might take a month helping your kid understand what that is.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:48.020]   And then I'd finish like this, "Now, in our day, the safest way to know what's
[00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:55.300]   right and wrong is to make sure that the New Testament commands it or forbids it."
[00:11:55.300 --> 00:12:00.180]   Very good counsel on how to make sense of the Old Testament now that we are in Christ.
