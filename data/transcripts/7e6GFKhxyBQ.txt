[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   This week we welcome Michael Reeves to the podcast, filling in for John Piper.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Michael is the author of several books, including "The Unquenchable Flame,"
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   "Discovering the Heart of the Reformation," along with "The Lighting in the Trinity,"
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   one of my favorite books of 2012. He just finished work on a beautiful book
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   titled "Christ Our Life," which is scheduled to release on September 1st in the UK.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   It will be titled "Rejoicing in Christ" and released in the US early next year, early in 2015.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   Anyone who has read his books know Michael as a gifted church historian, a theologian,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   and a keen and incisive writer. He lives in the UK and currently serves as the director
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   of an online theology website, UnionTheology.org,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   and senior lecturer at Wales Evangelical School of Theology.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   We are grateful for your time, Michael. You write so much about the glory of Christ.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   How does being Christ-centered, focusing ministry on the glory of Christ,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   how does this change someone's life?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Well, let me tell you a story of Thomas Goodwin's conversion.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Thomas Goodwin, he was a great Puritan theologian and preacher. He was born in 1600.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Now, he's born of Puritan parents, Puritan stock, and he grew up quite religious.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   And he even decided at quite a young age that he wanted to be a preacher.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But without being a Christ-centered preacher who'd experienced the sovereign grace of God in his life,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   he had a ministry in those early days of battering consciences,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   that is, of seeking to get people to improve.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   He then had a religious crisis, a meltdown, in which he listened to a sermon.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He was about 20 years old. He heard a sermon that made him deeply concerned for his own spiritual state.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And he had seven years of gloomy introspection.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   He was grubbing around inside himself to see if he had enough faith to merit salvation,
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   to see if he was being meritorious enough.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And then an old pastor told him, at the end of those seven years, told him,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   "Don't trust to anything in yourself, whether performance or feelings. Look out and rest on Christ alone."
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And with that, he said he was freed.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   But what's so striking, I think, is not only was Goodwin's own life freed,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   his ministry profoundly changed because he now became a Christ-centered preacher.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   And having seen through those seven years of introspection, having God's grace having shone into his heart,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   he began to have a very deep, a radically deep understanding of sin.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   So he couldn't simply tell people to try to improve because he saw now they can't do it.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   And instead, he began to have not a big view of our own ability to be able to sort ourselves out,
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   but a big view of God's grace in Christ that can rescue those who are dead and enslaved in sin.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   And so he became a Christ-centered preacher who would preach that gospel with compassion for those who are addicted to sin and entirely enslaved to it.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He had a mentor, a great Richard Sibbes, who, when he was a young man, told Goodwin,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   "Young man, if ever you would do good, you must preach the gospel and the free grace of God in Christ Jesus."
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And I think an example of this would be in one of his most popular works called Christ Set Forth.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   And in that work, he makes it very clear he's aiming simply to hold Christ before the eyes of his readership.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And he makes it very clear why he wants to do it, because even in those days, which we often look back on the 17th century as a golden age of preaching,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   he believed that Christ simply wasn't well-known enough by people. People were ignorant of him, or as he put it, barren in their knowledge of Christ.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And therefore, they wouldn't look out of themselves to him, but they would trust in themselves.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   They'd either be imprisoned in their own guilt or dependent on their own performance, not looking out to Christ.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And so Goodwin, having seen the solution in the Saviour, wanted now for the rest of his ministry to set forth Christ with great clarity.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Now, I'm someone who's had a similar experience to Goodwin of a crisis of depending on myself, not knowing where to go to,
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   and then seeing the beautiful answer in Christ. And still today, Goodwin, he was a man who helped me through his writings.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   He's a man who sets forth Christ in a way that changes the reader because you're liberated by God's grace and not your own potential.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I think of maybe one other indication of how the man himself was changed.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   Goodwin's dying words, he was 80 years old, were something like this.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   He said on his deathbed, "My bow abides in strength now. Is Christ divided? No, I have the whole of his righteousness.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I'm found in Christ, not having my own righteousness, but his. The righteousness of Christ who loved me, gave himself for me."
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And then at the end, he said, "Christ cannot love me better than he does. I think I cannot love Christ better than I do now."
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   That is a beautiful testimony. Unfortunately, Thomas Goodwin is not very well known in the States.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   Many readers probably are hearing the name for the first time.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Is there a better book for someone to start with if they haven't read Thomas Goodwin than his book, The Heart of Christ?
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   Yes. Next to Christ Set Forth, the writing I mentioned, there was a book he put alongside it that he called The Heart of Christ in Heaven Towards Sinners on Earth,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   where he's looking at how the ascended, glorified Jesus considers his beloved people today.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's one of the most striking reads.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   It was always Goodwin's most popular book in his own lifetime. And you can see why today.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It is extraordinary thing that Goodwin's being forgotten today.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   He's being called the greatest pulpit exegete of Paul that has ever lived.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   One of the reasons I think he is rather forgotten is he's slightly tough meat, rather like John Owen to read, and therefore people have left him.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   But I think that's a mistake. Meat is worth eating because it helps you grow strong.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And Goodwin is worth reading because he will present Christ to you with an extraordinary clarity.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Wonderful. Yes, Goodwin was a master of presenting Christ with clarity.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   His book, The Heart of Christ, has been edited and made more readable by the Banner of Truth. Thank you, Banner of Truth.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   And the book is available as a Puritan paperback as we're checking out this edition.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   If you love Christ, but you wonder if Christ loves you, this book will rock your soul. Kid you not.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Again, it's titled The Heart of Christ by Thomas Goodwin.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   So how does theology fuel ambitious evangelism and world missions?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   There's a story from church history to be told, and Dr. Reeves will share it tomorrow.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I'm your host, Tony Ranke. Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John Podcast.
