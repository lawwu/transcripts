[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.880]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.120]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.680]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.620]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.680]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.940]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.960]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.880]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.580]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.680]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.540]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.520]   Our first sponsor is Roca.
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.640]   Roca makes sunglasses and eyeglasses that, in my opinion,
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.540]   are the absolute best out there.
[00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.620]   The sunglasses and eyeglasses that are made by Roca
[00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.520]   have a number of properties that are really unique.
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.720]   First of all, they're extremely lightweight.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.800]   You never even notice that they're on your face.
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.000]   Second, the optical clarity is fantastic.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.920]   One of the things that's really hard to accomplish
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.180]   but that Roca succeeded in accomplishing
[00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.080]   is making sunglasses that you can wear
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.920]   in lots of different environments.
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.420]   As you move from bright to shadowed regions, for instance,
[00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.760]   or as the amount of sunlight changes,
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.380]   many eyeglasses will make it such
[00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.700]   that it's hard to see your environment
[00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.260]   and you need to take the eyeglasses off
[00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.020]   or you can't see or detect borders.
[00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.980]   With Roca sunglasses, all of that is seamless.
[00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.920]   They clearly understand the adaptation mechanisms
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.060]   and habituation mechanisms.
[00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.460]   All these fancy details about the human visual system
[00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.620]   have allowed them to design a sunglass
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.220]   that allows you to be in any environment
[00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.560]   and to see that environment extremely well.
[00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.880]   The eyeglasses are terrific.
[00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.180]   I wear readers at night.
[00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.420]   And again, they just make the whole experience of reading
[00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.580]   or working on a screen at night very, very easy,
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:36.800]   very easy on the eyes.
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.920]   The aesthetic of the eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.140]   is also superb.
[00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.660]   You know, I chuckle sometimes when I see sports frames
[00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.160]   or sports glasses, a lot of them just look ridiculous,
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.900]   frankly, but the Roca eyeglasses and sunglasses
[00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.100]   have a terrific aesthetic.
[00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.180]   They have a huge variety to select from.
[00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:52.720]   If you'd like to try Roca glasses,
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.980]   you can go to Roca, that's R-O-K-A.com
[00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.300]   and enter the code Huberman
[00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.500]   and you'll get 20% off your first order.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.980]   That's R-O-K-A.com and enter the code Huberman
[00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.180]   to get 20% off your first order.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.740]   Today's podcast is also brought to us by Inside Tracker.
[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.320]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.140]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.740]   to help you better understand your body
[00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.900]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.520]   I'm a big believer in getting regular blood work done
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.260]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.460]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.900]   can only be detected from a quality blood test.
[00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.320]   One of the major problems with blood tests, however,
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.160]   is that oftentimes you'll get information back
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.220]   about levels of metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.620]   and there won't be any directives
[00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.700]   about what to do with that information.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.740]   With Inside Tracker, it makes all of that very easy.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.460]   First of all, they can come to your home
[00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.180]   to do the blood test and DNA test,
[00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.440]   or you can go to a local clinic.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.740]   They make that very easy.
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.240]   Second of all, when you get the information back
[00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.560]   about the levels of hormones and metabolic factors
[00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.000]   and other things in your blood,
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.320]   it gives you simple directives.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.040]   They have a dashboard that allows you to assess,
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.160]   for instance, whether or not you ought to make changes
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.540]   in your nutrition or changes in your exercise
[00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.320]   or changes in your sleep regimen,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.960]   any number of different lifestyle factors
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   that can help bring the markers and the various factors
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.500]   in your blood and DNA to the appropriate levels.
[00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:16.960]   So really they're putting you
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.840]   in the driver's seat for your health.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.480]   In fact, one of the listeners of this podcast
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.040]   contacted me recently and said I took an Inside Tracker test.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.620]   I felt like I was in great health,
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.720]   but I noticed from the test that I had high CRP,
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.120]   C-reactive protein.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.080]   C-reactive protein is a marker that if it's too high
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.920]   is a cautionary note about various cardiac
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.500]   and even eye diseases.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.360]   So it's something that they are now taking actions on
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   as a consequence of getting their blood work done
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.880]   and taking the Inside Tracker test.
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.320]   So I think that's just one of many examples
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.280]   that we hear about.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.040]   I have examples from my own life, for instance,
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.440]   of different factors in my blood being off
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.520]   and making adjustments to nutrition
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.240]   and other aspects of my life that have allowed me
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.160]   to bring those into the proper range.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.520]   So if you care about your health,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.920]   Inside Tracker may very well be right for you.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.880]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.920]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:08.760]   And if you do that,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.840]   you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.280]   Just use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.340]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.040]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.600]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.760]   I've been using Athletic Greens since 2012,
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.520]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.880]   Athletic Greens is terrific
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:31.600]   because it covers your nutritional basis.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.080]   If I drink Athletic Greens once
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.280]   and I sometimes drink it twice a day,
[00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.920]   then I'm sure that all the vitamins I need,
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.520]   I'm getting those, all the minerals I need,
[00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.640]   I'm getting those, and the probiotics.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.880]   There's now a ton of data showing
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.520]   that a healthy gut microbiome is vital to brain function,
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.840]   vital to immune function,
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.240]   and vital to all aspects of our health.
[00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.660]   So with Athletic Greens, you get the vitamins, the minerals,
[00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.100]   and the probiotics to cover all your bases.
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:59.140]   In fact, anytime people ask me what should they take
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.140]   or what could they do to support their health,
[00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.840]   provided that they already have their sleep
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.760]   and other aspects of their life in order,
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   Athletic Greens is the thing that I recommend
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.160]   because it covers all the foundations,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:12.360]   all the bases of what one really wants from a supplement
[00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.480]   without having to take a ton of different things.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.760]   It also tastes great.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.600]   Almost everybody that tries it and that's reported back to me
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.360]   has told me that they really like the taste.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.880]   I mix mine with water, a little bit of lemon and lime juice,
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.280]   and I really like the taste, it's delicious to me.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   I drink it once or twice a day.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.640]   It's keto-compatible,
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.900]   it's compatible with most fasting regimens,
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.360]   it's compatible with if you're vegan or if you're not vegan,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.480]   it's compatible with essentially
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.880]   every nutritional plan out there.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.400]   So it's just a terrific all-around supplement
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.240]   and benefit to one's health and diet.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.680]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:47.640]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman.

[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:51.280]   They'll give you five free travel packs
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:53.080]   that make it easy to mix up Athletic Greens
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.140]   while you're on the road.
[00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.120]   And they'll give you a year supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:01.180]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.880]   to claim that special offer.
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.200]   This month, we've been talking about the senses,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.280]   how we detect things in our environment.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.680]   The last episode was all about vision,
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.800]   how we take light and convert that information
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.560]   into things that we can perceive,
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.840]   like colors and faces and motion, things of that sort,
[00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.760]   as well as how we use light to change our biology
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.200]   in ways that are subconscious, that we don't realize,
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.680]   things like mood and metabolism and levels of alertness.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.540]   Today, we're going to talk about chemical sensing.
[00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:34.340]   We're going to talk about the sense of smell,
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.680]   our ability to detect odors in our environment.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.500]   We're also going to talk about taste,
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:44.060]   our ability to detect chemicals and make sense of chemicals
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:47.760]   that are put in our mouth and into our digestive tract.
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.740]   And we are going to talk about chemicals
[00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:52.220]   that are made by other human beings
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.980]   that powerfully modulate the way that we feel,
[00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.460]   our hormones, and our health.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.060]   Now, that last category are sometimes called pheromones.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:04.140]   However, whether or not pheromones exist in humans
[00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:05.560]   is rather controversial.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.180]   There actually hasn't been a clear example
[00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.960]   of a true human pheromonal effect.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.160]   But what is absolutely clear, what is undeniable,
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.060]   is that there are chemicals that human beings make
[00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:23.060]   and release in things like tears onto our skin and sweat
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:27.100]   and even breath that powerfully modulate
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:30.100]   or control the biology of other individuals.
[00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:33.680]   In fact, right now, even if you're completely alone,
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.380]   your chemical environment internally
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.120]   is being controlled by external chemicals.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.340]   Your nervous system and your hormones and your metabolism
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:46.160]   are being modified by things in your environment.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:48.040]   So we're going to talk about those.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.320]   It's an absolutely fascinating aspect to our biology.
[00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.060]   It's one of our most primordial,
[00:07:54.060 --> 00:07:56.420]   meaning primitive aspects of our biology,
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.620]   but it's still very active in all of us today.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:01.700]   This episode, believe it or not,
[00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:04.660]   will have a lot of tools, a lot of protocols.
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.280]   Even though I'm guessing most of you
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.180]   can probably smell your environment just fine,
[00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:12.380]   that you know what you like to eat and what tastes good
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.840]   and what doesn't taste good to you,
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:16.740]   today's episode is going to talk about tools
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:19.500]   that will allow you to actually leverage
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:21.260]   these chemical sensing mechanisms,
[00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.580]   including how you smell,
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:26.180]   not how you smell in the qualitative sense,
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:28.180]   but how you smell in the verb sense,
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.900]   the action of sniffing and smelling
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.380]   to enhance your sense of smell
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:35.820]   and to enhance your sense of taste,
[00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.980]   as well, believe it or not, to enhance your cognition,
[00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:41.500]   your ability to learn and remember things.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.240]   Everything we're going to talk about, as always,
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:45.600]   is grounded in quality peer-reviewed studies
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:47.460]   from some excellent laboratories.
[00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.400]   I'll provide some resources along the way.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.100]   So that means tools and protocols
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:52.360]   and also basic information.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.660]   You're going to learn a ton of neuroscience
[00:08:54.660 --> 00:08:56.800]   and a lot of biology in general.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.140]   And I think what you'll come to realize by the end
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.260]   is that while we are clearly different
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.740]   from the other animals,
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:06.700]   there are aspects to our biology that are very similar
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:10.380]   to that of other animals in very interesting ways.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:12.620]   Before we dive into chemical sensing,
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.580]   I want to just briefly touch on a few things
[00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:16.340]   from the vision episode.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:18.980]   One is a summary of a protocol.
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.940]   So I covered 13 protocols last episode.
[00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:24.020]   If you haven't seen that episode, check it out.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.540]   Those protocols will allow you to be more alert
[00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.940]   and to see better over time if you follow them.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:30.080]   All of them are zero cost.
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:33.320]   You can find any and all of them at hubermanlab.com.
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.560]   There's a link to those videos and tools and protocols.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.920]   Everything is timestamped.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.600]   The two protocols that I just want to remind everybody of
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.760]   are the protocol of near-far viewing
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.060]   that all of us, regardless of age,
[00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.480]   should probably spend about five minutes three times a week
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.720]   doing some near-far viewing exercises.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:59.280]   So that would be bringing a pen or pencil up close
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:01.380]   to the point where you're about to cross your eyes
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.800]   but you don't cross your eyes and then out at some distance
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:08.300]   and then look beyond that pen or other object
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.100]   that you're using off as far as you can into the distance.
[00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.220]   It would be great if you could do this on a balcony or deck
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:14.860]   and then look way off in the distance
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:16.100]   and then bring it back in.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.040]   This is going to exercise that accommodation reflex,
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.980]   the change in the shape of the lens
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:23.300]   can help offset a number of things,
[00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:25.720]   including myopia, nearsightedness.
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:28.580]   The other one is this incredible study
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:31.620]   that showed that two hours a day outside,
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.140]   even if you're doing other things while you're outside,
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:37.240]   can help offset myopia and nearsightedness.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.660]   So try and get outside.
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:40.880]   It's really the sunlight and the blue light, right?
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.620]   Everyone's been demonizing blue light out there,
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:45.740]   but blue light is great provided it's not super, super bright
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.140]   and really close to your eyes.
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.020]   Blue light is terrific if it comes from sunlight.
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:54.180]   Two hours a day outside is going to help offset myopia,
[00:10:54.180 --> 00:10:55.020]   nearsightedness.
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.360]   Now that's a lot of time.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:58.520]   I think most of us are not getting that time,
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.800]   but since you can do other things like gardening
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:03.140]   or reading or walking or running,
[00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:04.740]   if you can get that two hours outside,
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:08.060]   your visual system and your brain will benefit.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.140]   I also would like to make one brief correction
[00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:13.340]   to something that I said incorrectly
[00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:15.080]   in the previous episode.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.480]   At the end of the episode, I talked about lutein
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:22.740]   and how lutein may help offset some moderate
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:25.460]   to severe age-related macular degeneration.
[00:11:25.460 --> 00:11:27.560]   As well, I talked about how some people are supplementing
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.660]   with lutein even though they don't have
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:31.700]   age-related macular degeneration,
[00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:33.580]   with the idea in mind that it might help
[00:11:33.580 --> 00:11:36.740]   offset some vision loss as they get older.
[00:11:36.740 --> 00:11:40.280]   I said lutein and lutein was the correct thing to say,
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:43.940]   but once or twice when I started speaking fast,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.440]   I said leucine and not lutein.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.700]   I want to emphasize that leucine and amino acid,
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:52.780]   very interesting, important for muscle building,
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:54.520]   covered in previous episodes,
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:59.220]   but lutein, L-U-T-E-I-N,
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.860]   is the molecule and compound that I was referring to
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:04.500]   in terms of supplementing for sake of vision.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.720]   So I apologize, please forgive me, I misspoke.
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.920]   A couple of you caught that right away.
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:11.820]   In listening to the episode after it went up,
[00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:13.620]   I realized that I had misspoken.
[00:12:13.620 --> 00:12:17.340]   So lutein for vision, lutein for muscles
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.100]   and muscle growth and strength, et cetera.
[00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.020]   Before we dive into the content of today's episode,
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.800]   I want to just briefly touch on color vision.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.380]   Many of you asked questions about color vision
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:31.600]   and color perception, and indeed color perception
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.080]   is a fascinating aspect of the human visual system.
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.140]   It's one of the things that makes us unique.
[00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.360]   There are certainly other animals out there
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.520]   that can detect all the colors of the rainbow.
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.720]   Some can even detect into the infrared
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.400]   and to the far red that we can't see,
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.140]   but nonetheless, human color vision,
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.160]   provided that somebody isn't colorblind,
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.060]   is really remarkable.
[00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.160]   And if you're interested in color vision
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.380]   or you want to answer questions about art
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:00.900]   or about, for instance, why that dress
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:02.540]   that showed up online a few years ago
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:05.160]   looks blue to you and yellow to somebody else,
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:07.960]   all the answers to that are in this terrific book,
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:09.660]   which is "What is Color?"
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:12.440]   15 questions and answers on the science of color.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.820]   I did not write this book, I wish I had.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:17.600]   The book is by Ariel and Joan Ekstut,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.380]   that's E-C-K-S-T-U-T.
[00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:21.780]   So it's "What is Color?"
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.620]   50 questions and answers on the science of color.
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.100]   It's an absolutely fabulous book.
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:29.200]   I have no business relationship to them.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.300]   I did help them get in contact
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.860]   with some color vision scientists
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:34.300]   when they reached out to me.
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:36.260]   And you can know that all the information in the book
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.160]   was vetted by excellent color vision scientists.
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.080]   It's a really wonderful and beautiful book.
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.600]   The illustrations are beautiful.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.280]   If you're somebody who's interested in design or art,
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.340]   or you're just curious about the science of color,
[00:13:48.340 --> 00:13:50.400]   it's a terrific book, I highly recommend it.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.840]   If you just look it up online,
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.240]   there are a variety of places
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.200]   that will allow you to access the book.
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.400]   So let's talk about sensing chemicals
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.520]   and how chemicals control us.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.400]   In our environment,
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.720]   there are a lot of different physical stimuli.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.000]   There is light, photons, which are light energy,
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:11.520]   and those land on your retinas
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.880]   and your retinas tell your brain about them
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.900]   and your brain creates this thing we call vision.
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.180]   There are sound waves, literally particles
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.200]   moving through the air and reverberations
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.520]   that create what we call sound and hearing.
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:29.280]   And of course there are mechanical stimuli,
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:34.280]   pressure, light touch, scratch, tickle, et cetera,
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.040]   that lands on our skin or the blowing of a breeze
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.400]   that deflects the hairs on our skin.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:44.400]   And we can sense mechanical touch, mechanical sensation.
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:46.160]   And there are chemicals.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.720]   There are things floating around in the environment,
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.620]   which we call volatile chemicals.
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.860]   So volatile sounds oftentimes like emotionally volatile,
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:58.380]   but it just means that they're floating around out there.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:01.000]   So when you actually smell something,
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.960]   like let's say you smell a wonderfully smelling rose
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.960]   or cake, yes, you are inhaling the particles into your nose.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:12.280]   There are literally little particles of those chemicals
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.200]   are going up into your nose
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.840]   and being detected by your brain.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.760]   Also, if you smell something putrid, disgusting or awful,
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.840]   use your imagination.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:26.760]   Those particles are going up into your nose
[00:15:26.760 --> 00:15:30.540]   and being detected by neurons that are part of your brain.
[00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:34.400]   Other ways of getting chemicals into our system
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:37.440]   is by putting them in our mouth,
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.520]   by literally taking foods and chewing them
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:43.780]   or sucking on them and breaking them down
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:45.400]   into their component parts.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:47.300]   And that's one way that we sense chemicals
[00:15:47.300 --> 00:15:50.020]   with this thing, our tongue.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:53.100]   And there are chemicals that can enter
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:57.120]   through other mucosal linings and other kind of,
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.340]   just think damp, sticky linings of your body.
[00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.760]   And the main ones would be the eyes.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:04.860]   So you've got your nose, your eyes and your mouth,
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.600]   but mainly when we have chemicals coming into our system,
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.260]   it's through our nose or through our mouth.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:12.840]   Although sometimes through our skin,
[00:16:12.840 --> 00:16:15.220]   certain things can go transdermal, not many,
[00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:17.060]   and through our eyes.
[00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:21.580]   So these chemicals, we sometimes bring into our body,
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.900]   into our biology through deliberate action.
[00:16:24.900 --> 00:16:27.760]   We select a food, we chew that food
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.920]   and we do it intentionally.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.080]   Sometimes they're coming into our body
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.820]   through non-deliberate action.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:35.340]   We enter an environment and there's smoke
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:39.260]   and we smell the smoke and as a consequence, we take action.
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.460]   Sometimes we are forced to eat something
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.260]   because somebody tells us we should eat it
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:44.780]   or we do it to be polite.
[00:16:44.780 --> 00:16:45.600]   So there are all these ways
[00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:48.480]   that chemicals can make it into our body.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:52.560]   Sometimes however, other people are actively making chemicals
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.720]   with their body.
[00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:58.280]   Typically this would be with their breath, with their tears,
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:01.780]   or possibly, I want to underscore possibly
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.480]   by making what are called pheromones,
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.560]   molecules that they release into the environment,
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.640]   typically through the breath that enter our system
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.020]   through our nose, our eyes, or our mouth
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.080]   that fundamentally change our biology.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.380]   I will explain how smell and taste
[00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:20.780]   and these pheromone effects work,
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:22.280]   but I'll just give an example,
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.420]   which is a very salient and interesting one
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   that was published about 10 years ago
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:28.960]   in the journal Science.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.780]   Science Magazine is one of the three,
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.040]   what we call apex journals.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:34.360]   There are a lot of journals out there,
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.760]   but for those of you that want to know,
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:40.360]   Science Magazine, Nature Magazine, and Cell
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.480]   are considered the three top kind of apex journals.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:44.940]   They are the most stringent
[00:17:44.940 --> 00:17:47.900]   in terms of getting papers accepted there,
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.000]   even reviewed there.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.360]   They have about a 95% rejection rate at the front gate,
[00:17:53.360 --> 00:17:55.340]   meaning they don't even review 95%
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:56.640]   of what gets sent to them.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.120]   Of the things that they do decide to review
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.240]   then get sent out,
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:02.480]   a very small percentage of those get published.
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.760]   It's very stringent.
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.440]   This paper came out in Science
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.300]   showing that humans, men in particular in this study,
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:14.400]   have a strong biological response and hormonal response
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.280]   to the tears of women.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.760]   What they did is they had women,
[00:18:20.760 --> 00:18:23.640]   and in this case it was only women for whatever reason,
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:28.420]   cry and they collected their tears.
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:32.080]   Then those tears were smelled by male subjects
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:36.560]   or male subjects got what was essentially the control,
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.220]   which was the saline.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:43.000]   Men that smelled these tears that were evoked by sadness
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:46.480]   had a reduction in their testosterone levels
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:48.160]   that was significant.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:50.720]   They also had a reduction in brain areas
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.560]   that were associated with sexual arousal.
[00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.320]   Now, before you run off with your interpretations
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:58.400]   about what this means and criticize the study
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.360]   for any variety of reasons,
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:02.160]   let's just take a step back.
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:04.480]   I will criticize the study for a variety of reasons.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:08.220]   Two, one is that they only used female tears
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:09.520]   and male subjects.
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:13.400]   So it would have been nice for them to also use female tears
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.080]   and female subjects smelling those,
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.760]   male tears and male subjects smelling those,
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:22.240]   male tears and female subjects smelling those and so on.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.400]   They didn't do that.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:25.700]   They did have a large number of subjects, so that's good.
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:27.180]   That adds power to the study.
[00:19:28.060 --> 00:19:31.240]   And they did have to collect these tears
[00:19:31.240 --> 00:19:34.500]   by having the women watch what was essentially a sad scene
[00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:35.380]   from a movie.
[00:19:35.380 --> 00:19:37.920]   They actually recruited subjects that had a high propensity
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.560]   for crying at sad movies, which was not all women.
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.080]   It turns out that the people that they recruited
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.740]   for the study were people who said,
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:48.380]   "Yes, I tend to cry when I see sad things in movies."
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.820]   What they were really trying to do is just get tears
[00:19:50.820 --> 00:19:55.200]   that were authentically cried in response to sadness
[00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:58.320]   as opposed to putting some irritant in the eye
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:02.180]   and collecting tears that were evoked by something else
[00:20:02.180 --> 00:20:04.740]   like just having the eyes irritated.
[00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:08.340]   Nonetheless, what this study illustrates
[00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:12.880]   is that there are chemicals in tears that are evoking
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.500]   or changing the biology of other individuals.
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.700]   Now, most of us don't think about sniffing
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.900]   or smelling other people's tears,
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:24.080]   but you can imagine how in close couples
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:27.680]   or in family members or even close friendships, et cetera,
[00:20:27.680 --> 00:20:29.740]   that we are often in close proximity
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.560]   to other people's tears.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.100]   Now, I didn't select this study as an example
[00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:36.820]   because I want to focus on the effects of tears
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.200]   on hormones per se,
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.820]   although I do find the results really interesting.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:44.340]   I chose it because I wanted to just emphasize
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.340]   or underscore the fact that chemicals that are made
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:50.740]   by other individuals are powerfully modulating
[00:20:50.740 --> 00:20:52.720]   our internal state.
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.280]   And that's something that most of us don't appreciate.
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:58.420]   I think most of us can appreciate the fact
[00:20:58.420 --> 00:21:01.060]   that if we smell something putrid, we tend to retract,
[00:21:01.060 --> 00:21:04.720]   or if we smell something delicious, we tend to lean into it.
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:06.740]   But there are all these ways in which chemicals
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.300]   are affecting our biology,
[00:21:08.300 --> 00:21:12.620]   and interpersonal communication using chemicals
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.520]   is not something that we hear that often about,
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:16.860]   but it's super interesting.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:19.340]   So let's talk about smell and what smell is
[00:21:19.340 --> 00:21:20.320]   and how it works.
[00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:21.900]   I'm going to make this very basic,
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:24.060]   but I am going to touch on some of the core elements
[00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.520]   of the neurobiology.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:27.660]   So here's how smell works.
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.560]   Smell starts with sniffing.
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:32.200]   Now that may come as no surprise,
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:36.180]   but no volatile chemicals can enter our nose
[00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:37.640]   unless we inhale them.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.900]   If our nose is occluded or if we're actively exhaling,
[00:21:41.900 --> 00:21:45.240]   it's much more difficult for smells to enter our nose,
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:46.660]   which is why people cover their nose
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:49.380]   when something smells bad.
[00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:52.420]   Now, the way that these volatile odors
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.140]   come into the nose is interesting.
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:57.480]   The nose has a mucosal lining, mucus,
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.160]   that is designed to trap things,
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:02.180]   to actually bring things in and get stuck there.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:04.500]   At the base of your brain,
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.380]   so you could actually imagine this or if you wanted,
[00:22:07.380 --> 00:22:09.100]   you could touch the roof of your mouth,
[00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.140]   but right above your mouth,
[00:22:11.140 --> 00:22:14.500]   about two centimeters is your olfactory bulb.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.620]   The olfactory bulb is a collection of neurons,
[00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:20.380]   and those neurons actually extend out of the skull,
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.720]   out of your skull, into your nose, into the mucosal lining.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:27.340]   So what this means in kind of a literal sense
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.900]   is that you have neurons that extend their little dendrites
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:34.260]   and axonoid-like things, their little processes,
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.300]   as we call them, out into the mucus,
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.140]   and they respond to different odorant compounds.
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.420]   Now, the olfactory neurons also send a branch
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:47.260]   deeper into the brain, and they split off
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:50.900]   into three different paths.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:55.900]   So one path is for what we call innate odor responses.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:59.220]   So you have some hardwired aspects
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:01.100]   to the way that you smell the world
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:03.100]   that were there from the day you were born
[00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:05.860]   and that will be there until the day you die.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.100]   These are the pathways and the neurons
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.180]   that respond to things like smoke,
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.440]   which, as you can imagine, there's a highly adaptive function
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.700]   to being able to detect burning things,
[00:23:17.700 --> 00:23:20.820]   because burning things generally means lack of safety
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:22.940]   or impending threat of some kind.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:26.980]   It calls for action, and indeed these neurons
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.180]   project to a central area of the brain called the amygdala,
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:32.060]   which is often discussed in terms of fear,
[00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.940]   but it's really fear and threat detection.
[00:23:34.940 --> 00:23:37.620]   So some compounds, some chemicals in your environment,
[00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:40.880]   when you smell them, unless you're trained to overcome them,
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.720]   because you're a firefighter,
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:46.920]   you will naturally have a heightened level of alertness,
[00:23:46.920 --> 00:23:50.640]   you will sense threat, and if you're in sleep even,
[00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:52.280]   it will wake you up, all right?
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.140]   So that's a good thing, it's kind of an emergency system.
[00:23:55.140 --> 00:23:57.680]   You also have neurons in your nose
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.040]   that respond to odorants or combinations of odorants
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:04.080]   that evoke a sense of desire
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.480]   and what we call appetitive behaviors, approach behaviors,
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.660]   that make you want to move toward something.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.660]   So when you smell a delicious cookie
[00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:17.380]   or some dish that's really savory that you really like,
[00:24:17.380 --> 00:24:21.860]   or a wonderful orange, and you say, "Mm,"
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:25.300]   or it feels delicious or it smells delicious,
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:27.180]   that's because of these innate pathway,
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.620]   these pathways that require no learning whatsoever.
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.220]   Now, some of the pathways from the nose,
[00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.180]   these olfactory neurons into the brain,
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.240]   are involved in learned associations with odors.
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:42.920]   Many people have this experience
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:47.920]   that they can remember the smell of their grandmother's home
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.080]   or their grandmother's hands even,
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:54.520]   or the smell of particular items baking
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:58.820]   or on the stove in a particular environment.
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.660]   Typically, these memories tend to be
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:04.460]   of a kind of nurturing sort, of feeling safe and protected,
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.340]   but one of the reasons why olfaction, smell,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.260]   is so closely tied to memory
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.200]   is because olfaction is the most ancient sense that we have,
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:16.060]   or I should say chemical sensing
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:19.340]   is among the most primitive and ancient senses that we have,
[00:25:19.340 --> 00:25:21.060]   probably almost certainly evolved
[00:25:21.060 --> 00:25:24.100]   before vision and before hearing.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.980]   But when we come into the world,
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.980]   because we're still learning about the statistics of life,
[00:25:29.980 --> 00:25:32.360]   about who's friendly and who's not friendly
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.800]   and where's a fun place to be
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:35.840]   and where's a boring place to be,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.560]   that all takes a long time to learn,
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.680]   but the olfactory system seems to imprint,
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:43.860]   seems to lay down memories very early
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:47.340]   and to create these very powerful associations.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:51.100]   And if you think about it long enough and hard enough,
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:54.120]   many of you can probably realize
[00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:57.500]   that there are certain smells that evoke a memory
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.760]   of a particular place or person or context.
[00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.840]   And that's because you also have pathways out of the nose
[00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.700]   that are not for innate behaviors
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:10.700]   like cringing or repulsion or gagging
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:13.360]   or for that appetitive mmm sensation,
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.400]   but that just remind you of a place or a thing or a context.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.240]   Could be flowers in spring,
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.100]   could be grandmother's home and cookies.
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.580]   This is a very common occurrence
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.900]   and it's a very common occurrence
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.300]   because this generally exists in all of us.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.680]   So we have pathway for innate responses
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:33.580]   and a pathway for learned responses.
[00:26:33.580 --> 00:26:36.060]   And then we have this other pathway
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.080]   and in humans, it's a little bit controversial
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.380]   as to whether or not it sits truly separate
[00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:42.860]   from the standard olfactory system
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:46.420]   or whether or not it's its own system embedded in there,
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.420]   but that they call the accessory olfactory pathway.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.660]   Accessory olfactory pathway is what in other animals
[00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:56.980]   is responsible for true pheromone effects.
[00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:59.100]   We will talk about true pheromone effects,
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:04.100]   but for example, in rodents and in some primates,
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:06.860]   including mandrills, if you've ever seen mandrills,
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.000]   they have these like big beak noses things,
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:09.940]   you may have seen them at the zoo,
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.520]   look them up if you haven't seen them already,
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.140]   M-A-N-D-R-I-L-S, mandrills,
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:17.300]   there are strong pheromone effects.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:20.120]   Some of those include things like
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:24.860]   if you take a pregnant female rodent or mandril,
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.860]   you take away the father that created those fetuses or fetus
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:36.060]   and you introduce the scent of the urine
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.840]   or the fur of a novel male,
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:43.820]   she will spontaneously abort or miscarry those fetuses.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:45.420]   It's a very powerful effect.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:48.340]   In humans, it's still controversial
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.420]   whether or not anything like that can happen,
[00:27:50.420 --> 00:27:53.560]   but it's a very powerful pheromonal effect in other animals.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:56.020]   Another example of a pheromone effect
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.520]   is called the Vandenberg effect,
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:00.100]   named after the person who discovered this effect,
[00:28:00.100 --> 00:28:04.220]   where you take a female of a given species
[00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:06.160]   that has not entered puberty,
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:10.020]   you expose her to the scent or the urine
[00:28:10.020 --> 00:28:14.820]   from a sexually competent, meaning post-pubertal male,
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:18.740]   and she spontaneously goes into puberty earlier.
[00:28:18.740 --> 00:28:20.980]   So something about the scent triggers something
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.160]   through this accessory olfactory system,
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.820]   this is a true pheromonal effect,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.820]   and creates ovulation and menstruation,
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.340]   or in rodents, it's an estrous cycle, not a menstrual cycle.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:35.340]   So this is not to say
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:37.220]   that the exact same things happen in humans.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.060]   In humans, as I mentioned earlier,
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:41.460]   there are chemical sensing between individuals
[00:28:41.460 --> 00:28:44.500]   that may be independent of the nose,
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.200]   and we will talk about those,
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.300]   but those are basically the three paths
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.820]   by which smells, odors, impact us.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:54.940]   So I want to talk about the act of smelling,
[00:28:54.940 --> 00:28:58.800]   and if you are not somebody who's very interested in smell,
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:00.360]   but you are somebody who's interested
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.180]   in making your brain work better,
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:04.800]   learning faster, remembering more things,
[00:29:04.800 --> 00:29:06.980]   this next little segment is for you,
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.740]   because it turns out that how you smell,
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:12.760]   meaning the act of smelling, not how good or bad you smell,
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:17.680]   but the act of smelling, sniffing and inhalation,
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.200]   powerfully impacts how your brain functions
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.920]   and what you can learn and what you can't learn.
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.700]   Breathing generally consists of two actions,
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:28.980]   inhaling and exhaling, and we have the option, of course,
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:32.220]   to do that through our nose or our mouth.
[00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:33.660]   I've talked on previous episodes
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:36.420]   about the fact that there are great advantages
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.260]   to being a nasal breather,
[00:29:38.260 --> 00:29:42.200]   and there are great disadvantages to being a mouth breather.
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.180]   There are excellent books and data on this.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.720]   There's the recent book, "Breath" by James Nestor,
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.360]   which is an excellent book that describes
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.540]   some of the positive effects of nasal breathing
[00:29:52.540 --> 00:29:54.480]   as well as other breathing practices.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:57.140]   There's also the book, "Jaws" by my colleagues,
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.000]   Paul Ehrlich and Sandra Kahn, with a forward by Jared Diamond
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   and an introduction by Robert Sapolsky from Stanford.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.500]   So that's a book, "Chock-a-block" with heavy hitter authors
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.720]   that describes how being a nasal breather
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:14.180]   is beneficial for jaw structure,
[00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:16.480]   for immune system function, et cetera.
[00:30:17.660 --> 00:30:21.380]   Breathing in through your nose, sniffing,
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:24.060]   actually has positive effects on the way
[00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:27.040]   that you can acquire and remember information.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.360]   Noam Sobel's group, originally at UC Berkeley
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.740]   and then at the Weizmann Institute,
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:36.640]   has published a number of papers
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.540]   that I'd like to discuss today.
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:43.000]   One of them, "Human Non-Olfactory Cognition Phase-Locked
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:43.840]   with Inhalation."
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.640]   This was published in "Nature Human Behavior,"
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:46.800]   an excellent journal.
[00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:51.000]   It showed that the act of inhaling
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.340]   has a couple of interesting and powerful consequences.
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.340]   First of all, as we inhale, the brain increases in arousal.
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.920]   Our level of alertness and attention increases
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:07.100]   when we inhale as compared to when we exhale.
[00:31:07.100 --> 00:31:10.020]   Now, of course, with every inhale, there's an exhale.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:11.900]   You could probably double up on your inhales
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.220]   if you're doing size or some of the physiological size.
[00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:15.060]   I've talked about these before.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.940]   It's a double inhales followed by an exhale,
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:18.820]   something like that.
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.260]   Or if you're speaking, you're going to change your cadence
[00:31:21.260 --> 00:31:22.620]   and ratio of inhales and exhales.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:26.320]   But typically, we inhale, then we exhale.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:29.500]   As we inhale, what this paper shows
[00:31:29.500 --> 00:31:33.980]   is that the level of alertness goes up in the brain.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:37.260]   And this makes sense because as the most primitive
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:40.460]   and primordial sense by which we interact
[00:31:40.460 --> 00:31:44.420]   with our environment and bring chemicals into our system
[00:31:44.420 --> 00:31:49.420]   and detect our environment, inhaling is a cue
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:52.940]   for the rest of the brain to essentially to pay attention
[00:31:52.940 --> 00:31:55.500]   to what's happening, not just to the odors.
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.900]   As the name of this paper suggests,
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:02.860]   human non-olfactory cognition, phase locked with inhalation.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:07.060]   What that means is that the act of inhaling itself
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:08.180]   wakes up the brain.
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:10.260]   It's not about what you're perceiving
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:11.440]   or what you're smelling.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:16.660]   And indeed, sniffing as an action, inhaling as an action
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:20.660]   has a powerful effect on your ability to be alert,
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.260]   your ability to attend, to focus,
[00:32:23.260 --> 00:32:26.020]   and your ability to remember information.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:30.220]   When we exhale, the brain goes through a subtle
[00:32:30.220 --> 00:32:34.060]   but nonetheless significant dip in level of arousal
[00:32:34.060 --> 00:32:35.820]   and ability to learn.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.260]   So what does this mean?
[00:32:37.260 --> 00:32:39.420]   How should you use this knowledge?
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.500]   Well, you could imagine, and I think this would be
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:46.780]   beneficial for most people, to focus on nasal breathing
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:49.220]   while doing any kind of focused work
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:51.420]   that doesn't require that you speak or eat
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:52.520]   or ingest something.
[00:32:52.520 --> 00:32:54.920]   There is a separate paper published
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.900]   in the Journal of Neuroscience that showed that indeed,
[00:32:57.900 --> 00:33:00.560]   if subjects, human subjects, are restricted
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.140]   to breathing through their nose, they learn better
[00:33:04.140 --> 00:33:06.260]   than if they have the option of breathing
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:09.580]   through their mouth or a combination of their nose and mouth.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:11.400]   These are significant effects in humans
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.380]   using modern techniques from excellent groups.
[00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:18.160]   So sniffing itself is a powerful modulator
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.100]   of our cognition and our ability to learn.
[00:33:22.100 --> 00:33:23.280]   You can imagine all sorts of ways
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:25.180]   that you might apply that as a tool.
[00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:27.340]   And I suggest that you play with it a bit,
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:30.420]   that if you're having a hard time staying awake and alert,
[00:33:30.420 --> 00:33:32.420]   you're having a hard time remembering information,
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.500]   you feel like you have a kind of attention deficit,
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.980]   nonclinical, of course, nasal breathing ought to help,
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:42.980]   extending or making your inhales more intense ought to help.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.900]   Now, this isn't really about chemical sensing per se,
[00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:48.980]   but here's where it gets interesting and exciting.
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:50.580]   If you are somebody who doesn't have
[00:33:50.580 --> 00:33:53.000]   a very good sense of smell,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.320]   or you're somebody who simply wants to get better
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:58.220]   at smelling and tasting things,
[00:33:58.220 --> 00:34:00.860]   you can actually practice sniffing.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:02.100]   I know that sounds ridiculous,
[00:34:02.100 --> 00:34:05.520]   but it turns out that simply sniffing nothing,
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.920]   so doing something like this,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.560]   [inhales deeply]
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.460]   I guess the microphone sort of has a smell.
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:12.500]   I guess my pen doesn't have a smell.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.040]   [inhales deeply]
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:16.660]   Turns out that doing a series of inhales,
[00:34:16.660 --> 00:34:18.820]   and of course each one is followed by an exhale,
[00:34:18.820 --> 00:34:22.700]   10 or 15 times, and then smelling an object
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:26.020]   like an orange or another item of food,
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.960]   or even the skin of somebody else,
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:32.340]   will lead to an increase in your ability to perceive
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:33.900]   those odors.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:36.440]   Now, there are probably two reasons for that.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.480]   One reason is that the brain systems of detecting things
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:42.400]   are waking up as a mere consequence of inhaling.
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:45.440]   So this is sort of the olfactory equivalent
[00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:50.120]   of opening your eyes wider in order to see, more or less.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.080]   Last episode, I talked about how opening your eyes wider
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.060]   actually increases your level of alertness.
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:55.680]   It's not just that your level of alertness
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:34:58.000]   causes your eyes to be open wider.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.560]   Opening your eyes wider can actually increase
[00:34:59.560 --> 00:35:00.760]   your level of alertness.
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:02.340]   Well, it turns out that breathing more deeply
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:04.660]   through the nose wakes up your brain,
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:08.440]   and it creates a heightened sensitivity
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.840]   of the neurons that relate to smell.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:13.980]   And there's a close crossover,
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:16.240]   I'm sure you know this, between smell and taste.
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.120]   If any of you have ever had a cold,
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:21.040]   or for whatever reason you've lost your sense of smell,
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:22.580]   you become what they call anosmic,
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:24.520]   your sense of taste suffers also.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.340]   We'll talk a little bit more about why that is
[00:35:26.340 --> 00:35:27.520]   in a few minutes.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.920]   But as a first protocol,
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.620]   I'd really like all of you to consider
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.560]   becoming nasal breathers while you're trying to learn,
[00:35:34.560 --> 00:35:36.080]   while you're trying to listen,
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:39.680]   while you're trying to wake up your brain in any way
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.600]   and learn and retain information.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:44.880]   This is a powerful tool.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.960]   Now, there are other ways to wake up your brain more as well.
[00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:50.440]   For instance, the use of smelling salts.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.420]   I'm not recommending that you do this necessarily,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:55.220]   but there are excellent peer-reviewed data
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:58.860]   showing that indeed, if you use smelling salts,
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.740]   which are mostly of the sort that include ammonia,
[00:36:02.740 --> 00:36:05.840]   ammonia is a very toxic scent,
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:10.140]   but it's toxic in a way that triggers this innate pathway,
[00:36:10.140 --> 00:36:12.120]   the pathway from the nose to the amygdala
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:14.720]   and wakes up the brain and body in a major way.
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:17.040]   This is why they use smelling salts when people pass out.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.680]   This is why fighters used to use,
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:21.780]   or maybe sometimes still use,
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.200]   smelling salts in order to heighten their level of alertness.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.160]   This is why power lifters will inhale smelling salts.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:31.600]   They work because they trigger the fear
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:34.280]   and kind of overall arousal systems of the brain.
[00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   This is why I think most people
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:37.440]   probably shouldn't use ammonia or smelling salts
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.120]   to try and wake up, but they really do work.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:41.580]   If you've ever smelled smelling salts,
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:45.680]   and I have, I tried this, they give you a serious jolt.
[00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.520]   It's like six espresso
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:49.380]   infused into your bloodstream all at once.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:51.640]   You are wide awake immediately.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:54.820]   And you feel a heightened sense of kind of desire to move
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.240]   because you release adrenaline into your body.
[00:36:57.240 --> 00:36:58.740]   Now, inhaling through your nose
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:00.760]   and doing nasal breathing is not going to do that.
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:02.760]   It's going to be a more subtle version
[00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:07.640]   of waking up your system, of alerting your brain overall.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.260]   And for those of you that are interested
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.200]   in having a richer, a more deep connection
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.260]   to the things that you smell and taste,
[00:37:16.260 --> 00:37:19.100]   including other individuals perhaps, not just food,
[00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:23.400]   practicing or enhancing your sense of sniffing,
[00:37:23.400 --> 00:37:24.480]   your ability to sniff
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:26.480]   might sound like a kind of ridiculous protocol,
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:28.380]   but it's actually a kind of fun
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:29.640]   and cool experiment that you can do.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:32.060]   You just do the simple experiment of taking,
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.120]   for instance, an orange, you smell it,
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:36.920]   try and gauge your level of perception
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.320]   of how orangish it smells or lemony, lemon-ish, lemony?
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.780]   I don't know, is it lemon-ish or lemony?
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.560]   Lemony, it smells.
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.160]   Then set it away.
[00:37:48.160 --> 00:37:50.440]   Do 10 or 15 inhales.
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.620]   Followed by exhales, of course, or just through the nose.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:55.980]   Not going to do all 10 or 15.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.220]   And then smell it again.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:59.340]   And you'll notice that your perception of that smell,
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.760]   the kind of richness of that smell
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.780]   will be significantly increased.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:05.380]   And that's, again, for two reasons.
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:09.260]   One, the brain is in a position to respond to it better.
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:12.380]   Your brain has been aroused by the mere act of sniffing,
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:16.160]   but also the neurons that respond to that lemon odor,
[00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.860]   that lemony or odor are going to respond better.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.560]   So you can actually have a heightened experience
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:23.400]   of something.
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.000]   And that, of course, will also be true for the taste system.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.640]   You also can really train your sense of smell
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:30.480]   to get much, much better.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:32.140]   When Noam Sobel's group was at Berkeley,
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:34.740]   I happened to be a graduate student around that time.
[00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.300]   And every once in a while, I'd look outside
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:40.700]   and there would be people crawling around on the grass
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:43.940]   with goggles on, gloves on, and these hoods on,
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:47.440]   with earmuffs, and they looked ridiculous.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:49.520]   But what they were doing is they were actually learning
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.880]   to follow scent trails.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:54.320]   So in the world of dogs, you have sight hounds
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:57.680]   that use their eyes in order to navigate and find things.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:38:59.440]   And you have scent hounds that use their nose.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:00.840]   And the scent hounds are remarkable.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.880]   They can be trained to detect a scent.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:05.240]   These are the sniffing, you know, the bomb sniffing
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:08.240]   and the drug sniffing dogs in airports.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.560]   There are now dogs, actually,
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:12.480]   that can sniff out COVID infections
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:14.160]   with a very high degree of accuracy.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.400]   They can be trained to that.
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:19.480]   There's something about the COVID and similar infections
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:22.080]   that the body produces probably in the immune response,
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.360]   some odors, and the dogs are, I think, as high as 90%,
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.100]   in some cases, maybe even 95% accuracy, just remarkable.
[00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.840]   There are theories that dogs can sniff out cancer.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.800]   This stuff all exceeds statistical significance.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.760]   It's still a little bit mysterious in some ways,
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.760]   but you may not ever achieve the olfactory capabilities
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.360]   of a scent hound, but what Noam Sobel's lab did
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:49.800]   is they had people completely eliminate their visual
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:53.160]   experience by having them wear dark glasses or goggles.
[00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:54.560]   So they couldn't see, they couldn't hear,
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:56.640]   they couldn't sense anything with their sense of touch.
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:39:59.800]   They had thick gloves on, but they had these masks on
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:02.120]   where just their nasal passages were open.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:05.880]   And people could, in a fairly short amount of time,
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:09.860]   learn to follow a chocolate scent trail on the ground,
[00:40:09.860 --> 00:40:12.520]   which is not something that most people want to do.
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:15.160]   But what they showed using brain imaging, et cetera,
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:19.320]   in subsequent studies is that the human brain,
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:23.060]   you can learn to really enhance your sense of smell
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:26.720]   and become very astute in distinguishing whether or not
[00:40:26.720 --> 00:40:30.580]   one particular odor or combinations of odors is such
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:34.260]   that it's less than or more than a different odor,
[00:40:34.260 --> 00:40:35.140]   for instance.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:36.240]   Now, why would you want to do this?
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:39.400]   Well, if you like to eat as much as I do,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.840]   one of the things that can really enhance your sense
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:45.620]   of pleasure from the experience of ingesting food
[00:40:45.620 --> 00:40:47.520]   is to enhance your sense of smell.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.240]   And if you don't have a great sense of smell,
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:53.040]   or if you have a sense of smell that's really so good
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.160]   that it's always picking up bad odors,
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:57.240]   we'll talk about that in a minute,
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:01.700]   well then you might want to tune up your sense of smell
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:04.840]   by doing this practice of 10 or 15 breaths,
[00:41:04.840 --> 00:41:07.660]   excuse me, sniffs, not breaths, sniffs,
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:10.740]   and then interacting with some food item or thing
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.440]   that you're interested in smelling more of.
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:14.260]   So these could be the ingredients that you're cooking with.
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:16.640]   I really encourage you to try and really smell them.
[00:41:16.640 --> 00:41:18.900]   You sometimes hear this as kind of a mindfulness practice,
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:22.200]   like, ooh, really smell the food, really taste the food.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:24.660]   And we always hear about that as kind of a mindfulness
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.800]   and presence thing,
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.040]   but you actually can increase the sensitivity
[00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:30.880]   of your olfactory and your taste system by doing this.
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.120]   And it has long-term effects.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.280]   That's what's so interesting.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.620]   This isn't the kind of thing that you have to do
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:36.620]   every time you eat.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:38.160]   You don't have to be the weirdo in the restaurant
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.800]   that's like picking up the radish
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:41.480]   and like jamming it up your nostrils.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.660]   Please don't do that.
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.740]   You don't have to necessarily smell everything,
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:47.780]   although it's nice sometimes to smell the food
[00:41:47.780 --> 00:41:49.620]   that you're about to eat and as you eat it,
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.500]   but it has long-term effects in terms of your ability
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:56.580]   to distinguish and discriminate different types of odors.
[00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:58.840]   And these don't even have to be very pungent foods,
[00:41:58.840 --> 00:41:59.680]   it turns out.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.200]   The studies show that it doesn't have to be
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.860]   some really stinky cheese.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.800]   There are cheese shops that I've walked into
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:07.040]   where like, I just basically gag, I can't handle it.
[00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.280]   I just can't be in there.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:09.880]   It just overwhelms me.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.860]   Other people, they love that smell.
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.340]   So you have to tune it to your interest and experience,
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:17.160]   but I think even for you Fasters out there,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:19.360]   everybody eats at some point.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:21.980]   Everybody ingests chemicals through their mouth.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:25.160]   And one of the ways that you can powerfully increase
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.200]   your relationship to that experience
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.520]   and make it much more positive
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:31.740]   is through just the occasional practice
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:35.180]   of 10 or 15 sniffs of nothing,
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:37.900]   which almost sounds ridiculous, like how could that be?
[00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:39.160]   But now you understand why.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:41.060]   It's because of the way that the sniffing action
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:43.040]   increases the alertness of the brain,
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:46.440]   as well as increasing the sensitivity of the system.
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:49.960]   No other system that I'm aware of in our body
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:54.260]   is as amenable to these kinds of behavioral training shifts
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.040]   and allow them to happen so quickly.
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.660]   I would love to be able to tell you
[00:42:57.660 --> 00:43:01.080]   that just doing 10 or 15 near-far exercises with a pen
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.400]   or going outside for 10 or 15 seconds each morning
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.840]   is going to completely change the way that you see the world
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.240]   but it actually isn't the case.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:10.020]   You actually, it requires more training,
[00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:11.960]   a little bit more effort in the visual system.
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:14.320]   In the olfactory system, in your smell system,
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:15.620]   and in your taste system,
[00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:18.440]   just the tiniest bit of training and attention
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.940]   and sniffing, inhaling,
[00:43:20.940 --> 00:43:23.660]   can radically change your relationship to food
[00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.040]   such that you actually start to feel very different
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.920]   as a consequence of ingesting those foods,
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:33.100]   as well as becoming more discerning about which foods you like
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.320]   and which ones you don't like.
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:35.280]   And we're going to talk about that
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.760]   because there's a really wonderful thing that happens
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.000]   when you start developing a sensitive palate
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.120]   and a sensitive sense of smell
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:46.500]   in a way that allows you to guide your eating
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.940]   and smelling decisions
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.580]   and maybe even interpersonal decisions
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:52.880]   about who you spend time with or mate with or whatever
[00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:56.080]   in a way that is really in line with your biology.
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:59.300]   In fact, how well we can smell and taste things
[00:43:59.300 --> 00:44:03.480]   is actually a very strong indication of our brain health.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.960]   Now, that's not to say that if you have a poor sense of smell
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:08.720]   or a poor sense of taste that you're somehow brain damaged
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.520]   or you're going to have dementia,
[00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:14.640]   although sometimes early signs of dementia
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:17.160]   or loss of neurons in other regions of the brain
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.680]   related to, say, Parkinson's,
[00:44:18.680 --> 00:44:21.760]   can show up first as a loss of sense of smell.
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:25.240]   Again, it's not causal.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:26.680]   And it's certainly not the case
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:28.820]   that every time you have a sudden loss of smell
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.280]   that there's necessarily brain damage.
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:32.000]   I want to be very clear about that.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.240]   But they are often correlated.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:37.100]   There's also a lot of interest right now
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:38.480]   in loss of sense of smell
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:41.560]   because one of the early detection signs of COVID-19
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:43.440]   was a loss of sense of smell.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:46.640]   So I just briefly want to talk about loss of sense of smell
[00:44:46.640 --> 00:44:49.320]   and regaining sense of smell and taste
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:53.180]   because these have powerful implications for overall health
[00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:56.800]   and in fact can indicate something about brain damage
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:59.720]   and can even inform how quickly we might be recovering
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.080]   from something like a concussion.
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:03.960]   So our olfactory neurons,
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.460]   these neurons in our nose that detect odors,
[00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:10.800]   are really unique among other brain neurons
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:14.720]   because they get replenished throughout life.
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:18.560]   They don't just regenerate, but they get replenished.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:23.060]   So regeneration is when something is damaged and it regrows.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:25.400]   These neurons are constantly turning over
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.280]   throughout our lifespan.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.840]   They're constantly being replenished.
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:31.340]   They're dying off and they're being replaced by new ones.
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:34.000]   This is an amazing aspect of our brain
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:36.440]   that's basically unique to these neurons.
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:37.680]   There's one other region of the brain
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:39.720]   where there's a little bit of this maybe,
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.360]   but these olfactory neurons,
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:45.440]   about every three or four weeks, they die.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.800]   And when they die, they're replaced by new ones
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:51.100]   that come from a different region of the brain,
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:53.800]   a region called the subventricular zone.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:57.500]   The name isn't as important as the phenomenon,
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.880]   but these neurons are born in the ventricle,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:02.060]   the area of your brain that's a hole that contains,
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:03.080]   it's not an empty hole,
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:06.000]   it's a hole basically that contains cerebral spinal fluid.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.040]   Well, there's a little subventricular zone.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.400]   There's a little zone below, sub, the ventricles,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.400]   and that zone, if you are exercising regularly,
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.100]   if your dopamine levels are high enough,
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:23.340]   those little cells there are like stem cells.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.360]   They are stem cells and they spit out
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:27.280]   what are called little neuroblasts,
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:29.520]   those little neuroblasts migrate
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:32.920]   into the front of your brain and then shimmy.
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:33.760]   They kind of move through
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.820]   what's called the rostral migratory stream.
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.060]   They kind of shimmy along and land
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.500]   back in your olfactory bulb, settle down,
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:43.840]   and extend little wires into your olfactory mucosa.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:47.120]   This is an ongoing process of what we call neurogenesis
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:49.180]   or the birth of new neurons.
[00:46:49.180 --> 00:46:52.080]   Now, this is really interesting
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:56.360]   because other neurons in your cortex, in your retina,
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.480]   in your cerebellum, they do not do this.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:47:01.320]   They are not continually replenished throughout life,
[00:47:01.320 --> 00:47:03.640]   but these neurons, these olfactory neurons are,
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.840]   they are special.
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:07.720]   And there are a number of things
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:09.820]   that seem to increase the amount
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:12.200]   of olfactory neuron neurogenesis.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:15.760]   There is evidence that exercise, blood flow,
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:18.260]   can increase olfactory neuron neurogenesis,
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:21.800]   although those data are fewer in comparison
[00:47:21.800 --> 00:47:24.240]   to things like social interactions
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.740]   or actually interacting with odorants of different kinds.
[00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:31.720]   So if you're somebody who doesn't smell things well,
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.080]   you have a poor sense of smell,
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:35.680]   your olfactory system doesn't seem very sensitive,
[00:47:35.680 --> 00:47:38.440]   more sniffing, more smelling is going to be good.
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:41.140]   And then the molecule dopamine, this neuromodulator
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:45.520]   that is associated with motivation and drive,
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:48.840]   and in some cases, if it's very, very high with mania
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:52.080]   or if it's very, very low with depression or Parkinson's,
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.700]   but for most people where dopamine is in essentially
[00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:59.240]   normal ranges, dopamine is also a powerful trigger
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:02.080]   of the establishment of these new neurons
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:04.320]   and their migration into the olfactory bulb
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:05.860]   and your ability to smell.
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:09.760]   Now you don't want to confuse correlation with causation.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.360]   So if you're not good at smelling,
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.760]   does that mean you have low dopamine?
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:13.920]   No, not necessarily.
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.000]   If you have low dopamine,
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.820]   does that mean that you have a poor sense of smell?
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:18.360]   No, not necessarily.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:21.560]   Some people who take antidepressants of the sort
[00:48:21.560 --> 00:48:25.800]   that impact the dopamine system strongly like, well, butrin,
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:29.200]   will report a sudden, meaning within a couple of days,
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:33.480]   increase in their ability to smell particular odors.
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:35.680]   And it's a very striking effect.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:38.140]   Some people, when they are in a new relationship,
[00:48:38.140 --> 00:48:41.780]   because dopamine and the hormones testosterone and estrogen
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:45.320]   are associated with novelty and the sorts of behaviors
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:48.040]   that often are associated with new relationships,
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.460]   those three molecules, dopamine, testosterone, and estrogen,
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:53.360]   kind of work together.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:56.900]   And oftentimes people will say or report
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:48:58.980]   when they're newly in love or in a new relationship
[00:48:58.980 --> 00:49:00.840]   that they're just obsessed with,
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:03.280]   or they just so enjoy the scent of another person,
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.940]   so much so that they like to borrow
[00:49:05.940 --> 00:49:07.160]   the other person's clothing,
[00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:09.000]   or they'll sniff the other person's clothing,
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.880]   or they can even just, in the absence of the person,
[00:49:11.880 --> 00:49:15.600]   they can imagine their smell and feel a biological response,
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.220]   something that we'll talk more about.
[00:49:17.220 --> 00:49:19.840]   So these neurons turn over throughout the lifespan.
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:23.360]   And as we age, we actually can lose our sense of smell.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.540]   And it's likely, I want to underscore likely,
[00:49:25.540 --> 00:49:27.220]   that that loss of sense of smell as we age
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.740]   is correlated with a loss of other neurons
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:31.340]   in the retina, in the ear.
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.740]   So loss of vision, loss of hearing, loss of smell,
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:38.260]   loss of the sense apparati, which are neurons,
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:40.420]   is correlated with aging.
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:42.300]   So what we've been talking about today
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:44.420]   is the ability to sense these odors.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:46.900]   But what I'd like to do is empower you with tools
[00:49:46.900 --> 00:49:48.980]   that will allow you to keep these systems tuned up.
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.660]   Last time, we talked about tuning up
[00:49:50.660 --> 00:49:53.820]   and keeping your visual system tuned up and healthy,
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.900]   regardless of age.
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:57.680]   Here, we're talking about really enhancing
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:00.920]   your olfactory abilities, your taste abilities,
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.940]   as well by interacting a lot with odors,
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:09.020]   preferably positive odors, and sniffing more,
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:11.380]   inhaling more, which almost sounds crazy,
[00:50:11.380 --> 00:50:13.120]   but now you understand why.
[00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.160]   Even though it might sound crazy,
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.780]   it's grounded in real mechanistic biology
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.220]   of how the brain wakes up and responds to these chemicals.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:23.220]   Now, speaking of brain injury, olfactory dysfunction
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:25.840]   is a common theme in traumatic brain injury
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.060]   for the following reason.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.380]   These olfactory neurons, as I mentioned,
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:33.260]   extend wires into the mucosa of the nose,
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:35.940]   but they also extend a wire up into the skull,
[00:50:35.940 --> 00:50:37.580]   and they extend up into the skull
[00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:39.240]   through what's called the cribriform plate.
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.620]   It's like a Swiss cheese-type plate
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:42.740]   where they're going through,
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:45.920]   and if you get a head hit, that bone,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:48.780]   the cribriform plate shears those little wires off,
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.960]   and those neurons die.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:53.060]   Now, eventually, they'll be replaced,
[00:50:53.060 --> 00:50:56.300]   but there's a phenomenon by which concussion
[00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:57.720]   and the severity of concussion
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:59.660]   and the recovery from a head injury
[00:50:59.660 --> 00:51:02.700]   can actually be gauged in part, in part, not in whole,
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:06.000]   but in part by how well or fully
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.440]   one recovers their sense of smell.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.800]   So if you're somebody that unfortunately
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:11.140]   has suffered a concussion,
[00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:13.760]   your sense of smell is one readout
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.200]   by which you might evaluate
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:16.380]   whether or not you're regaining
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.980]   some of your sensory performance.
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:18.900]   Of course, there will be others
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:21.280]   like balance and cognition and sleep, et cetera,
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:23.740]   but I'd like to refer you to a really nice paper
[00:51:23.740 --> 00:51:27.020]   which is entitled "Olfactory Dysfunction
[00:51:27.020 --> 00:51:29.940]   "in Traumatic Brain Injury, the Role of Neurogenesis."
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.420]   The first author is Marin, M-A-R-I-N.
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:34.500]   The paper was published
[00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:37.140]   in "Current Allergy and Asthma Report."
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.040]   This is 2020.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:39.360]   I spent some time with this paper.
[00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:40.200]   It's quite good.
[00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:41.220]   It's a review article.
[00:51:41.220 --> 00:51:43.860]   I like reviews if they're peer-reviewed reviews
[00:51:44.740 --> 00:51:46.440]   and in quality journals.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.320]   And what they discuss is,
[00:51:48.320 --> 00:51:49.500]   and I'll just read here briefly
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.160]   'cause they said it better than I could,
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.040]   olfactory functioning disturbances are common
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:54.920]   following traumatic brain injury, TBI,
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:57.580]   and can have a significant impact on the quality of life,
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:51:59.240]   although there's no standard treatment for patients
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.560]   with the loss of smell.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:05.840]   Now I'm paraphrasing post-injury.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:10.840]   Olfactory training has shown promise for beneficial effects.
[00:52:10.840 --> 00:52:12.840]   Some of this involves,
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:15.560]   they go on to tell us the role of dopamine,
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:17.920]   dopaminergic signaling, as I mentioned before.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:18.880]   But what does this mean?
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:21.920]   This means that if you've had a head injury
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:23.800]   or repeated head injuries,
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:26.500]   that enhancing your sense of smell is one way
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.760]   by which you can create new neurons.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.700]   And now you know how to enhance your sense of smell
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:34.020]   by interacting with things that have an odor very closely
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:36.760]   and by essentially inhaling more,
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.360]   focusing on the inhale to wake up the brain
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:42.360]   and to really focus on some of the nuance of those smells.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:45.300]   So you might do, for instance, a smell test
[00:52:45.300 --> 00:52:47.140]   by which you smell something like a lemon,
[00:52:47.140 --> 00:52:50.840]   put it down, do 10 inhales or so, smell again, et cetera.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   You might also just take a more active role
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:56.440]   in trying to taste and smell your food
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:58.480]   and taste and smell various things.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:00.360]   I mean, please don't ingest anything that's poisonous
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.880]   so that you're not supposed to be ingesting,
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.060]   but you know what I mean.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.760]   Really tuning up this system,
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:06.440]   I think is an excellent review.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:08.100]   We're going to do an entire episode
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:10.560]   all about the use of the visual system in particular,
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.440]   but also the olfactory system for treatment
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:14.980]   of traumatic brain injury, as well as other methods.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:16.980]   But I wanted to just mention it here
[00:53:16.980 --> 00:53:19.400]   because a number of people asked me about TBI.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.320]   And here again, we're in this place
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.240]   where the senses and our ability to sense these chemicals,
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:27.260]   so these two holes in the front of our face, our nostrils,
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.560]   is a powerful readout and way to control brain function
[00:53:31.560 --> 00:53:33.440]   and nervous system function generally.
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:36.080]   Just a quick note about the use of smelling salts.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.660]   I have a feeling that some of you may be interested in that
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:39.600]   and its application.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.320]   If you are interested in that,
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:44.380]   I recommend you go to the scientific literature first,
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:47.120]   rather than straight to some vendor
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:49.800]   or to the, what do they call it these days?
[00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.680]   Costello bro science.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:54.360]   He says bro science, the bro science.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.600]   You can go to this paper,
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:53:57.400]   which is excellent and is real science,
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.380]   which is acute effects of ammonia inhalants
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.920]   on strength and power performance in trained men.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.480]   It's a randomized control trial.
[00:54:03.480 --> 00:54:04.760]   It was published in the Journal of Strength
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:07.520]   and Conditioning Research in 2018,
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:09.080]   and it should be very easy to find.
[00:54:09.080 --> 00:54:11.800]   I will provide a link to the so-called PubMed ID,
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.900]   which is a string of numbers,
[00:54:13.900 --> 00:54:14.920]   and we'll put that in the caption
[00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:16.360]   if you want to go straight to that article.
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:19.200]   It does show a significant, what they call,
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:20.400]   this is what the words they use,
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.400]   literally in quotes, psyching up effect
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.560]   through the use of these ammonia inhalants
[00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:30.440]   and a significant increase in maximal force
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:34.360]   in force development in a variety of different movements.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:35.840]   So for those of you that are interested
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:39.280]   in ammonia inhalants, so-called smelling salts,
[00:54:39.280 --> 00:54:41.200]   that might be a good reference.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.320]   The other thing I wanted to talk about
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:44.960]   with reference to odors is this myth,
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.720]   which is that we don't actually smell things in our dreams,
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:50.560]   that we don't have a sense of smell.
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:52.640]   That's pure fiction.
[00:54:52.640 --> 00:54:54.360]   I don't know who came up with that.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.900]   It's very clear that we are capable
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.440]   of smelling things in our sleep.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:03.200]   However, when we are in REM sleep, rapid eye movement sleep,
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:04.800]   which is the sleep that predominates
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.680]   toward the second half of the night,
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:12.520]   our ability to wake up in response to odors is diminished.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:14.440]   It's not absent, but it's diminished.
[00:55:14.440 --> 00:55:16.560]   If smoke comes into the room,
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:19.160]   we will likely wake up if the concentration of smoke
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:22.020]   is high enough, regardless of the stage of sleep we're in.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.280]   But in REM sleep, we tend to be less likely
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:28.000]   to smell, to sniff.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.600]   And that actually was measured in a number of studies
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:33.560]   that sniffing in sleep is possible.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:35.320]   So if you put an odor like a lemon
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.600]   underneath someone's nostrils
[00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:40.320]   in the early portion of the night, they will smell.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:43.000]   And they will later, they will sniff, excuse me,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:43.860]   whether or not they smell or not,
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:45.880]   I guess depends on them and when they showered last,
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:47.560]   but they will definitely sniff.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.880]   And they will report later,
[00:55:49.880 --> 00:55:51.840]   especially if you wake them up soon after,
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:54.980]   that they had a dream or a percept
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:57.900]   of the scent of a lemon, for instance.
[00:55:57.900 --> 00:56:00.420]   Later in the night, it's harder for that relationship
[00:56:00.420 --> 00:56:01.260]   to be established.
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:03.780]   It's likely that because of some of the paralysis associated
[00:56:03.780 --> 00:56:05.440]   with rapid eye movement, sleep,
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:08.500]   which is a healthy paralysis, so-called sleepatonia,
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:10.980]   you don't want to act out your dreams in REM sleep,
[00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:14.860]   that there is a less active tendency to sniff.
[00:56:14.860 --> 00:56:17.820]   And actually this has real clinical implications.
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:20.980]   The ability to sniff in response
[00:56:20.980 --> 00:56:25.340]   to the introduction of an odor is actually one way
[00:56:25.340 --> 00:56:28.900]   in which clinicians assess whether or not somebody's brain
[00:56:28.900 --> 00:56:31.000]   is so-called brain dead.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.580]   That's not a nice term, but brain dead,
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.900]   or whether or not they have the capacity to recover
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:38.500]   from things like coma and other states
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:40.220]   of deep unconsciousness,
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:42.620]   or I guess you could call it subconsciousness.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:45.380]   So what will happen is if someone has an injury
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:48.040]   and they're essentially out cold,
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.900]   the production of a sniffing reflex
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:54.740]   or a sniffing response to say a lemon
[00:56:54.740 --> 00:56:57.040]   or some other odor presented below the nostrils
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:59.540]   is considered a sign that the brain is capable
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:00.860]   of waking up.
[00:57:00.860 --> 00:57:03.740]   Now that's not always the case, but it's one indication.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.040]   So just like you could use mechanosensation,
[00:57:07.040 --> 00:57:09.720]   so a toe pinch, for instance,
[00:57:09.720 --> 00:57:12.200]   or scraping the bottom of somebody's bare foot
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:15.800]   to see if they're conscious or shining light in their eyes.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.120]   These are all things that you've seen in movies
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.420]   and television, or maybe you've seen in real life as well.
[00:57:20.420 --> 00:57:23.100]   Well, odors and chemical sensing is another way
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:24.880]   by which you can assess whether or not the brain
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.980]   is capable of arousal.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:29.240]   And actually olfactory stimulation
[00:57:29.240 --> 00:57:31.060]   is one of the more prominent ones
[00:57:31.060 --> 00:57:33.420]   that's being used in various clinics.
[00:57:33.420 --> 00:57:37.080]   As a last point about specific odors and compounds
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:39.420]   that can increase arousal and alertness,
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.300]   and this was simply through sniffing them,
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:42.840]   not through ingesting them.
[00:57:42.840 --> 00:57:44.740]   There are data, believe it or not,
[00:57:44.740 --> 00:57:47.300]   there are good data on peppermint
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:49.300]   and the smell of peppermint.
[00:57:49.300 --> 00:57:53.480]   Minty type sense, whether you like them or not,
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.700]   will increase attention,
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:59.260]   and they can create the same sort of arousal response,
[00:57:59.260 --> 00:58:01.840]   although not as intensely or as dramatically
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:04.260]   as ammonia salts can, for instance.
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.500]   By the way, please don't go sniff real ammonia.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.660]   You could actually damage your olfactory epithelium
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:10.660]   if you do that too close to the ammonia.
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:11.700]   If you're going to use smelling salts,
[00:58:11.700 --> 00:58:13.440]   be sure you work with someone
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:15.940]   or you know what you're getting and how you're using this.
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.420]   You can damage your olfactory pathway
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:19.500]   in ways that are pretty severe.
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:21.060]   You can also damage your vision.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:23.180]   If you've ever teared up because you inhaled something
[00:58:23.180 --> 00:58:27.140]   that was really noxious, that is not a good thing.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:28.820]   Doesn't mean you necessarily cause damage,
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:32.780]   but it means that you have irritated the mucosal lining
[00:58:32.780 --> 00:58:35.480]   and possibly even the surfaces of your eyes,
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:38.120]   so please be very, very careful.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:42.320]   Scents like peppermint, like these ammonia smelling salts,
[00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:43.520]   the reason they wake you up
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:46.660]   is because they trigger specific olfactory neurons
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:49.020]   that communicate with the specific centers of the brain,
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:51.380]   namely the amygdala and associated neural circuitry
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:54.680]   and pathways that trigger alertness of the same sort
[00:58:54.680 --> 00:58:58.700]   that a cold shower or an ice bath or a sudden surprise
[00:58:58.700 --> 00:59:01.300]   or a stressful text message would evoke.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:04.240]   Remember, the systems of your body
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:07.260]   that produce arousal and alertness and attention
[00:59:07.260 --> 00:59:10.520]   and that cue you for optimal learning, AKA focus,
[00:59:10.520 --> 00:59:12.060]   those are very general mechanisms.
[00:59:12.060 --> 00:59:13.980]   They involve very basic molecules
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:15.380]   like adrenaline and epinephrine,
[00:59:15.380 --> 00:59:18.320]   same thing actually, adrenaline and epinephrine.
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:20.180]   The number of stimuli,
[00:59:20.180 --> 00:59:23.780]   whether it's peppermint or ammonia or a loud blast,
[00:59:23.780 --> 00:59:28.200]   the number of stimuli that can evoke that adrenaline response
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:31.580]   and that wake-up response are near infinite,
[00:59:31.580 --> 00:59:33.580]   and that's the beauty of your nervous system.
[00:59:33.580 --> 00:59:37.060]   It was designed to take any variety of different stimuli,
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:38.700]   place them into categories,
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.940]   and then evoke different categories
[00:59:40.940 --> 00:59:43.080]   of very general responses.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:44.600]   Now you know a lot about olfaction
[00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:46.020]   and how the sense of smell works.
[00:59:46.020 --> 00:59:48.780]   Here's another experiment that you can do.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:50.680]   I'll ask you right now.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:54.860]   Do you like, hate, or are you indifferent
[00:59:54.860 --> 00:59:57.140]   to the smell of microwave popcorn?
[00:59:57.140 --> 01:00:01.760]   Some people, including one member of my podcast staff,
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:05.060]   says it's absolutely disgusting to them.
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.800]   They feel like it's completely nauseating.
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.640]   I don't mind it at all.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.860]   In fact, I kind of like it.
[01:00:09.860 --> 01:00:12.300]   I think the smell of microwave popcorn is kind of pleasant.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:13.520]   I don't particularly like it,
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.220]   but it's certainly not unpleasant.
[01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:21.740]   Some people have a gene that makes them sensitive
[01:00:21.740 --> 01:00:24.360]   to the smell of things like microwave popcorn
[01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.720]   such that it smells like vomit.
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:29.920]   I probably don't have that gene
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:32.080]   because I find the smell of microwave popcorn
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:33.620]   pretty pleasant.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:37.540]   Some people hate the smell of cilantro.
[01:00:37.540 --> 01:00:40.500]   Some people ingest asparagus,
[01:00:40.500 --> 01:00:41.500]   and when they urinate,
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:44.660]   they can smell the asparagus in a very pungent way.
[01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:47.020]   Other people can't smell it at all.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:50.140]   These are variants in genes that encode
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:53.860]   for what are called olfactory receptors.
[01:00:53.860 --> 01:00:58.580]   Each olfactory sensory neuron expresses one odorant gene,
[01:00:58.580 --> 01:01:01.220]   one gene that codes for a receptor
[01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:03.400]   that responds to a particular odor.
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:04.800]   If you don't have that gene,
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:07.220]   you will not respond to that odor.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:09.640]   So the reason why some people find
[01:01:09.640 --> 01:01:12.780]   the smell of microwave popcorn to be very noxious,
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.880]   putrid, in fact, is because they have a gene
[01:01:14.880 --> 01:01:18.420]   that allows them to smell the kind of putrid odor
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:19.260]   within that.
[01:01:19.260 --> 01:01:23.500]   Other people who lack that gene just simply can't smell it.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:25.400]   So we are not all the same
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:27.340]   with respect to our sensory experience.
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:29.400]   What one person finds delicious,
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.120]   another person might find disgusting.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:32.920]   I'll give a good example,
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.520]   which is that I absolutely despise
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.460]   Gorgonzola and blue cheese.
[01:01:37.460 --> 01:01:38.560]   I absolutely despise it.
[01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:43.560]   It smells and tastes like dirty, moldy socks to me.
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:45.720]   Some people love it.
[01:01:45.720 --> 01:01:46.560]   They crave it.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.080]   Actually, some people get a visceral response to it.
[01:01:49.080 --> 01:01:51.720]   And we will talk about how certain tastes
[01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:55.580]   can actually evoke very deep biological responses,
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:57.160]   even hormonal responses,
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.580]   when we talk about taste in a few minutes.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:01.440]   But there are these odors.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:02.780]   For instance, in popcorn,
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   it's the molecule 2-acetyl-1-pyroline,
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:09.740]   not proline, but pyroline,
[01:02:09.740 --> 01:02:11.720]   that gives off to some people, like me,
[01:02:11.720 --> 01:02:14.840]   that toasted smell as the sugars in the kernels heat.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.280]   But the compound is also found
[01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.340]   in things like white bread and jasmine rice,
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:21.960]   which don't have as pungent an odor.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:26.780]   But some people smell that and it smells like cat urine.
[01:02:26.780 --> 01:02:31.780]   Now there are scents like musky scents and musty scents
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:34.420]   that are secreted by animals like skunks
[01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:37.780]   and other animals of the so-called mustelid family.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.520]   So these would be ferrets and other animals
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.660]   that can spray in response to fear,
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:45.400]   or if they just want to mark a territory
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.080]   because they want to say, "That's mine."
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:49.640]   Dogs instantly have scent glands that they rub on things.
[01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:51.080]   Cats have them too.
[01:02:51.080 --> 01:02:54.940]   This musty odor, some people find actually quite pleasant.
[01:02:54.940 --> 01:02:57.360]   Some people find it to be very noxious.
[01:02:57.360 --> 01:03:00.720]   And that will depend, of course, on the concentration.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.400]   I'll never forget the first time Costello
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.100]   got sprayed by a skunk and it was awful.
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.440]   I actually don't mind the smell of skunk at a distance.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:10.680]   It's actually a little bit pleasant.
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:12.780]   I admit it's a little bit pleasant to me.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:13.980]   I don't think that makes me too weird
[01:03:13.980 --> 01:03:15.200]   because have you ever read the book
[01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:18.200]   "All's Quiet on the Western Front" about World War I?
[01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:19.760]   There's a description in there
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.540]   about the smell of skunk at a distance
[01:03:21.540 --> 01:03:22.840]   being mildly pleasant.
[01:03:22.840 --> 01:03:25.200]   So the author of that book probably shared
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:29.980]   a similar olfactory profile to me or I to them rather.
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:32.360]   But some people find even the tiniest bit
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.360]   of the smell of skunk or must to be noxious or awful.
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.500]   Now, of course, in high concentrations, it's really awful
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.680]   and unfortunately, poor Costello,
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:43.380]   he was like literally red-eyed and just snorting
[01:03:43.380 --> 01:03:44.440]   and it was awful.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:45.580]   There's a joke about dogs.
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:48.900]   It says that dogs either get skunked one time
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:51.460]   and never again or 50 or 100 times.
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.820]   Costello has been skunked no fewer,
[01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:56.340]   I'm not making this up, has been skunked no fewer
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:58.160]   than 103 times.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:00.460]   And that's because if he sees something
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.360]   or hears something in the bushes, he just goes straight in.
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:03.920]   He does not learn.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:07.840]   But if you like the musty scent or musky scent,
[01:04:08.660 --> 01:04:10.340]   well, that says something about the genes
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.460]   that you express in your olfactory neurons.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:14.900]   It is completely inherited.
[01:04:14.900 --> 01:04:17.400]   And if you don't like that scent, if it's really noxious
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.140]   or you have this response to microwave popcorn,
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:21.180]   well, that means you have a different complement,
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:23.740]   a different constellation, if you will,
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:27.700]   of genes that make up for these olfactory sensory neurons
[01:04:27.700 --> 01:04:29.620]   and the receptors that they express.
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:31.260]   Let's talk about taste.
[01:04:31.260 --> 01:04:33.860]   Not whether or not you have taste or you don't have taste.
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:36.020]   There's no way for me to assess that.
[01:04:36.020 --> 01:04:39.480]   But rather how we taste things,
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:44.400]   meaning how we sense chemicals in food and in drink.
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.140]   There are essentially five,
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:50.000]   but scientists now believe there may be six things
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:53.840]   that we taste alone or in combination.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:58.840]   They are sweet tastes, salty tastes, bitter tastes,
[01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:04.760]   sour tastes, and umami taste.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.860]   Most of you have probably heard of umami by now.
[01:05:06.860 --> 01:05:09.640]   It's U-M-A-M-I.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:14.020]   Umami is actually the name for a particular receptor
[01:05:14.020 --> 01:05:19.020]   that you express on your tongue that detects savory tastes.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:22.780]   So it's the kind of thing in braised meats.
[01:05:22.780 --> 01:05:26.860]   Sometimes people can even get the activation of umami
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:29.360]   by tomatoes or tomato sauces.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.740]   What are each of these tastes
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:34.980]   and taste receptors responsible for?
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:36.400]   And then we'll talk about the sixth.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:37.500]   Maybe you can guess what it is.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:38.720]   I don't know if you can guess it now.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:42.080]   I couldn't guess it, but of the five tastes,
[01:05:42.080 --> 01:05:45.440]   each one has a specific utility or function.
[01:05:45.440 --> 01:05:50.960]   Each one has a particular group of neurons in your mouth,
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:53.280]   in your tongue, believe it or not,
[01:05:53.280 --> 01:05:55.840]   that responds to particular chemicals
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.340]   and particular chemical structures.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.420]   It is a total myth, complete fiction,
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.100]   that different parts of your tongue
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:06.060]   harbor different taste receptors.
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.840]   You know, that high school textbook diagram
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.780]   that, you know, sweet is in one part of the tongue
[01:06:09.780 --> 01:06:12.300]   and sour is in another and bitter is in another,
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.740]   complete fiction, just total fiction
[01:06:14.740 --> 01:06:16.860]   related to very old studies that were performed
[01:06:16.860 --> 01:06:18.740]   in a very poorly controlled way.
[01:06:18.740 --> 01:06:20.940]   No serious biologist,
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:22.340]   and certainly no one that works on taste,
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.220]   would contend that that's the way
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.940]   that the taste receptors are organized.
[01:06:26.940 --> 01:06:29.420]   They are completely intermixed along your tongue.
[01:06:29.420 --> 01:06:32.580]   If you have heightened or decreased sensitivity
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.620]   to one of those five things I mentioned,
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:36.620]   sweet, salty, bitter, umami, or sour,
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.820]   at one location in your tongue,
[01:06:37.820 --> 01:06:42.820]   it likely reflects the density of overall receptors
[01:06:42.820 --> 01:06:45.860]   or something going on in your brain,
[01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:49.600]   but not the differential distribution of those receptors.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:53.220]   So the sweet receptors are neurons
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:57.540]   that express a receptor that respond to sugars.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:59.900]   In the same way that you have cones, photoreceptors
[01:06:59.900 --> 01:07:02.420]   in your eye that respond to short, medium,
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.740]   or long wavelength light,
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:07.520]   meaning blue-ish, green-ish, or reddish light,
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:12.360]   you have a neuron in, or neurons, plural, in your tongue,
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.900]   that respond to sugars.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:18.700]   And then those neurons, they don't say sweet,
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:21.180]   they don't actually send any sugar into the brain,
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:23.180]   they send what we call a volley,
[01:07:23.180 --> 01:07:24.860]   a barrage of action potentials,
[01:07:24.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   of electrical signals off into the brain.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:28.500]   It's an amazing system.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.360]   So all these receptors in your tongue
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:33.300]   make up what are called the neurons
[01:07:33.300 --> 01:07:34.740]   that give rise to a nerve,
[01:07:34.740 --> 01:07:37.460]   a collection of wires, nerve bundles,
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.820]   of what's called the gustatory nerve.
[01:07:39.820 --> 01:07:41.620]   It goes from the tongue
[01:07:41.620 --> 01:07:44.620]   to the so-called nucleus of the solitary tracts,
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.260]   and some of you requested names,
[01:07:46.260 --> 01:07:48.180]   I usually don't like to include too many names
[01:07:48.180 --> 01:07:49.100]   for sake of clarity,
[01:07:49.100 --> 01:07:51.220]   but the gustatory nerve from the tongue
[01:07:51.220 --> 01:07:53.580]   goes to the nucleus of the solitary tract,
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:56.620]   and then to the thalamus and to insular cortex.
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.500]   You don't have to remember any of those names
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:07:59.380]   if you don't want to,
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.260]   but if you want mechanism, you want neural circuits,
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.080]   that's the circuit.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:04.720]   Gustatory nerve from the tongue,
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.560]   nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem,
[01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.100]   then the thalamus, and then insular cortex.
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:10.580]   And it is an insular cortex,
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:12.700]   this region of our cortex that we sort out
[01:08:12.700 --> 01:08:16.020]   and make sense of and perceive the various tastes.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:20.140]   Now, it's amazing because just taking a little bit of sugar
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.520]   or something sour, like a little bit of lemon juice,
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.360]   and touching it to the tongue within 100 milliseconds, right?
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:30.760]   Just 100 milliseconds, far less than one second,
[01:08:30.760 --> 01:08:32.680]   you can immediately distinguish,
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.160]   ah, that's sour, that's sweet, that's bitter, that's umami.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:41.620]   And that's an assessment that's made by the cortex.
[01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.140]   Now, what do these different five receptors encode for?
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.900]   Well, sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:49.840]   but what are they really looking for?
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:51.480]   What are they sensing?
[01:08:51.480 --> 01:08:55.820]   Well, sweet stuff signals the presence of energy, of sugars.
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.020]   And while we're all trying,
[01:08:57.020 --> 01:08:59.180]   or we're told that we should eat less sugar
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.580]   for a variety of reasons,
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:05.060]   the ability to sense whether or not a food
[01:09:05.060 --> 01:09:07.860]   has rapid energy source
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:09.880]   or could give rise to glucose is essential,
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:11.460]   so we have sweet receptors.
[01:09:11.460 --> 01:09:14.540]   The salty receptors, these neurons,
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:18.080]   are trying to sense whether or not there are electrolytes
[01:09:18.080 --> 01:09:20.780]   in a given food or drink.
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.320]   Electrolytes are vitally important
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.600]   for the function of our nervous system
[01:09:23.600 --> 01:09:24.740]   and for our entire body.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:28.140]   Sodium is what allows neurons to fire,
[01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:30.560]   what allows them to be electrically active.
[01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:32.280]   We also need potassium and magnesium.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.440]   Those are the ions that allow the neurons to be active.
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:38.600]   So the salty receptors, the reason that they are there
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.520]   is to make sure that we are getting enough,
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:42.200]   but not too much salt.
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.880]   We don't want to ingest things that are far too salty.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:49.180]   Bitter receptors are there
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:52.300]   to make sure we don't ingest things that are poisonous.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:53.180]   How do I know this?
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.040]   How can I say that?
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.980]   Even though I was definitely not consulted
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:09:57.580]   at the design phase, how can I say that?
[01:09:57.580 --> 01:09:59.860]   Well, the bitter receptors
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:03.540]   create a what we call labeled line, a unique trajectory
[01:10:03.540 --> 01:10:05.580]   to the neurons of the brainstem
[01:10:05.580 --> 01:10:08.420]   that control the gag reflex.
[01:10:08.420 --> 01:10:11.460]   If we taste something very bitter,
[01:10:11.460 --> 01:10:14.540]   it automatically triggers the gag reflex.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:15.780]   Now, some people like bitter taste.
[01:10:15.780 --> 01:10:17.780]   I actually like the taste of bitter coffee.
[01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:20.740]   Children generally like sweet taste more than bitter taste,
[01:10:20.740 --> 01:10:22.640]   but even babies, if they taste something bitter,
[01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:26.020]   they'll just immediately spit it up as like the gag reflex.
[01:10:26.020 --> 01:10:29.860]   Putrid smells will also evoke these same neurons.
[01:10:29.860 --> 01:10:31.660]   So some people are very sensitive.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:36.260]   They have a very sensitive or low threshold vomit reflex.
[01:10:36.260 --> 01:10:39.740]   There was somebody in my lab early on.
[01:10:39.740 --> 01:10:40.700]   We never did this intentionally.
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:43.380]   We were just laughing because it was so dramatic.
[01:10:43.380 --> 01:10:44.300]   We would have a discussion.
[01:10:44.300 --> 01:10:48.100]   Someone would say something about something kind of gross,
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:50.080]   appropriate for the workplace, but nonetheless gross.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:51.380]   We are biologists.
[01:10:51.380 --> 01:10:52.860]   We'd say something and they would say,
[01:10:52.860 --> 01:10:54.580]   "Stop, stop, stop, I'm going to throw up."
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.620]   You know, and some people have a very low threshold,
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.740]   quick gag reflex.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:00.820]   Other people don't.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.900]   Other people have a very stable stomach.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:05.540]   They don't, you know, they rarely, if ever, vomit.
[01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:10.020]   The umami receptor isn't sensing savory
[01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.460]   because the body loves savory.
[01:11:12.460 --> 01:11:14.620]   It's because savory is a signal
[01:11:14.620 --> 01:11:16.820]   for the presence of amino acids.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.200]   And we'll talk more about this,
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:21.820]   but the presence of amino acids in our gut
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.740]   and in our digestive system
[01:11:23.740 --> 01:11:27.240]   and the presence of fatty acids is essential.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.980]   There is in fact, no essential carbohydrate or sugar.
[01:11:30.980 --> 01:11:33.580]   Now I'm not a huge proponent of ketogenic diets,
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.580]   nor am I against them.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:36.740]   I think it's highly individual.
[01:11:36.740 --> 01:11:38.800]   You have to decide what's right for you,
[01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:42.060]   but everybody needs amino acids to survive.
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:44.640]   The brain needs them and we need fatty acids,
[01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.900]   especially to build a healthy brain during development.
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:49.880]   You need amino acids and fatty acids.
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.300]   And the sour receptor, why would we have a sour receptor
[01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:56.100]   so that we could have those really like sour candies?
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:11:57.940]   I think they've gotten more and more sour over the years.
[01:11:57.940 --> 01:11:59.980]   I admit I don't eat candy much,
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:02.580]   but I do have a particular weakness
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:07.580]   for like a really good, really sour, like gummy peach.
[01:12:07.580 --> 01:12:09.800]   Or if the gummy cherries are dipped
[01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:11.180]   in whatever that sour powder.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.340]   So I was a kid who, I admit it, I liked the Likomade thing.
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.620]   I like drink the powder.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.460]   Please don't do this.
[01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:18.460]   Don't give this garbage to your kids.
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:21.680]   But I liked it, it was tasty.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:25.020]   But sour receptors are not there
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.960]   so that you can ingest gummy, sour gummy peaches
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.800]   or something like that.
[01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:31.020]   That's not why the system evolved.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:33.980]   It's there and we know it's there
[01:12:33.980 --> 01:12:38.020]   to detect the presence of spoiled or fermented food.
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:40.780]   Fermented fruit has a sour element to it.
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.080]   And fermented things,
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:44.140]   while certainly some fermented foods
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:46.180]   like sauerkraut and kimchi and things of that sort
[01:12:46.180 --> 01:12:47.320]   can be very healthy for us
[01:12:47.320 --> 01:12:49.300]   and are very healthy in reducing inflammation,
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:50.800]   there are great data on that,
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:56.220]   pro quality microbiome, et cetera.
[01:12:56.220 --> 01:12:59.700]   Fermented fruit can be poisonous, right?
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:03.900]   Alcohols are poisonous in many forms to our system.
[01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.200]   And the sour receptor bearing neurons
[01:13:08.200 --> 01:13:10.540]   communicate to an area of the brainstem
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:13.300]   that evokes the pucker response.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:16.560]   Closing of the eyes and essentially shutting of the mouth
[01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:18.040]   and cringing away.
[01:13:18.040 --> 01:13:20.040]   I think cringe is like a thing now my niece,
[01:13:20.040 --> 01:13:22.060]   whenever I seem to say something or do something,
[01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:26.460]   it's either an eye roll, a cringe or both in combination.
[01:13:26.460 --> 01:13:30.780]   So the sour, the sweet, the salty, the bitter
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:33.220]   and the umami system were not there
[01:13:33.220 --> 01:13:35.820]   so that we could have this wonderful pallet of foods
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:37.100]   that we enjoy so much.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:39.500]   They'll allow us to do that,
[01:13:39.500 --> 01:13:40.620]   but they're there to make sure
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:42.400]   that we bring in certain things to our system
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.860]   and that we don't ingest other things.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:48.900]   Now what's the sixth sense within the taste system?
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.760]   Not sixth sense generally, but within the taste system.
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:54.440]   What's this putative possible sixth receptor?
[01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.200]   I already kind of hinted at it
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:58.160]   when I talked about fatty acids.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:01.840]   There are now data to support the idea,
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:03.900]   although there's still more work that needs to be done,
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:07.180]   that we also have receptors on our tongue that sense fat.
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.860]   And that because fat is so vital
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:13.020]   for the function of our nervous system
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.180]   and the other organs of our body,
[01:14:15.180 --> 01:14:17.920]   that we are sensing the fat content in food.
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:21.220]   Maybe this is why I can only eat half,
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:23.580]   but no less than half of a jar of almond butter
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.220]   or peanut butter in one sitting.
[01:14:25.220 --> 01:14:26.680]   I just can't, unless it's not salt,
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:28.760]   in which case it makes no sense to me.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:33.380]   But it's remarkable how that texture
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:36.480]   and also the flavor, but that texture of fat,
[01:14:36.480 --> 01:14:39.800]   I love butter, I am guilty and Costello is definitely guilty
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.920]   of eating pats of butter from time to time.
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:42.980]   I have no guilt about this.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.120]   People eat pats of cheese.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:46.220]   Why shouldn't we eat a pat of butter?
[01:14:46.220 --> 01:14:47.300]   If you think that's gross,
[01:14:47.300 --> 01:14:50.100]   then maybe I have greater abundance
[01:14:50.100 --> 01:14:52.300]   of the fat receptors in my tongue.
[01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:55.340]   Maybe I have a fat tongue than you do.
[01:14:55.340 --> 01:14:59.600]   But nonetheless, the ability to sense fat here in our mouth
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:01.320]   seems to be critical.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:03.020]   You can imagine why that is.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:06.900]   I want to talk about the tongue and the mouth
[01:15:06.900 --> 01:15:09.880]   as an extension of your digestive tract.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:12.040]   I know that might not be pleasant to think about,
[01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.920]   but when you look at it through the lens
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.020]   that I'm about to provide,
[01:15:15.020 --> 01:15:16.620]   it will completely change the way you think
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.580]   about the gut brain and about all the stuff
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:20.500]   that you've heard in these recent years about,
[01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.480]   oh, you know, we have this second brain,
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:23.640]   it's all these neurons in our gut.
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.960]   I've been chuckling through these last few years
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.360]   as people have gotten so excited about the gut brain,
[01:15:29.360 --> 01:15:30.800]   not because of their excitement.
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:32.240]   I think their excitement is wonderful,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:34.080]   but we always knew that the nervous system
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.400]   extended out of the brain and into the body.
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.200]   And people seem kind of overwhelmed and surprised
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:43.660]   by the idea that we have neurons in our gut
[01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:46.520]   that can sense things like sugars and fatty acids.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:48.240]   And I think those are beautiful discoveries,
[01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:49.080]   don't get me wrong.
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:51.400]   Diego Borges' lab out of Duke University
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:53.600]   has done beautiful studies showing
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:56.340]   that within the mucosal lining of our gut,
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:15:58.480]   we have neurons that sense fatty acids,
[01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:00.840]   sugars, and amino acids.
[01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.880]   And that when we ingest something
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.460]   that contains one or two or three of those things,
[01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:07.920]   there's a signal sent via the vagus nerve
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:12.920]   up into what's called the nodose ganglion, N-O-D-O-S-E,
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.520]   and then into the brain where it secretes dopamine,
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.320]   which makes us want more of that thing.
[01:16:17.320 --> 01:16:19.860]   It makes us more motivated to pursue
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:21.640]   and eat more of that thing
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:25.240]   that's either fatty or umami, it's savory,
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:27.920]   or has a sweet taste,
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.660]   any one or two or three of those qualities,
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.520]   independent of the taste.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:35.240]   Now, I think those are beautiful data,
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:38.360]   but we know that this thing, the mouth,
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.200]   for those of you listening,
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.600]   I've got a couple fingers in my mouth,
[01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.260]   that's why I sound like I'm on something in my mouth.
[01:16:43.260 --> 01:16:46.640]   This thing in the front of our face,
[01:16:46.640 --> 01:16:47.560]   we use it for speaking,
[01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:49.540]   but it is the front of our digestive tract.
[01:16:49.540 --> 01:16:51.800]   We are essentially a series of tubes,
[01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:53.600]   and that tube starts with your mouth
[01:16:53.600 --> 01:16:56.400]   and heads down into your stomach.
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:59.080]   And so that you would sense
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.460]   so much of the chemical constituents of the stuff
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:03.700]   that you might bring into your body
[01:17:03.700 --> 01:17:06.100]   or that you might want to expel and not swallow
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.160]   or not interact with by being able to smell it.
[01:17:09.160 --> 01:17:10.000]   Is it putrid?
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.360]   Does it smell good?
[01:17:11.360 --> 01:17:12.320]   Does it taste good?
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:13.140]   Is this safe?
[01:17:13.140 --> 01:17:13.980]   Is it salty?
[01:17:13.980 --> 01:17:17.200]   Is it so sour that it's fermented and is going to poison me?
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:19.700]   Is it so bitter that it could poison me?
[01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:23.880]   Is it so savory that, yes, I want more and more of this?
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:25.220]   Well, then you'd want to trigger dopamine.
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:27.300]   That's all starting in the mouth.
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:31.080]   So you have to understand that you were equipped
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.640]   with this amazing chemical sensing apparatus
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.700]   we call your mouth and your tongue.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:38.400]   And those little bumps on your tongue
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:39.920]   that they call the papillae,
[01:17:39.920 --> 01:17:41.520]   those are not your taste buds.
[01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:44.340]   Surrounding those little papillae,
[01:17:44.340 --> 01:17:48.280]   like little rivers, are these little dents and indentations.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.900]   And what dents and indentations do in a tissue
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:52.480]   is they allow more surface area.
[01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:54.700]   They allow you to pack more receptors.
[01:17:54.700 --> 01:17:57.600]   So down in those grooves are where all these little neurons
[01:17:57.600 --> 01:18:01.680]   and their little processes are with these little receptors
[01:18:01.680 --> 01:18:03.640]   for sweet, salty, bitter, umami, sour,
[01:18:03.640 --> 01:18:05.300]   and maybe fat as well.
[01:18:05.300 --> 01:18:06.720]   So it's this incredible device
[01:18:06.720 --> 01:18:08.000]   that you've been equipped with
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:10.920]   that you can use to interact with various components
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:11.960]   of the outside world
[01:18:11.960 --> 01:18:15.320]   and decide whether or not you want to bring them in or not.
[01:18:15.320 --> 01:18:17.640]   Just as you can lose those olfactory neurons
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   if you happen to get hit on the head
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:22.040]   or you have some other thing,
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.000]   maybe it was an infection that caused loss
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.980]   of those olfactory sensory neurons,
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:29.640]   you can also lose taste receptors in your mouth.
[01:18:29.640 --> 01:18:33.820]   If you've ever eaten something that's too hot,
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:36.300]   not spicy hot, but too hot,
[01:18:36.300 --> 01:18:40.020]   you burn your tongue, you burn receptors.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.500]   It takes about a week to recover those receptors.
[01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:45.840]   For some people, it's a little bit more quickly,
[01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:47.800]   but if you burn your tongue badly
[01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.340]   by ingesting a soup that's too hot
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:50.420]   or a beverage that's too hot,
[01:18:50.420 --> 01:18:53.080]   you will greatly reduce your sense of taste
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:56.680]   for essentially all tastes.
[01:18:56.680 --> 01:19:01.280]   And that's because those neurons sit very shallow
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.920]   beneath the tongue's surface.
[01:19:02.920 --> 01:19:04.240]   And so that if you put something too hot on it,
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:06.000]   you literally just burn those neurons away.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:09.380]   Luckily, those neurons also can replenish themselves.
[01:19:09.380 --> 01:19:12.740]   Those neurons are of the peripheral nervous system.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.740]   And like all peripheral system neurons,
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:17.500]   they can replenish or regenerate.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:20.080]   So if you burn your mouth in about a week or so,
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.040]   hopefully sooner, you'll be able to taste again.
[01:19:23.040 --> 01:19:26.960]   In fact, everybody's ability to taste
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.080]   is highly subject to training.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:31.400]   You can really enhance your ability to taste
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.160]   and taste the different component parts of different foods
[01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:38.880]   simply by paying attention to what you're trying to taste.
[01:19:38.880 --> 01:19:42.360]   This is an amazing aspect of the taste system.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.120]   I think more than any other system,
[01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:47.160]   the taste system and perhaps the smell system as well
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:49.840]   can be trained so that you can learn
[01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:53.300]   to pick out the tones, if you will,
[01:19:53.300 --> 01:19:58.300]   of different ice cream or different beverages.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:00.780]   Somebody who, I don't drink much alcohol,
[01:20:00.780 --> 01:20:02.400]   I occasionally have a drink or something,
[01:20:02.400 --> 01:20:05.180]   but a while ago I got to taste
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:08.360]   a bunch of different white tequilas.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:10.320]   These are different kinds of tequilas that are,
[01:20:10.320 --> 01:20:11.680]   they're not brown, they're white.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:15.920]   And I sort of assumed that all tequila was disgusting.
[01:20:15.920 --> 01:20:17.280]   That was my assumption before doing this.
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.720]   And then I tasted a couple of white tequilas
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:20.500]   and I realized, oh, those aren't too bad.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:22.080]   I tasted a few more.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.480]   And then pretty soon I could really start to detect
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:25.800]   the nuance and the difference.
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:28.200]   Now, I haven't had a tequila in a long time now.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:30.480]   I sort of tend to not drink it all these days.
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:33.260]   But in a very short period of time, like a couple of days,
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:35.800]   I got very good at detecting which things I liked
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.660]   and I could start to pick out tones.
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:40.680]   So I'm not a wine drinker, but for those of you that are,
[01:20:40.680 --> 01:20:42.780]   you hear about, oh, it has floral tones
[01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.960]   or berry tones or chocolate tones.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:48.680]   Some of that is just kind of menu based
[01:20:48.680 --> 01:20:50.820]   and kind of marketing based silliness
[01:20:50.820 --> 01:20:52.940]   designed to get you excited
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:54.200]   about what you're about to ingest.
[01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:55.700]   But some of it is real.
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:59.280]   And for people that are skilled in assessing wines
[01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:03.120]   or assessing foods, much more of an eater than a drinker,
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:06.000]   you can really start to develop a sensitive palette,
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:09.580]   a nuanced palette through what we call top-down mechanisms.
[01:21:09.580 --> 01:21:12.980]   This olfactory cortex that takes these five,
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:16.160]   maybe the sixth fat receptor two information
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:18.960]   and tries to make sense of what's out there in the world
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:21.380]   and what its utility is.
[01:21:21.380 --> 01:21:22.360]   Is it good? Is it bad?
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.160]   Do I want more of it or less than it?
[01:21:24.160 --> 01:21:27.760]   That neural circuitry is unlike other neural circuitry
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:32.140]   in that it seems very amenable to behavioral plasticity
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:33.240]   for whatever reason.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.840]   And we could talk about what those reasons might be.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:37.480]   It's interesting sometimes to think about
[01:21:37.480 --> 01:21:41.200]   how your taste literally, chemical taste,
[01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:43.840]   is probably very different than that of other people.
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:46.680]   How a food tastes to you is probably very different
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.880]   than how it tastes to somebody else.
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:49.840]   The same probably cannot be said
[01:21:49.840 --> 01:21:51.960]   of something like vision or hearing,
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:53.920]   unless you're somebody who has perfect pitch
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.940]   or your color vision is disrupted or you're a mantis shrimp,
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:00.120]   chances are when you look at the same object,
[01:22:00.120 --> 01:22:03.000]   two people are seeing more or less the same object
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.360]   or perceiving it in a very similar way.
[01:22:05.360 --> 01:22:08.040]   There are experiments that essentially establish that.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.120]   Now, we have taste receptors
[01:22:10.120 --> 01:22:11.400]   and a lot of those taste receptors,
[01:22:11.400 --> 01:22:13.120]   their chemical structures are known.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:17.920]   They come with fancy names like the T1R1 or the T1R2
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:21.920]   which were identified as the sweet and umami receptor.
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:25.080]   So what's interesting is that this umami flavor
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:29.000]   is the savory flavor rather that's sensed by umami receptors
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   is very close to the receptor that detects sweet things.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:37.360]   Similarly, bitter is sensed
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.580]   by a whole other set of receptors.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:42.760]   Now, there's a fun naturally occurring experiment
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:47.000]   that will forever change the way that you look at animals
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.160]   and the way certainly that I think about dogs
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:50.600]   and Costello in particular.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:55.360]   Carnivorous large animals like tigers
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:58.040]   and some grizzly bears, for instance,
[01:22:58.040 --> 01:23:02.040]   we know that they have no ability to detect sweet.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:04.320]   They don't actually have the receptors
[01:23:04.320 --> 01:23:06.740]   for detecting sweet on their tongue,
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:09.400]   but their concentration of umami receptors,
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:12.080]   of their ability to detect savory
[01:23:12.080 --> 01:23:16.840]   is at least 5,000 times that which it is in humans.
[01:23:16.840 --> 01:23:19.440]   In other words, if I eat a little piece of steak
[01:23:19.440 --> 01:23:23.720]   or Costello eats a little piece of steak,
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:28.720]   that steak probably tastes much, much more savory
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:31.000]   than it does to me.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:35.040]   So dogs and tigers and bears, et cetera,
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:38.480]   they're going to taste savory things and smell savory things
[01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:41.000]   with a much higher degree of sensitivity,
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:42.600]   but they can't taste sweet things.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:45.300]   Other large animals, which are mostly herbivores,
[01:23:45.300 --> 01:23:48.220]   like the panda bear, for instance,
[01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.240]   it's hard to believe that thing is even a bear.
[01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:51.480]   I got nothing against pandas.
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:53.640]   I just think that they get a little bit too much
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:55.960]   of the limelight, frankly.
[01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.200]   So no vendetta against panda, save the pandas.
[01:23:58.200 --> 01:23:59.440]   I hope they replenish all the pandas,
[01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:04.440]   but pandas in all their whatever have no umami receptors.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:07.580]   They can't taste savory,
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:11.700]   but they have greatly heightened density of sweet receptors.
[01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:14.720]   So there they are eating these whatever bamboos all day
[01:24:14.720 --> 01:24:18.500]   or not bamboozle, but bamboos all day.
[01:24:18.500 --> 01:24:21.940]   And they can taste things that are very sweet
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:24.620]   with a much higher degree of intensity.
[01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:27.880]   And in general, animals that are more gentle,
[01:24:27.880 --> 01:24:32.260]   more that are herbivores, excuse me,
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:34.980]   or animals that have the propensity for aggression,
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:36.700]   that's where you really see the divergence
[01:24:36.700 --> 01:24:38.020]   of the umami receptor,
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.640]   because it's associated with meat and amino acids,
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:44.360]   and where you see the enhancement of the sweet receptors
[01:24:44.360 --> 01:24:47.080]   for animals that eat a lot of plants and fruits.
[01:24:47.080 --> 01:24:49.300]   And they probably taste very different to them
[01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.000]   than they do to you and me.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.600]   And so it's interesting to note that animals that eat meat,
[01:24:54.600 --> 01:24:57.160]   that eat other organisms,
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:00.200]   can actually extract more savory experience from that.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.480]   What does this mean for you?
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:03.600]   All right, do you associate yourself
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:05.800]   as a tiger or a grizzly bear or a panda
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:06.840]   or a combination of both?
[01:25:06.840 --> 01:25:08.400]   Most people are omnivores.
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.560]   However, you may find it interesting that people that,
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:15.960]   for instance, eat a pure carnivore type diet
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.280]   or a keto diet where they are ingesting a lot of meats,
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.640]   so therefore are sensing a lot of umami flavors,
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:25.380]   and I realize not everyone who's keto eats meat,
[01:25:25.380 --> 01:25:29.240]   but those who do that will develop a more sensitive palette
[01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:32.460]   and likely, there are some data, although early data,
[01:25:32.460 --> 01:25:35.280]   craving for umami-like foods.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:38.920]   Whereas people that eat a more plant-based diet
[01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:43.480]   are likely developing a heightened sensitivity
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.460]   and desire for, and maybe even dopamine response
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:49.080]   to sugars and plant-based foods.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:52.160]   Now, this is my partial attempt to reconcile
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:55.440]   the kind of online battle that seems to exist
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.160]   between plant-based versus animal-based,
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.080]   purely plant-based or purely animal-based diets.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.840]   I think most people are omnivores,
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.920]   but it's kind of interesting to think that the systems
[01:26:06.920 --> 01:26:10.420]   are plastic such that people might want more meat
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:11.360]   if they eat more meat.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:14.120]   People might want more plants if they eat enough plants
[01:26:14.120 --> 01:26:16.680]   for a long period of time, and this might explain
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:19.780]   some of the chasm that exists between these two groups.
[01:26:19.780 --> 01:26:23.000]   Now, this is not to say anything about the ethical
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.720]   or the environmental impacts of different things.
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:25.840]   I don't even want to get into that
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:28.060]   because the meat people say that the plant-based diets
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:29.680]   have as much a negative impact
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:31.600]   as the plant people say that the meat-based diets.
[01:26:31.600 --> 01:26:33.080]   That's a totally different discussion.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:35.080]   What I'm talking about here is food craving
[01:26:35.080 --> 01:26:38.640]   and food seeking, and one's ability to detect
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:41.400]   these umami savory flavors is going to be enhanced
[01:26:41.400 --> 01:26:44.460]   by ingesting more meat and less activation
[01:26:44.460 --> 01:26:45.440]   of the sweet receptor.
[01:26:45.440 --> 01:26:47.360]   So in other words, the more meat you eat,
[01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:50.840]   the more you're going to become like a tiger, so to speak.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:54.960]   And the more that you avoid these umami flavors and meats,
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.320]   and the more that you would eat plant-based foods
[01:26:57.320 --> 01:26:58.820]   and in particular, sweet foods,
[01:26:58.820 --> 01:27:02.520]   the more you will likely suppress that umami system
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:06.480]   and that you will have a heightened desire for,
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:09.900]   appetite for, and sensing of sweet foods
[01:27:09.900 --> 01:27:11.960]   or foods that contain sugars.
[01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:15.120]   What I'm about to tell you is going to seem crazy,
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.540]   but is extremely interesting
[01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:21.080]   with respect to taste and taste receptors.
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:24.040]   Remember, even though we can enjoy food
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:27.460]   and we can evolve our sense of what's tasty or not tasty,
[01:27:27.460 --> 01:27:31.000]   depending on life decisions, environmental changes, et cetera,
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:32.960]   the taste system, just like the olfactory system
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:36.600]   and the visual system was laid down for the purpose
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.380]   of moving towards things that are good for us
[01:27:39.380 --> 01:27:41.380]   and moving away from things that are bad for us.
[01:27:41.380 --> 01:27:44.220]   That's the kind of core function of the nervous system.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:49.760]   Well, taste receptors are not just expressed on the tongue.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:54.160]   They are expressed in other cells and other tissues as well.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.060]   Some of you may be able to imagine foods
[01:27:57.060 --> 01:27:58.440]   that are so delicious to you
[01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:01.560]   that they make your entire body feel good.
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.400]   Or foods that are so horrifically awful to think about,
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.300]   let alone taste, that they create a whole body shuttering
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:12.680]   or kind of repellent type response
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:15.760]   where you just either cringe or turn your face away,
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.640]   even in the absence of that food.
[01:28:17.640 --> 01:28:21.720]   That's sort of how I feel about pungent Gorgonzola cheese.
[01:28:21.720 --> 01:28:24.600]   If you like Gorgonzola cheese, I don't judge you.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:27.560]   I just, that's an individual difference.
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:29.600]   I happen to love certain foods.
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:31.600]   I do like savory foods very much.
[01:28:31.600 --> 01:28:36.980]   When I think about them, they just, they make me feel good.
[01:28:36.980 --> 01:28:39.920]   And I'm oftentimes not even associating
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.260]   with the taste of those foods.
[01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:43.520]   It feels almost like a visceral thing.
[01:28:43.520 --> 01:28:45.720]   Well, it turns out that some of the taste receptors
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:49.120]   extend beyond the tongue, that they actually can extend
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.040]   into portions of the gut and digestive system.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:53.960]   And if that's not strange enough,
[01:28:53.960 --> 01:28:57.280]   turns out that some of the taste receptors
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.820]   are actually expressed on the ovaries and the testes.
[01:29:01.820 --> 01:29:04.720]   So what that means is that the gonads,
[01:29:04.720 --> 01:29:08.120]   the very cells and tissues and organs in our body
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:10.960]   that make up the reproductive axis
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:13.040]   are expressing taste receptors.
[01:29:13.040 --> 01:29:14.200]   Okay, so how do we interpret this?
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:15.880]   Does this mean that when you eat something
[01:29:15.880 --> 01:29:19.160]   that's very savory or very sweet, for instance,
[01:29:19.160 --> 01:29:22.660]   that it's triggering activation of the ovaries
[01:29:22.660 --> 01:29:24.420]   or of the testes?
[01:29:24.420 --> 01:29:26.980]   Well, it's possible.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:30.160]   Now, how those molecules, those chemical molecules
[01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:31.800]   would actually get there isn't clear.
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:34.740]   The digestive tract does not run directly
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:36.820]   to the testes or to the ovaries.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:40.040]   But nonetheless, what this means is that chemical sensing
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:42.160]   of the very things that we detect on our tongue
[01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:46.680]   and that we call taste in quotes, in food,
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:50.840]   is also evoking cellular responses
[01:29:50.840 --> 01:29:53.560]   within the reproductive gonads.
[01:29:54.440 --> 01:29:57.540]   Now, whether or not this underlies the positive association
[01:29:57.540 --> 01:30:00.280]   that we have with certain foods isn't clear,
[01:30:00.280 --> 01:30:04.600]   but I'd be remiss if I didn't point out the obvious,
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:07.400]   which is that the relationship
[01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:11.920]   between the sensual nature of particular foods
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:16.160]   and sensuality generally and the reproductive axis
[01:30:16.160 --> 01:30:19.100]   is something that's been covered in many movies.
[01:30:19.100 --> 01:30:21.240]   There are entire movies that are focused
[01:30:21.240 --> 01:30:24.640]   on the relationship between, for instance, chocolate
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:26.940]   and love and reproductive behaviors,
[01:30:26.940 --> 01:30:31.940]   or certain feasts of meat and their wonderful tastes
[01:30:31.940 --> 01:30:36.640]   and the kind of sensuality around feasts
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:38.480]   of different types of foods.
[01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:41.760]   But in general, it's the sweet and the savory.
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:46.200]   Rarely is it the sour or the bitter, the salty or the fat.
[01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:49.240]   And not surprisingly, perhaps,
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:51.920]   it is the T2Rs and the T1Rs,
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:54.720]   the receptors that are associated with the sweet
[01:30:54.720 --> 01:30:57.560]   and with the umami, the savory flavors
[01:30:57.560 --> 01:30:59.680]   that are expressed not just on the tongue
[01:30:59.680 --> 01:31:02.060]   and in portions of the digestive tract,
[01:31:02.060 --> 01:31:04.280]   but on the gonads themselves.
[01:31:04.280 --> 01:31:05.340]   So what does this mean?
[01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.960]   Does this mean that eating certain foods
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.720]   can stimulate the gonads?
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:09.560]   Maybe.
[01:31:09.560 --> 01:31:12.660]   There's no data that immediately support that right now,
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.640]   but this is an emerging area.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.080]   If you'd like to read more about this,
[01:31:17.080 --> 01:31:20.280]   there's a great review entitled Taste Perception
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:21.940]   from the Tongue to the Testes,
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:24.720]   although they do also talk about the ovaries.
[01:31:24.720 --> 01:31:26.200]   Why they didn't include that in the title
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:29.700]   is I think a reflection of the sort of bias of the author.
[01:31:29.700 --> 01:31:34.700]   The author, not incidentally, is Fang Li, last name Li.
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:38.520]   It's a very interesting paper published
[01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:42.160]   in Molecular Human Reproduction.
[01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:43.560]   You can find it easily online.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:44.380]   It's downloadable.
[01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:45.960]   I'll also provide a link to it.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.600]   I just think it's fascinating
[01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.040]   that these taste receptors are expressed in other tissues.
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:51.320]   And I should mention that they're expressed
[01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.480]   in tissues of other areas of the body as well,
[01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.780]   including the respiratory system,
[01:31:56.780 --> 01:32:01.160]   but the richest aggregation or concentration
[01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:03.000]   of these receptors for umami and sweet, of course,
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:05.720]   is on the tongue, but also on the gonads.
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:09.180]   And I think it does speak to the possible bridge
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:12.120]   between what we think of as a sensory
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.480]   or a sensual experience of food
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:18.040]   and the deeper kind of visceral sense within the gut
[01:32:18.040 --> 01:32:20.060]   and maybe even within the gonads as well
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:22.600]   of something that we find extremely pleasurable
[01:32:22.600 --> 01:32:26.280]   or even a repetitive that we want to move toward it.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:28.840]   We are actually going to return to that general theme
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:32.200]   in the discussion about touch sensation.
[01:32:32.200 --> 01:32:36.420]   Some people, for instance, when they touch certain surfaces
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:41.420]   like furs or sheepskins or velvet or soft, smooth surfaces,
[01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:46.240]   it feels good elsewhere in their body,
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:49.860]   not just at the point of contact with that surface.
[01:32:49.860 --> 01:32:54.800]   And similarly, if there's the, how about this one,
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:57.120]   the screech of chalk on a chalkboard?
[01:32:57.120 --> 01:33:00.720]   It's a sound, but it has a very strong visceral component
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:04.440]   or sandpaper like fingers, fingernails on a chalkboard,
[01:33:04.440 --> 01:33:06.620]   not the sound, but the feeling, right?
[01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:07.540]   Exactly.
[01:33:07.540 --> 01:33:09.460]   So our whole nervous system is tuned
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:12.340]   to either be drawn toward, repetitive,
[01:33:12.340 --> 01:33:15.800]   or repelled by aversive behaviors, right?
[01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:17.760]   So there's this push-pull that exists.
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.920]   And what I'm referring to in terms of these receptors
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:22.120]   on the tongue that are also expressed on the gonads
[01:33:22.120 --> 01:33:24.360]   is yet another example of what, at least in this case,
[01:33:24.360 --> 01:33:26.740]   seems to be an appetitive thing,
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:29.500]   a desire to move toward certain foods
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:30.820]   and maybe even the experiences
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:32.400]   that are associated with those foods.
[01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:35.040]   I want to talk about a particular aspect of food
[01:33:35.040 --> 01:33:37.680]   and a chemical reaction in cooking
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.300]   called the Maillard reaction.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.560]   Some of you have probably heard of the Maillard reaction.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:45.520]   It's spelled M-A-I-L-L-A-R-D.
[01:33:45.520 --> 01:33:48.720]   The D is silent, so don't call it the Maillard reaction.
[01:33:48.720 --> 01:33:51.020]   And it's not the Maillard reaction.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:52.680]   It is the Maillard reaction.
[01:33:52.680 --> 01:33:54.980]   And the Maillard reaction is a reaction
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:58.520]   that for the aficionados is a non-enzymatic browning.
[01:33:58.520 --> 01:34:01.720]   The other form of non-enzymatic browning is caramelization.
[01:34:01.720 --> 01:34:03.840]   Although when you hear caramel, caramel,
[01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.800]   I think it's caramel, you think sweet.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:11.660]   And indeed caramelization is a sugar-sugar chemical
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:15.620]   interaction that leads to a kind of nicely toasted,
[01:34:15.620 --> 01:34:18.640]   not burnt, but nicely toasted sweet taste.
[01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:22.480]   Whereas the Maillard reaction is that really savory reaction
[01:34:22.480 --> 01:34:25.380]   that occurs when you have a sugar amino acid reaction.
[01:34:25.380 --> 01:34:26.980]   Remember we have neurons in our gut,
[01:34:26.980 --> 01:34:31.040]   but also neurons in our tongue and neurons deep in the brain
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:36.040]   that are comparing the amount of sugar to savory, okay?
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.520]   And the Maillard reaction is very interesting.
[01:34:38.520 --> 01:34:39.960]   For you chemists out there,
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:41.420]   this is going to be way too elementary.
[01:34:41.420 --> 01:34:42.360]   And for you non-chemists,
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:43.960]   it's probably going to be a little bit of a reach,
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:45.520]   but just bear with me.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.280]   All these chemicals that we sense
[01:34:47.280 --> 01:34:48.400]   have a different structure.
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:50.780]   It's like hydrogens and oxygens and aldehyde groups
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.620]   and all these things.
[01:34:51.620 --> 01:34:53.200]   And basically the Maillard reaction
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.040]   involves what's called a free aldehyde.
[01:34:55.040 --> 01:34:57.560]   If you didn't like chemistry, don't worry about it.
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.060]   It's basically got a group there that kind of sits open
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:03.240]   that allows it to interact with other things.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.720]   And actually through the use of heat
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.640]   and the process that we call brazing,
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:10.200]   which I'll talk about in a moment,
[01:35:10.200 --> 01:35:13.080]   you create what's called a ketone group.
[01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:14.700]   Now, most people now have heard of ketones
[01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.640]   'cause they think about the ketogenic diet,
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:20.600]   but a ketone group is actually a chemical compound
[01:35:20.600 --> 01:35:21.920]   that can be used for energy.
[01:35:21.920 --> 01:35:24.420]   That's why people say you can use ketones for energy.
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:28.120]   But if you've ever actually encountered ketones,
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:31.840]   if you, for instance, get liquid ketones, a ketone ester,
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.080]   and you smell it, what does it smell like?
[01:35:34.080 --> 01:35:36.520]   It smells a little bit like an alcohol,
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.920]   but it has a kind of savory taste
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:42.080]   even when you smell it, okay?
[01:35:42.080 --> 01:35:44.160]   There are other smells that have these tastes too,
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:46.200]   but for the Maillard reaction,
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:47.880]   which could be created, for instance,
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.240]   like if you took a piece of meat
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.400]   or if you're not a meat eater,
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:53.040]   if you took tomatoes and you cooked them in a pan
[01:35:53.040 --> 01:35:54.920]   and you cooked it nice and slow till it simmered
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:57.200]   and almost started to brown and burn a little bit.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.400]   Usually if I do it, it burns.
[01:35:58.400 --> 01:36:02.000]   I'm not a good cook, as Costello points out a lot.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:07.000]   But it gets that like almost tangy, very umami-like flavor.
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   And sometimes it will even stick to the pan
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.380]   if you scrape it off.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:13.400]   It actually, you can taste it in your mouth
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.600]   as you're cooking it.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.880]   That's the Maillard reaction.
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.200]   That's that free aldehyde group.
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:20.100]   And that's the production of a ketone group.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:25.560]   When you smell ketones, it smells very much like that, okay?
[01:36:25.560 --> 01:36:27.200]   Some people talk about the ketones
[01:36:27.200 --> 01:36:28.720]   will produce like fruity breath.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.080]   And that's true if people are really far into ketosis.
[01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:32.560]   Their breath has a kind of fruity odor.
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.300]   That's a little bit of a different thing.
[01:36:34.300 --> 01:36:36.900]   So the relationship between smell and taste
[01:36:36.900 --> 01:36:39.400]   is a very, very close one.
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:40.920]   And this is why when people drink wine,
[01:36:40.920 --> 01:36:43.440]   they often will inhale and then sip.
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:44.800]   Some of that is just kind of like
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:46.640]   pomp and circumstance, frankly.
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:48.320]   They make a big deal of it.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:51.060]   But they can sense things with their mouth.
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:56.260]   The combination of odor receptors being activated
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:36:58.640]   in a particular way and taste receptors in the mouth
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:00.480]   being activated in a particular way
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:03.100]   triggers the activation of multiple brain areas
[01:37:03.100 --> 01:37:04.560]   that are associated with taste
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:06.780]   and circuitry within the body
[01:37:06.780 --> 01:37:09.120]   that's associated with the behaviors
[01:37:09.120 --> 01:37:11.960]   that relate to that taste, like leaning toward it
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:13.080]   or leaning away from it,
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.920]   depending on whether or not it's a pettative or aversive.
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:18.840]   So the Maillard reaction is a very interesting reaction
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:21.860]   involving this sugar amino acid thing.
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:25.120]   But really what it's doing is heating up food
[01:37:25.120 --> 01:37:29.860]   such that the amino acids are more available,
[01:37:29.860 --> 01:37:31.320]   literally in their chemical form,
[01:37:31.320 --> 01:37:33.360]   for detection by the neurons.
[01:37:33.360 --> 01:37:35.600]   This is a phenomenon that occurs in other domains
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.840]   of the taste system.
[01:37:37.840 --> 01:37:40.400]   For instance, a lot of what's happened
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.880]   with highly processed foods
[01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:45.680]   is that manufacturers have figured out
[01:37:45.680 --> 01:37:48.340]   how to trigger more dopamine response
[01:37:48.340 --> 01:37:50.340]   by ingestion of these sugary foods
[01:37:50.340 --> 01:37:52.360]   and created textures
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.720]   and created essentially design of foods for two purposes.
[01:37:55.720 --> 01:37:58.900]   I'm not out to completely demonize processed foods.
[01:37:58.900 --> 01:38:00.720]   I did that in a previous episode.
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:03.480]   But processed foods are really designed
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:05.740]   to take foods that ordinarily would spoil,
[01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:07.680]   that would have a shelf life and extend their shelf life,
[01:38:07.680 --> 01:38:10.680]   to turn foods, which are not a commodity, into a commodity.
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:12.600]   Something that could be stored and used essentially
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:17.600]   as a tradable, purchasable, sellable resource.
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.560]   In doing that, they've also decided to change the texture
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.720]   so that you want to chew more of them.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.680]   Like I have this thing,
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:29.140]   I don't know what it is for those Triscuit crackers.
[01:38:29.140 --> 01:38:30.120]   Why are those things so good?
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:31.420]   It's probably the texture.
[01:38:31.420 --> 01:38:33.780]   Yeah, those layers, they're just kind of perfectly salty.
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:34.800]   Haven't had one in a long time,
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:35.940]   so I bet if I had one now,
[01:38:35.940 --> 01:38:38.000]   it wouldn't taste as good as I'm imagining it.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:42.560]   But those combinations of texture, smell, and taste
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:44.800]   are what combine to activate these different brain areas
[01:38:44.800 --> 01:38:47.440]   that make you really want to desire something.
[01:38:47.440 --> 01:38:49.100]   And the people who make foods,
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:50.860]   processed foods in particular,
[01:38:50.860 --> 01:38:53.580]   are phenomenally good at figuring out
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:56.040]   what drives the dopamine system and makes you want more
[01:38:56.040 --> 01:38:58.740]   of these things, either because of the way they taste
[01:38:58.740 --> 01:39:01.060]   and/or because of the way they trigger neurons in your gut
[01:39:01.060 --> 01:39:02.460]   that have nothing to do with taste
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:04.620]   that simply make you desire more of the food.
[01:39:04.620 --> 01:39:08.400]   In other words, many of the foods that are processed foods
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:10.340]   make you desire more of them,
[01:39:10.340 --> 01:39:13.260]   it's impossible to eat one chip kind of thing,
[01:39:13.260 --> 01:39:16.380]   not because they taste good, but because in your gut,
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:18.660]   they're activating the neurons that activate dopamine,
[01:39:18.660 --> 01:39:20.900]   which make you seek more of those foods,
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:23.820]   independent of blood sugar or anything else.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:26.700]   So you may actually be eating more particular foods,
[01:39:26.700 --> 01:39:28.580]   not because they taste good,
[01:39:28.580 --> 01:39:32.820]   but because they feel good on your tongue and mouth,
[01:39:32.820 --> 01:39:34.780]   and because the neurons in your gut,
[01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:37.140]   which are totally independent of conscious taste,
[01:39:37.140 --> 01:39:38.700]   are triggering the release of dopamine,
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:41.340]   which is a molecule that makes you seek more of
[01:39:41.340 --> 01:39:43.120]   and do more of anything that led
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:44.960]   to the ingestion of that food.
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.300]   There's a fun experiment that you can do,
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:52.300]   which is to completely invert your sense of sweet and sour.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:54.940]   There's actually a way to do this readily.
[01:39:54.940 --> 01:39:56.820]   When I was a postdoc,
[01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.980]   I used to have a journal club at my house,
[01:39:58.980 --> 01:40:01.860]   people would come over in the evening once a month,
[01:40:01.860 --> 01:40:03.160]   and we would read a paper,
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.120]   typically the weirdest paper we could find,
[01:40:05.120 --> 01:40:08.420]   and we would eat food and hang out.
[01:40:08.420 --> 01:40:11.660]   That was what nerds did and do for fun.
[01:40:11.660 --> 01:40:12.880]   So that's what we did.
[01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:17.760]   And one time someone brought what's called miracle berry.
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:20.000]   So this isn't some psychedelic plant medicine thing.
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:22.400]   Miracle berry you can purchase online,
[01:40:22.400 --> 01:40:24.440]   it's relatively inexpensive.
[01:40:24.440 --> 01:40:28.120]   It actually causes a change in the configuration
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:32.320]   of taste receptors such that when you eat something sour,
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:33.600]   it tastes sweet.
[01:40:33.600 --> 01:40:37.240]   And so what's really wild is you ingest miracle berry,
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.760]   and then you bite into a lemon, maybe even the lemon peel,
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:43.160]   and it tastes as sweet as a peach.
[01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:45.500]   And this effect lasts several hours.
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:48.460]   Definitely check any warnings.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:51.120]   I don't know what sort of warnings miracle berry carries,
[01:40:51.120 --> 01:40:54.640]   but I'm sure there's always something you can imagine.
[01:40:54.640 --> 01:40:56.620]   There are a number of papers on miracle berry,
[01:40:56.620 --> 01:40:59.320]   or miracle fruit it's called,
[01:40:59.320 --> 01:41:02.320]   but it changes your perception of sour
[01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:04.480]   at a perceptual level,
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:07.800]   but it does that by changing the activity of the receptors
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:09.560]   in the mouth and tongue.
[01:41:09.560 --> 01:41:11.440]   Now, this is important as a principle,
[01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.840]   and it's underscored by experiments that have been done
[01:41:13.840 --> 01:41:15.480]   by, for instance, Charles Zucker's lab
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:16.880]   at Columbia University,
[01:41:16.880 --> 01:41:20.160]   where they've essentially genetically engineered animals
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:23.300]   such that the bitter receptor is swapped
[01:41:23.300 --> 01:41:24.400]   with the sweet receptor,
[01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:26.680]   or the sweet receptor is swapped with the bitter receptor.
[01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.000]   And what they show is that the actual food,
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:32.360]   the experience on the tongue
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:34.960]   drives different pathways in the brain.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:35.800]   Here's what they did.
[01:41:35.800 --> 01:41:39.320]   They essentially took mice and swapped out the sweet receptor
[01:41:39.320 --> 01:41:40.620]   and put in a bitter receptor.
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:42.040]   And then what they found is that,
[01:41:42.040 --> 01:41:45.560]   whereas normally mice would actively seek out
[01:41:45.560 --> 01:41:48.220]   and even work for sugar water, sucrose,
[01:41:48.220 --> 01:41:49.500]   they really liked that,
[01:41:49.500 --> 01:41:52.280]   if they replace the sweet receptor with the bitter receptor,
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.940]   the mice would avoid sugar water.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:55.120]   And the reverse was also true,
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:58.200]   that mice would drink a bitter solution avidly.
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:41:59.560]   They liked a bitter solution
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.020]   if they swapped out the bitter receptor for sweet receptor.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.960]   What this means is that our entire experience
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:08.200]   of what we taste is dependent on how we experienced
[01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:09.440]   that taste at the level of the tongue.
[01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.580]   And so you're hopefully not going to do genetic engineering
[01:42:12.580 --> 01:42:13.800]   of your taste receptors,
[01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:16.140]   but if you'd like to do this sort of experiment,
[01:42:16.140 --> 01:42:18.760]   you actually can do it very easily using miracle fruit.
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.680]   The instructions of how much to ingest, et cetera,
[01:42:21.680 --> 01:42:23.980]   any safety concerns are usually on the package
[01:42:23.980 --> 01:42:26.120]   and should be easy to find.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.240]   And there's a lot of science to support how this works.
[01:42:28.240 --> 01:42:31.240]   It's kind of a fun experiment that anyone can do
[01:42:31.240 --> 01:42:33.240]   and will completely change your perception
[01:42:33.240 --> 01:42:35.460]   of any food that you're accustomed to eating.
[01:42:35.460 --> 01:42:38.760]   In fact, you can figure out how much sweet
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:41.720]   or the sense of sweetness is contributing
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:42.980]   to your experience of a food,
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:44.960]   even if you don't think of that as a sweet food,
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.260]   through this miracle fruit experiment.
[01:42:47.260 --> 01:42:48.280]   You could take miracle fruit,
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:51.200]   you could eat a slice of pepperoni pizza or cheese pizza,
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:54.780]   which perhaps normally to you would taste just like pizza.
[01:42:54.780 --> 01:42:56.940]   And you'll notice it tastes very different.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:01.240]   What you are detecting is how much the sense of sweet
[01:43:01.240 --> 01:43:04.560]   was contributing to that particular flavor.
[01:43:04.560 --> 01:43:07.840]   Now I'd like to return to pheromones.
[01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:09.080]   So I mentioned earlier,
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.580]   true pheromonal effects are well-established in animals.
[01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:15.080]   And one of the most remarkable pheromonal effects
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.820]   that's ever been described is one that actually
[01:43:16.820 --> 01:43:18.300]   I've mentioned before on this podcast,
[01:43:18.300 --> 01:43:20.040]   but I'll mention again just briefly,
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.600]   which is the Coolidge effect.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.860]   The Coolidge effect is the effect of a male
[01:43:25.860 --> 01:43:26.880]   of a given species.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:31.880]   In most cases, it tended to be a rodent or a rooster mating.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.920]   And at some point reaching exhaustion
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:37.960]   or the inability to mate again
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:41.320]   because they just simply couldn't for whatever reason.
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.960]   The Coolidge effect establishes that if you swap out
[01:43:45.960 --> 01:43:49.280]   the hen with a new hen or the female rat or mouse
[01:43:49.280 --> 01:43:53.800]   with a new one, then the rat or the rooster
[01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:56.360]   spontaneously regains their ability to mate.
[01:43:56.360 --> 01:43:58.480]   Somehow their vigor is returned,
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:44:02.100]   the refractory period after mating that normally occurs
[01:44:02.100 --> 01:44:05.560]   is abolished and they can mate again.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:06.920]   Turns out that the Coolidge effect
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.020]   runs in the opposite direction too.
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.560]   I did not know this, but I recently learned of a study.
[01:44:11.560 --> 01:44:14.280]   It was actually done in hamsters, not in mice,
[01:44:14.280 --> 01:44:17.540]   but it turns out that females also will,
[01:44:17.540 --> 01:44:19.960]   female rodents will mate to exhaustion.
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.200]   And at some point, excuse me,
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:24.080]   they will refuse to mate any longer
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:26.200]   unless you swap in a new male.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.560]   And then because mating in rodents
[01:44:28.560 --> 01:44:30.280]   involves the female being receptive,
[01:44:30.280 --> 01:44:31.860]   there are a certain number of behaviors
[01:44:31.860 --> 01:44:36.860]   that tell you that she's willing and wanting to mate,
[01:44:36.860 --> 01:44:38.600]   so-called lordosis reflex.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:42.120]   Then if there's a new male,
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:46.280]   she will spontaneously regain the lordosis reflex
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:47.320]   and the desire to mate.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:49.520]   And how do you know this?
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:51.360]   How do we know it's a pheromonal effect?
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:54.960]   Well, this recovery of the desire and ability to mate,
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:58.240]   both in males and in females,
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:45:03.240]   can be evoked completely by the odor of a new male or female.
[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:05.000]   It doesn't even have to be the presentation
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:06.180]   of the actual animal.
[01:45:06.180 --> 01:45:07.020]   And that's how you know that
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:09.780]   it's not some visual interaction or some other interaction.
[01:45:09.780 --> 01:45:12.000]   It's a pheromonal interaction.
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:14.720]   Now, as I mentioned earlier, pheromonal effects,
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:17.620]   humans have been debated for a long period of time.
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:19.700]   We are thought to have a vestigial,
[01:45:19.700 --> 01:45:22.940]   meaning a kind of shrunken down
[01:45:22.940 --> 01:45:25.800]   miniature accessory olfactory bulb
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:29.560]   called Jacobson's organ or the vomeronasal organ.
[01:45:29.560 --> 01:45:31.740]   Some people don't believe that Jacobson's organ is this.
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:33.220]   Some people do.
[01:45:33.220 --> 01:45:37.000]   There is anatomical evidence for it in some cadavers.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.040]   It sits not very high up in the brain
[01:45:41.040 --> 01:45:42.800]   or where your olfactory bulb is,
[01:45:42.800 --> 01:45:45.400]   but it's actually in the nasal passages.
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:46.680]   So there's like little dents
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.440]   as you go up through your nasal passages.
[01:45:48.440 --> 01:45:52.740]   And there is evidence of something that's vomeronasal-like.
[01:45:52.740 --> 01:45:54.560]   Vomeronasal is the pheromonal organ.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:55.700]   They call it Jacobson's organ.
[01:45:55.700 --> 01:45:57.220]   If it's present in humans,
[01:45:57.220 --> 01:46:01.740]   kind of tucked into some of the divots in the nasal passage.
[01:46:01.740 --> 01:46:06.680]   Even if that Jacobson's organ isn't there
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.420]   or is not responsible for the chemical signaling
[01:46:09.420 --> 01:46:10.820]   between individuals,
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:13.380]   there is chemical signaling between human beings.
[01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:16.740]   As I mentioned earlier, the effect of tears
[01:46:16.740 --> 01:46:19.100]   in suppressing the areas of the brain
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:23.740]   that are involved in sexual desire and testosterone of males.
[01:46:23.740 --> 01:46:25.620]   That's a concrete result.
[01:46:25.620 --> 01:46:28.520]   It's a very good result published by an excellent group
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:30.260]   with no preexisting bias going in.
[01:46:30.260 --> 01:46:32.160]   That's just what they found.
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:37.160]   There is also evidence both for and against
[01:46:37.160 --> 01:46:40.420]   chemical signaling between females
[01:46:40.420 --> 01:46:42.940]   in terms of synchronization of menstrual cycles.
[01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:44.560]   Now, the original paper on this
[01:46:44.560 --> 01:46:48.580]   was published in the 1970s by McClintock.
[01:46:48.580 --> 01:46:53.020]   And it essentially said that when women live together
[01:46:53.020 --> 01:46:55.220]   in group housing dormitories and similar,
[01:46:55.220 --> 01:46:57.020]   that their menstrual cycles were synchronized
[01:46:57.020 --> 01:46:58.900]   and that was due to what was hypothesized
[01:46:58.900 --> 01:47:00.580]   to be for hormonal effects.
[01:47:00.580 --> 01:47:01.420]   Over the years,
[01:47:01.420 --> 01:47:04.820]   that study has been challenged many, many times.
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:07.780]   The more recent data point to the idea
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:10.980]   that there is chemical signaling between women
[01:47:10.980 --> 01:47:14.420]   in ways that impact the timing of the menstrual cycle,
[01:47:14.420 --> 01:47:17.980]   but that depending on whether or not some of the women
[01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:19.980]   are in the ovulation phase,
[01:47:19.980 --> 01:47:21.580]   the ovulatory phase of that cycle,
[01:47:21.580 --> 01:47:23.420]   or whether or not they are in the follicular phase,
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:26.060]   the phase when the follicle is maturing
[01:47:26.060 --> 01:47:30.420]   before the egg actually ovulates.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:35.560]   So two separate phases of the 28-day menstrual cycle
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:39.900]   will either lengthen or shorten the menstrual cycle
[01:47:39.900 --> 01:47:42.000]   of the person that smells those women.
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:43.020]   Translated into English,
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:46.220]   what that means is that it is very likely, it seems,
[01:47:46.220 --> 01:47:47.940]   that something, maybe pheromones,
[01:47:47.940 --> 01:47:49.300]   but maybe some other chemical
[01:47:49.300 --> 01:47:51.220]   that is independent of pheromones,
[01:47:51.220 --> 01:47:55.840]   is being conveyed between women that are housed together
[01:47:55.840 --> 01:47:57.480]   or spend a lot of time together
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:58.960]   to shift their menstrual cycle,
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:48:02.120]   but it doesn't necessarily mean that they synchronize.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:02.960]   So for instance,
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:04.960]   if one woman is in the follicular phase
[01:48:04.960 --> 01:48:07.860]   of the menstrual cycle,
[01:48:07.860 --> 01:48:12.040]   it might shorten or delay ovulation, excuse me,
[01:48:12.040 --> 01:48:14.820]   it might accelerate ovulation in another woman,
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:17.020]   whereas if somebody is in the ovulatory phase
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:17.840]   of their cycle,
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:21.320]   it might lengthen the menstrual cycle out
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:25.680]   so that the woman who smells that person's scent
[01:48:25.680 --> 01:48:27.360]   or who smells her sweat,
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:29.060]   we still don't know the origin of the chemical,
[01:48:29.060 --> 01:48:30.560]   would ovulate later.
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:31.920]   So all of this is to say
[01:48:31.920 --> 01:48:33.980]   is that chemical-chemical signaling is happening
[01:48:33.980 --> 01:48:36.560]   from females to males through tears, we know that.
[01:48:36.560 --> 01:48:38.000]   Is that a pheromonal effect?
[01:48:38.000 --> 01:48:40.100]   Well, by the strict definition of a pheromone,
[01:48:40.100 --> 01:48:42.140]   a molecule that's released from one individual
[01:48:42.140 --> 01:48:44.920]   that impacts the biology of another individual, yes,
[01:48:44.920 --> 01:48:48.380]   but in terms of identifying what the pheromone is in tears,
[01:48:48.380 --> 01:48:49.680]   that's still unknown.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:52.120]   It's not clear what the chemical compound is.
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:53.940]   So we're reluctant as scientists
[01:48:53.940 --> 01:48:55.560]   to call it a true pheromonal effect.
[01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:57.000]   The menstrual cycle
[01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.300]   and the synchronization of the menstrual cycle effect
[01:48:59.300 --> 01:49:01.040]   seems to hold up under some conditions,
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:02.120]   but in some cases,
[01:49:02.120 --> 01:49:04.520]   there's a kind of clash of menstrual cycles
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:07.920]   that's created by chemicals
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.640]   that are emitted from one female to another.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:14.420]   So there are many examples of this in humans.
[01:49:14.420 --> 01:49:19.420]   For instance, people can recognize the T-shirt of their mate
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:24.380]   if you give, this experiment has been done many times.
[01:49:24.380 --> 01:49:25.740]   I know it's been challenged a number of times,
[01:49:25.740 --> 01:49:27.140]   but the data are pretty good by now
[01:49:27.140 --> 01:49:29.560]   that if you offer,
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:31.300]   you take a collection of women
[01:49:31.300 --> 01:49:35.100]   who are in stable relationships with somebody,
[01:49:35.100 --> 01:49:37.700]   you offer them the smell of a hundred different shirts
[01:49:37.700 --> 01:49:39.360]   and they can very readily pick out
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:41.300]   their significant other's scent.
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.480]   Okay, that's pure old faction.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:43.980]   That's not pheromonal.
[01:49:43.980 --> 01:49:47.300]   But nonetheless is a remarkable degree of discrimination,
[01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.360]   olfactory discrimination.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:53.120]   You can dilute their partner's scent
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:55.240]   down to the point where they themselves
[01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:57.160]   can't consciously detect the difference
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:59.220]   between the sweat or the T-shirt
[01:49:59.220 --> 01:50:01.200]   of a hundred different T-shirts or so.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.960]   And they might say, I don't really smell the difference,
[01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:04.640]   but I think it's this one.
[01:50:04.640 --> 01:50:07.480]   Yeah, this one belongs to the person that I've been with.
[01:50:07.480 --> 01:50:09.120]   And they are much greater than chance
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:12.920]   at detecting the T-shirt or identifying the T-shirt correctly.
[01:50:12.920 --> 01:50:14.460]   So there's no question really
[01:50:14.460 --> 01:50:17.820]   that there is chemical chemical signaling between humans.
[01:50:17.820 --> 01:50:19.000]   The question is whether or not
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:21.200]   it's truly pheromonal in basis.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:23.480]   Now you'll notice that a lot of the examples I gave,
[01:50:23.480 --> 01:50:25.280]   aside from the one of tears,
[01:50:25.280 --> 01:50:30.280]   is women detecting the sense of men or of other women.
[01:50:30.280 --> 01:50:33.680]   And it turns out that there are a number of papers.
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:37.100]   The best one I think that I could find
[01:50:37.100 --> 01:50:39.800]   is published in Physiology and Behavior in 2009
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:43.240]   to review entitled Sex Differences in Reproductive Hormone
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:45.720]   Influences on Human Odor Perception
[01:50:45.720 --> 01:50:48.600]   by Doddy, D-O-T-Y, and Cameron.
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:50.040]   I encourage you to check out this review.
[01:50:50.040 --> 01:50:51.600]   It's available free as a download.
[01:50:51.600 --> 01:50:53.120]   We'll provide a link to it.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:55.080]   You can get the full PDF if you want.
[01:50:55.080 --> 01:51:00.080]   But it does seem that women are better at detecting odors
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:03.820]   in these odor discrimination tasks than are men.
[01:51:03.820 --> 01:51:05.720]   And yes, that it does vary according
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:08.720]   to where they are in their menstrual cycle.
[01:51:08.720 --> 01:51:10.840]   And yes, they also looked at people
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:12.280]   who had received gonadectomy,
[01:51:12.280 --> 01:51:13.720]   that had their ovaries removed,
[01:51:13.720 --> 01:51:16.180]   a number of different important controls.
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:17.900]   None of this surprises me.
[01:51:17.900 --> 01:51:19.440]   None of this should surprise you.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:22.220]   It's very clear that hormones have a profound effect
[01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:24.720]   on a large number of systems in our biology,
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:27.280]   and that smell and taste and the ability
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:29.600]   to sense the chemical states of others,
[01:51:29.600 --> 01:51:31.200]   either consciously or subconsciously,
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:33.280]   have a profound influence on whether or not
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.500]   we might want to spend time with them,
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:36.860]   whether or not this is somebody that we're pair bonded with,
[01:51:36.860 --> 01:51:39.480]   whether or not this is somebody that we just met
[01:51:39.480 --> 01:51:42.420]   and don't trust yet, things of this sort.
[01:51:42.420 --> 01:51:46.200]   And given what's at stake in terms of reproductive biology,
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:47.480]   not just offspring,
[01:51:47.480 --> 01:51:50.980]   but given the possibility of transmission of diseases,
[01:51:50.980 --> 01:51:55.720]   et cetera, the risks of childbirth, et cetera,
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:52:00.480]   it makes so much sense that much of our biology
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:02.860]   is wired toward detecting and sensing
[01:52:02.860 --> 01:52:04.940]   whether or not things and people
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:07.160]   are things that we should approach or avoid,
[01:52:07.160 --> 01:52:10.320]   whether or not reproduction with that person
[01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:11.480]   is the appropriate response
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.720]   or suppression of the reproductive response
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:15.400]   is the appropriate response, right?
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.420]   As in the case with the tears.
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:19.980]   So I think these are fascinating studies.
[01:52:19.980 --> 01:52:22.920]   It's an area that still needs a lot of work,
[01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:25.600]   but there are some really wonderful papers on this.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:27.200]   And the one that I mentioned a few minutes ago,
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:29.260]   sex differences and reproductive hormone influences
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:33.140]   on human odor perception is one of the better reviews
[01:52:33.140 --> 01:52:34.680]   that are out there.
[01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:37.540]   There are also a number of other reviews, for instance,
[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:39.500]   that talk about pheromone effects
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:43.060]   and their impact on mood and sexual responses
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:43.900]   and things of that sort.
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:45.460]   And we will also provide some links to those.
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:47.720]   A lot of this is still speculative, but I want to say,
[01:52:47.720 --> 01:52:48.720]   I know I said it three times,
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:50.180]   but I really want to underscore
[01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.560]   because it is vitally important
[01:52:51.560 --> 01:52:52.940]   and people seem to get a little triggered
[01:52:52.940 --> 01:52:54.440]   by the notion of pheromones.
[01:52:54.440 --> 01:52:58.800]   Just because we haven't identified
[01:52:58.800 --> 01:53:03.180]   the actual chemical compound that's acting as a pheromone
[01:53:03.180 --> 01:53:06.020]   or putative pheromone does not mean
[01:53:06.020 --> 01:53:07.500]   that chemical-chemical signaling
[01:53:07.500 --> 01:53:09.260]   between individuals doesn't exist.
[01:53:09.260 --> 01:53:10.860]   Clearly it does.
[01:53:10.860 --> 01:53:13.740]   Actually, you and every other human
[01:53:13.740 --> 01:53:15.820]   from the time you're born until the time you die
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:20.820]   are actively seeking out and sensing and evaluating
[01:53:20.820 --> 01:53:24.980]   the chemicals that come from other individuals.
[01:53:24.980 --> 01:53:27.540]   There's a really nice study that was done
[01:53:27.540 --> 01:53:29.740]   by the Weizmann Institute, a group there.
[01:53:29.740 --> 01:53:31.260]   I think it was also Noam Sobel's group,
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:33.220]   but another group as well, as I recall,
[01:53:33.220 --> 01:53:35.460]   looking at human-human interactions
[01:53:35.460 --> 01:53:37.460]   when they meet for the first time.
[01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:40.940]   It's a remarkable study because what they found
[01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:44.340]   was people would reach out and shake hands.
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:45.860]   This is a typical response.
[01:53:45.860 --> 01:53:48.100]   Pre-pandemic, people would meet,
[01:53:48.100 --> 01:53:50.180]   they'd reach out and they would shake hands.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:54.300]   And what they observed was almost every time
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:58.020]   within just a few seconds of having shaken hands
[01:53:58.020 --> 01:54:00.820]   with this new individual, people will touch their eyes.
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:03.060]   Almost without fail.
[01:54:03.060 --> 01:54:04.620]   Occasionally they would touch their eyebrow,
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:06.380]   occasionally someone would touch their hair.
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:09.760]   We always associate that with people having some sort of,
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:12.260]   or us having some sort of self-conscious response,
[01:54:12.260 --> 01:54:14.020]   like, oh, we want to make sure we're, you know,
[01:54:14.020 --> 01:54:16.540]   shirt tucked in and all prim and proper, whatever it is,
[01:54:16.540 --> 01:54:18.380]   or looking right, is there something in my teeth,
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:19.400]   this kind of thing.
[01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:21.220]   But actually people are doing that
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:24.600]   even if the person they just met left the room.
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:26.200]   So someone's sitting there, someone comes in,
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:29.920]   they shake hands, and the person inevitably subconsciously
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:31.060]   touches their eyes.
[01:54:31.060 --> 01:54:34.180]   They are taking chemicals from the skin contact
[01:54:34.180 --> 01:54:37.260]   and they are placing it on a mucosal membrane of some sort,
[01:54:37.260 --> 01:54:39.360]   typically not up their nose or in their mouth,
[01:54:39.360 --> 01:54:40.840]   typically on their eyes.
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:42.240]   Now, animals do this all the time.
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:44.600]   There's a phenomenon in animals called bunting.
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:48.300]   If you have a overeager dog that when you meet them
[01:54:48.300 --> 01:54:50.420]   or you see them again after you've been away for the day,
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:52.560]   they'll rub their head against you, right?
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:54:54.560]   Cats will do this too, it's called bunting.
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:56.300]   They're rubbing their scent glands on you,
[01:54:56.300 --> 01:54:57.740]   they're marking you.
[01:54:57.740 --> 01:54:58.760]   And believe it or not,
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.360]   you're marking other people when you shake their hand.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:03.840]   And they are then taking your mark
[01:55:03.840 --> 01:55:07.140]   and rubbing it on themselves subconsciously.
[01:55:07.140 --> 01:55:08.940]   So we all do these kinds of behaviors.
[01:55:08.940 --> 01:55:10.100]   And now that you're aware of it,
[01:55:10.100 --> 01:55:11.800]   you can watch for it in your environment,
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:13.880]   you can pay attention to people.
[01:55:13.880 --> 01:55:15.140]   Some of this has probably changed
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:17.460]   in light of the events of 2020, et cetera.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:21.240]   But nonetheless, we are evaluating the molecules
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:22.600]   on people's breath.
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:25.120]   We are evaluating the molecules on people's skin
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:28.520]   by actively rubbing it on ourselves.
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:31.360]   And we are actively involved in sensing
[01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:32.740]   not just their facial expressions,
[01:55:32.740 --> 01:55:34.800]   the size of their pupils and things like that,
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:36.740]   but the chemicals that they are emitting,
[01:55:36.740 --> 01:55:39.040]   their hormone status, how they smell.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:43.480]   We're detecting the pheromones possibly,
[01:55:43.480 --> 01:55:45.700]   but certainly the odors in their breath.
[01:55:45.700 --> 01:55:46.540]   You might say, well,
[01:55:46.540 --> 01:55:49.340]   I don't actually go around sniffing people's breath.
[01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:51.240]   Unless if it's bad, in which case it's aversive,
[01:55:51.240 --> 01:55:53.560]   but breath is communicating a lot of signals.
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:56.320]   And this handshake eye rub experiment
[01:55:56.320 --> 01:55:59.580]   shows that we are actively going through behaviors
[01:55:59.580 --> 01:56:03.300]   reflexively to wipe ourselves or smear ourselves
[01:56:03.300 --> 01:56:04.720]   with other people's chemicals.
[01:56:04.720 --> 01:56:07.540]   Now that might seem odd or even gross to you,
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:09.440]   but I think it's beautiful.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:11.520]   I think that it illustrates the extent
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.320]   to which we as human beings are in some ways
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:17.320]   among the other animals in our subconscious,
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:20.080]   sometimes conscious, but certainly subconscious,
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:22.980]   tendency to try and evaluate our chemical environment
[01:56:22.980 --> 01:56:25.160]   through what we inhale through our nose,
[01:56:25.160 --> 01:56:27.400]   what we ingest through our mouth,
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:31.460]   and what we actively take off other people's skin
[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:34.500]   and rub on ourselves to evaluate it
[01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:35.920]   and what we should do about it
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:38.140]   and perhaps that person as well.
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:40.960]   So today we talked a lot about olfaction, taste,
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.320]   and chemical sensing between individuals.
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:45.400]   I like to think that you now know a lot
[01:56:45.400 --> 01:56:47.320]   about how your smell system works
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.440]   and why inhaling is a really good thing to do in general
[01:56:51.440 --> 01:56:54.020]   for waking up your brain and for cognitive function
[01:56:54.020 --> 01:56:56.120]   and for enhancing your sense of smell.
[01:56:56.120 --> 01:56:58.420]   We talked about how to enhance your sense of taste.
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:01.380]   And we talked about chemical signaling between individuals
[01:57:01.380 --> 01:57:03.680]   as a way of communicating some important aspects
[01:57:03.680 --> 01:57:04.780]   about biology.
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:07.360]   People are shaping each other's biology all the time
[01:57:07.360 --> 01:57:09.420]   by way of these chemicals that are being traded
[01:57:09.420 --> 01:57:11.960]   from one body to the next through air
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:15.000]   and skin-to-skin contact and tears.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:16.260]   If you're enjoying this podcast

[01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:14.340]   Everything's zero cost, of course.
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:16.180]   And there, you can also find any links
[01:58:16.180 --> 01:58:18.480]   to additional resources that we might post.
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:21.320]   As well, please check out our sponsors
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:23.820]   that we mentioned at the beginning of each podcast episode.
[01:58:23.820 --> 01:58:25.700]   Those sponsors are the way that we are able
[01:58:25.700 --> 01:58:28.220]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[01:58:28.220 --> 01:58:30.660]   about all these topics to you each week.
[01:58:30.660 --> 01:58:32.340]   And we also have a Patreon.
[01:58:32.340 --> 01:58:35.480]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman.
[01:58:35.480 --> 01:58:38.980]   And there, you can support us at any level that you like.
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:40.700]   Today, we didn't really talk about supplements,
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:43.100]   but in previous episodes and in future episodes,
[01:58:43.100 --> 01:58:45.040]   we'll talk about supplements and things that you can take
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:48.160]   to modify your biology and nervous system if you like.
[01:58:48.160 --> 01:58:50.780]   We've partnered with Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E,
[01:58:50.780 --> 01:58:53.060]   because Thorne has the highest levels of stringency
[01:58:53.060 --> 01:58:55.460]   with respect to the amounts of given compounds
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:56.580]   that are in their supplements
[01:58:56.580 --> 01:58:59.380]   and the quality and purity of those compounds.
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:04.380]   If you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:59:04.380 --> 01:59:07.480]   you can see all the supplements that I take
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:09.860]   and get 20% off any of those supplements,
[01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:13.000]   as well as any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:15.980]   You just go to thorne.com/u/huberman.
[01:59:15.980 --> 01:59:18.200]   And if you enter their website through that portal,
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:21.120]   you get 20% off any of their things at checkout.
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:22.120]   Last but not least,
[01:59:22.120 --> 01:59:24.140]   I want to thank you for your time and attention
[01:59:24.140 --> 01:59:26.960]   and your willingness to embrace new concepts and terms
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:29.920]   and to learn about science and biology and protocols
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:32.660]   that hopefully can benefit you and the people that you know.
[01:59:32.660 --> 01:59:35.600]   And of course, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.180]   [upbeat music]
[01:59:38.180 --> 01:59:40.760]   (upbeat music)
