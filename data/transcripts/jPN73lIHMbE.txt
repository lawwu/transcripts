[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.080]   - Pastor John, yesterday we talked about living in hope
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.760]   when life seems aimless,
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.240]   and specifically when a job is hard
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.320]   or it's just difficult to get excited about.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.540]   We're gonna talk about work more today
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.100]   because jobs for many are scarce,
[00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.120]   and many people just take the jobs that they can get.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.080]   And a long-time listener to the podcast,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.840]   Joshua in Vancouver, asks this,
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.960]   "Pastor John, can a believer ever be called
[00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.960]   to a lifelong career for which they do not enjoy?"
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.200]   Pastor John, what would you say to Joshua?
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.480]   - It's not an easy question to answer
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.160]   the way it's formulated.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.160]   The main reason is that there is another question,
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.740]   which I think needs to be answered first.
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.020]   Namely, would God ever call a person
[00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.780]   to a lifelong vocation in which He does not enable
[00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.560]   the person to have joy?
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:07.560]   Would He call you to a work you can't enjoy?
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.120]   That's one question.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.880]   Is there a work He calls you to
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.900]   that He won't enable you to enjoy?
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.960]   The way the question is posed seems to assume
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   that some tasks that God, God, might call a person to
[00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.780]   simply cannot be enjoyed.
[00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.340]   God doesn't have the capacity or the will
[00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.460]   to give the person He just called into that
[00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.740]   the joy to do it.
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.020]   And my question is, is that true?
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.760]   Is there anything in the Bible that would incline us
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.300]   to believe that if God, God,
[00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.140]   the good, loving, Christ-sending God,
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.020]   calls us to something,
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.180]   He would give us the grace to find it rewarding
[00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.540]   and to find joy in it?
[00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.960]   Is that not the way the Bible reads?
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.840]   So here's the way I would go about answering it.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.000]   Joshua is right to assume that God cares
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.920]   about whether we do what we do with joy.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.780]   Psalm 100, "Serve the Lord with gladness."
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.680]   That's clear.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.040]   God does not like begrudging, joyless service.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.440]   And in one sense, all of our lives,
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.640]   including our vocations, are service to God.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.540]   Paul says, Romans 12, eight,
[00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.880]   "Let the one who does acts of mercy do so cheerfully."
[00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.060]   And he says in 2 Corinthians 9, seven,
[00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.960]   "God loves a cheerful giver."
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.240]   And all of our work should be giving.
[00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.540]   All of our work should be merciful.
[00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.200]   And he says in 1 Thessalonians 5, 18,
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.280]   "That we should give thanks in every circumstance."
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.420]   And he ups the ante in Ephesians 5, 20,
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.760]   "Give thanks for everything."
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.960]   Amazing.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.280]   And then Ecclesiastes 9, 10,
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.340]   "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might."
[00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.880]   And chapter three, verse 22, Ecclesiastes,
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.760]   "There's nothing better than that a man should rejoice
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.460]   in his work."
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.200]   So for all those reasons,
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.640]   I would say that Joshua is on the right track here
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.960]   for believing that God wants us to find joy
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.520]   in the work of our hands, in our vocational labors.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.520]   But I think the implication in the Bible is not mainly
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.240]   that we should refuse to work until we find the work
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.680]   that we think we can enjoy,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.680]   but that we should take the work that we can
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.100]   for the good of the family, the good of the community,
[00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.720]   the glory of God, and then pray our way
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.180]   into the enjoyment of it and shape it
[00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.700]   in whatever way we can so that it becomes more fruitful
[00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.300]   and more enjoyable.
[00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.360]   I say that because, for example, in the early church,
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.540]   many slaves were converted to Christianity
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.080]   in the first century in the Roman Empire.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.620]   And it's clear from the way 1 Peter 2, 18 to 25
[00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.020]   talks about these slaves is that for them,
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:19.500]   it was often terrible.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.940]   They were mistreated, and Peter was helping them
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:25.300]   to know what to do about that.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.060]   It was not an enjoyable vocation by and large.
[00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.580]   To be sure, in 1 Corinthians 7, 21,
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.060]   Paul says that if a slave can obtain his freedom,
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.260]   he should do so, which shows that Paul did not consider it
[00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.780]   ideal that we labor in a role that's miserable.
[00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.580]   Nevertheless, the main counsel that Paul and Peter
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.380]   gave to slaves and to the rest of us
[00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.460]   in 1 Corinthians 7, 24 is this.
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.460]   So brothers, in whatever condition each was called,
[00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.060]   let him there remain with God.
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.300]   And the key words are with God.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.700]   In other words, whatever work we have,
[00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:13.140]   the greatest joy about the job is that we get to be there
[00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.820]   with God, he's come to us, he's with us every day.
[00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.320]   Whatever we're doing, he's there, he'll help us,
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.940]   he'll turn it for our good.
[00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:23.980]   One last observation.
[00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:28.980]   Those of us in the prosperous West should keep in mind
[00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.660]   that one of the most surprising features of our culture,
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.820]   which visitors from the two-thirds world
[00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.300]   are amazed at when they come,
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.220]   is the stunning number of choices we have.
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.700]   Choices in hundreds of kinds of cereals and fruits
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.620]   and vegetables and cars and houses and theaters
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:52.440]   and every manner of appliance and device.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.220]   And we tend to take all these choices for granted.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.980]   Most places in the world, people do not have 100 possibilities
[00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.380]   in front of them for how to make a living.
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.380]   They may have one or two or three options,
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.660]   given their village and the family they're in
[00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.300]   and the society they're in, and therefore the question
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.220]   that was asked represents a very Western question.
[00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.180]   And so I return to my original reconstruction
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:27.220]   of the question, which I think applies globally.
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:33.400]   Would God ever call a person to a lifelong work
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.760]   in which he does not enable the person to have joy?
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.920]   And I think the answer to that is this.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.800]   God intends to give his people joy and thankfulness
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:51.600]   and a sense of usefulness, whatever he calls them to.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.600]   Paul knew how to be content in every circumstance.
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:00.160]   This is the essence of the Christian life,
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.560]   finding contentment in Christ and turning every circumstance
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.040]   in all of our work into living worship.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.680]   Yeah, such a helpful perspective, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.520]   We must get that question right.
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.140]   Thank you, Joshua, for prompting this discussion
[00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:16.160]   in the first place.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.200]   And Monday we're gonna talk about spiritual leadership
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:21.040]   in the home.
[00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.660]   What does it look like for a husband to lead his wife
[00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.720]   and family well?
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.400]   And as we break for the weekend,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.040]   be sure to check out our podcast homepage
