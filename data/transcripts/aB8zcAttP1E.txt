[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   The following is a conversation with Commander David Fravor,
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.760]   who was a Navy pilot for 18 years
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.860]   and commander of the Strike Fighter Squadron 41,
[00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:11.400]   also known as the Black Aces,
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.240]   a squadron of 12 airplanes consisting of several hundred people.
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.640]   He's also famously one of the people who, with his own eyes,
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.520]   saw and chased a UFO,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.860]   an identified flying object in 2004
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:28.940]   that is referred to as the Tic Tac,
[00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.000]   and the incident more formally referred to as
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.040]   the USS Nimitz UFO incident.
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.540]   His story, corroborated by several other pilots,
[00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.220]   from my perspective as a curious scientist and an open-minded human being,
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.140]   is the most credible sighting of a UFO in history,
[00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.260]   at least that I'm aware of.
[00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.520]   He's a humble, fascinating, and fun human being to talk to.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.800]   I put out a call for questions on Reddit and many other places,
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:00.980]   and tried to ask as many of the questions that people posted as I could.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.820]   And overall, I really enjoyed this conversation,
[00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.280]   and I'm sure if the world wants us to,
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.400]   and if there's more questions to be had,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.660]   we'll talk on this podcast again.
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.120]   Quick summary of the sponsors.
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.960]   Athletic Greens, ExpressVPN, and BetterHelp.
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.920]   Please check out the sponsors in the description
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.540]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.680]   As a side note, let me say that the world of UFOs and UAPs,
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.140]   unidentified aerial phenomena, and aliens in general,
[00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.820]   is foreign to me because of the high ratio
[00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.720]   of outlandish conspiracy theorists to actual hard evidence.
[00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.460]   I'm a scientist first and foremost, but an open-minded one,
[00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.020]   often looking and thinking outside the box.
[00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.460]   I'm often disheartened by the closed-mindedness
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.300]   of the scientific community.
[00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.380]   And in equal part, I'm disheartened by the lack of rigor
[00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.900]   and basic scientific inquiry and study
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.780]   on the part of the conspiracy theorists.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.540]   I believe there's a line somewhere between the two extremes
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.900]   that more inquisitive minds should walk.
[00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.940]   I think we humans know very little about our world,
[00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.580]   what's up there among the stars, and the nature of reality,
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.180]   and the nature of our very own minds.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.560]   The path to understanding can only be walked humbly.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.980]   The very idea that there's a possibility
[00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.780]   that David witnessed a piece of technology,
[00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.180]   whether human-made or alien-made,
[00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.920]   that moved in the way it did,
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.140]   should be inspiring to every scientist
[00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.100]   and engineer on this Earth.
[00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.260]   There may be propulsion and energy systems
[00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.980]   yet to be discovered that, once understood and mastered,
[00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.220]   will put distant galaxies within reach of us human beings.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.500]   Paradigm shifts in science and leaps in understanding
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.580]   can only happen, I think, if we open our eyes
[00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.860]   and allow ourselves to dream,
[00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.740]   to think from first principles,
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.740]   and remove the constraints and innovation placed on us
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.900]   by the scientific conventions and assumptions
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.420]   of prior generations.
[00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.740]   If you enjoy this thing, subscribe on YouTube,

[00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.300]   As usual, I'll do a few minutes of ads now,
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.020]   and no ads in the middle.
[00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:16.380]   More and more, I'm trying to make these ad reads
[00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.340]   unique and interesting, and less adsy, more personal,
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.660]   but I give you timestamps so you can skip.
[00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.700]   But still, please do check out the sponsors

[00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.100]   It is honestly the best way to support this podcast.
[00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.900]   This show is brought to you by Athletic Greens,
[00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.340]   the all-in-one daily drink
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.340]   to support health and performance.
[00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.740]   I drink it every day to make sure I'm not missing
[00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.680]   any of the nutrition I need.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.640]   Now, let me take a hard left turn and talk about fasting.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.540]   I fast often, sometimes intermittent fasting of 16 hours
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.940]   and then an eight-hour eating period of two meals,
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:57.100]   sometimes 24 hours, that's one dinner to the next.
[00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.500]   I've been even considering doing a 48 or 72-hour fast
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.820]   that some people I look up to have done.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.620]   People who have done it tell me that outside of weight loss
[00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.660]   and the different health benefits,
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.300]   it's a chance to meditate on the finiteness of life.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.860]   Not eating somehow is a reminder that we're immortal,
[00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.900]   that every day is precious.
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.140]   I certainly experienced this with a 24-hour fast
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.460]   and I think it goes even deeper for the 48, 72
[00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.220]   and even week-long fast.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.380]   Anyway, I always break my fast with Athletic Greens.
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.980]   It's delicious, refreshing, just makes me feel good.
[00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.740]   So go to athleticgreens.com/lex to claim a special offer
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.100]   of free vitamin D for a year.
[00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.620]   Again, go to athleticgreens.com/lex to get free stuff
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.500]   and to support this podcast.
[00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.900]   This show is also sponsored by ExpressVPN.
[00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.300]   Get it at expressvpn.com/lexpod to get a discount.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.380]   You probably know there's a show called "The Office"
[00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.460]   that I fell in love with,
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.180]   first with the British version with Ricky Gervais
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.060]   and then the American version with Steve Carell.
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.500]   ExpressVPN lets you pretend your location
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:05.700]   is somewhere else,
[00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.220]   choosing from nearly 100 different countries
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.820]   and then watch one of the nine totally different
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:14.100]   other versions of "The Office" in other countries.
[00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.120]   Also, it protects you when you do shady things
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.340]   on the internet that you shouldn't be doing,
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.140]   like checking the website of this very podcast
[00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.700]   that for some reason was not available in Russia
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.220]   for a long time, not sure if it still is,
[00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.060]   but if it isn't, you can use ExpressVPN to access it.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.820]   I think of ExpressVPN like a pirate ship
[00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:37.340]   and regular VPN free life as a boring cruise
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.920]   from one place to another with no excitement in between.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.020]   Choose wisely, my friends.
[00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.220]   Again, get it on any device at expressvpn.com/flexpod
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.680]   to get an extra three months free
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.560]   and to support this podcast.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:56.260]   This show is sponsored by BetterHelp, spelled H-E-L-P, help.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.380]   Like you would try to spell if you were on a deserted island
[00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:01.960]   and trying to get an airplane to notice you.

[00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:06.100]   They figure out what you need
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.220]   and match you with a licensed professional therapist
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.060]   in under 48 hours.
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.140]   You can communicate by text anytime
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.660]   and schedule weekly audio and video sessions.
[00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.620]   Now, hard left turn, let me talk about desert islands.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.740]   Whatever you think of it,
[00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.220]   I love the movie "Cast Away" with Tom Hanks
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.220]   and the idea of spending time on an island alone
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.100]   with potentially no hope.
[00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:29.320]   The natural question is, if I could,
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:31.620]   what would I bring to this island?
[00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.980]   The answer is complicated, but let me pick one thing.
[00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.460]   The first thing that popped into my crazy mind,
[00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:39.820]   which is the "Introduction to Algorithms" book,
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.620]   also called CLRS for the first letters
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:44.880]   of the last name of its four authors.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:47.100]   I find algorithms beautiful,
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.500]   like a little toolbox for a simple world inside computers
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.100]   when the real world outside is an impossible chaotic mess.
[00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:57.700]   I would love pondering the puzzles in that book for months,
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:00.020]   far away from human civilization.
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:03.860]   Anyway, check out BetterHelp at betterhelp.com/flex
[00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:07.780]   to get a discount and to support this podcast.
[00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.560]   And now, finally, here's my conversation with David Fravor.
[00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.020]   - You're a graduate of the Navy Fighter Weapons School.
[00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:18.860]   - Yeah, I am.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:20.580]   - Better known as Top Gun.
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.420]   - Yeah.
[00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:23.620]   - Let me ask the most ridiculous question.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:26.100]   How realistic is the movie "Top Gun"?
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.220]   - So it's funny, we used to joke,
[00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.620]   and a friend of mine who was a Top Gun instructor said this.
[00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.980]   There's two things in the original "Top Gun" that are true,
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:36.100]   that are very realistic.
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.380]   One, there is a place called Top Gun.
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.680]   And number two is they do fly airplanes there.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.020]   (Dave laughs)
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.400]   Other than that, I went through in '97, class 497,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:51.140]   and there's actually a log of every single person
[00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:53.900]   that's went through, kind of like SEAL training.
[00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:54.740]   There's a list.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.540]   So people, 'cause there's a lot of posers out there,
[00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.060]   oh, I was a Navy SEAL.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:58.900]   No, you weren't.
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:07:59.720]   Well, I went to Top Gun.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.860]   You can actually go to Top Gun.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.020]   And matter of fact, just to get a Top Gun patch,
[00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:06.000]   the real patch, you have to have gone there.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.500]   So a lot of the patches you see running around are not real.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:13.140]   The real ones are controlled,
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.020]   the people that make 'em honor that.
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.820]   And when you go in, they look up your name.
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:19.340]   If you wanna get one, they look up your name.
[00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:20.500]   You just tell 'em, they go, "Okay, here."
[00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.340]   And they'll sell 'em to you.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.500]   If you are not on the list, you ain't getting no patch.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:27.780]   Because it is, it's a pretty big deal to go through.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:32.100]   But it's, for me, probably one of the best experiences
[00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:36.060]   of flying, because everyone there is extremely competent.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:38.140]   It's very, very challenging.
[00:08:38.140 --> 00:08:41.460]   But it's what we all signed up to do.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:45.940]   So it's just the entire group that is,
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.200]   when you wanna be that level,
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.180]   where you go, everyone really cares,
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:53.220]   and everyone really wants to be good.
[00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.860]   - Is it competitive, like in the movie?
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.300]   - No, it's, when you go through, it's,
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:01.660]   if anything, it's more of the students,
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.180]   and then there's the instructor side.
[00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.700]   And the instructor sides are really,
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:06.460]   they're guys that you know.
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.060]   They just chose to stay up in Fallon.
[00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:12.100]   And it's extremely difficult job,
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:17.100]   because they have a very small tolerance for not being good.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:22.380]   So they're briefs, the guys, when they give a lecture.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:25.200]   So let's just say there's a fighter employment lecture,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.200]   which is one of the hardest ones.
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:27.060]   It takes about two days
[00:09:27.060 --> 00:09:29.000]   to give the fighter employment lecture.
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.580]   The guy who gives the lecture goes through multiple,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.500]   they call them murder boards,
[00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:36.140]   where he's scrutinized by his peers, and he practices.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:39.220]   By the time they actually stand in front of a class,
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:43.420]   they pretty much have their 250 PowerPoint slides memorized,
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:44.580]   and they don't even turn around.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.660]   They just click, and they know them in order.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:48.940]   And they repeat the same thing over.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:50.640]   And it's standardized.
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.860]   So they are extremely, extremely standardized
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:53.700]   when you go through the school,
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:54.940]   and there's a reason for that.
[00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.460]   Because what they're doing is they're training.
[00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.580]   So when you come out of Top Gun,
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:09:59.980]   you're called a Strike Fighter Weapons
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:01.460]   and Tactics Instructor, okay?
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.800]   So you're SFTI.
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.780]   When you come out of that,
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.440]   your job is to go usually to one of the weapons schools
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.980]   on the East or West Coast and train the fleet squadrons,
[00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:12.100]   and then you visit the squadrons and train
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.400]   and do upgrade rides and all that.
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:18.400]   So there's a reason that they're extremely particular
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.380]   when you go through the course.
[00:10:20.380 --> 00:10:21.980]   It is literally one of the best things,
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.700]   and it's not a rank-based thing,
[00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:25.400]   'cause think, oh, Navy.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.440]   You can come in as an '04 Lieutenant Commander.
[00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:32.200]   The lieutenants, the hierarchy,
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.360]   or at least to be, I don't know how it is exactly today,
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:36.240]   but I imagine it's the same.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:39.220]   The hierarchy is actually based on seniority at the school,
[00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:40.380]   not necessarily rank.
[00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.520]   So when the tactical decisions are made,
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.780]   which are based on fact and trying things out
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.040]   in the Fallon ranges,
[00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:50.480]   they set the top X number of folks
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.400]   that have been there seniority-wise,
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.280]   and I mean time-wise,
[00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.400]   are the ones that actually make the decision.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:58.160]   And when the door, you may not agree,
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:01.400]   but when the door opens and everyone comes out
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.600]   from the staff, they all speak the same language.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.000]   And it has to be that way,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.440]   which is why the school has been so effective
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.040]   since it was founded.
[00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.080]   So it's just a, it's an incredible group of individuals.
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.160]   - So there's a bar of excellence
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:20.760]   that the instructors demand.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.680]   - Oh, very much so, and they're held to it.
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.480]   So it's not a, "Hey, I'm now an instructor,
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.200]   "so I can do what I want."
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:27.220]   There is a standard,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.880]   and they have to live up to that standard.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.700]   They have to, and I mean every moment of every day.
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.200]   So if they go someplace, if they go from Fallon
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:37.020]   and they come down and do,
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.560]   they're called site visits where they come down
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:39.880]   and they'll come to Lemoore, California,
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:41.160]   which is where the West Coast Fighter Wing
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.680]   is at for the Navy,
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:44.560]   and they go around and start flying sorties
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.000]   with the fleet squadrons
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.840]   to kind of pass on some of that knowledge,
[00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:51.160]   that's that same high level of standard.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.400]   They can't just drop your guard
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:55.160]   because you wear the Top Gun patch,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.000]   and people know that.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.120]   And they wear light blue shirts,
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:00.080]   so it's pretty easy to identify them when they're out there.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.160]   And then everyone else who's been through the school,
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:03.980]   including them, have the patch on their sleeve.
[00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.520]   So there's a standard that's expected
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.000]   when you come out of there.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:09.940]   - So you were a Navy pilot for 18 years.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:11.000]   - Yes.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.020]   - Can you briefly tell the story of your career as a pilot?
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:16.600]   - Yeah.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:19.920]   So first I was enlisted, I was a Marine.
[00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:25.160]   And then the Marines actually sent me,
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.440]   recommended me to go to the Naval Academy.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:29.080]   So it's always better to be lucky than good,
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.840]   but I got to go to the Naval Academy and I finished.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:34.440]   And I had that dream to fly, so when I got selected--
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:35.880]   - They've always dreamed of flying.
[00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.600]   - Yeah, since 1969 when I watched Neil Armstrong
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.240]   walk on the moon.
[00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:43.360]   I was, at that point I asked my mom,
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.120]   I remember watching it, I was just prior to being five.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.640]   And I said, "Wow, yeah, it's so cool, Mom."
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:53.160]   And she said, "Well, you know, they were all pilots."
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.400]   And then at that point it was like, "I'm gonna be a pilot."
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.920]   And if you knew me growing up,
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:00.440]   'cause I was a little bit of a delinquent,
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.720]   people are just like, "Yeah, right."
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.720]   I used to joke, "I'm gonna fly jets
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:06.080]   "and I'm gonna drop bombs."
[00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:08.560]   Then, and if people that knew me when I was a kid,
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.400]   they'd be like, "Yeah."
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.580]   And they'd be like, "Not a chance."
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:13.800]   And then when I did, I actually had a,
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.560]   it's a funny story and I'll get to it,
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.960]   I'll finish my career, but I was at my cousin's wedding
[00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.160]   and we all grew up in the same neighborhood.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.560]   We kind of, they had Italian side of the family,
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.400]   that's how we grew up.
[00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:26.520]   So it was my house right down the street,
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:27.680]   it was my cousin Chad,
[00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:29.240]   and then right around the corner is my cousin Ray
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:31.280]   and my aunts and uncles and stuff.
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:32.120]   The guy two doors down from my,
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:33.400]   and I was a paper boy in the neighborhood,
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.520]   so they all knew me.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.440]   And I went to my cousin's wedding
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.640]   and Mr. Race looks at me and he says, "David Fravor."
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:42.080]   I go, "Mr. Race, how you doing?"
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.820]   He goes, "You fly jets, top gun and all that."
[00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.520]   I go, "Yes, sir."
[00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.480]   He goes, "Man, I figured you'd be in jail by now."
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.960]   (laughing)
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:51.800]   And it was kind of a,
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:53.720]   to me it was a little bit of a badge of honor going on.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:55.640]   I kind of overcame that, but--
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.080]   - What do you attribute that to?
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.740]   So you, I've heard you before and just now say
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.840]   that it's better to be lucky than good.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:07.840]   And you talk modestly about just being lucky,
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:13.040]   but if you were to describe your trajectory,
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.940]   maybe in a way of advice, like retrospectively,
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:21.940]   how'd you pull it off to be truly a special person?
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:26.540]   - The easiest way is one, never take no.
[00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:29.220]   Don't let anyone put you down and say you can't do it.
[00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.700]   I mean, I knew what I was capable of inside,
[00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.800]   and if I really believe if you want something
[00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:39.340]   and you want to do something, then you can achieve it.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:42.780]   Not in all cases, like if I loved basketball
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.940]   and I really wanted to be in the NBA,
[00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.540]   there's a realism that says I'm five foot eight
[00:14:47.540 --> 00:14:49.180]   and I got like a really short vertical leap,
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:50.380]   and I'm really not that good at basketball,
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:51.500]   it's probably not ever gonna happen
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:53.300]   no matter how hard I try and practice.
[00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:54.260]   It's just the way it is.
[00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:57.940]   Or for me to be in the NFL, I'm not fast,
[00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:02.060]   I'm not that big, it's just physically,
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.340]   I'm incapable of doing that.
[00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:06.380]   But there's things that don't really tie
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:09.860]   to a true physical ability as far as size and strength,
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:14.420]   but it's mental, and I'm not saying you have to be a genius
[00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.060]   and super smart to be a fighter pilot.
[00:15:16.060 --> 00:15:17.340]   Matter of fact, you don't.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:21.000]   It really comes down to the ability to think very quickly.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.960]   80% solution is typically good enough,
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:26.380]   'cause if you overthink it, you're behind.
[00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:28.900]   And in an air-to-air fight, that's what happens.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.260]   People try and overthink it, and before you know it,
[00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.620]   because it's happening so fast,
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.820]   you can't get to the nth degree, six decimal places.
[00:15:36.820 --> 00:15:38.100]   80% solution's good enough.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.860]   - You build up a really strong gut for the 80% solution.
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.740]   - Yeah, I'm a big believer in the 80% solution.
[00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:43.580]   - I love that.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:45.660]   - If you get 80%, you can go,
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.060]   and then you can always adjust,
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:50.020]   which is exactly what, if you're fighting in BFM,
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.120]   the 80% solution is.
[00:15:51.120 --> 00:15:51.960]   It's like a chess game,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.660]   but it's a really, really fast chess game where you go,
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:57.980]   I'm doing this, and then I know that if I do a maneuver,
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:01.240]   if he's gonna counter it correctly, he should do A.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.140]   If he doesn't do A, he does some degree less, like B, C, D,
[00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.780]   and then I know how bad his error is, and then I capitalize.
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:11.700]   So I don't have to be perfect.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.500]   I don't have to go, I need to go to 47 degrees nose high.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.700]   If I just kinda get above 40, then I'm good,
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:17.780]   and I can watch how he reacts,
[00:16:17.780 --> 00:16:19.100]   and then I can adjust for that.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.860]   And you continually work that problem, and you chip away,
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.340]   'cause if you start neutral,
[00:16:24.340 --> 00:16:25.700]   you're just basically chipping away
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:27.300]   and gaining advantage, advantage, advantage,
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:31.700]   'til eventually, and if you're really fighting
[00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.100]   just guns only rear quarter,
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.580]   where you gotta get behind the guy,
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.680]   kinda World War II dogfighting type stuff,
[00:16:37.740 --> 00:16:42.380]   then it's literally, it's a very, very fast chess game
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:46.300]   that happens at 400 knots, 300 knots, depends.
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:48.940]   - So to get to be one of the rear individuals
[00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:53.940]   that are able to do that, he just had the dream
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:55.980]   and didn't take no for an answer.
[00:16:55.980 --> 00:16:59.400]   - Well, part of it is family.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.920]   My dad was, I used to call him a fire-ready aim guy.
[00:17:03.920 --> 00:17:07.420]   He'd smack me and then ask me what I did wrong.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.700]   (laughs)
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:10.140]   - Good parenting.
[00:17:10.140 --> 00:17:12.500]   - Back then, I joke, and people look,
[00:17:12.500 --> 00:17:14.220]   'cause at times it was kinda tough,
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.660]   'cause he can be pretty demanding,
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.200]   but on the other side, I probably needed
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:20.900]   to be reined in a little bit at times.
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.660]   But then everyone else in my family,
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:24.960]   my mom was really awesome when I was a kid.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.640]   My grandfather, who is a big, big part of it,
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:34.020]   my mom's dad, who, he taught me a lot,
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:37.220]   and you have a question there that we'll talk about him,
[00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.900]   but huge, huge influence, very, very positive.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:43.020]   And a lot of the stuff that I do today
[00:17:43.020 --> 00:17:46.540]   and decisions are based on things that he taught me.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:52.020]   And I figured, it was the first funeral I ever went to,
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.020]   and it was about three miles long,
[00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.420]   and church was overfilling, and people were out.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:18:00.140]   He was a beer delivery guy, dead serious.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:02.380]   And you go, someone asked who died, the Pope?
[00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:05.340]   - So a lot of people loved him.
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:07.820]   So back to my career, to your first question,
[00:18:07.820 --> 00:18:10.340]   'cause I'm getting down a rabbit hole.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:13.100]   No, when I was at the, I was gonna stay in the Marines.
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.380]   I really wanted to go, man, I love the Corps.
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:18.980]   I think it's, of all services, it's that one.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:21.240]   Everything is in a ball, and they're very, very professional,
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.860]   and it was a great, great organization to join.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:29.100]   But I went out to the Nimitz on my freshman cruise.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.780]   After your freshman year at the Naval Academy,
[00:18:30.780 --> 00:18:33.060]   you go out on a ship, and you're an enlisted person.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:34.980]   You get to experience that half an hour.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.500]   He was enlisted, so it was fine with me.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.620]   - Because it comes up a lot.
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.020]   Do you mind saying what the Nimitz is, what a ship is?
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:43.500]   - Yeah, so Nimitz is an aircraft carrier.
[00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.820]   So it's four and a half acres of sovereign US territory
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:48.260]   that floats around the US oceans.
[00:18:48.260 --> 00:18:49.380]   - Is it a giant thing?
[00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:51.380]   Does it have weapons on it?
[00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:52.740]   - The air wing is really the weapons.
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:55.180]   It does have defensive weapons, but for the most part,
[00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:58.720]   it's a giant moving airport, is what it is.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.180]   So I was out there watching the airplanes land and take off,
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:04.020]   and I'm like, "Oh."
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.180]   And the squadrons that were out there,
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:08.020]   one of the squadrons was a VF-41 and a 14 squadron,
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.580]   VF-84 and a 14 squadron, and then a couple of A6 squadrons.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:14.300]   And we actually ended up pairing up
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.340]   and hanging out with some of the A6 pilots and BNs,
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:17.660]   so it was really a neat experience.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:20.660]   And I said, "I wanna do that."
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.460]   And the way to do it was to not to go in the Navy,
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.220]   because there are Marine squadrons
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:26.580]   that go out to the aircraft carriers,
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:29.660]   but most of them are land-based to support the Marines,
[00:19:29.660 --> 00:19:32.820]   'cause they're that unit, that whole unit.
[00:19:32.820 --> 00:19:35.260]   The Marine Corps is that one service that has it all.
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:39.380]   And so when I graduated and I got to,
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:44.140]   I worked hard through primary, and that's where I knew Missy.
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.660]   We were in, actually went through together.
[00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:46.940]   - Missy Cummings. - Missy Cummings.
[00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:48.180]   We went through primary together,
[00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:50.100]   and then I went to Kingsville.
[00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:51.260]   We all selected the same time.
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.180]   I went to Kingsville.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.540]   There was another guy, Scott Wiedemeier, the three of us.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.100]   So I went to Kingsville, Scott went to Beeville,
[00:19:58.100 --> 00:20:00.060]   and Missy went to Meridian.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.100]   So the three of us that we had all went through,
[00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:04.100]   we got, we selected out of primary together.
[00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:05.860]   We all ended up going jets.
[00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:07.660]   And that's how, besides from school,
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:08.980]   I knew her at school too.
[00:20:08.980 --> 00:20:11.380]   Long story, I got done, got winged.
[00:20:11.380 --> 00:20:12.540]   It took me two years to the day
[00:20:12.540 --> 00:20:14.300]   from the time I graduated the Naval Academy
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:15.900]   until I got my wings.
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:20.660]   And through some luck, I ended up getting A6s
[00:20:20.660 --> 00:20:23.300]   on the West Coast, which is a side-by-side bomber.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:24.700]   So it's a pilot on the left seat
[00:20:24.700 --> 00:20:26.340]   and the bombardier navigators on the right seat.
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.220]   It was built in the '60s.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.380]   It is all weather and it flies low at night.
[00:20:31.380 --> 00:20:33.180]   It's got a terrain mapping radar.
[00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:36.580]   - How many, I guess, is that a good term to use,
[00:20:36.580 --> 00:20:39.740]   fighter jet, as a broad category for the public?
[00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.580]   - Yeah, that's fine.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.300]   - How many fighter jets are side-by-side like that?
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:45.860]   - That was, in the Navy, that was the only one.
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:48.780]   The Air Force, the F-111 was a side-by-side,
[00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:50.260]   but the Navy, it was the A6.
[00:20:50.260 --> 00:20:53.460]   And then there's the EA6B, which is a derivative of that.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:54.660]   Now those are all gone.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:56.540]   The EA6Bs just went away a few years ago.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:21:01.540]   And now the E18G Growler is the replacement for the EA6B.
[00:21:01.540 --> 00:21:04.820]   There was never a replacement for the A6 that I flew.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.740]   It really became the F-18,
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.540]   which the A6 could go quite a bit further distance-wise
[00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.780]   by fuel than the Hornet.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:16.020]   - The Hornet is the F-18. - The F-18, yeah.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.580]   - Is there usually two people in the plane,
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:21.460]   but they're usually in front and behind?
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:23.180]   - The modern two-seaters, yes.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.100]   But most of the tactical airplanes
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:26.740]   in the world today are single-seat.
[00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:27.940]   - Single-seat, just one person?
[00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:30.420]   - One person, with the exception of,
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:31.540]   I'll probably, someone will yell at me,
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.900]   but really with the exception of the F-15E Strike Eagle
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:38.580]   and the F-18F Super Hornet, which is the F is a two-seater,
[00:21:38.580 --> 00:21:40.060]   and the G is also a two-seater,
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:41.620]   but it's more of an electronic attack
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:44.300]   by say, full-up fighter, bomber.
[00:21:44.300 --> 00:21:48.900]   - So most of the time that you've flown in your,
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:51.980]   like I said, 18-year career, was it two-seater?
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:53.420]   - No, it was about half and half.
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:55.820]   So I started off in A6, was a two-seater,
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:57.900]   then I went to single-seat F-18s,
[00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.900]   and I flew those all the way up until 2000 and,
[00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.660]   let me think, 2001, to the end of 2001.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.020]   And then I shifted over and started flying the Super Hornets
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.980]   and I've flown both of those, the Es and the S.
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.500]   But I deployed when I had command of VFA-41,
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:17.940]   I had the two-seat, they were F squadron.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:22.220]   - So you eventually ended up commanding
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:24.960]   the strike fighter Squadron 41.
[00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.300]   I love the name, the Black Aces.
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:34.500]   Is there some parts of that journey that are amazing,
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.900]   parts of it that are tough, that kind of stand out?
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:39.440]   - To me, one, it was a huge honor,
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.420]   and I got to serve with, you know,
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:44.820]   I got pulled up because the guy,
[00:22:44.820 --> 00:22:46.500]   the people that are XOs, 'cause we fleet up,
[00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:48.900]   we go from the number two guy to the number one guy.
[00:22:48.900 --> 00:22:50.300]   So the XO becomes the CO,
[00:22:50.300 --> 00:22:53.060]   so the executive officer becomes the commanding officer.
[00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:58.060]   So I had worked with, now soon to be Vice Admiral Weitzel,
[00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:01.240]   was the, he was Commander Weitzel at the time,
[00:23:01.240 --> 00:23:03.460]   was the XO, and he really wanted,
[00:23:03.460 --> 00:23:06.020]   because he knew there was a little bit of a problem
[00:23:06.020 --> 00:23:08.420]   when the Super Hornets came into L'Amour.
[00:23:08.420 --> 00:23:12.060]   L'Amour had been a single-seat fighter community
[00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.980]   since the forever.
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.220]   And now all of a sudden you've got the F-18F coming in,
[00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:21.100]   which has the weapons systems operators in the back
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:23.380]   that are not pilots, they're weapons systems operators,
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:24.900]   and there's a difference.
[00:23:24.900 --> 00:23:27.300]   And Kenny is a weapons systems operator.
[00:23:27.300 --> 00:23:31.380]   And Kenny knew because of my A6 background
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:34.100]   that I have a switch that I can go one seat, two seat,
[00:23:34.100 --> 00:23:36.460]   one seat, two seat, because when you fly two seat,
[00:23:36.460 --> 00:23:39.380]   there's a lot of stuff that the pilot will offload
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.580]   and take the advantage of the weapons systems operator.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:44.700]   And it's not that one plus one equals two
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.940]   in that environment, 'cause it really,
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:48.500]   there's a huge amount of capabilities
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:50.380]   that the single seat has and the autonomy
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:53.340]   that comes for the ability to make decisions quickly
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:55.040]   and how well the airplane flies.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:58.500]   But it does equal more than one.
[00:23:58.500 --> 00:24:01.380]   And I would say that one plus one with two people
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:05.900]   is a minimum of 1.5, because you've got an extra head,
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.300]   you've got extra eyes,
[00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.380]   you've got someone that can monitor systems,
[00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.160]   the airplanes can do two things at once.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:12.980]   I mean, there's an incredible amount of capability
[00:24:12.980 --> 00:24:14.820]   that we add when we do that.
[00:24:14.820 --> 00:24:16.780]   - Can we just pause on that just for me,
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:18.660]   from a human factors perspective
[00:24:18.660 --> 00:24:20.380]   and also an AI perspective,
[00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:26.380]   how difficult, so there's like, when there's two people,
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:31.000]   there's also a third person that's the AI part,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.340]   there's some level of automation,
[00:24:32.340 --> 00:24:33.980]   like autopilot maybe even.
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:37.740]   Maybe you can kind of talk about the psychology of like,
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:41.940]   you said making decisions really quick, 80%.
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:46.220]   How do you deal with another brain working with you?
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:48.460]   And then also the automation.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:51.860]   Is there an interesting interplay that you get to learn?
[00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:54.620]   And also as that changed throughout your career,
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.140]   I imagine it gotten better in terms of the automation
[00:24:58.140 --> 00:24:59.620]   or perhaps not?
[00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:01.060]   - Well, I can tell you, so let's--
[00:25:01.060 --> 00:25:01.900]   - Sorry, there's a bunch of questions in there.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.740]   - No, this is good, this is good.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.460]   And I'm enjoying this because now we actually get
[00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:09.460]   to talk about something other than a tic-tac.
[00:25:09.460 --> 00:25:10.700]   So let's start with the A6.
[00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.900]   The A6 was really an analog airplane
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.340]   that was built in the '60s, all right?
[00:25:16.340 --> 00:25:20.140]   And there's been studies done on the crew coordination,
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.940]   which is the interaction between the pilot
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:23.580]   and the bombardier navigator.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:26.540]   So we would fly low at night in the mountains.
[00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.860]   So I was stationed up in Whidbey Island, Washington.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:33.080]   So you've got the Cascades and incredible amount of time.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.840]   And we would get in the simulators because unlike,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.460]   normally people think terrain following
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:39.340]   and there's the radars, the 111, the B1
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.140]   has a system like this, but it'll,
[00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.420]   the radar can see and it'll fly,
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:43.620]   it basically flies a straight line.
[00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:45.340]   So it goes up and over mountains and back down
[00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:48.640]   and up and over mountains where the A6 was really manual.
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:52.020]   So you do this low level routes where you're gonna fly
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.420]   in the mountains at night, you're gonna be at,
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.260]   you know, 500 to a thousand feet above the ground,
[00:25:56.260 --> 00:25:58.700]   ripping through like fog layers
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.060]   'cause you don't need to see outside.
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.940]   You're literally flying a little TV screen and a radar.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:04.300]   - What are you looking at most of the time?
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.540]   So you just as a screen?
[00:26:05.540 --> 00:26:07.220]   - It's this really primitive,
[00:26:08.100 --> 00:26:09.400]   if you look at it now what we did,
[00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.780]   you'd think, wow, that was crazy, but it was really fun.
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.100]   - Is it similar to like the FLIR stuff?
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.140]   Is that, is-- - No.
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.740]   This thing is totally radar based.
[00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:19.180]   Now the airplane had a FLIR ball,
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:21.380]   it's a target recognition and multi-sensor,
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:22.380]   it was called a tram.
[00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:25.100]   - So you're looking at like basically
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.260]   like dots of hard objects.
[00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.140]   - No, actually what it is is the bombardier navigator
[00:26:30.140 --> 00:26:32.000]   had a radar and he was getting raw feed
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.740]   off of a pulse radar in front.
[00:26:33.740 --> 00:26:35.860]   Okay, so it's just basically mapping the mountains.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.940]   So if you look at a mountain on a radar
[00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:39.180]   and you're coming up on it,
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:40.140]   the front side is gonna be,
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.780]   it's gonna give you a really bright return.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:44.480]   And then the backside, it's just gonna be a giant shadow
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:46.480]   because you can't see on the other side.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:49.300]   So the bombardier navigators would do that
[00:26:49.300 --> 00:26:50.300]   and they would have charts
[00:26:50.300 --> 00:26:52.180]   and they could shade their charts knowing that,
[00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.540]   hey, if we turn a little bit left here,
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.660]   we can get in this valley, we can sneak up this valley
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:57.460]   and then go around the backside of the mountain,
[00:26:57.460 --> 00:26:59.100]   which is what the airplane would do.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:00.580]   - And sorry to interrupt,
[00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:03.420]   I'm gonna just keep asking dumb questions, I apologize.
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:06.880]   But the pilot, can you at a high level say
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.120]   what the pilot does versus the bombardier?
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.440]   - Yes, so--
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.320]   - You're actually just controlling.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.160]   - I'm flying the jet.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.360]   I have the throttles, the stick,
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:20.040]   and I have a, it's about a, probably a four inch
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.640]   or six inch wide by maybe four inches, five inches high.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.680]   It looks like, it's literally a CRT.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.120]   That's how old it is.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:29.880]   A CRT screen and what it would do,
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:33.180]   what the radar would do is the bombardier navigator
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:34.160]   is looking at his radar.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.920]   He's looking out about 12 and a half miles
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:37.160]   in front of the airplane.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.000]   So he has the range really scoped down
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.360]   'cause the radar can see a lot further.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.880]   He's looking at about 12 and a half miles
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.200]   when we're in the terrain mode
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.240]   where we're dodging mountains and stuff.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:46.720]   And what the pilot has is there's,
[00:27:46.720 --> 00:27:49.280]   they're called range bins and there's eight of them.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:52.520]   So the very far range bin is the 12 and a half mile,
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:55.920]   you know, and the closest range bin, it's a thing,
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:58.320]   it'll be like between like a half a mile
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:01.560]   and or a quarter mile to three quarters of a mile.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:04.600]   The next one might be three quarters of a mile to two miles.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:06.240]   And then it just keeps going out like that.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.880]   So if there's a mountain in front,
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:09.760]   let's say we're on a flat plane
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.700]   and there's a mountain out in the distance at 15 miles
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.800]   and we're just driving right at it.
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:17.600]   So when we get to the point where it hits 12 and a half miles
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:20.120]   where the radar is going to see it on his scope,
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.840]   my 12th, my range bin for that would pop up
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:25.520]   and it would show like a big bump, like a mountain.
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:27.160]   And then as I got closer to it,
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.360]   the next range bin would pop up and show it.
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:32.200]   And I could see that that bump was moving towards me.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.760]   And then if I turned a little bit, you know,
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.320]   to go over here, I'd see the mountain go over
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.720]   to the right-hand side and I could do that.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.320]   But it wasn't like a video game.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:44.320]   It's literally like, if you think of the original Atari's.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.200]   - Yeah.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.160]   But you build up, I imagine,
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.440]   that you start to get a really deep sense
[00:28:50.440 --> 00:28:54.080]   of like the actual 3D environment
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.960]   based on that little Atari's.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:57.240]   - It's, you're exactly right.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.040]   And you have to train.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.440]   So there's been studies.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:02.280]   As a matter of fact, a lot of the bases,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:04.600]   and people probably argue with me, but it's true.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.840]   There were studies done watching A6 crews in our simulators.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.600]   We call it the WIST, the Weapon Systems Trainer.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.720]   And it was not even a motion.
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:13.560]   It just kind of sat there and you just,
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:15.280]   you could fly these things and they had terrain
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.560]   that they would inject into the system.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.240]   But the crew coordination, so you get,
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.520]   so my first fleet bombardier navigator,
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.240]   who I'll name him, his name's Chris Sato.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:32.360]   He's a, works at Apple, pretty high up, MIT grad.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.600]   I think computer engineering, he's scary smart.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:39.240]   So Chris could really work.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:40.520]   A matter of fact, all the guys that flew us,
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.320]   so there's another guy, Matt, who also worked at Apple,
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:43.240]   who's now at SAP.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.960]   We did our first night traps together.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:47.080]   The bond between us, I mean, it's one of those things
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.680]   that you just, you're never gonna forget.
[00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:50.400]   But Chris and I, when we started flying together,
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.760]   and we were actually the most junior crew in the squadron,
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.080]   we'd spent a lot of time training and Chris was amazing
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.200]   at how he could work the system.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:03.480]   One, because he was extremely brilliant
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:05.240]   and he was, had that inquisitive mind of,
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.760]   oh, we can do all these different things
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.840]   and there's all these degradation modes.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:12.200]   But we spent a lot of time to see
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:14.000]   how good we could actually get.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.680]   Because, and it's, you almost talk in partials.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.720]   So as the BN is looking at his radar scope,
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:22.680]   Chris would say, "I've got rising terrain."
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:23.800]   That's just what they'd say,
[00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.560]   "Showing rising terrain at 12 miles."
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:28.560]   And I'd see the little bump and I'd say, "Got it."
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   This is gonna go to your question on the autonomy
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.160]   and how you work with two heads.
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.840]   So when you first get together, the interaction,
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.320]   it's almost like you have to rehearse it.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.960]   You have to know, and you talk in full sentences.
[00:30:40.960 --> 00:30:44.680]   The more and more we fly together,
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:49.360]   Chris could go, "I'm showing,"
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:50.880]   and he'd get like rising out.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.200]   And before he finished, I'd say, "I've got it."
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:54.920]   So you end up starting to talk in partials
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.880]   because I have to trust him.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:02.440]   Like, I mean, I can have no doubt
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.480]   that he knows how to do his job.
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:06.640]   Because I'm literally looking at this little scope
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   that's not giving me this continuous picture
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:09.480]   of that mountain moving.
[00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.720]   Remember the mountains here,
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:12.120]   and then it's gonna pop up here,
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:13.640]   and then it's gonna pop up here
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.080]   because there's gaps in the coverage
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.280]   on how the system was set up.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.160]   Remember, it's an analog system.
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.600]   To where he is telling me,
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.360]   like, "I can't see all the way to the left."
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.320]   And he's got a wider scope on the radar,
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.620]   but my screen doesn't show that.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.640]   So he's telling me, "Start a left turn."
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.840]   - How to avoid the mountain. - Or start a hard turn.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.720]   And we would do that.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.840]   So my truck-- - And this is all
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.560]   happening quick? - Very quick.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:35.620]   What you're doing, we would typically fly
[00:31:35.620 --> 00:31:38.840]   between 420 and 480 knots of ground speed.
[00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:40.760]   - Which is how many miles an hour?
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:43.520]   - Well, four, 27 miles a minute.
[00:31:43.520 --> 00:31:45.040]   - Okay, seven miles. - Between seven
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.640]   and eight miles a minute is what you're flying.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:47.480]   - That's fast.
[00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:49.360]   - At night, I mean, I broke out of clouds.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.160]   I mean, I remember him and I flying.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.200]   We were on it's IR, it's called an IR route,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.800]   an instrument route that's low.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.200]   They're all around the country.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:59.040]   There's IR-344 that we used to fly,
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.640]   which would coast in off of Oregon,
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.520]   you'd fly from the land,
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.840]   you'd go out over the ocean, turn around,
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.380]   and then you could practice actually coming in
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:05.840]   on a coastline.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:10.160]   And we were flying, and we ended up in the clouds.
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:12.360]   Keep in mind, we're between 500 and 1,000 feet
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.680]   in the mountains, and we're in the clouds.
[00:32:13.680 --> 00:32:14.800]   You can't see anything.
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:16.760]   And I had to turn off our red lights that flash.
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:18.840]   You know, they're called anti-collision lights.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.480]   Because it was reflecting off the clouds,
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.600]   and it starts to bother you.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   Just gets annoying.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:25.800]   So I turned it off, and we were flying,
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:26.640]   we're flying, we're flying.
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.920]   We break out of that coastal marine layer,
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:31.120]   and poof, we break out.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.160]   And it's a decent night.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.560]   And this is right by Mount St. Helens.
[00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:34.480]   This is kind of where we're coming in.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.640]   So we're coming in from the east,
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.040]   and we're just north of Mount St. Helens,
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:38.300]   is where the route goes.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:39.280]   And you look up, you know,
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:40.600]   'cause you can kind of see the silhouette
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:41.920]   of this mountain that's right next to you.
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.380]   But you're flying along, you're just like,
[00:32:43.380 --> 00:32:44.840]   you know, you gotta trust.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:45.960]   And you can see houses.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:47.120]   You can see the lights, they're above you.
[00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:48.760]   We're literally below people's houses,
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:50.040]   flying down these valleys and stuff.
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:51.760]   So just incredible experience.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:55.360]   So when you take that, and then you move into an F-18F.
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:57.680]   So now we're into modern technology
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.680]   that was actually built in this century.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.120]   And you're flying, so now, you know,
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   the Wizzo is behind us.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.440]   And we're not doing those night low levels,
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:07.960]   but that same type of crew coordination
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:09.280]   that has to happen,
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.920]   because what you're doing is, you're sharing the load.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:15.440]   So most of the communications that go out of the airplane,
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:16.560]   the Wizzo does all the talking.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.460]   He's got actually, he uses his feet.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:21.800]   That's the weapon systems operator in the back of an F-18F.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:25.560]   So he's gonna run, well, the radar kind of runs itself now,
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:27.880]   but we have a situational awareness display,
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:29.560]   and it's linked to all the other airplanes.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:30.400]   - Just out of curiosity,
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.160]   what's the situational awareness display?
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.320]   'Cause that term comes up a lot in-
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:35.800]   - Think of it as a God's eye view.
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:38.240]   So if you have a, the back of the Super Hornet has,
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.780]   well, the Block IIs has about an eight by 10 display
[00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.340]   for the Wizzos, that they can look at.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:44.880]   The pilot's is smaller, it's down between his,
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:46.560]   it's a six by six between his legs,
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:49.440]   and they're getting ready to redesign that Boeing is.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.600]   But when you looked, it'd be like if you put your airplane
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:53.540]   and you're looking down.
[00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:56.180]   So all the stuff, like if your radar's seeing bad guys
[00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:57.640]   out in front of you, it'd be like looking down and going,
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.480]   "Oh, I'm right here.
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.260]   "I know there's bad guys out here.
[00:34:00.260 --> 00:34:01.520]   "And my wingman is over here."
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:02.360]   And it shows everything.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:04.040]   It's just like, it gives you,
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:05.360]   you can look at that display and go,
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.160]   "Oh, I can see where everything's at.
[00:34:07.160 --> 00:34:09.880]   "I can see if one guy's trying to target another guy."
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:10.720]   It shows you all this.
[00:34:10.720 --> 00:34:13.480]   It's an incredible amount of knowledge that comes up
[00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:18.480]   for the crews to maintain the overall picture
[00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.960]   of what's going on.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:20.800]   - Big picture sense of what's going on.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.520]   - Because it's happening so fast.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:24.800]   And this is where that autonomy piece,
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.340]   this is the third brain.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.180]   So we're all looking at it,
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:29.380]   and the third brain is doing fusion.
[00:34:29.380 --> 00:34:30.520]   It's pulling stuff together going,
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.040]   "Oh, this is all this guy, this is this guy,
[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:32.880]   "this is this guy."
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.000]   It's sending it out through the link.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.560]   So all the airplanes are talking to each other
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:38.400]   through this digital network that we don't even see.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:41.000]   It just says, that airplane says, "Hey, I'm over here."
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.360]   And it tells us, and we go, "Oh, he's right there."
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:45.640]   And then we can go, his airplane says,
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:47.880]   "Oh, I'm looking at this airplane, this bad guy."
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:49.520]   And it shows us, "Oh, he's over there,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:50.440]   "and he's looking at this guy."
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.320]   I mean, it's an incredible amount of visual intake
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:57.080]   because your eye, you can hear a lot,
[00:34:57.080 --> 00:34:58.240]   but when you look down at stuff,
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:35:00.360]   it's all, you can sell the picture really quick.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   - The third brain is doing the sensor fusion,
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.080]   the integration of the different sensors,
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.580]   and gives you a big picture view.
[00:35:08.580 --> 00:35:09.880]   What about the control?
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.040]   Like, is there, and I apologize,
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.440]   as if this is a dumb question,
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:17.360]   but people use the high-level term of autopilot.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:22.360]   How much is there, let's use a loose term of AI,
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.100]   how much automation is there?
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:27.360]   How much AI is there in helping you control the airplane?
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:29.680]   - The AI piece would be more of a control loop
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:31.480]   because of the digital flight controls.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.680]   So the airplane actually,
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:36.000]   they had to make the airplane easier to fly.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.360]   And when I say easy, it's relative
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:38.360]   'cause people go, "I can do it,"
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.440]   'cause I did it on Flight Sim.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:42.240]   Real life is a lot different.
[00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:44.160]   In Flight Sim, you have no apparent fear of death.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:45.560]   You'll do things in a simulator
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:46.680]   that you would never do in real life.
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:51.680]   But the autonomy in the airplane to allow you to manage,
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:52.760]   I mean, 'cause you think about it,
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:55.660]   you've got a radar that's feeding you data,
[00:35:55.660 --> 00:35:58.000]   you've got a targeting pod that's feeding you data.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.720]   All that stuff is hooked to your head
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:02.040]   because you've got a joint helmet-mounted cueing system on
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:04.820]   that basically maps the magnetic field in the cockpit
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.860]   so it can tell where your head's at looking.
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:08.400]   So if I turn my head to the right,
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.800]   the radar will actually look to the right,
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.760]   the targeting FLIR will look to the right.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:14.760]   And oh, by the way, the back seater has a helmet on too,
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:16.560]   so he can look to the left and he can do things.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:18.800]   So depending on what sensor he's controlling,
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.720]   so if he's got control of the targeting pod
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:24.960]   and he looks left, the targeting pod looks left.
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:27.120]   But if I have something where I wanna lock a guy up
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:28.920]   that I don't see, that maybe the radar didn't see,
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:31.080]   but I can get over and now point the radar,
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:32.680]   'cause it's a phased array radar now,
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.980]   it doesn't really scan.
[00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:36.720]   There's all kinds of cool stuff.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:41.040]   That technology brings, 'cause if you just,
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.600]   if you'd went back 30 years and said,
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.160]   "Hey," or 40 years ago and said,
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.320]   "Hey, we're gonna have this helmet."
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:47.480]   Now you're gonna be able to slew everything to your head.
[00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:49.200]   And I don't mean a mechanical setup,
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:50.880]   but I mean literally you're just gonna map
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:52.560]   magnetic resonance and go, "Oh, look."
[00:36:52.560 --> 00:36:56.960]   And I can literally slew my sensors this fast
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:37:01.240]   and then mash a button and transfer high quality coordinates
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:03.920]   from a system into a joint, a JDAM,
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.000]   which is a joint direct attack munition
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.280]   that is the GPS bombs that you see all the time.
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:09.960]   And then let that thing fly.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:13.680]   And I'm solving this problem in seconds, vice minutes,
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:15.160]   or, "Hey, I got it.
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.720]   "We're gonna have to mensurate coordinates."
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.360]   And you bring back the data
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.680]   and then they do all the targeting for it
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:21.600]   and then they send another group out to get it.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:24.220]   Instead of all that, now it's that fast.
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:25.960]   - So there's a, okay, I mean,
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.160]   we probably don't have enough time to talk about
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:30.200]   the beautiful fusion of minds that happens
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.240]   when two people are flying, controlling the plane.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:37.320]   But at a high level, this is a really interesting question
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:39.600]   for people who don't know what they're talking about,
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:42.800]   like me, which is what is the difference
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.240]   between a human being and an AI system?
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:52.240]   Like what is the ceiling of a current AI technology
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:53.960]   for controlling the plane?
[00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:57.280]   Like how much does the human contribute?
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:00.480]   Is it possible to have automated flight, for example?
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:05.080]   Like what is the hardest part about flying
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:09.280]   that a human does expertly that an AI system cannot?
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:14.280]   In warfare situations, in flying a fighter jet plane.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:20.200]   - So I would say AI systems are usually black and white.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.800]   When you write the algorithm for an AI system,
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:27.000]   basically you're taking thought
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:28.800]   and turning it into a giant math problem
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:30.360]   is really what you're doing, right?
[00:38:30.360 --> 00:38:32.720]   So you've got this logical math problem.
[00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:35.680]   Math problems are, there's a line that says,
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:36.680]   I can or I can't.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.280]   And it's a very finite line, you know,
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:42.480]   but you can go up to the line where a human,
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:46.480]   we all have gray areas where we go, eh, maybe,
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.400]   yeah, I'll try it.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.080]   - So humans can operate within that gray.
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:52.440]   - So if you take an airplane and say,
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:53.680]   and I'll just take a Hornet for a while,
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.880]   a Super Hornet, it doesn't matter, any airplane,
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:58.240]   and you go, here is the flight performance model
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:38:59.080]   of the airplane.
[00:38:59.080 --> 00:39:02.360]   So if you know what an EM diagram is, the energy.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.600]   So it basically says the airplane can fly as slow as this,
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:06.840]   it can go as fast as this,
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.320]   it can pull this many Gs, force of gravity,
[00:39:09.320 --> 00:39:11.920]   you know, so one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.200]   And then based on the airfoil design and everything else
[00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   and how it can pull, here's how it's gonna fly,
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.520]   you know, 'cause it's really physics-based.
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:22.360]   Well, if you, depending on how you write the AI,
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:24.120]   but typically AI, you don't want the airplane
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.920]   to leave controlled flight, right?
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:28.120]   You wanna maintain it so that it is flying
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.640]   in a controlled envelope.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:33.240]   Where there are times, and you can go back to World War I,
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.000]   where people intentionally departed the airplane
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.340]   from controlled flight in order to obtain an advantage,
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.680]   which is, that's where the human goes, can I do this?
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:45.620]   I know it's outside of where I would normally go,
[00:39:45.620 --> 00:39:46.460]   but I can do that.
[00:39:46.460 --> 00:39:48.360]   So you can do some crazy things now,
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.520]   especially since the flight control logic
[00:39:50.520 --> 00:39:53.940]   in modern airplanes with digital flight controls,
[00:39:53.940 --> 00:39:56.240]   they're extremely forgiving.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.640]   So you can literally, I've done things in Super Hornets
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:03.320]   that literally, even as a pilot inside the airplane,
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:05.720]   you're just like, wow, I cannot believe it just did that.
[00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:09.160]   Like, it'll flop ends, which defies most logic.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:12.000]   And I guess, in a way, you could probably program it,
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:14.680]   but I still think when you get to the edges
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.160]   that may or may not give you an advantage,
[00:40:17.160 --> 00:40:23.120]   there are things that a human will do that AI won't.
[00:40:23.120 --> 00:40:24.420]   And I don't think we've got to the point,
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:29.100]   which is how do you map illogical solutions?
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:30.380]   Most AI is logical.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.300]   It's based on some type of premise.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:37.300]   When you write the algorithm to control it, there's bounds.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.940]   - Yeah, there's this giant mess.
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:41.760]   Like you said, the difference between the simulator
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.000]   and real life also gets at that somehow,
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.620]   that there is somehow the fear of death,
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.740]   all of that beautiful mess comes into play.
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:55.280]   Is there a comment you can make on commercial flight?
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:41:00.280]   Like with Sully landing that plane famously
[00:41:00.280 --> 00:41:03.020]   versus the simulator, all of those discussions,
[00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:04.740]   is there some?
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:07.180]   - Well, it's very similar to what I was talking about
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:08.000]   earlier with the A6.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.540]   So one is when you're flying with a crew,
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.140]   there's standardization.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.860]   So you gotta remember when Sully flew,
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.880]   when his first officer, that's the co-pilot,
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:19.420]   showed up, it's the first time they met.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.220]   And this happens all the time in the commercial world.
[00:41:21.220 --> 00:41:24.340]   You know, there's six, 7,000 pilots at United Airlines.
[00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.820]   You know, your chance of flying with the same guy
[00:41:25.820 --> 00:41:26.940]   all the time is slim and none.
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.140]   Where in the Navy, we recruit.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:33.060]   So I had a primary and a secondary Wizzow that flew with me.
[00:41:33.060 --> 00:41:34.860]   - For months?
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:37.220]   - Oh yeah, for like all of the deployment.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.060]   So because you want it to know.
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:39.540]   - So these brains fuse.
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:40.380]   - You have to.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:41.940]   - Trust and all of those things.
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.740]   - It increases the capability of the airplane.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.780]   It's not to say we can't swap out,
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.020]   but for true effectiveness,
[00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:48.820]   especially in very complex missions
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.300]   like a forward air controller,
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:53.540]   we're in the air actually controlling ground assets
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:54.980]   and supporting ground troops.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:00.580]   If you're in a high threat area, which is crazy busy,
[00:42:00.580 --> 00:42:02.820]   you have to be melded when you do that.
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:04.780]   You have to have trained to do that job,
[00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:06.860]   otherwise you're gonna be ineffective.
[00:42:06.860 --> 00:42:09.820]   So when you get to the commercial world,
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.260]   and I've got tons of friends that fly commercial,
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:14.940]   there is a standardization.
[00:42:14.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   Like we know that at this point,
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:18.380]   I'm gonna put this switch, you're gonna do that.
[00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:20.260]   And everyone, they know their roles.
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:21.500]   Captain's gonna do this,
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:22.820]   first officer's gonna do this.
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:24.620]   And they know that when the emergency breaks out,
[00:42:24.620 --> 00:42:27.280]   so in Sully's case, when they take the birds
[00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:28.580]   and they know they've got a problem,
[00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:30.740]   and if you've listened to the cockpit recordings
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.240]   of the two of them talking, you gotta remember,
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:36.340]   they're talking to each other when you hear the full tapes,
[00:42:36.340 --> 00:42:38.740]   but they're also talking to the air traffic controllers
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:40.460]   in the New York area.
[00:42:40.460 --> 00:42:42.520]   And it's like, we got a bird strike
[00:42:42.520 --> 00:42:43.780]   and the first officer already knows,
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:45.700]   hey, silence the alarm, they silence the alarm.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:47.140]   The first officer's pulling out the book,
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:48.860]   he's going through the procedures,
[00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:50.580]   while Sully's actually flying the airplane,
[00:42:50.580 --> 00:42:51.940]   knowing that they've lost their motors.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.720]   And you gotta think his decision process,
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.480]   like they're trying to get him to go into an airport
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:58.300]   in New Jersey, and he realizes, not happening,
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:42:59.300]   we're gonna put this thing,
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:01.140]   and he made a decision soon enough
[00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.220]   so that he could prepare everyone on the airplane
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.480]   that he was gonna put this thing in the Hudson River,
[00:43:05.480 --> 00:43:07.160]   and he did it flawlessly.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:10.300]   I mean, every single person walked away from that wreck.
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:12.060]   The only thing that didn't survive was the airplane,
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.820]   you know, and it got fished out of the Hudson, but.
[00:43:14.820 --> 00:43:17.300]   - What is it about those human decisions he had to make?
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:19.180]   Is that something you put into words,
[00:43:19.180 --> 00:43:22.340]   or is that just deep down some instinct
[00:43:22.340 --> 00:43:23.900]   that you develop as a pilot over time?
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.060]   - It's when we, when you train,
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:28.540]   and aviation is a self-cleaning oven,
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:30.300]   so if you make bad decisions,
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.260]   and the list is long and distinguished
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:35.220]   of those who have died by making bad decisions.
[00:43:35.220 --> 00:43:36.580]   - Oh, man.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.900]   - So when you look at what he did, or the way we train,
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:43.500]   'cause the commercial industry and the Navy
[00:43:43.500 --> 00:43:45.100]   and the Air Force, for all that,
[00:43:45.100 --> 00:43:47.640]   we have what's called, we have emergency procedures
[00:43:47.640 --> 00:43:48.580]   that we have to know.
[00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:50.460]   Like, the engine's on fire, the first three steps,
[00:43:50.460 --> 00:43:52.540]   you just have to know what they are, right?
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.380]   So they know.
[00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:55.660]   The airline, same type, you know, they go,
[00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.380]   "Hey, I know this is," they pull the book out,
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.540]   'cause the airplanes are designed,
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:00.780]   they're built to have some time,
[00:44:00.780 --> 00:44:02.460]   but there's a point where you have to make a decision,
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:03.680]   and you can't second guess it.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.580]   So when he decided, "I'm putting this in the Hudson River,"
[00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.380]   he couldn't all of a sudden halfway through it go,
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:10.340]   "Well, maybe I can get over to that airport."
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:12.780]   He looked, he made a quick assessment,
[00:44:12.780 --> 00:44:14.980]   this is that 80% solution where you go,
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.820]   "These are not, you know,
[00:44:16.820 --> 00:44:18.340]   "it's like a multiple choice test,"
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.980]   when you go, "Oh my God, I don't really know the answer,
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.260]   "but I know A and D are wrong."
[00:44:22.260 --> 00:44:23.100]   Gone.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.620]   So the Jersey airport and going back to LaGuardia, gone.
[00:44:26.620 --> 00:44:28.100]   So what's my next option?
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:30.020]   Well, the Hudson River's there,
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:31.300]   and that's probably looking pretty good,
[00:44:31.300 --> 00:44:32.940]   or what is my other one?
[00:44:32.940 --> 00:44:34.740]   Can I get a restart on the motors?
[00:44:34.740 --> 00:44:36.380]   And then if I can get a restart,
[00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:38.140]   now can I take it someplace else?
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:40.820]   He had to make really, really fast decisions,
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:43.660]   and then once they go, that 80% solution,
[00:44:43.660 --> 00:44:45.620]   you realize, "All right, I'm going into the Hudson,
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.900]   "there's the 80%, get the book out,
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:48.020]   "let's see if we can get an air start,"
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:48.840]   'cause if you listen to the tapes,
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.260]   they're trying to get it air started.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:52.260]   The closer he gets to the water,
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:55.020]   the more he's going, "I'm ditching the airplane."
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.940]   So the original decision to,
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:59.380]   "This is my best option right now,
[00:44:59.380 --> 00:45:01.100]   "this is where I'm going,"
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.820]   and you start eliminating anything
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:05.060]   that could possibly change the events,
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:06.780]   which they tried to do,
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.100]   and then he gets to that last minute,
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:09.460]   he says, "We're going in the water,"
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:11.500]   they change the plan, they secure the airplane,
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.540]   they do exactly what they're doing,
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.120]   and he does that basically flawless landing on the Hudson.
[00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.860]   But you gotta remember,
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:20.520]   every, it's every six months for commercial,
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.260]   they go back and they do research
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:23.860]   in the airplane in the simulator,
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.100]   where they train to the airplane being broken.
[00:45:27.100 --> 00:45:30.000]   You just lost a motor, you just lost another motor.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.100]   So they go through this extensive training,
[00:45:33.100 --> 00:45:35.100]   and all these, and it's,
[00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:37.040]   we used to refer to it in the Navy as the pain cave,
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:37.880]   where you're gonna get in,
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.420]   and you know that when you get in for your check ride
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:43.160]   in a simulator, that the airplane is going to break.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.160]   You're gonna lose hydraulics,
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.460]   and it's sometimes they're a problem,
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:47.240]   like, "Oh, I just lost this hydraulic system,
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:48.840]   "but I'm having an issue on the other motor.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.460]   "Well, if I shut down this motor,
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:51.660]   "and I've got a hydraulics,
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.960]   "'cause there's two hydraulic systems,
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.620]   "one on each motor,
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:55.460]   "well, if I've got an issue
[00:45:55.460 --> 00:45:57.100]   "with the left motor hydraulic system,
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:46:00.060]   "and my right motor is starting to give me indications,
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.500]   "do I wanna shut the right motor down,
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:04.140]   "'cause that's gonna kill my hydraulic system that's good,
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:05.780]   "and now I'm flying on a good motor
[00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:06.840]   "with a bad hydraulic system,
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.260]   "and without hydraulics, the airplane won't fly."
[00:46:08.260 --> 00:46:10.640]   So they're challenging problems
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.600]   that you have to think through in real time,
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.420]   and of course, the weather's never good.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.680]   It's always dark.
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.660]   It's always crappy.
[00:46:16.660 --> 00:46:17.620]   You're gonna break out at midnight.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.520]   I mean, it's just all this stuff gets compiled
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.580]   on top of you,
[00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.460]   and it's intended to increase the level of stress,
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.940]   because when things happen, like in Sully's case,
[00:46:27.940 --> 00:46:30.540]   we like to joke it's going to stem power,
[00:46:30.540 --> 00:46:32.660]   where the functional part of your brain shuts down,
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:35.660]   and you are literally on instinct, like an animal.
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:37.220]   Well, if you've trained so much
[00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:38.780]   that that is the instinctive reaction
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:40.020]   that you're going to have,
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.740]   when the main part of your cognitive abilities
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:44.100]   start to shut down,
[00:46:44.100 --> 00:46:47.580]   that instinct is ingrained so much into you
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:49.440]   that you know exactly what to do,
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:52.020]   and that's literally how it happens.
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:55.980]   - So there's no, how do I put it, fear of death?
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:58.380]   Like in Sully's case,
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:01.780]   do you think he was at all ever thinking about the fact
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:05.380]   if his decision is wrong, a lot of people are going to die?
[00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:06.460]   - You know, I can't speak for him,
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:08.860]   but I would say there was so much going on
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:10.620]   at the cockpit in that time,
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:14.460]   his mindset was probably,
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:16.100]   I can do this, I'm trained,
[00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:17.480]   I'm going to do the procedures,
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:19.840]   I've practiced this before, I've done these things,
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.500]   and I'm assuming that in his mindset,
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.900]   'cause I never thought about when things were really bad,
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:26.180]   if you're having problems with the airplane,
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:29.540]   that I was going to mort and plant it into the ground.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:31.860]   It was always, maybe it's an ego thing
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:33.420]   where you think, I can do this.
[00:47:33.420 --> 00:47:34.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:47:34.260 --> 00:47:39.140]   - So you never, have you experienced fear during flight?
[00:47:39.140 --> 00:47:45.940]   I mean, one way, we just offline mentioned Mike Tyson,
[00:47:45.940 --> 00:47:50.940]   I mean, he talked about as he's walking up to the ring,
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:56.100]   he's like, he starts out basically in fear
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:48:00.200]   and worried about how things are going to go.
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:02.900]   I mean, it's purely to put in towards his fear,
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:05.260]   but as he gets closer and closer to the ring,
[00:48:05.260 --> 00:48:06.620]   the confidence grows and grows
[00:48:06.620 --> 00:48:10.580]   until the ego basically takes over
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:15.580]   to where you think there's no way anybody could defeat me.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:18.620]   So that's his experience of overcoming fear,
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:22.980]   but did you experience any kind of thing like that,
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.500]   or do you just go to the part of the brain
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.300]   that goes to the training,
[00:48:27.300 --> 00:48:30.900]   and then you just go to the instinctual 80% solution?
[00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.860]   - I wouldn't say I was never afraid.
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:35.540]   I think that would be, I couldn't tell you
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.480]   that anyone I know that wasn't afraid at one time.
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.800]   And for most of us, especially Navy carrier pilots,
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:44.160]   it's just, it's usually, especially when you're new
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:46.040]   and you gotta go out and it's nighttime
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.880]   and there's no moon and the weather sucks
[00:48:47.880 --> 00:48:50.420]   and the deck's moving, you know, the ship's going up
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:53.780]   and down 'cause it will scare the living shit out of you.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.620]   Can I say that?
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.420]   - You can definitely say that.
[00:48:56.420 --> 00:48:58.380]   So it's about landing and takeoff that-
[00:48:58.380 --> 00:49:01.140]   - That is, if you, even they used to wire people up,
[00:49:01.140 --> 00:49:02.740]   they did it during Vietnam, you know,
[00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:04.220]   guys would go fly missions, you know,
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.300]   when they were flying low and crazy stuff was going on
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:08.560]   and people were getting shot down a lot.
[00:49:08.560 --> 00:49:11.700]   The highest anxiety and heart rates
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.700]   were coming back to land on board an aircraft carrier.
[00:49:13.700 --> 00:49:15.260]   - How hard is it to land on that?
[00:49:15.260 --> 00:49:20.260]   It seems impossible, like for a civilian, I guess, like me,
[00:49:20.260 --> 00:49:23.060]   just seems crazy that a human can do that.
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.700]   - The problem with night is,
[00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.540]   and there's different degrees of night, just like day.
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:30.940]   I mean, there's the clear full moon night, you know,
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:32.620]   where it's like, "Woo!"
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.500]   You know, this is not that bad.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:36.220]   But you gotta remember at night,
[00:49:36.220 --> 00:49:38.420]   I think everyone can associate with,
[00:49:38.420 --> 00:49:41.020]   you're driving in your car and it's just a,
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.840]   it's an overcast, dark night
[00:49:42.840 --> 00:49:45.800]   and you're on a country road with no side lights.
[00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:48.340]   Most people have a tendency to slow down
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.140]   just by nature of, "Oh my God,"
[00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.100]   'cause what you'll do is you'll outdrive your headlights
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:53.980]   'cause it is so dark, you know,
[00:49:53.980 --> 00:49:55.700]   and you can get outside of the city
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:57.740]   and get up into New Hampshire,
[00:49:57.740 --> 00:49:59.940]   especially when the roads are curving, you know,
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:02.300]   and the lines probably aren't that good.
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:03.900]   It's, you know, now take that
[00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:06.260]   and multiply it by like a million
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.320]   because you have no depth perception.
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:14.740]   What you think is fixed, the runway, is actually moving.
[00:50:14.740 --> 00:50:16.260]   - Up and down and left to right.
[00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.900]   - Yeah, oh, and when it's really bad,
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.820]   you can actually see it move.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:22.180]   And we have two systems, you know,
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:25.040]   there's an automatic system that's actually,
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.620]   it stabilizes with the inertials on the ship.
[00:50:29.620 --> 00:50:30.800]   And then there's the ILS.
[00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:32.740]   Now, civilian pilots will tell you
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:34.260]   that ILS is a precision approach,
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   which gives you azimuth and glide slope.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:38.980]   You know, you come down, it's like a plus.
[00:50:38.980 --> 00:50:40.020]   On the carrier, it's not.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.380]   It's really just a beam that goes out
[00:50:41.380 --> 00:50:43.500]   and it's considered a non-precision approach.
[00:50:43.500 --> 00:50:45.740]   It's not stabilized at all that.
[00:50:45.740 --> 00:50:47.780]   And I've been where you can actually watch the needle
[00:50:47.780 --> 00:50:49.740]   and the tack hand needle will move.
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:50.740]   There's all kinds of stuff moving
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:53.860]   'cause the base that it's all sitting on is doing this.
[00:50:53.860 --> 00:50:55.660]   And ships don't just go up and down.
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:50:57.820]   They do this, so the bow goes up and down
[00:50:57.820 --> 00:50:59.860]   and the tail like you normally see a ship.
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:01.580]   And then there's, so that's pitch.
[00:51:01.580 --> 00:51:03.760]   And then it has roll, so it's doing this.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.620]   And then it has heave, so the whole boat
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:08.120]   is going up and down while it's pitching and rolling.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:09.620]   And you're gonna land on that.
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:13.820]   So, and it's, I mean, I remember landing,
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.940]   so I was with Chris Sato,
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:18.500]   and Chris and I, we were off the USS Ranger,
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.620]   which is now decommissioned.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:22.780]   It's sitting, getting turned into razor blades.
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:24.660]   We're flying the old A6 and we come in
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:26.820]   and it was off of San Diego and it was just an ugly night
[00:51:26.820 --> 00:51:28.620]   'cause San Diego always has a marine layer
[00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:29.940]   that is about 1200 feet.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:31.420]   It was lower than that that night.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.500]   And it was pouring down rain.
[00:51:32.500 --> 00:51:34.820]   It was an El Nino year and there's thunderstorms all around.
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.340]   It was just the craziest night I've ever seen
[00:51:36.340 --> 00:51:37.780]   out of San Diego.
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:41.520]   And I remember landing and your adrenaline is so high
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.460]   that you're shaking.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.300]   I mean, you literally can't stop.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.300]   And we had spun around out of the landing area
[00:51:46.300 --> 00:51:47.980]   and we parked, we call it the six pack.
[00:51:47.980 --> 00:51:49.260]   So it's right in front of the island.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:50.860]   So if you see an aircraft carrier with the island
[00:51:50.860 --> 00:51:52.460]   and the number of the ship on it,
[00:51:52.460 --> 00:51:53.380]   we're sitting right in front of that
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.800]   and we're looking at the landing area.
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:57.900]   So it's like, you get front row seats to the concert.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:02.900]   And this EA6B comes in, you know, ugly pass.
[00:52:02.900 --> 00:52:05.700]   He ends up catching a one wire, which is the first one.
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:06.900]   You never wanna catch the first one,
[00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:08.500]   which means you were not really high
[00:52:08.500 --> 00:52:11.380]   above the back of the ship when you landed.
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:14.540]   And it comes in and the exhaust on an EA6 or an A6
[00:52:14.540 --> 00:52:16.900]   actually points kind of down and it blows
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.140]   and it's blowing all the standing water on the aircraft.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:20.060]   That's how hard it's raining.
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:21.740]   And you literally could not see across.
[00:52:21.740 --> 00:52:24.220]   I mean, I could see the front of my airplane, his airplane,
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:25.260]   and then it was just white
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:27.500]   'cause of the water being blown off the deck.
[00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.900]   And I'm shaking and I'll never forget,
[00:52:29.900 --> 00:52:31.780]   I looked over at Chris and I said, "Oh my God."
[00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:32.620]   I go, "Hey dude, man,
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:35.260]   "10,000 foot runway looks really good right now."
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:37.320]   And I go, and I'm shaking my hands like this.
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.100]   And I said, "I'm not even, I'm not faking this, dude."
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:42.540]   I go, "That's literally, I cannot stop shaking."
[00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:44.740]   I said, "That scared the everyone out of me."
[00:52:44.740 --> 00:52:48.100]   But it scares you afterwards.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:52.220]   During it, you don't have time to think about that.
[00:52:52.220 --> 00:52:53.980]   You're doing it, you gotta do.
[00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.060]   There's kind of the quote from Tom Hanks
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:00.100]   in what's that, the girl's baseball movie,
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:01.660]   where he goes, "There's no crying in baseball."
[00:53:01.660 --> 00:53:03.060]   Well, that's our joke.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:04.540]   There's no crying in naval aviation.
[00:53:04.540 --> 00:53:06.700]   I said, "You can fly around and cry all you want at night,
[00:53:06.700 --> 00:53:09.360]   "but there's only one pilot in those airplanes
[00:53:09.360 --> 00:53:10.220]   "and you gotta land it."
[00:53:10.220 --> 00:53:13.260]   So you cry all you want, wipe the tears away,
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.060]   put on your big kid pants and it's time to man up
[00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.620]   and land the jet.
[00:53:18.620 --> 00:53:19.980]   - Sorry for the romantic question,
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.980]   but going back to the kid that dreamed to fly,
[00:53:22.980 --> 00:53:27.820]   what's it like to fly an airplane?
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:31.660]   It looks incredible.
[00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.020]   - To me-- - As a human,
[00:53:33.020 --> 00:53:35.660]   like a descendant of ape, I sit here on land
[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:38.060]   and look up at you guys.
[00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:41.100]   It seems incredible that a human being can do that.
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:42.980]   - You know, people ask, I'll be sitting around
[00:53:42.980 --> 00:53:44.140]   with my friends and they're like, "How was it?"
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.060]   I said, "The greatest job on the planet."
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:47.940]   (Lyle laughs)
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:50.820]   I said, "It's an office with a view
[00:53:50.820 --> 00:53:52.260]   "'cause you're sitting in a glass bubble."
[00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:54.180]   - Office with a view.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:58.180]   - You can do, it's like roller coasters.
[00:53:58.180 --> 00:53:59.300]   You go, "Oh, it does all these cool stuff."
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:01.620]   So we take people flying every once in a while.
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.220]   And it's like, "Oh yeah, I like roller coasters."
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:04.620]   They go, "No, take any roller coaster,
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:06.700]   "the coolest roller coaster you've ever been on
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.940]   "and multiply it by 1,000."
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:12.460]   I said, "It's an experience to put your body under
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:15.620]   "the jets rated at seven and a half,
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:18.100]   "but it'll pull up to 8.1 before it overstresses,
[00:54:18.100 --> 00:54:19.740]   "depends on fuel weight."
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.540]   So, I mean, you routinely get up there towards eight Gs.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:26.780]   To be able to do that to your body, I mean, it takes a toll.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.860]   Like I can't really turn my head real good anymore
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:32.180]   and stuff like that, but would I trade it?
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:33.340]   I mean, it was a childhood dream.
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:34.940]   And how many people get to do that?
[00:54:34.940 --> 00:54:37.780]   You know, professional, I wanna be an NFL, you know,
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.860]   and you end up to the NFL,
[00:54:38.860 --> 00:54:40.700]   which is a very small percentage.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.700]   Well, I wanna fly jets and to fly,
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:46.220]   you know, at the time when I was flying,
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:47.700]   the Super Hornets that we had on our squadron
[00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:49.940]   were brand new, like literally right out of the factory.
[00:54:49.940 --> 00:54:52.180]   I'd come off our first Super Hornet cruise.
[00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:54.260]   We had went to the Boeing factory in St. Louis
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.300]   where they were building my new jets that I was going to get
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:58.900]   and I actually signed the inside of one of the wings
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:54:59.940]   while they were putting it together.
[00:54:59.940 --> 00:55:01.020]   So, I'm meeting the people
[00:55:01.020 --> 00:55:02.140]   that are putting the jet together
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.940]   that's gonna get delivered to me in a couple of months
[00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:05.340]   that I'm gonna fly.
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:08.380]   So, just, I mean-
[00:55:08.380 --> 00:55:10.460]   - The whole of it is incredible.
[00:55:10.460 --> 00:55:13.220]   - I'll tell you what, when I left,
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:15.780]   when I decided to walk away-
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:17.340]   - Yeah, did you miss it?
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:18.940]   - I told myself I wouldn't.
[00:55:18.940 --> 00:55:21.580]   I promised myself that, you know,
[00:55:21.580 --> 00:55:23.380]   once you get through your O5 command,
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:26.740]   your flying really starts to tag, to come down.
[00:55:26.740 --> 00:55:28.580]   You know, even if you go and you're an air wing commander,
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:31.620]   which is, we call them CAG, carrier group commander,
[00:55:31.620 --> 00:55:35.220]   you're not flying as much as like the normal pilots,
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:36.060]   nor should you be.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.100]   I mean, there's young people that are coming up
[00:55:38.100 --> 00:55:39.100]   and it's training your relief
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:40.220]   'cause that's the next generation.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:43.220]   So, like currently I have friends of mine
[00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:45.060]   that we serve together,
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:48.100]   their kids are flying Super Hornets, right?
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:50.300]   So, to me, that's really neat
[00:55:50.300 --> 00:55:52.180]   'cause I watched them when they were little.
[00:55:52.180 --> 00:55:55.620]   And now, you know, one of them who is good friends,
[00:55:55.620 --> 00:55:56.460]   I won't get his last name,
[00:55:56.460 --> 00:56:00.460]   but Joey, who lived down the street from us,
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:02.020]   is a top, was a Top Gun instructor.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:04.340]   And I'm like, "Hey, Joey's a Top Gun."
[00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:06.100]   You know, and I'm like, "That's cool."
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:07.420]   Because, you know, I'd went there
[00:56:07.420 --> 00:56:08.940]   and I knew him, he would come down to my house.
[00:56:08.940 --> 00:56:10.780]   And now to see these kids that are,
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:13.100]   because typically military breeds military, you know,
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.340]   because the kids grew up in it.
[00:56:14.340 --> 00:56:17.460]   I mean, and I, the only reason that my son is not doing it
[00:56:17.460 --> 00:56:18.860]   is he's colorblind.
[00:56:18.860 --> 00:56:22.420]   So, it disqualifies you for being a pilot, being a SEAL,
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:23.980]   'cause he had talked about doing that
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:25.740]   'cause he's an incredible swimmer
[00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:29.100]   and he likes doing that stuff and the water polo player.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:31.820]   But he's, you know, both of my kids are,
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:32.980]   well, my daughter is a doctor
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:35.860]   and my son's in his third year, so.
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:38.260]   - But there's a, I suppose,
[00:56:38.260 --> 00:56:42.140]   I mean, from my perspective, a bittersweet handover
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.260]   of this incredible experience of flying
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:46.060]   to the younger generation.
[00:56:46.060 --> 00:56:49.700]   So, you don't, you told yourself you're not gonna miss it.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:51.140]   You miss it?
[00:56:51.140 --> 00:56:51.980]   - There are days I do.
[00:56:51.980 --> 00:56:54.660]   When I hear jets, like if I'm around a base
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:57.740]   or a jet flies over, but I have all the memories.
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:01.540]   So, I can look at it and go, it can't go on forever.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:04.340]   You know, Tom Brady can't play football.
[00:57:04.340 --> 00:57:06.180]   There's gonna come a time where he has to stop.
[00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:08.220]   - He seems to have done it for a long time.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.180]   - But, you know, typically when you look at it,
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:12.340]   you go, I had the opportunity.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:16.580]   And I think as automation moves on, especially with AI,
[00:57:16.580 --> 00:57:20.780]   that, you know, when will the last manned fighter be built?
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.060]   You know, and that's that big question.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:23.460]   You know, we just did F-35.
[00:57:23.460 --> 00:57:26.660]   It's over budget, it's seven years late.
[00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:29.020]   There's all kinds of issues when we try and do it.
[00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:30.500]   And then you look at some of the new stuff
[00:57:30.500 --> 00:57:32.780]   that's coming out that the Air Force is working on
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:37.220]   with smaller, cheaper, attritable platforms
[00:57:37.220 --> 00:57:39.580]   that you can go, oh, we can,
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:42.540]   'cause if you don't put a man in the box, or a person,
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:45.180]   because there's a lot of incredibly talented women
[00:57:45.180 --> 00:57:48.580]   that do this too, so I'll just say that as person.
[00:57:48.580 --> 00:57:52.160]   - Yeah, so we say man and he, we mean both men and women,
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:54.860]   'cause offline you've told me about a lot of incredible
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:56.180]   women that flown, so it's--
[00:57:56.180 --> 00:58:00.220]   - I had three female, actually four,
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:01.540]   one of them didn't fly anymore.
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:03.380]   She actually lives right around here.
[00:58:03.380 --> 00:58:06.320]   She ended up going into aircraft maintenance
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:07.820]   when she couldn't fly anymore.
[00:58:07.820 --> 00:58:13.180]   One of the girls who everyone knows is incredibly,
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:15.300]   she's one of the most gifted people I've ever met
[00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.460]   in my life, she is the vice president of Amazon Air.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:20.020]   You can see her on TV, her name's Sarah.
[00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:22.460]   Incredible, and then I had Paige,
[00:58:22.460 --> 00:58:24.700]   who ended up taking command.
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.500]   She got out of fighters and went into other platforms,
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:29.240]   and she was a commanding officer.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:33.180]   And then the other one is a, teaches leadership,
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:35.720]   and she is, all three of them,
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:38.900]   actually all four of the women that were direct,
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:41.880]   I'm not forgetting, I don't think I'm forgetting someone,
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:44.500]   incredibly, incredibly talented,
[00:58:44.500 --> 00:58:45.740]   and a great addition to the ready room.
[00:58:45.740 --> 00:58:48.180]   So anyone that gets into the, oh, women can't do it,
[00:58:48.180 --> 00:58:49.860]   that's all total horse crap.
[00:58:49.860 --> 00:58:52.700]   Hey, we can talk about the original integration and stuff,
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:55.940]   which was not done well by the military nor the Navy.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.300]   - So women can fly as good as the guys?
[00:58:58.300 --> 00:59:01.180]   - Yeah, you can't tell if you pass another airplane,
[00:59:01.180 --> 00:59:03.020]   you can't tell if there's a man or a woman in it.
[00:59:03.020 --> 00:59:06.640]   It really comes down to stick and throttle,
[00:59:06.640 --> 00:59:11.640]   the ability to extrapolate where the vehicle's going to be,
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:14.200]   where the airplane would be if you're fighting another one.
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.320]   You have to be able to think fast.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:17.820]   Anyone who has those characteristics can do it.
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:19.860]   And then I think most important besides that,
[00:59:19.860 --> 00:59:21.660]   there has to be a desire.
[00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:22.500]   - Yeah.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:23.920]   - And I'm not saying that everyone, if you took,
[00:59:23.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   'cause we used to track, so when I ran,
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:27.960]   we call it the RAG, it's the Replacement Air Group,
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.120]   it's where, so the Super Hornet Training Squadron,
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.760]   there's two of them, there's one on the East Coast,
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:34.440]   at 106, and there's one on the West Coast,
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:36.480]   which is VFA 122.
[00:59:36.480 --> 00:59:37.640]   122 is the first one.
[00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.400]   So I ended up going there and I ended up being
[00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.180]   the Operations Officer and Training Officer, okay?
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:45.960]   So we tracked the last 100 students, right?
[00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.920]   So everyone goes, "Ah, it's funny to hear students talk,
[00:59:47.920 --> 00:59:50.040]   "'cause oh, he's awesome, he's super."
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:54.040]   If you took the 100, there's three at the top of the list
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:56.160]   that are just naturally gifted aviators.
[00:59:56.160 --> 00:59:58.000]   They're well, well, well above average.
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:59.360]   It's like the person in a math class
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:02.360]   that sits down in complex math and they just get it.
[01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   You know?
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.640]   At the bottom, there's the three at the bottom
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:07.560]   that are gonna struggle and there's a good chance
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:08.520]   they won't get out.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.740]   And if they do get out, they're gonna have to work
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:13.840]   really hard to just maintain kinda average.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:15.260]   Sometimes it's just the way your mind works.
[01:00:15.260 --> 01:00:17.120]   Not everyone is good at everything.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.600]   If you took the 94 of 'em in the middle,
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.400]   they're within one mean deviation of, you know, it's there.
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.760]   They're all, you know, it's a,
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.000]   the bell curve doesn't look real good.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.800]   It's just a big hump and it comes back down
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.040]   and everyone's right there within one mean deviation.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:33.480]   And then you have the outliers,
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:35.600]   usually not on the high side 'cause they're gonna get through
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:38.960]   but the outliers on the low side that don't make it through.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:41.240]   So for the most part, the Navy does a really good job,
[01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.920]   as does the Air Force, of screening.
[01:00:42.920 --> 01:00:44.540]   So now what they do, when I went,
[01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.400]   you just showed up and you started.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:49.480]   Now what you do is you actually go fly a Piper Warriors,
[01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:52.640]   low wing, to see, are you adaptable to this?
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:55.280]   And there's an evaluation that goes through
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.960]   and then if you hit a certain mark,
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:59.120]   then you're good to go and then they put you into primary.
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:01.400]   It's kinda like a, it's like a pre-check, you know,
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:03.640]   like the pre-sat, the pre-SAT to go,
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.000]   hey, how am I gonna do on the SAT?
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   It's very similar to that but it's more of a hand skill,
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:09.840]   can you adapt?
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:11.880]   Because although we live in three dimensions,
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:14.160]   like this table is not, you know, we, this is,
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:17.320]   you know, this is all, has depth with all that.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.980]   Where it's really, relative to aviation,
[01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:22.240]   we are two-dimensional, very two-dimensional.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.320]   - Can you explain that?
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:26.200]   So our perception is actually more limited
[01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:28.840]   than that of an aviator?
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.640]   - Very much and here's why.
[01:01:30.640 --> 01:01:33.200]   So we look at, let's look at a tall building.
[01:01:33.200 --> 01:01:35.320]   Let's look at one World Trade Center in New York
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:36.960]   'cause that's, everyone knows what it looks like,
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.040]   big, tall building.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:42.360]   It's what, maybe 1800 feet tall?
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.160]   Even the Burj Al Dubai, which is like, what,
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:46.440]   20-some hundred feet tall, it's not that big.
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:49.480]   So a Super Hornet, to do what a Split S is,
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.080]   which is I'm flying, I'm just gonna roll the airplane
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.400]   upside down and then I'm gonna do basically a C,
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.240]   the letter C.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:58.080]   I'm gonna go in the top and out the bottom.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.680]   So, and I'm just gonna, it's basically
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:01.200]   a vertical displacement of the airplane.
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:02.680]   So I'm going from high to low.
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.640]   It's very, very tight and it does it in about,
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.680]   roughly about 2,500 feet, give or take a little.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:13.040]   So you go, that is a really tight vertical turn.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.880]   For example, the A6, in order to do that,
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:17.080]   was about 9,000 feet.
[01:02:17.080 --> 01:02:19.280]   And we look at a building that's 2,000 feet high
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.120]   and think that is tall.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:21.960]   - Right.
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:23.220]   - All right, so in aviation sense,
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:25.760]   when you're starting to do vertical displacement maneuvers,
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.240]   going from 35,000 feet down to 20,000 feet
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.600]   in a matter of seconds and maneuvering the airplane,
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:33.640]   because the human brain thinks, we really are,
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:35.240]   we like to be flat. - 2D, I see what you mean.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.080]   - We think 2D.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:38.600]   So if I'm fighting, how you really get an advantage
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.840]   when you're fighting another airplane
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:42.780]   is to work in the vertical.
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.320]   Because most people will do like one move in the vertical
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:46.720]   and then they wanna start to flatten out
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:48.200]   because that's where we're comfortable.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:49.160]   - Yeah, it's really profound.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.360]   Do you still think in like stacks of 2D layers or no?
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:56.920]   Or do you truly start to think in that third dimension,
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.920]   like the rich 3D world of fighting?
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:04.960]   Do you start to actually be able
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:09.140]   to really experience the 3D nature?
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.560]   - You do, because you have to project
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:11.400]   where you're gonna be.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.040]   So you have to know the performance of the airplane,
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:14.920]   knowing that, hey, if I do this maneuver
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:18.440]   that I am gonna go, it's kinda like when I talk about
[01:03:18.440 --> 01:03:20.040]   when we were chasing the Tic Tac.
[01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:22.160]   So the Tic Tac's coming up and I'm at about,
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:25.600]   you know, and I've been doing this for at the time, 16 years.
[01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.720]   So I'm looking and I'm going, hey, I'm here,
[01:03:27.720 --> 01:03:29.400]   he's there on the other side of the circle.
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.840]   I'm gonna do a vertical displacement.
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:31.680]   I'm gonna go like this.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.840]   I'm gonna cut across the circle and I'm not going to him.
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:34.760]   I'm going out in front of him.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.800]   I'm going over here.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:37.760]   'Cause I know that by the time I get through this maneuver,
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:38.600]   that's where he's gonna be.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:40.920]   And I'm trying to basically join up on him.
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:43.420]   But I also had to look at it to go,
[01:03:43.420 --> 01:03:44.800]   do I have enough altitude to do this?
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.360]   'Cause what I didn't, if we're here and I do this,
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:48.240]   I'm gonna end up over here and he's gonna be above me.
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.800]   And then I have to get that energy back to get up to him.
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.480]   And when you're doing a max performance, it's a trade.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:57.840]   So you have, this is really important
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:59.200]   when you're fighting airplanes
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:01.120]   and you're really max performing.
[01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.920]   So when you go to an air show and you see the air demo,
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.280]   he's literally playing with it.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.320]   He's got a finite amount of energy, right?
[01:04:07.320 --> 01:04:08.960]   He can add some with the motors and stuff,
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.920]   but what you're really doing is it's a trade off
[01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:14.800]   and you can trade off kinetic energy, speed for altitude,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:16.560]   which gives you potential energy.
[01:04:16.560 --> 01:04:18.480]   The other piece is, is I can trade some
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.800]   of that kinetic energy for performance.
[01:04:20.800 --> 01:04:22.960]   Because I know if I do a nice easy turn,
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:25.520]   the airplane will make it at what doesn't bleed energy.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.880]   But I know if I do a real tight, that 2,500 foot split S,
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.000]   that it's gonna cost me energy.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.200]   So if I enter the split S at 200 knots and I do it right,
[01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:35.480]   I'm gonna come out at the bottom at probably 200 knots.
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:38.840]   Although I lost 2,500 feet of potential energy,
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:42.640]   I converted that to kinetic and that kinetic was transitioned
[01:04:42.640 --> 01:04:44.600]   and bled off the wings in order for me
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:46.360]   to get that high performance turn.
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:49.760]   And you have to constantly evaluate where you're at
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.960]   and it's your overall energy package.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.560]   So you can have a guy that's behind you
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.280]   that looks like he's going to kill you,
[01:04:55.280 --> 01:04:57.040]   but if this jet is at 400 knots
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:58.960]   and this jet is at 110 knots,
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.800]   this jet's just gonna pull away, drive around
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:03.480]   and kill him in about 30 seconds, right?
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:06.560]   It's overall energy package and that's that,
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:08.680]   you gotta be constantly evaluating where you're at.
[01:05:08.680 --> 01:05:10.000]   And this is that 80% solution.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:11.160]   Can I afford to do this or not?
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:12.840]   Yes, no, and you have literally a split second
[01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:13.680]   to make the decision.
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.120]   - The most incredible dance of human decision-making.
[01:05:17.120 --> 01:05:19.080]   It's just incredible.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.400]   I know a million people want me to talk about Tic Tac
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.000]   and I definitely will,
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:27.520]   but let me ask the one last ridiculous subjective question.
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:32.840]   What's the greatest plane ever made in history?
[01:05:32.840 --> 01:05:36.520]   You don't get to like-
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:39.040]   - From pure speed, I would say SR-71.
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:40.080]   I think it's an engineering marvel
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.320]   that was actually developed in the '50s by Kelly Johnson,
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:45.360]   you know, Skunk Works, for what that was able to do.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.560]   And then when you get into history of it,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.320]   you know how they actually built,
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:52.120]   the CIA actually made like six companies
[01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:54.240]   in order to buy the titanium from Russia
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:56.760]   to bring it back and build an airplane out of titanium
[01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.680]   that we would fly over Russia.
[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:00.400]   To me, that's an incredible-
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:01.320]   - Engineering marvel.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:03.680]   - I think that like the X-15, you know-
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:05.600]   - By the way, this SR, sorry to interrupt,
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.200]   the SR-71 still holds the speed record
[01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.280]   for any plane as far as I can understand.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.800]   - Yeah, what's funny when you get into it is it's,
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:18.160]   remember, fast is relative.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:20.000]   And when I say that, I mean,
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.080]   so if you're going 3,000 miles an hour,
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.360]   100 feet above the ground,
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:28.440]   you're going 3,000 miles an hour through,
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:30.120]   you know, that's how fast you're going.
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:32.800]   When you get up to altitude, there's an indicated airspeed
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.960]   and there's a, you know, your ground speed.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.960]   So your indicated airspeed is really
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.040]   how fast the air is going past your airplane.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.040]   Well, the air is so thin up there,
[01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:44.680]   you may only be showing like 300 knots.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.680]   But at 300 knots, you're really doing
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:48.760]   2,500 miles an hour over the ground.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:51.160]   So, you know, like we would take the airplanes
[01:06:51.160 --> 01:06:53.240]   up to 50,000 feet when we had to do
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:55.400]   full the maintenance check flights on them.
[01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:59.000]   So when you're doing 200, you know, and some odd knots,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.400]   it's actually slow for the airplane.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.480]   It's, you know, you're getting, you know,
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.960]   it's kind of like, it's not, you know,
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:05.000]   there's maneuvering speeds.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.600]   You know that if I hit a certain speed in a Super Hornet,
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.680]   that I have the full capability of the airfoil.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:12.160]   If I'm below that speed, I'm gonna stall the airfoil
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.640]   before I get to the maximum G.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.480]   Okay?
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.600]   So when you look at something like that, you go,
[01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:19.360]   well, is it really going fast?
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.280]   And when you look at an SR-71 that's flying upwards of,
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:25.760]   you know, 70 plus thousand feet, the air is so thin,
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.840]   you know, just like the X-15,
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:28.920]   you can get to a much higher speed,
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.920]   but the relative speed of the air going over you
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.600]   is actually relatively low.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.560]   So the stresses on the airframe are not like they would be
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:37.840]   if you were down low, but because you're going fast
[01:07:37.840 --> 01:07:39.680]   to get enough air over your pitot-static system
[01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:43.400]   to show that you're going 300 knots, you're screaming.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.200]   I mean, the fastest I ever got was, I was with the,
[01:07:46.200 --> 01:07:48.940]   well, soon to be Vice Admiral White.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:53.940]   So we had taken a check flight and I got it up to 1.78.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:55.960]   I got a Super Hornet up to Mach 1.78.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.920]   And it was, and we were just right by Pebble Beach too.
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.240]   And then it-
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:00.080]   - What's that feel like?
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.200]   Or is it just like-
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:02.520]   - When you get that fast, it started,
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:03.800]   to me, it got a little bit weird.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.160]   'Cause you realize in your brain, and I did,
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.160]   that there's no out.
[01:08:08.160 --> 01:08:10.440]   If something happens, I can't eject.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.800]   The ejection would kill me.
[01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:13.320]   - Isn't that kind of liberating in a way?
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:14.880]   (laughing)
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:16.320]   - Or no, that, okay, maybe not.
[01:08:16.320 --> 01:08:17.640]   - You always wanna push the limit.
[01:08:17.640 --> 01:08:18.600]   You know, it's like how fast,
[01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:19.720]   I could have got it going faster.
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:21.920]   It was literally still accelerating when I stopped,
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.680]   but I had, it was fuel limited and space limited.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:28.320]   'Cause I, you know, I'm off the coast of California,
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:30.480]   Big Sur, and I'm going, and I can see Pebble Beach
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:31.800]   out in the distance, you know,
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:33.120]   the whole Monterey Peninsula.
[01:08:33.120 --> 01:08:34.040]   - You're just going fast.
[01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:37.000]   - And you're doing almost 18 miles a minute.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.480]   I mean, you're screaming.
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:39.320]   - Yeah.
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:40.920]   - I mean, that's, and then you have to turn,
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:42.440]   well, the airplane didn't have anything on it.
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:43.720]   It was a slicked off Super Hornet.
[01:08:43.720 --> 01:08:45.040]   So it was basically just the airplane,
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.400]   no pylons, no pods, no nothing.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:48.800]   And then we had to get it turned around
[01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.400]   'cause we got to go to the exit point for the area.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.440]   And I'm trying to get it down below to subsonic.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.400]   And there's a bunch of things that are disabled,
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:57.320]   like the speed brakes that normally we pop out
[01:08:57.320 --> 01:08:58.640]   when you're going that fast, they don't,
[01:08:58.640 --> 01:09:00.440]   because the Super Hornet really doesn't have speed brakes.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.320]   It deforms the flight controls.
[01:09:02.320 --> 01:09:04.520]   They don't function.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:06.440]   So you really, you're trying to maneuver.
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:07.840]   And when you're going that fast,
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:12.040]   you can't turn because a 7G turn at 1.5 Mach
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.400]   is a pretty big turn.
[01:09:13.400 --> 01:09:16.440]   So it's just, it's crazy.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:18.720]   - It's incredible that a human can do this.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.960]   And a human can engineer that,
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.800]   the system which allows another human
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.200]   to control that system.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:27.960]   - It's, to me, it's, I think it's just,
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.440]   it's a great experience.
[01:09:29.440 --> 01:09:31.720]   - Was it sad to see the SR-71 go?
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.320]   I think it was during your career.
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:37.680]   I mean, do you guys romanticize the different planes?
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.520]   - We would see it flying when I was flying Hornets,
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:43.400]   'cause we, West Coast flies in, it's called R-2508,
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:47.160]   which is, covers the Navy China Lake area and Edwards.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.320]   It's a huge area.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.280]   It's actually, I think the,
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:50.720]   we had a guy from Switzerland come out
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:52.080]   'cause they had Hornets and he's like,
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:54.080]   "This is bigger than our whole country."
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:57.280]   'Cause it's a pretty big area in California that you fly.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.040]   But you would see the SR-71s, they had a loop
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.680]   'cause NASA was flying them out of Palmdale.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:02.840]   And they would take off and they'd go up
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.280]   towards Washington State and Montana and they do a loop.
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:06.760]   And so you'd see them coming back down.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:08.760]   They descend out of, you know, above 60,000.
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.440]   You'd see them, they get contrails, you know,
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:12.120]   the white lines behind airplanes.
[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.320]   And it'd come down and hit the tanker
[01:10:13.320 --> 01:10:14.200]   and then they'd go back up.
[01:10:14.200 --> 01:10:18.080]   So it was cool to be able to see them in my lifetime flying.
[01:10:18.080 --> 01:10:22.840]   But, you know, I think with money, age,
[01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:27.040]   the advent of satellites, you know,
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040]   'cause they're everywhere now.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:29.160]   I mean, you've got commercial companies
[01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:30.240]   putting satellites up.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:33.040]   How much of that need was really there?
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:34.440]   'Cause you gotta remember when those things started
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:36.680]   in the 50s, Sputnik wasn't flying around.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.840]   You know, it was the U-2 and the SR-71
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:41.240]   that were out there doing that work.
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.960]   So at the time it was needed, it was at the,
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:44.920]   if you think about it, really,
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:47.280]   it was an incredible feat of aviation for that time.
[01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:48.760]   - Yeah. - I mean, literally,
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:50.120]   we have yet to pass that.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.920]   And then you also asked, well, is there a need to pass that?
[01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.640]   I go, I don't know, we got stuff in space.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:56.960]   So do we need to make an airplane that goes that fast?
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:59.400]   I think the next one is you get into the hypersonics
[01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:00.640]   where you don't have to put a person in
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.880]   and it does all kinds of crazy stuff.
[01:11:01.880 --> 01:11:03.160]   - You know, the work with automation,
[01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:05.280]   all that kind of stuff, yeah.
[01:11:05.280 --> 01:11:08.520]   - So one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:11.720]   is you happen to be one of, at least in my view,
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.160]   one of the most credible witnesses in history
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:19.480]   of somebody who's witnessed a UFO,
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.960]   literally an identified flying object.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:27.200]   And not only witnessed, but got to,
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:29.200]   how do you put it, like chase it, essentially?
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:31.320]   - Chased it. - Chased it.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:33.880]   So let me just lay out, I think it's easier
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.760]   than you telling the story, maybe me and my
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:40.360]   dumb simpleton ways trying to explain the stories,
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:43.400]   I understand it, and then maybe you can correct me.
[01:11:43.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   So on November 10th, 2004, the USS Princeton,
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.880]   which is one of the carriers.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.360]   - That's a cruiser.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.560]   - It's a cruiser. - It's a cruiser.
[01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:57.120]   - So you can't land on a--
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.280]   - No, helicopter, it has a helicopter pad on the back.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.600]   - Gotcha, and it has weapons on it, okay, gotcha.
[01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.940]   - It shoots the missiles up.
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:04.440]   But it has a nice radar, just like--
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.160]   - It's got an incredible SPY-1 system, phased array,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:10.060]   four panels, so it looks in quadrants.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:14.240]   - Perfect, so they started noticing on November 10th
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:18.000]   that there is a few objects flying around at 28,000 feet
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:21.160]   with speed of, what I guess is considered
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.080]   a low speed of 120 miles an hour,
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:24.360]   don't know what that's in knots,
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.520]   but on the coast of California.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:29.520]   So, and they kept detecting these objects
[01:12:29.520 --> 01:12:31.840]   for just about a week.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.840]   Then comes in like your part of the story,
[01:12:36.840 --> 01:12:39.100]   which is on November 14th,
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:44.120]   from the, I guess it's from the USS Nimitz,
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:49.820]   you flew and witnessed a 40-foot long
[01:12:49.820 --> 01:12:53.700]   white tic-tac-shaped object with no wings,
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:56.500]   flying in ways you've never thought possible,
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:59.220]   and in some interview somewhere you said,
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:01.820]   "I think it was not from this world."
[01:13:01.820 --> 01:13:05.180]   So there's a mysterious aspect to this object,
[01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.500]   to this entire situation.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:09.320]   There's videos involved,
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:14.320]   the video of a flare forward looking infrared--
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:17.540]   - Receiver.
[01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:19.980]   - Receiver, there's also visible light,
[01:13:19.980 --> 01:13:20.900]   so you can switch--
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:21.820]   - Yeah, it's TV mode.
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:24.420]   - It's a TV mode, so that gives you visible light,
[01:13:24.420 --> 01:13:26.580]   and then it has IR mode.
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:29.900]   And Chad Underwood recorded that video.
[01:13:29.900 --> 01:13:31.740]   So, and those are the videos that were released
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.780]   by the Pentagon later, one of the three videos.
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:39.780]   The two other videos, Go Fast and Gimbal,
[01:13:39.780 --> 01:13:43.620]   were recorded in 2000 and something, '14 or '15,
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:48.340]   on the East Coast of the United States.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.760]   They had different kinds of objects,
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:53.500]   but they were weird in the same kind of way,
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:57.940]   in terms of at least the videos and the experiences
[01:13:57.940 --> 01:14:01.220]   that people have described were similar
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.780]   in the degree of weirdness.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:07.380]   But the difference is, actually,
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.280]   on the East Coast, the 2014 case,
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:13.140]   very few people have spoken about it.
[01:14:13.140 --> 01:14:14.820]   And even in your situation,
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:16.660]   very few people have spoken about it.
[01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:18.900]   So there's a mystery to it,
[01:14:18.900 --> 01:14:23.240]   but in some sense, this is a quite simple story
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:26.540]   without much resolution to the mystery.
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.740]   And it's fascinating.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:31.380]   And there's a lot of opinions.
[01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:33.500]   There's division of opinions,
[01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:35.900]   because it's a mysterious, I mean,
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:40.240]   it truly is a UFO, in the sense that UAP.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:42.560]   What is it?
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:45.260]   Unidentified aerial phenomena.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:48.340]   So can you maybe correct me
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.140]   on any of the things I've gotten wrong,
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:52.020]   elaborate on some key things,
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:54.020]   and describe that experience in general?
[01:14:54.020 --> 01:14:55.060]   - So here's what I know.
[01:14:55.060 --> 01:15:00.060]   So yeah, we went out on our mission to go train,
[01:15:00.060 --> 01:15:03.380]   and they canceled the mission.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:04.220]   And they sent us down.
[01:15:04.220 --> 01:15:05.320]   There's all kinds of rumors out here.
[01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:07.580]   There's all kinds of, after this has come out.
[01:15:07.580 --> 01:15:09.580]   So originally it was the four of us.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.740]   There's two jets, two people in each jet.
[01:15:11.740 --> 01:15:12.580]   They're F-18Fs.
[01:15:12.580 --> 01:15:15.180]   Okay?
[01:15:15.180 --> 01:15:17.540]   There is no video from our event.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.780]   It was all four sets of eyeballs staring at this thing.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:21.540]   And then when we came back and told it,
[01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.700]   when Chad and his pilot took off,
[01:15:23.700 --> 01:15:25.220]   that's when Chad got the video of it.
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.420]   And we're like, that's it.
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:27.720]   That's exactly, that's it.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:30.460]   - So when you say eyeballs,
[01:15:30.460 --> 01:15:32.860]   you mean literally your eyes are seeing a thing?
[01:15:32.860 --> 01:15:33.700]   - Yeah.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.740]   So as we're flying out, we get vectored.
[01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:36.580]   They come up and tell us,
[01:15:36.580 --> 01:15:37.400]   hey, we're gonna cancel training.
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:38.460]   This is a USS Princeton.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:40.240]   So this is a Seagis cruiser.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.160]   So we're talking to one controller,
[01:15:42.160 --> 01:15:46.460]   who is like, hey, sir,
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:48.220]   first you ask what ordinance we have on board.
[01:15:48.220 --> 01:15:49.780]   And I laugh, 'cause we don't carry live ordinance
[01:15:49.780 --> 01:15:52.120]   in training typically, because bad stuff happens.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:53.820]   Usually someone forgets to put a switch on
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:55.940]   and then the missile comes off and hits a good airplane
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.100]   and it's not good.
[01:15:57.100 --> 01:15:59.300]   So we had what's called a CATM-9,
[01:15:59.300 --> 01:16:00.740]   which is really just a blue tube
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:02.700]   with the AIM-9 seeker on the front of it,
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:04.080]   which is an IR missile.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:06.660]   So there's only two ways to get it off.
[01:16:06.660 --> 01:16:07.860]   You can beat it off with a sledgehammer.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.100]   You can take this thing and you put a wrench in it
[01:16:10.100 --> 01:16:11.980]   and it unlocks the lugs and pulls the lugs back in
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:13.060]   that hold it on.
[01:16:13.060 --> 01:16:15.260]   When it really fires the impulse from the engine,
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:17.740]   actually throws the lugs forward and breaks that release
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.220]   and it comes off down the rail.
[01:16:19.220 --> 01:16:20.220]   That's how it works.
[01:16:21.180 --> 01:16:23.880]   So they said, "Hey, well, we have real world tasking."
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.200]   So as we're going out, my wingman, the other pilot,
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.620]   she maneuvers the airplane to the left-hand side of me.
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.800]   So she's kind of stepped up like this.
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.460]   And I'll use your mic box to start.
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.300]   So as we're going out,
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:39.080]   they're calling ranges are called BRA calls,
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.160]   bearing range and altitude.
[01:16:40.160 --> 01:16:43.080]   And they're telling us, "Hey, it's at 40 miles
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:44.920]   or 50 miles and 40 miles and 30 miles."
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:48.600]   So they're saying, "Hey, 270, 30, 20,000."
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:49.760]   That's all they say.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.900]   So we got our radars and we had mechanically scanned radars
[01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:55.200]   at the time, APG-73.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:58.220]   Good piece of gear, APG-79, new one's way better.
[01:16:58.220 --> 01:16:59.080]   But anyway.
[01:16:59.080 --> 01:17:01.580]   - And I apologize if I interrupt the story,
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:02.780]   hopefully it's useful.
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:05.180]   But they're telling you a location of a thing
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:06.180]   that you should look at?
[01:17:06.180 --> 01:17:07.140]   - Yep, they're telling us.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:08.500]   They have a contact on their radar.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:09.340]   They don't know what it is.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.180]   They just have a blip.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:11.580]   They have a little blip.
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.780]   Well, they've been watching these things.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:14.900]   And what he told me is they had been looking at these things
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:15.740]   as we're driving.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:16.580]   He says, "Sir, we've been tracking these things
[01:17:16.580 --> 01:17:17.420]   for about two weeks."
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:18.620]   We had been at sea for two weeks.
[01:17:18.620 --> 01:17:21.300]   He goes, "This is the first time we've had planes airborne.
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:23.220]   We want you to go see what these are."
[01:17:23.220 --> 01:17:24.060]   - Gotcha.
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:26.240]   So they kind of interrupt the mission to say,
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.080]   "Check it out."
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:27.900]   - That's exactly it.
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.620]   So we start driving out there.
[01:17:29.620 --> 01:17:32.740]   And as we get down to, he's going, you know,
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:35.220]   20 miles, 15 miles, 10 miles.
[01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:36.980]   And then you get to a point where they call merge plot,
[01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:39.580]   which means we are inside of the resolution cell
[01:17:39.580 --> 01:17:40.420]   of the radar.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.820]   'Cause radars don't see everything.
[01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:45.820]   So they have a range and they have an azimuth resolution.
[01:17:45.820 --> 01:17:46.660]   Right?
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:48.260]   So, and it's basically, think of a little cube.
[01:17:48.260 --> 01:17:50.100]   So they can, and the whole sky is made
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:52.300]   of all these little cubes and they're looking.
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:54.220]   So if you're inside a cube with something
[01:17:54.220 --> 01:17:56.180]   and you're both inside the same little cube,
[01:17:56.180 --> 01:17:57.980]   then the radar can only see one thing.
[01:17:57.980 --> 01:17:58.820]   Does that make sense?
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:17:59.640]   - Yep.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:01.140]   - So they call merge plot.
[01:18:01.140 --> 01:18:03.060]   Well, when we say merge plot to us,
[01:18:03.060 --> 01:18:04.340]   it means he's right around,
[01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.860]   something's around you, get your head out.
[01:18:05.860 --> 01:18:07.900]   So we're not looking at radar scopes anymore.
[01:18:07.900 --> 01:18:09.140]   And the Wizzos, the Wizzos can look,
[01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:10.660]   but everyone, it's heads out.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:12.040]   When they say merge plot,
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.640]   you're done looking at your displays inside,
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:15.880]   you're doing this and you're trying to find it.
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:19.240]   So as we look out to the right and you look high and low,
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:21.680]   'cause he could be anywhere from the surface all the way up.
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:24.240]   Now keep in mind, the ship is like probably 60 miles away.
[01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:27.280]   So it can't see the surface and you can do
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:29.440]   your standard radar horizon calculation and go,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:33.120]   hey, it's the thing is 40 feet off the water, the panel.
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:34.760]   Can he really see, you know,
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:36.720]   there are radars that can see around the curve,
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:40.160]   but let's just say that it can't at this time.
[01:18:40.160 --> 01:18:42.640]   So you go, is it, you know, where is it at?
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.320]   So as we're looking around, we see,
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.400]   you know, this is a, it's a clear day.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:51.200]   There's no clouds and there's no white caps.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.400]   It's just a calm, it's actually a perfect day.
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.320]   If you own a sailboat, it was that five to 10 knots of wind.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.600]   And you just want to kind of go out there
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:18:59.800]   and you're not going to get beat up
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:01.080]   and have white water come out.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.880]   It was the perfect day to own a sailboat.
[01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:05.000]   - How many miles out do you see like seven,
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.240]   like you see just, it's a clear day.
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:08.840]   - That's 50, it's unrestricted visibility.
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:10.440]   You can see literally all the way to the horizon.
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:12.600]   It's just clear, it's nothing.
[01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.800]   And we're basically off the coast.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.720]   If you look at a map and you go San Diego
[01:19:15.720 --> 01:19:18.800]   and then inside of Mexico, we're kind of in between that.
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:22.120]   And we're probably about, by the time this all hits,
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.320]   we're probably, I don't know, 80, 100, I don't know,
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:28.280]   but somewhere out, it's pretty far off the coast.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:29.320]   - Perfect visibility.
[01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:31.000]   - From 20,000 feet, you'd be amazed.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:32.040]   You can do the calculation.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.080]   You can see stuff, you know, you'll see land 50 miles away.
[01:19:35.080 --> 01:19:38.160]   You can see, you know, and when you're looking at a continent
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:40.040]   it's really easy to see you're not looking at an island.
[01:19:40.040 --> 01:19:41.600]   I mean, you're looking at Mexico.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:43.480]   - And you can see on the white caps in the water.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   If there is any.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:45.680]   - Oh yeah, they're easy.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.280]   Yeah, for us, we look at it because we know
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.960]   if it's natural wind or, so if it's a really white cap
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   windy day, then the ship's just kind of barely be moving
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:53.800]   when we land on it.
[01:19:53.800 --> 01:19:55.440]   It makes it actually easier.
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:57.360]   If the ship has to move or it's got a big weight
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.160]   'cause it has to make its own wind when we land,
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:01.960]   which is the day that it was this day, you go, oh, okay.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.080]   And it creates what's called, we call it the burble,
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:06.000]   but when the air flows across the flight deck,
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.240]   it drops behind the ship, you know?
[01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.640]   And then it kicks back up.
[01:20:09.640 --> 01:20:10.920]   So when you're coming aboard to land,
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:12.200]   it's gonna make you go up a little bit
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:13.080]   and then you're gonna fall
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.680]   and you gotta anticipate that to stay on glide slope.
[01:20:15.680 --> 01:20:20.600]   So we're pretty conscious of what's going on out there
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:21.720]   with the waves and the wind.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:24.120]   So we look, there's no waves, there's no wind,
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:26.280]   there's no white caps, and we look down
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.320]   and we see white water.
[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:31.200]   So if you put a piece of land, a seamount,
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.840]   below the surface, like, you know,
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:35.160]   even 20 feet below the surface, it's big enough,
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.680]   as the waves come in, you know,
[01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:38.840]   waves have height and length.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.760]   When they come in, that's what happens on the shore.
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:42.080]   When a wave comes in, it hits
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:43.360]   and then it starts to collapse
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:44.680]   and it pushes the wave height up
[01:20:44.680 --> 01:20:46.120]   because it can't go anymore.
[01:20:46.120 --> 01:20:46.960]   And then it breaks off the top and you get-
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:47.800]   - And it crashes, yeah.
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:49.440]   And that's where you get the white.
[01:20:49.440 --> 01:20:51.880]   - So what happens is at sea, when you get a seamount,
[01:20:51.880 --> 01:20:53.760]   you'll see stuff come in, the wave will crash
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:54.760]   and you'll get white water.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.120]   You can go out when it's high tide
[01:20:57.120 --> 01:20:59.040]   and any one of the coasts,
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.960]   you can go out here off of Boston and go,
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:02.640]   "Hey, at low tide, I can see those rocks
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.320]   and at high tide, I can't see the rocks are covered,"
[01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:05.800]   but there'll be white water around those rocks.
[01:21:05.800 --> 01:21:06.760]   You'll be able to tell there's something
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   underneath the surface.
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.600]   Does that make sense?
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:09.440]   - Yep.
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:10.280]   - So that's what it was.
[01:21:10.280 --> 01:21:12.040]   We don't see an object 'cause there's all kinds of,
[01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:14.840]   "Oh, they saw another craft below the wave."
[01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.680]   We didn't see anything below the water.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:18.040]   We just saw white water.
[01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   But the white water, and I like to shape it,
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.120]   you can say it was across.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.960]   I say it's about the size of a 737.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.360]   So it looks like if you took a 737,
[01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:27.520]   put it about 15, 20 feet below the water
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.920]   so the wave's breaking over the top
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:30.720]   and you're gonna get white water where the plane is at,
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.480]   you'd see this kind of shape.
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.720]   So it looks like a cross.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:36.720]   So as we're looking down off the right side,
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:39.320]   the back seat or any other airplane, Jim,
[01:21:39.320 --> 01:21:41.480]   says, this is that talking in partials again,
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:43.120]   he says, "Hey, Skipper, do you?"
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:44.680]   And that's about what he gets out of his mouth.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:46.960]   And I go, "What the hell is that?"
[01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:47.800]   In a nice way.
[01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:48.640]   - Do you see that essentially is what he's saying?
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.240]   - So we see the white water,
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:51.640]   and that's what draws our eyes down there.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.080]   Otherwise, we'd have never seen it.
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:53.920]   So we see this white water.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.720]   - I would have loved to see the look on your face
[01:21:55.720 --> 01:21:56.560]   when you see that.
[01:21:56.560 --> 01:21:57.380]   Like, "What?" - And then we see
[01:21:57.380 --> 01:21:59.120]   this little white tic-tac
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:00.960]   'cause we're about 20,000 feet above it.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:03.640]   And it's doing, it's going basically north, south,
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.920]   and then east, west, north, south.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.760]   It's abrupt.
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:06.580]   It's very abrupt.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:08.860]   It's not like a helicopter.
[01:22:08.860 --> 01:22:10.700]   If a helicopter's going sideways,
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:12.420]   and it goes once, it's going sideways, left,
[01:22:12.420 --> 01:22:13.900]   and it goes right, what it'll do is it'll go,
[01:22:13.900 --> 01:22:16.900]   it's got a speed, it slows down 'cause there's inertia,
[01:22:16.900 --> 01:22:18.660]   and it stops, and then it goes back the other way.
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:19.500]   This thing's not.
[01:22:19.500 --> 01:22:21.980]   It's like left, right, left, right, with no-
[01:22:21.980 --> 01:22:26.260]   - So moving in ways that doesn't feel intuitive to you
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:27.980]   of the things you've seen in the past.
[01:22:27.980 --> 01:22:30.300]   - So as a pilot, the first thing you think is,
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:32.400]   it's a helicopter, right?
[01:22:32.400 --> 01:22:33.580]   So you go, "Oh."
[01:22:33.580 --> 01:22:34.860]   What is, 'cause when we see it's moving,
[01:22:34.860 --> 01:22:36.700]   we're like, "Oh, helicopter."
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:37.860]   So the first thing you look for to see
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:39.380]   if it's a helicopter when they're doing that,
[01:22:39.380 --> 01:22:41.100]   because usually when they get down there
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:43.700]   towards that 50 feet, you'll get rotor wash.
[01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:45.740]   You see it in the movies when the helicopter's by the water,
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:48.980]   it kicks, water comes up the sides 'cause the downdraft,
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:50.340]   you know, like a thunderstorm will do that.
[01:22:50.340 --> 01:22:51.320]   It pushes the air down,
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:53.200]   and then it has to come up the sides.
[01:22:53.200 --> 01:22:56.540]   So you see it, and you go, "Well, there's no rotor wash.
[01:22:56.540 --> 01:22:58.280]   "What is that thing?"
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.740]   So by this time we're driving around,
[01:22:59.740 --> 01:23:01.160]   so as we're, if we were at the six o'clock,
[01:23:01.160 --> 01:23:03.220]   we're driving around towards that nine o'clock position,
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:04.300]   and we're just watching this thing.
[01:23:04.300 --> 01:23:05.900]   And it's just, it's still pointing north, south,
[01:23:05.900 --> 01:23:07.280]   and it's going left, right,
[01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:09.460]   and it's kind of moving around the object.
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.700]   And if it had, if I had to say it biased itself,
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:13.300]   it was biased towards the bottom half.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.700]   So if you've got the east, west,
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.800]   and then the north, south kind of across,
[01:23:16.800 --> 01:23:18.820]   it's hanging out on the southern thing that's hanging out.
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:20.220]   It's just kind of moving around up, down, left,
[01:23:20.220 --> 01:23:21.580]   and it's crossing over it, and it's going up.
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:23.380]   It's just kind of, so now we're like,
[01:23:23.380 --> 01:23:25.300]   "Oh, what the hell is that?"
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.380]   So then I go, "Hey, I'm gonna go check it out."
[01:23:28.380 --> 01:23:31.180]   And the other pilot says, "I'm gonna stay up here."
[01:23:31.180 --> 01:23:32.740]   And I said, "Yeah, stay up high."
[01:23:32.740 --> 01:23:35.220]   'Cause now we get a different perspective.
[01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:37.660]   So she's up here, and I'm down here.
[01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:39.820]   As I'm descending, she can watch,
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:42.780]   'cause right now all I'm watching is the Tic Tac.
[01:23:42.780 --> 01:23:44.580]   She can watch me and the Tic Tac.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.820]   So she gets a God's eye view of everything that's going on,
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:47.940]   which is really important.
[01:23:47.940 --> 01:23:49.780]   You know, you can hear people say it's high cover,
[01:23:49.780 --> 01:23:52.100]   whatever, she's watching me.
[01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:54.380]   Which is, it's perfect as the story goes on,
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.900]   'cause it gives us two perspectives,
[01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:00.060]   you know, of a perspective that's about 8,000 feet above us
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.180]   when that thing disappears.
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:02.540]   And they don't, you know, 'cause if it just like,
[01:24:02.540 --> 01:24:03.860]   "Oh, I lost it."
[01:24:03.860 --> 01:24:04.900]   And they go, "No, it's over to the right.
[01:24:04.900 --> 01:24:05.740]   "We can still see it."
[01:24:05.740 --> 01:24:07.700]   We all lost it at the same time.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:09.660]   So as we come down, we get to about 12 o'clock
[01:24:09.660 --> 01:24:11.020]   and I'm descending, and it's an easy descent.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.380]   I'm doing about 300 knots,
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:14.820]   which is a really good airspeed for the airplane
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:18.060]   for maneuvering, 'cause I have everything available to me
[01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:19.540]   at that speed.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:22.180]   So I'm coming down, and as I get to 12 o'clock,
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.020]   as the Tic Tac's doing this,
[01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.820]   it literally, it's like it's aware of us,
[01:24:24.820 --> 01:24:25.700]   and it just goes, "Bloop."
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.220]   And it kind of points out towards the west
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:29.540]   and starts coming up.
[01:24:29.540 --> 01:24:31.420]   So now it's obviously knows that we're there,
[01:24:31.420 --> 01:24:33.780]   whatever this thing is, it knows that we're there.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:35.460]   So as we drive around, it's coming up
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.060]   and I'm just coming down, I'm just watching it.
[01:24:37.060 --> 01:24:38.460]   Now you gotta remember, this whole thing is like,
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.620]   this is like five minutes.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:41.740]   This is not like we saw it and it was gone.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:44.340]   Or, "Ooh, I saw lights in the sky and they were gone."
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:47.660]   We watch this thing on a crystal clear day
[01:24:47.660 --> 01:24:50.580]   with four trained observers to watch this thing fly around.
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:52.020]   So we're like, "Okay."
[01:24:52.020 --> 01:24:54.060]   So I get over to the eight o'clock position,
[01:24:54.060 --> 01:24:56.060]   and I'm a little, I'm a couple thousand feet above it,
[01:24:56.060 --> 01:24:58.540]   and it's about, so I'm probably at about 15K,
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:00.340]   I think it is, I think that's my story, is about 15.
[01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:01.780]   That's just estimating.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:05.060]   So you can see it's just a really easy descent because--
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:06.260]   - So what's 15K?
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:07.300]   - 15,000 feet.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.700]   - I thought it was 8,000.
[01:25:08.700 --> 01:25:10.980]   - No, the other airplane ends up about,
[01:25:10.980 --> 01:25:11.820]   so you can go back to that.
[01:25:11.820 --> 01:25:12.660]   - Okay, gotcha.
[01:25:12.660 --> 01:25:14.420]   - So they're still at about 20,000 feet.
[01:25:14.420 --> 01:25:15.260]   So they're driving around above us.
[01:25:15.260 --> 01:25:16.100]   - Okay, and then you're slowly--
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:17.420]   - And I'm descending, they're staying up there.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:20.820]   So I'm kind of doing this as a driver, okay?
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.020]   So I'm looking at this thing
[01:25:22.020 --> 01:25:23.620]   and it's about the two o'clock position,
[01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.740]   we're about the eight o'clock position,
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.100]   and I'm like, "Oh, I've got enough altitudes.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.700]   "I'm gonna cut across the circle."
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:31.620]   I tell the guy in my back seat, "Dude, I'm gonna do this."
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.620]   He's like, "Go for it, skip," 'cause I was a skipper.
[01:25:34.620 --> 01:25:36.220]   So I cut across the bottom.
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:39.740]   So I'm kind of almost coming out co-altitude
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:41.620]   as this thing's coming out, I'm gonna meet it.
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:44.860]   And I'm driving and I get to probably,
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.140]   I'm probably about a half mile away,
[01:25:46.140 --> 01:25:47.540]   which you think, "Well, a half mile's pretty far."
[01:25:47.540 --> 01:25:50.300]   Half mile in aviation, it's nothing.
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:52.500]   I mean, you can tell there's a pilot in an airplane,
[01:25:52.500 --> 01:25:54.380]   you can see all kinds of stuff at a half mile.
[01:25:54.380 --> 01:25:56.140]   You can see pretty good detail.
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:58.500]   So I'm like right there and it's coming across my nose.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:00.220]   So now I'm basically pointing back towards east.
[01:26:00.220 --> 01:26:01.780]   So I'm cutting across 'cause I'm going
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:03.500]   to the three o'clock position, it's at two o'clock,
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.620]   and I'm gonna meet it at three o'clock.
[01:26:05.620 --> 01:26:08.780]   So as I do this, it just accelerates and disappears.
[01:26:08.780 --> 01:26:11.780]   So this happens at around, estimate in about 12,000 feet.
[01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:13.580]   So they're at 20, so they've got about 8,000 foot
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:16.060]   of altitude above us when this happens.
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:17.860]   And it just, as it crosses our nose,
[01:26:17.860 --> 01:26:21.140]   it just accelerates and literally in less than,
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:22.700]   probably less than a half second, it just goes,
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:24.260]   and it's gone.
[01:26:24.260 --> 01:26:27.020]   And so we're like, and the first thing is,
[01:26:27.020 --> 01:26:29.140]   "Dude, did you guys see it?"
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.860]   The other airplane's like, "It's gone.
[01:26:30.860 --> 01:26:32.580]   "We have no idea where it's at."
[01:26:32.580 --> 01:26:33.980]   So we kind of spin around real quick.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:35.380]   I go, "Well, let's see what's down here."
[01:26:35.380 --> 01:26:37.740]   And I turn around, we're looking for the whitewater.
[01:26:37.740 --> 01:26:38.900]   And we can't, the whitewater's gone.
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:39.740]   There's nothing.
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.100]   It's literally all blue.
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:43.660]   So now you go, and I remember telling the guy
[01:26:43.660 --> 01:26:46.700]   in my back seat, I go, "Dude, I don't know about you,
[01:26:46.700 --> 01:26:48.580]   "but I'm pretty weirded out 'cause this is,
[01:26:48.580 --> 01:26:52.140]   "I mean, I had at the time, like 30 some hundred hours
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:53.740]   "of flying, I'd been doing it for 18 years."
[01:26:53.740 --> 01:26:55.500]   - It's nothing like anything you've seen.
[01:26:55.500 --> 01:26:56.340]   - No, no.
[01:26:56.340 --> 01:26:59.820]   So as we turn, we go, "Oh, well, let's just go back."
[01:26:59.820 --> 01:27:02.340]   'Cause now I got to put on my real hat,
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:03.700]   which we have to train 'cause we're getting ready
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:06.280]   to deploy to overseas.
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:07.380]   So we got to get our training done.
[01:27:07.380 --> 01:27:09.460]   So that's my mindset, especially as a CO,
[01:27:09.460 --> 01:27:11.820]   'cause I got to get training out of the flight time
[01:27:11.820 --> 01:27:13.100]   because I'm responsible to do that.
[01:27:13.100 --> 01:27:14.420]   So, "Hey, let's go back."
[01:27:14.420 --> 01:27:16.880]   And the guy who's going to be the bad guys
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.940]   is the CO of the Marine Squadron.
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:20.300]   And so Cheeks is at the,
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:22.180]   he's listening to all this happen.
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:23.340]   'Cause he's just like, I don't know.
[01:27:23.340 --> 01:27:25.340]   'Cause when he first went out, they were going to do him,
[01:27:25.340 --> 01:27:28.460]   but the little Hornets, the legacy Hornets, the F-18Cs,
[01:27:28.460 --> 01:27:30.820]   don't have as much gas as the Super Hornets.
[01:27:30.820 --> 01:27:33.260]   So he had launched first and they were going to do him.
[01:27:33.260 --> 01:27:34.620]   And then when they knew we were off the deck,
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:37.300]   they just told him, "Hey, go to your cap point down South.
[01:27:37.300 --> 01:27:39.260]   And we're going to send,
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.020]   we'll pass this off to the Super Hornets."
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.300]   - What's the cap point, by the way?
[01:27:43.300 --> 01:27:44.380]   - That's where we hold.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:46.580]   So it's called a combat air patrol point.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.100]   So we're just going to hold at one end.
[01:27:48.100 --> 01:27:49.840]   He's going to hold at the other end.
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:51.420]   It's kind of like, "Hey, you guys are going to get each."
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:53.420]   It's thinking about, if it's a football field,
[01:27:53.420 --> 01:27:54.640]   we're going to sit on one goal line.
[01:27:54.640 --> 01:27:55.860]   He's going to sit on the other goal line.
[01:27:55.860 --> 01:27:57.580]   And when they say, "Go," we're going to run at each other
[01:27:57.580 --> 01:27:59.260]   and try and do something in the middle of the field
[01:27:59.260 --> 01:28:01.700]   and then go back to our reset points.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:03.340]   - So you're talking to him.
[01:28:03.340 --> 01:28:04.940]   He's listening to all the stuff.
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:05.780]   - He's just listening.
[01:28:05.780 --> 01:28:06.600]   We don't talk to him at all.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.440]   He's just listening.
[01:28:07.440 --> 01:28:08.260]   He just dials up 'cause they know that,
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.260]   we all know the frequencies.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.420]   So he's listening to what's going on.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:12.780]   'Cause he's like, 'cause they canceled training.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:13.620]   So what else is he going to do?
[01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:15.100]   He's just going to hang out there and do circles
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.580]   while he's waiting for him and his wingman.
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:18.700]   So they're listening to all this go on.
[01:28:18.700 --> 01:28:20.420]   - And then at this point you move on.
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:21.840]   - Yeah, we come back up to train.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.160]   We go back as we're flying back, the controller,
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.560]   'cause we're talking to the kid on the Princeton,
[01:28:26.560 --> 01:28:30.000]   they're called OSs, they're operation specialists.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   They're the ones that run the radars.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:33.760]   And we're talking to him and he's like,
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.080]   "Hey sir, you're not going to believe this,
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:36.960]   but that thing is at your cap."
[01:28:36.960 --> 01:28:38.920]   It showed back up, it just popped up.
[01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.040]   This is like 60 miles away.
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:40.880]   It just reappears.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:42.440]   We're like, "Oh, okay."
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:44.920]   So we got the radars out, we're looking for it.
[01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.320]   We get out there, we never see it.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:48.280]   We never see it again.
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.200]   We do what we need to do.
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:50.480]   We come back to the ship.
[01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:52.520]   Of course, now we're like, "Oh, this is going to be."
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:54.160]   I told him, I go, "Dude, you know,
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.600]   we're going to catch shit for this.
[01:28:56.600 --> 01:28:58.400]   When we get back to the ship, word's going to get out
[01:28:58.400 --> 01:28:59.800]   and we're just going to catch maximum shit."
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:00.640]   And we did.
[01:29:00.640 --> 01:29:02.680]   And it's kind of that joking.
[01:29:02.680 --> 01:29:04.280]   So the ship plays movies.
[01:29:04.280 --> 01:29:06.620]   We have movies on the boat and they do 12 hours of movies.
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:07.960]   So they repeat, 'cause there's a day check
[01:29:07.960 --> 01:29:08.800]   and a night check.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:10.520]   So the same movies in the morning and night plays.
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:12.420]   So you never get to ever get to watch a whole movie
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:14.980]   on the boat, which drives my wife crazy
[01:29:14.980 --> 01:29:16.600]   'cause I'll watch stuff on TV that way too.
[01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:17.840]   I'll be like, "Oh, here, I've seen this."
[01:29:17.840 --> 01:29:19.520]   And then I'll jump into a movie in the middle
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:21.520]   and then I'll pick it up later and I'll see the beginning
[01:29:21.520 --> 01:29:23.520]   and I'll put it all together
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.000]   because that's how we have to do it 'cause we're so busy.
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.540]   Well, the movies became, it was Men in Black, Aliens,
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:33.680]   Independence Day.
[01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.800]   - Definitely going to catch some shit.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:36.640]   - Oh, we did.
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:37.880]   (laughs)
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:40.440]   - But let me just ask some dumb questions.
[01:29:40.440 --> 01:29:41.840]   So just take it, 'cause it's,
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.720]   whatever the heck you saw, whatever the heck happened,
[01:29:45.720 --> 01:29:50.720]   it's one of the most fascinating things,
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:55.120]   events in recent history.
[01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:59.160]   So whatever it was, it's interesting to talk about
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.160]   at different kinds of angles.
[01:30:00.160 --> 01:30:01.680]   There's no good answers, but it's interesting
[01:30:01.680 --> 01:30:03.460]   to ask some dumb questions here.
[01:30:03.460 --> 01:30:05.600]   So first of all, you mentioned,
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.000]   so you saw at some point X, Y,
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:11.920]   and then somebody in the Princeton said,
[01:30:11.920 --> 01:30:13.600]   "You're not gonna believe this, sir.
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:14.840]   "It's at your cap point."
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.240]   Now, that's a different place.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.240]   How the heck did it know what your cap point is?
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:19.520]   - That's a good question.
[01:30:19.520 --> 01:30:23.000]   And that's the one, no one, we don't tell it,
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:26.200]   we don't broadcast it, we have a waypoint in the system.
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:28.120]   But I don't know, maybe it knew where we were going,
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:30.000]   'cause we use the same one day after day after day.
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:31.400]   - Right, it's just using.
[01:30:31.400 --> 01:30:32.840]   - But it obviously knew where we were going.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.240]   - But you never saw it there.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:35.060]   - Never saw it there.
[01:30:35.060 --> 01:30:36.840]   Chad, when he took off, when he got the video,
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:38.280]   we landed, we told them, "Hey, look,
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.640]   "we just chased this thing."
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:41.720]   They're like, "What'd I go?"
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:42.560]   "Chased it."
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.800]   And they're like, "What'd I go?"
[01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:46.840]   "Dude, I told him, I said, 'Dude, get video.'"
[01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.480]   And he goes, and that's how he is.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.880]   He's like, "I'm gonna go."
[01:30:49.880 --> 01:30:51.560]   And he was, he was determined
[01:30:51.560 --> 01:30:52.400]   that he was gonna find this thing.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:55.080]   So when you look at his video,
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:56.580]   and this is the stuff that isn't out,
[01:30:56.580 --> 01:30:58.400]   that they don't see because not all the,
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:30:59.600]   all you see is the FLIR tape.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:01.040]   That's the targeting pod,
[01:31:01.040 --> 01:31:02.940]   the forward-looking infrared receiver.
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:05.200]   - I'll probably overlay the video
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.040]   for people who've seen it.
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:08.120]   - When he goes out, it's, you know,
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.960]   what he's looking at on his displays is,
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.360]   he has basically two radar displays up.
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:14.640]   He has azimuth and range on the right one,
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.680]   and he has azimuth and elevation on the left one.
[01:31:16.680 --> 01:31:18.500]   So this is called the az-L display,
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:20.780]   and this is called, this is basically the PPI,
[01:31:20.780 --> 01:31:22.960]   which is the, you're at the bottom of it.
[01:31:22.960 --> 01:31:24.480]   You're at the bottom of the square.
[01:31:24.480 --> 01:31:26.880]   It's really taking this, it's taking a cone,
[01:31:26.880 --> 01:31:29.460]   'cause a radar really looks left and right from a point,
[01:31:29.460 --> 01:31:30.460]   and it squares it out.
[01:31:30.460 --> 01:31:33.800]   So the entire bottom of the scope that we look at is us,
[01:31:33.800 --> 01:31:35.400]   'cause they do this, they square it off.
[01:31:35.400 --> 01:31:38.040]   So he goes out, and when he first sees it,
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.200]   he gets a radar return on it,
[01:31:39.200 --> 01:31:40.640]   because when he's not trying to lock it,
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:42.560]   so the radar's just throwing energy out and getting it,
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:44.440]   you know, it's a Doppler radar.
[01:31:44.440 --> 01:31:46.040]   So when it's in search mode, that's all it's doing.
[01:31:46.040 --> 01:31:47.920]   It's going, "Oh, I can see you, I can see you."
[01:31:47.920 --> 01:31:48.760]   And it's looking for return.
[01:31:48.760 --> 01:31:50.960]   So he gets a return, so he wants to see what it is,
[01:31:50.960 --> 01:31:52.520]   because all you get is a little green square,
[01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:54.240]   unless it builds a track file on it.
[01:31:54.240 --> 01:31:55.800]   But a little green square is just sitting there.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:32:00.000]   It's not moving, 'cause it's sitting in one spot in space.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:00.920]   He locks it up.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:01.880]   When he goes to lock it up,
[01:32:01.880 --> 01:32:03.880]   now he's putting a bunch of energy on it.
[01:32:03.880 --> 01:32:05.920]   He's telling the radar, "Stare down that line of sight,
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:07.760]   and whatever's there, I want you to grab it
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:08.840]   and build a track file on it,
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.640]   which will tell us how high it is, how fast it is,
[01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:13.720]   and the direction that it's going, okay?"
[01:32:13.720 --> 01:32:17.120]   The radar's smart enough that when the signal comes back,
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:19.200]   if it's been messed with, it will tell you,
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:21.720]   it'll give you indications that I'm being jammed.
[01:32:21.720 --> 01:32:23.800]   So that's all it is, is you send a signal out,
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:25.640]   something, it manipulates the signal,
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.400]   either in range and velocity or whatever,
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:28.400]   and it sends it back.
[01:32:28.400 --> 01:32:30.360]   And the radar was smart enough to go,
[01:32:30.360 --> 01:32:32.680]   "That is not a return that I'm expecting.
[01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:34.720]   Something's messing with me, I'm being jammed."
[01:32:34.720 --> 01:32:36.440]   And it shows you, and it puts strobes up,
[01:32:36.440 --> 01:32:38.040]   it gives these lines on the radar,
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.000]   and it does some stuff.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:41.880]   So you can, well, it does, it goes full into,
[01:32:41.880 --> 01:32:44.360]   it's being jammed at about every mode you can possibly see,
[01:32:44.360 --> 01:32:45.320]   'cause everything comes up,
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.720]   and this aspect gets along, it's all kinds of,
[01:32:47.720 --> 01:32:48.640]   I don't wanna get into details,
[01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.680]   but you can tell it's being jammed.
[01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:51.520]   So, and it's what does-
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:52.480]   - As you said on Rogan, by the way,
[01:32:52.480 --> 01:32:54.280]   that jamming is an act of war, right?
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.120]   - Act of jamming is, when you actively jam
[01:32:56.120 --> 01:32:58.120]   another platform, yes, it's technically an act of war.
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:00.480]   - Feels like you should be freaking out at this point.
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:01.320]   I mean-
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:04.280]   - So, well, he does it, and then in the back seat,
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:05.720]   so they don't have a stick and throttle,
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:07.200]   they have their side stick controllers,
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:09.160]   so they can control all the sensors,
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:10.840]   and they can just toggle around and do stuff.
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:14.680]   So he has the ability to just move one switch real quick,
[01:33:14.680 --> 01:33:16.720]   and it will go from that azimuth elevation on the radar
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:18.280]   to the targeting pod.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.840]   Well, as soon as he commanded the radar
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:22.320]   to look at that target, the targeting pod goes,
[01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.200]   "Oh, what's over there?"
[01:33:23.200 --> 01:33:24.960]   And it'll stare, 'cause it goes down the line of sight,
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:27.000]   'cause all the systems are hooked together.
[01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:28.040]   You can decouple them,
[01:33:28.040 --> 01:33:30.080]   but they're gonna automatically couple up.
[01:33:30.080 --> 01:33:32.680]   So when he castles over, it's a switch,
[01:33:32.680 --> 01:33:34.640]   it looks like a castle switch, what's a castle switch?
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:36.000]   When he moves that thing to the left,
[01:33:36.000 --> 01:33:37.920]   and he swaps the displays out, and he says,
[01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:38.800]   "Instead of looking at the radar,
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:40.600]   "I wanna look at the targeting pod,"
[01:33:40.600 --> 01:33:41.800]   he sees it on the targeting pod,
[01:33:41.800 --> 01:33:43.920]   'cause the targeting pod's already looking there.
[01:33:43.920 --> 01:33:45.360]   And now he's on a passive track,
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:47.480]   'cause he's not literally sending any energy out,
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:50.640]   he's just receiving IR energy from the TIC-TAC,
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:53.760]   and then the system itself will track the pixels
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:56.120]   and the contrast differences, it depends on what mode you're in.
[01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.760]   So it says, "Oh," and that's where those little bars
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.440]   you see in the video where the bars come up left and right.
[01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:02.040]   - He's doing some vision-based tracking.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:03.800]   - That's exactly what it is.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.240]   So, and then- - And that's the video.
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:07.560]   - He goes through- - Changes zooms,
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.600]   changes the mode. - He goes through all the modes,
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.440]   so there's a narrow, medium, and wide.
[01:34:11.440 --> 01:34:14.320]   So wide is far away, medium, and then narrow,
[01:34:14.320 --> 01:34:15.800]   and then there's the TV mode,
[01:34:15.800 --> 01:34:18.400]   and he goes from IR mode to the TV mode.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:23.400]   The cool thing with the TV mode is narrow IR mode
[01:34:23.400 --> 01:34:25.960]   is only medium TV mode.
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:28.280]   So you can actually get closer with narrow TV mode,
[01:34:28.280 --> 01:34:31.080]   it's got a better zoom capability when you go into TV mode.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:33.240]   So he goes through all those things,
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:34.080]   and that's when you see it going
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:35.640]   from a black background to a white background.
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:37.440]   - He's trying to figure out what the heck is this.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.000]   - Well, yeah, and he wants to get as much data
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:40.840]   as he can on it based on the different modes
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.960]   instead of just staring at it going, "What is that thing?"
[01:34:43.960 --> 01:34:46.800]   Granted, so the video has been out,
[01:34:46.800 --> 01:34:49.400]   it actually was on YouTube for years
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:50.600]   before the government released it.
[01:34:50.600 --> 01:34:54.160]   - It was leaked in 2000, what, seven?
[01:34:54.160 --> 01:34:57.560]   - About, no, I got a, the guy that was in my backseat
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:00.440]   sent me an email, and I had retired.
[01:35:00.440 --> 01:35:03.800]   So this is about, nope, 'cause I was working,
[01:35:03.800 --> 01:35:05.000]   I was working down in San Diego.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:08.400]   So this is about 2008, early 2009.
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:14.840]   He sends me a link to strangeland.com,
[01:35:14.840 --> 01:35:16.320]   which is not suitable for work.
[01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:18.160]   Oh yeah, it's top notch.
[01:35:18.160 --> 01:35:20.880]   And he says, "Hey," I can remember the email,
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.720]   "Hey, Skip, does this look familiar?"
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:25.560]   And I look at it, I'm like,
[01:35:25.560 --> 01:35:29.840]   "How the hell did that get on strangeland.com?"
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:33.160]   So next thing you know, it ends up on YouTube,
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:34.880]   which was cool because you can send
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.520]   a YouTube link to someone.
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:39.560]   You don't send strangeland.com to someone
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:41.280]   'cause you don't know what you're gonna get.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:42.600]   It's like Googling kittens.
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.960]   So-- - So it ends up there somehow.
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:48.760]   - So it gets on YouTube, which was cool
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.680]   because I would go out with my friends
[01:35:50.680 --> 01:35:52.280]   and we'd be drinking and they'd go,
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:54.000]   "Dude, what's the coolest thing you ever saw flying?"
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.400]   You know, it's kinda like you were asking what it's like.
[01:35:55.400 --> 01:35:57.400]   And I go, "Oh dude, I chased a UFO."
[01:35:57.400 --> 01:35:58.280]   And they're like, "Get out."
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.120]   And I'm like, "No, serious."
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:00.960]   So this is literally how it happened.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:02.920]   So I was sitting with my friend Matt.
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:05.120]   So Matt and I did our, he was the guy
[01:36:05.120 --> 01:36:06.720]   in my right seat of the A6 when I did
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:08.720]   my very first night trap, right?
[01:36:08.720 --> 01:36:10.780]   And we were friends to this day, right?
[01:36:10.780 --> 01:36:13.520]   Because when you do stuff like people like that,
[01:36:13.520 --> 01:36:15.440]   you know, I had to have faith in him,
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:16.940]   he had to have faith in me.
[01:36:16.940 --> 01:36:19.200]   You know, they become like your brother.
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:22.440]   And these are guys that literally, you know,
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:23.960]   I don't talk to them on a regular basis.
[01:36:23.960 --> 01:36:25.920]   Like Chris, who works at Apple,
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:28.580]   if Chris called me up tomorrow and said,
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:30.640]   "Dude, I need help, I need this."
[01:36:30.640 --> 01:36:31.960]   I'd be like, "All right, let's figure this out
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:32.800]   and let's do it."
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:33.620]   'Cause it's, they're like family.
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:36.320]   You do it, and most Navy guys, we don't,
[01:36:36.320 --> 01:36:38.720]   we're not, we don't send letters to each other weekly.
[01:36:38.720 --> 01:36:39.960]   You know, I have friends that could,
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:41.000]   I haven't talked to in 10 years
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]   that they showed up on my door.
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.520]   You know, pop a bottle of wine, grab a beer,
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:47.880]   shoot the shit, take about first 10 minutes to catch up.
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.280]   And then it's like old times.
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:50.880]   And it's amazing how fast this happens.
[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:53.360]   So I'm out to dinner with Matt,
[01:36:53.360 --> 01:36:55.840]   and I'm telling him this story,
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:57.700]   and he's like, "Get out of here."
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.980]   So he goes back and he tells our friend Paco.
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:04.360]   Paco has a fightersweep.com, it's a blog site.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:09.600]   So Paco's obsessed, like he is way into UFOs.
[01:37:09.600 --> 01:37:11.120]   So Paco calls me up, he says,
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.600]   "Dude, I was talking to Matty."
[01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.440]   That's what we call him.
[01:37:13.440 --> 01:37:15.160]   He goes, "I was talking to Matty."
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:18.320]   He goes, "Dude, you got to tell me this story."
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.160]   So I'm like, all right.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.640]   So I spend a chunk of time.
[01:37:20.640 --> 01:37:23.800]   And so he calls me one day and I'm like,
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.960]   "I gotta get a voicemail.
[01:37:24.960 --> 01:37:25.800]   Hey, give me a call."
[01:37:25.800 --> 01:37:28.220]   So I call him up and he answers the phone,
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.600]   but I can hear people in the background.
[01:37:29.600 --> 01:37:30.440]   And I go, "Hey dude, what's going on?"
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.280]   And he goes, "Hey, hang on,
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:32.480]   I gotta put you on speakerphone."
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.320]   I go, "What are you putting me on speakerphone?"
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:34.280]   He goes, "You got to tell the story.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:36.360]   I'm having a dinner party."
[01:37:36.360 --> 01:37:37.280]   You got to tell the story.
[01:37:37.280 --> 01:37:38.780]   So he's literally having a dinner party
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:40.160]   with his cell phone in the middle of the table
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:42.320]   as I tell a Tic Tac story.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:43.460]   So he calls me up again, he says,
[01:37:43.460 --> 01:37:46.400]   "Hey, I got this blog."
[01:37:46.400 --> 01:37:48.160]   And he just writes about fighter stuff.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.360]   Like he wrote about, we call him the shit hot break.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.840]   That's a guy that when you're landing on a carrier,
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:54.540]   comes and turns and gets ready to land really fast,
[01:37:54.540 --> 01:37:57.000]   like breaks it off right at the back of the ship.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:58.920]   And one of the guys,
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:01.400]   when we were junior officers on the USS Ranger,
[01:38:01.400 --> 01:38:04.080]   one of the partners in our squadron was a guy, Nasty.
[01:38:04.080 --> 01:38:06.440]   And Nasty was notorious for coming in in a Tomcat
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:08.680]   and cranking off the shit hot break.
[01:38:08.680 --> 01:38:10.880]   So he literally wrote a thing
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:12.800]   about the shit hot break with Nasty.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.120]   And there's another guy, Mav,
[01:38:14.120 --> 01:38:19.120]   was one of our landing signals officers for the air wing.
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:21.980]   It's just a good article on how this was
[01:38:21.980 --> 01:38:24.680]   and how it kind of forms you in naval aviation,
[01:38:24.680 --> 01:38:26.340]   it's kind of become part of the club.
[01:38:26.340 --> 01:38:28.200]   So he's like, "I got to write about this thing."
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.280]   I'm like, "What do you guys, I got to write about it."
[01:38:29.280 --> 01:38:30.440]   I go, "All right."
[01:38:30.440 --> 01:38:31.840]   I go, 'cause at first I would say no.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:33.480]   I'm like, "Dude, I don't want this out there."
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:36.280]   - You haven't really before then talked about it much.
[01:38:36.280 --> 01:38:38.640]   - No, my wife didn't even really know the whole story.
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.280]   - What, just as a comment,
[01:38:40.280 --> 01:38:42.640]   is it just because you caught some--
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:45.440]   - No, it was just, I'll tell you what, three days,
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:46.800]   we had the incident.
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:49.240]   For about two days, they played the goofy movies.
[01:38:49.240 --> 01:38:51.680]   There's a comic on the back of the air wing schedule
[01:38:51.680 --> 01:38:52.520]   that they would put.
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:53.920]   It was like, first one was a far side
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:56.480]   and the second one was me and the guy in my back seat.
[01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.960]   And it was men in black, but it had our names,
[01:38:57.960 --> 01:39:00.720]   you know, protecting the Nimitz battle group type stuff.
[01:39:00.720 --> 01:39:02.360]   It was just funny shit like that.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:06.200]   So, no, it's just, to me it wasn't that big of a deal.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.160]   It was like, okay, that's weird.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:08.800]   We're never gonna know what it was.
[01:39:08.800 --> 01:39:10.680]   I want to get out there, 'cause this is important,
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.240]   'cause there's all kinds of rumors.
[01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:13.800]   There's a group of folks there.
[01:39:13.800 --> 01:39:19.920]   No one ever came out in suits to talk to us.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:24.360]   - Nobody looking like me came out on a--
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:26.080]   - No, no one came out on a helicopter.
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:28.160]   No one came out on an airplane.
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:29.840]   You know, you get, oh, I was told
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:30.960]   to turn over this classified.
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:33.000]   What's funny is all the COs,
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.840]   and several of them are still in the Navy.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:38.620]   There's one that is a, I think he just finished up.
[01:39:38.620 --> 01:39:40.880]   He was a captain of an aircraft carrier.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.080]   You know, so he'll end up making Admiral and all that stuff.
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:44.920]   Those guys are all my friends.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:46.800]   I talk to them daily.
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:50.160]   - Just to clarify, so just for people who don't know,
[01:39:50.160 --> 01:39:53.320]   there's a story that both on the Nimitz
[01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:58.320]   and the Princeton folks in a helicopter landed.
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:00.000]   They showed up.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.360]   They took the data, quote-unquote,
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:07.160]   so all the sort of recordings associated with this incident,
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.760]   and they took it and presumably deleted it.
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:13.140]   There's a kind of story to that.
[01:40:13.140 --> 01:40:15.960]   And then from what I've seen,
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:17.760]   you said that you believe,
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:19.460]   just like we were talking about offline,
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.640]   that jokes spread faster than,
[01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:25.040]   or just rumors spread faster than anything on these ships,
[01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.600]   that it might've been a joke that started and--
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:30.440]   - Well, they did.
[01:40:30.440 --> 01:40:31.640]   So here's the joke.
[01:40:31.640 --> 01:40:33.080]   So they had come down, right?
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.940]   We had the tapes, and they were Chad's tapes.
[01:40:36.940 --> 01:40:39.240]   So we use those tapes over and over again.
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:40.800]   You know, they're consumable,
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.280]   but remember, I have a budget as a squadron,
[01:40:42.280 --> 01:40:43.960]   so I have a budget, so I have to buy those tapes.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:45.640]   I have to, all that stuff that we used,
[01:40:45.640 --> 01:40:46.960]   I'm accountable for.
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:48.680]   And the tapes are actually classified secret
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.780]   because of the data that's on them, okay?
[01:40:50.780 --> 01:40:52.280]   So we had the tapes.
[01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.180]   So the security intelligence guys,
[01:40:55.180 --> 01:40:58.120]   the intel officers, came down from what's called CIVIC,
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:41:01.340]   it's C-V-I-C, which is Carrier Intel Center,
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:03.680]   came down and said, "Hey, we need the tapes.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.900]   "These guys are gonna come,
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:06.960]   "they're gonna come and get 'em."
[01:41:06.960 --> 01:41:09.320]   So we're like, "Oh," I'm like, "Oh, whatever," you know?
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.160]   So we hand 'em the tapes.
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:14.640]   And then someone, 'cause I have, you know, you know people,
[01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:16.720]   shortly after they came and got the tapes,
[01:41:16.720 --> 01:41:17.720]   someone came to me and said,
[01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:19.080]   "You know, they're messing with you.
[01:41:19.080 --> 01:41:20.720]   "They're playing a joke."
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:22.480]   So I said, "Oh, well, let's see how well that goes
[01:41:22.480 --> 01:41:25.600]   "'cause, you know, I'm a CO and they're not."
[01:41:25.600 --> 01:41:29.080]   And so I went down to CIVIC and it was a,
[01:41:29.080 --> 01:41:30.880]   I think he was a lieutenant or a lieutenant JG,
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.280]   so he's way junior to me.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:35.640]   And I said, "Hey, I want my tapes back."
[01:41:35.640 --> 01:41:36.780]   And he looks at me and I go,
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.060]   "I know you guys are pulling my leg.
[01:41:38.060 --> 01:41:40.000]   "I know there's no one came out."
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:41.680]   And I go, "And you have about 30 seconds
[01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:43.020]   "to get me my tapes before I start
[01:41:43.020 --> 01:41:45.120]   "tearing this place apart."
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:46.960]   That's literally what I told him.
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:48.800]   And I said, "And if your boss has an issue,
[01:41:48.800 --> 01:41:50.160]   "he can come and see me
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:52.000]   "'cause it's not gonna go well."
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.360]   I said, "'Cause this is bullshit
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:41:54.760]   "and I need those tapes."
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.840]   Then he literally walked right over to a filing cabinet,
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:57.880]   opened it up, they weren't in a safe.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:41:58.960]   He opened up a filing cabinet
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.720]   and pulled them out and handed them to me.
[01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:02.840]   I said, and I basically said a few things to him,
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:05.080]   like, "Don't ever fuck with me again."
[01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.920]   And I left, I had the tapes.
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:08.400]   So this, no one came out.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:11.200]   There's no flying going on when all this is happening.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:15.080]   And I took the tapes back and then I copied the tapes.
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.200]   So I took two brand new eight mil tapes
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.520]   and I copied the sections that I want.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.040]   So there's a rumor too that,
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.080]   "Oh, the original FLIR video is 10 minutes long
[01:42:23.080 --> 01:42:24.560]   "and there's some, one of these petty officers
[01:42:24.560 --> 01:42:25.400]   "is saying I saw it."
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:26.240]   That's total crap.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:28.320]   The original video is about a minute 30 seconds long.
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:31.880]   What you see on the release video is the entire video.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:33.420]   - So you have mentioned,
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:37.120]   I apologize if I say stupid things, please correct me.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:41.440]   But you have mentioned that, like on "Roguen" I think,
[01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.520]   that you watched it on a bigger screen.
[01:42:45.520 --> 01:42:47.520]   It felt like it was higher definition.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:51.160]   So let me ask the question,
[01:42:51.160 --> 01:42:53.520]   is there a higher definition version,
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.160]   do you think, of the FLIR video
[01:42:56.160 --> 01:42:59.320]   that would give us more pixels and more information,
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:01.520]   presumably because of the high number of--
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:04.320]   - I would doubt it 'cause I don't know where,
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:05.600]   the stuff that the government released,
[01:43:05.600 --> 01:43:06.440]   I don't know where they got.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:08.920]   Okay, so the stuff that was on "Strangeland" and YouTube,
[01:43:08.920 --> 01:43:12.640]   someone pulled off of a secret, it looks like a rack.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:13.560]   There's tape machines in there
[01:43:13.560 --> 01:43:14.680]   and it gets converted to digital
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:15.640]   and stored on a hard drive.
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:16.760]   And they pulled it off that hard drive
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.120]   and they put it on YouTube.
[01:43:18.120 --> 01:43:23.320]   No, it's just like, anytime, even a digital media,
[01:43:23.320 --> 01:43:24.600]   the more you copy digital media,
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:27.000]   there's some quality that gets, it degrades.
[01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:28.240]   So this, you don't know how many times
[01:43:28.240 --> 01:43:29.080]   this has been copied.
[01:43:29.080 --> 01:43:29.920]   So we were looking,
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:31.640]   the videos I've seen are right off the original,
[01:43:31.640 --> 01:43:32.480]   they're Hi8 tapes,
[01:43:32.480 --> 01:43:34.640]   that's basically pulled off the back of the display.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.800]   So it's not filmed with cameras,
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:37.960]   it's literally a digital feed that's pulled off the back
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:39.440]   and put onto a Hi8 tape.
[01:43:39.440 --> 01:43:40.680]   That's how the recorders work.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:42.560]   Now it's actually digital to digital,
[01:43:42.560 --> 01:43:43.680]   it's not even on tapes anymore.
[01:43:43.680 --> 01:43:45.240]   It's a digital recording system.
[01:43:45.240 --> 01:43:46.920]   But we were still in that process of slowing up
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:49.640]   'cause original we had little cameras here that shine.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:52.040]   So if the light hit, it would wash out the displays.
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:53.840]   So this is, it's a pretty good feed.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:56.000]   When you put it on, so we're,
[01:43:56.000 --> 01:43:57.880]   instead of looking at it on your tiny little
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:43:59.120]   computer monitor or whatever,
[01:43:59.120 --> 01:44:01.800]   I'm looking at it on a, like a 19 inch,
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:03.320]   'cause it was still normal TVs back there.
[01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:04.960]   We had just put flat screens in the red room
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:07.240]   that I had bought so we could watch movies.
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:09.120]   So, 'cause we-
[01:44:09.120 --> 01:44:11.600]   - A nice, huge 19 inch screen.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:13.760]   - It's maybe 20, it was nice.
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:14.880]   - Wow, that's huge.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:16.040]   - It was gigantic.
[01:44:16.040 --> 01:44:20.920]   - I can get for like 50 bucks, you can get like 60 inches.
[01:44:20.920 --> 01:44:22.120]   - This is 2005.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.040]   So-
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:25.680]   - So you look at it as big thing and-
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:27.760]   - But you could see, so when you get to the TV mode,
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.720]   when I say there's little things
[01:44:28.720 --> 01:44:30.520]   coming out of the bottom of it, you could see those.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:32.120]   It was very clear.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.760]   - But in terms of the actual visual on the Tic Tac,
[01:44:35.760 --> 01:44:38.440]   was it, did you get much more information
[01:44:38.440 --> 01:44:40.560]   from the higher, from the clear-
[01:44:40.560 --> 01:44:42.440]   - The little things out of the bottom.
[01:44:42.440 --> 01:44:43.280]   We didn't see those visuals.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:44.120]   - So the bottom information, got it.
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:45.160]   - When you see it, 'cause he's coming
[01:44:45.160 --> 01:44:47.280]   almost co-altitude with it, you can see the bottom of it.
[01:44:47.280 --> 01:44:49.600]   It looks like little, you know, like if you look at a Cessna,
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.400]   there's little antennas hanging out of the bottom,
[01:44:51.400 --> 01:44:52.240]   kind of like that.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.680]   There was two little things out of the bottom.
[01:44:53.680 --> 01:44:56.320]   There was nothing on the top, there was no plume, no IR,
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:45:00.240]   no visible propulsions, even heat signature.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:01.520]   You know, it's all that stuff.
[01:45:01.520 --> 01:45:02.980]   And then the other thing that people didn't see
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:05.220]   is they didn't see the radar display,
[01:45:05.220 --> 01:45:08.960]   which that really raises a classification level,
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:11.560]   especially to see what the radar does when it's being jammed.
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:13.720]   You know, matter of fact, when they did
[01:45:13.720 --> 01:45:16.480]   the unofficial official investigation in about 2000,
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.440]   and let me think, about 2009,
[01:45:19.440 --> 01:45:23.080]   I had gotten a call on my cell phone from a guy
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:26.200]   who, government employee, and said,
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:29.960]   "Hey," he told me who he was, he's still in the government,
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.340]   I'm friends with him, and he said,
[01:45:31.340 --> 01:45:35.480]   "Hey, we're gonna investigate your Tic Tac thing."
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.640]   This is literally five years later.
[01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.280]   Yeah, five years later.
[01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:41.120]   And I said, "Okay, whatever."
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.240]   And he did a pretty good job.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.880]   I call it the unofficial official report
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:48.320]   because it was really never official.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.480]   It wasn't.
[01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:51.520]   But I'll give you the history of why I say that
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.360]   and why it never came out in FOIA requests.
[01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:56.600]   So he does the report, he sent me the report,
[01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.320]   and all he said is, "Hey, I'm gonna send you this report.
[01:45:58.320 --> 01:46:01.200]   "Please don't distribute this report."
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.500]   I said, "Okay."
[01:46:02.500 --> 01:46:04.540]   The report is now out because Harry Reid
[01:46:04.540 --> 01:46:07.400]   got it to George Knapp, and they were good enough to redact it
[01:46:07.400 --> 01:46:09.080]   but there's a few versions of it unredacted,
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:11.080]   and I'm very protective of the other people
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:13.080]   that were involved in this.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:15.440]   So Jim has talked, but he's off the grid.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:17.320]   He doesn't talk to anyone now.
[01:46:17.320 --> 01:46:20.780]   The pilot of his airplane, she has come out unidentified,
[01:46:20.780 --> 01:46:22.080]   but they don't release her name,
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:23.220]   although people are starting to do it.
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:25.060]   And she's had weird shit happen around her house.
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.800]   She's got kids, so I'm very protective of her.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:30.960]   And I've told people like Jeremy and George,
[01:46:30.960 --> 01:46:32.500]   "If I know that a name's ever came from you,
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:34.460]   "I will never talk to you again about this."
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.840]   And Jeremy's been really good about it, and so has George.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.500]   But George knew who the names were
[01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.740]   'cause he got the report from Senator Reid.
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:44.740]   And then the other crew.
[01:46:44.740 --> 01:46:47.700]   So the pilot of the airplane that took the video
[01:46:47.700 --> 01:46:52.700]   that Chad was in, if you talk to that individual,
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:54.060]   they really don't have the recollection.
[01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:55.340]   They were just out flying that day,
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:56.600]   and it wasn't a big deal.
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:47:00.820]   So you need to protect, 'cause not everyone
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:01.780]   wants people knocking.
[01:47:01.780 --> 01:47:03.820]   I don't want people knocking on my door.
[01:47:03.820 --> 01:47:06.220]   And there's rumors, "Oh, you talk to everyone."
[01:47:06.220 --> 01:47:07.900]   I think you're about the 23rd person
[01:47:07.900 --> 01:47:09.940]   that I've talked to total.
[01:47:09.940 --> 01:47:13.300]   And that includes the newspapers and stuff.
[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:14.940]   And I've been selective because there's so much.
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:19.460]   I mean, if I turned down like, I turned down Russian TV.
[01:47:19.460 --> 01:47:21.180]   I can give you her name when we're done here.
[01:47:21.180 --> 01:47:23.020]   But she called, she not only called me,
[01:47:23.020 --> 01:47:24.660]   she called my wife, she called my daughter,
[01:47:24.660 --> 01:47:27.180]   she called my son, and she called my son-in-law.
[01:47:27.180 --> 01:47:28.260]   Because they're persistent.
[01:47:28.260 --> 01:47:31.380]   So I'm pretty, I'm very particular.
[01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:32.380]   I mean, the reason I'm talking to you
[01:47:32.380 --> 01:47:33.820]   is 'cause I knew we would have a conversation
[01:47:33.820 --> 01:47:35.620]   that wasn't based just on the tic-tac and the incident,
[01:47:35.620 --> 01:47:37.420]   but we could actually talk about
[01:47:37.420 --> 01:47:39.300]   some of the science and some of the theoretical
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:42.660]   to get into, to get more people involved to go.
[01:47:42.660 --> 01:47:44.100]   'Cause I think there's, you know,
[01:47:44.100 --> 01:47:49.100]   and when you talk to Lou Elizondo or Chris Mellon,
[01:47:49.100 --> 01:47:50.940]   you know, the group at TTSA,
[01:47:50.940 --> 01:47:52.380]   you know, that whole thing was--
[01:47:52.380 --> 01:47:53.220]   - What's TTSA?
[01:47:53.220 --> 01:47:55.420]   - That's To The Stars Academy.
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:57.140]   That's the Tom DeLonge group that got started.
[01:47:57.140 --> 01:47:59.900]   So, and you go, well, you know,
[01:47:59.900 --> 01:48:02.660]   'cause I think Tom has caught a lot of crap for this,
[01:48:02.660 --> 01:48:06.820]   but he's actually, when you talk to him, he's very smart.
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:08.100]   And I ask him, how'd you get into this?
[01:48:08.100 --> 01:48:11.460]   And he goes, oh, when I was traveling around with Blink-182,
[01:48:11.460 --> 01:48:12.540]   he goes, you read a lot of books
[01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:13.460]   when you're laying in a van
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:15.860]   as you're driving to your next gig
[01:48:15.860 --> 01:48:16.860]   before you make it big.
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:19.220]   And he goes, and he read, he was reading books
[01:48:19.220 --> 01:48:20.340]   and he read one of them on UFOs.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:21.180]   I'm trying to think the title.
[01:48:21.180 --> 01:48:23.460]   It's one of the big ones that's out there, real popular.
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:26.820]   And so he started just, he started asking more
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:30.340]   and through his fame with Blink-182 in the band,
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:32.260]   he got more and more connected.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:33.620]   You know, if you talk to Chris Mellon,
[01:48:33.620 --> 01:48:36.540]   who is an Undersecretary of Defense for Intelligence,
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:39.740]   and he's part of the Mellon dynasty,
[01:48:39.740 --> 01:48:42.940]   from Carnegie Mellon type, very, very smart.
[01:48:42.940 --> 01:48:46.260]   He knows, he definitely knows how the government works
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:47.460]   'cause he worked there.
[01:48:47.460 --> 01:48:51.940]   And so when I went down to DC to talk to people,
[01:48:51.940 --> 01:48:53.580]   he's one of the first people I'll go to.
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:57.100]   When I did Tucker Carlson about a month ago,
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:49:01.460]   a month and a half ago, I asked, he texted me.
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:04.460]   I texted him, Tom, Lou to go, hey,
[01:49:04.460 --> 01:49:05.740]   'cause they were like, you gotta do it.
[01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:08.700]   'Cause I turned Tucker down a couple of times before
[01:49:08.700 --> 01:49:12.300]   and his producer had called me and I'm like,
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.940]   all right, I'll do it.
[01:49:13.940 --> 01:49:16.140]   'Cause those guys are like, you gotta do this for us.
[01:49:16.140 --> 01:49:19.140]   - So from my perspective, just to give you some context.
[01:49:19.140 --> 01:49:23.220]   So to me, there seems to be some stigma.
[01:49:23.220 --> 01:49:24.740]   So I come from the scientific community
[01:49:24.740 --> 01:49:27.060]   and I really appreciate you talking to me today.
[01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:30.000]   And I think that people who listen to this include,
[01:49:30.980 --> 01:49:35.980]   you know, fellow faculty at MIT and major universities.
[01:49:35.980 --> 01:49:39.860]   And it feels like there's some stigma to the subject
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:42.360]   from the scientific community.
[01:49:42.360 --> 01:49:45.620]   A lot of people, especially when they hear your story
[01:49:45.620 --> 01:49:47.940]   are like, wow, this is really interesting.
[01:49:47.940 --> 01:49:52.940]   But you don't even know, one, you're afraid to talk about it
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:55.500]   and two, you don't know what the next steps are.
[01:49:55.500 --> 01:50:00.500]   Like how can we seriously try to think about what you saw?
[01:50:00.940 --> 01:50:05.300]   How to think about how we further look for things like it?
[01:50:05.300 --> 01:50:10.300]   How we develop systems and plans for how in the future
[01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:14.540]   we can immediately collect a lot more data
[01:50:14.540 --> 01:50:19.540]   and try to react properly, you know, try to communicate,
[01:50:19.540 --> 01:50:24.180]   try to interpret this in the best way possible
[01:50:24.180 --> 01:50:25.540]   from the scientific perspective.
[01:50:25.540 --> 01:50:30.540]   And I just would love to remove stigma from this subject.
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:33.700]   - Well, I think that's the first step.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:36.540]   We have done in this country
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:38.460]   an absolutely terrible job with these things.
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:41.900]   So you go, and I joke, you know, go back to Roswell.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:43.980]   So the first reports that came out of Roswell
[01:50:43.980 --> 01:50:46.260]   was we have this crash flying saucer.
[01:50:46.260 --> 01:50:47.940]   That's literally what came up.
[01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:50.500]   And then magically the next day, it's a weather balloon
[01:50:50.500 --> 01:50:52.100]   and they're showing your pieces of Mylar.
[01:50:52.100 --> 01:50:53.600]   And you go, well, that doesn't look like
[01:50:53.600 --> 01:50:55.300]   what they showed us yesterday.
[01:50:55.300 --> 01:50:56.900]   Then you get into Project Blue Book, you know,
[01:50:56.900 --> 01:50:58.600]   so there's that whole series about Project Blue Book.
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:00.080]   But the bottom line of Project Blue Book
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.100]   is it really did two things.
[01:51:01.100 --> 01:51:03.940]   It investigated sightings and it did everything it could
[01:51:03.940 --> 01:51:05.180]   to debunk and disprove,
[01:51:05.180 --> 01:51:08.500]   to the point where it actually went to discredit,
[01:51:08.500 --> 01:51:10.260]   you know, to make you look.
[01:51:10.260 --> 01:51:14.060]   So there's always been this, I don't know if you'd call it
[01:51:14.060 --> 01:51:16.460]   an aura around it or a mystique about UFOs
[01:51:16.460 --> 01:51:18.860]   that if you're talking about them, they're nuts.
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:23.140]   With ours, because I'm not a UFO guy, I'm not a junkie.
[01:51:23.140 --> 01:51:25.460]   If you asked me, do I believe
[01:51:25.460 --> 01:51:27.620]   that there's life outside of earth,
[01:51:27.620 --> 01:51:30.440]   I would say you probably have a better chance
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:32.680]   of winning the Mega Ball lottery
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:35.480]   than we're the only planet that has life on it
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:36.320]   in the universe.
[01:51:36.320 --> 01:51:38.480]   It's just, the odds are against it.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:40.400]   If you do, just do the math.
[01:51:40.400 --> 01:51:43.320]   You have to accept, 'cause if there only has to be
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:45.480]   one other planet that has life on it,
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:48.180]   and then I win and you lose.
[01:51:48.180 --> 01:51:49.760]   - And then more and more science is showing
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:52.180]   that there's habitable planets out there.
[01:51:52.180 --> 01:51:54.640]   That yeah, everything we've learned so far,
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.960]   and we know very little, but everything we've learned so far
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:01.180]   about the planets out there, exoplanets,
[01:52:01.180 --> 01:52:04.920]   earth-like planets, it seems that it's very likely
[01:52:04.920 --> 01:52:06.160]   that there's life out there.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:08.920]   Intelligent life is another topic, but life--
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:12.760]   - Well, we as humans, and even more as Americans,
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.360]   we have this hubris about us that says,
[01:52:14.360 --> 01:52:18.800]   ha ha, we're it, and you go, not so much.
[01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:20.680]   - Maybe we're not so intelligent.
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:22.740]   - Because we are, it's just how we learn.
[01:52:22.740 --> 01:52:25.860]   So our main mode of transportation
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:28.080]   and what people figured out years ago
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:29.600]   was the internal combustion engine,
[01:52:29.600 --> 01:52:32.880]   which led us to jet engines and solid rocket fuel.
[01:52:32.880 --> 01:52:36.840]   What if you're in another planet where you figured out
[01:52:36.840 --> 01:52:39.760]   the ability to create a gravity field,
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:42.380]   or you used, 'cause electromagnetics are becoming
[01:52:42.380 --> 01:52:43.480]   bigger and bigger and bigger.
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:45.640]   Catapults on ships were steam-powered,
[01:52:45.640 --> 01:52:48.380]   and the new Gerald Ford is electromagnetic.
[01:52:48.380 --> 01:52:49.760]   Roller coasters used to use a chain
[01:52:49.760 --> 01:52:50.760]   to get you to the top of the hill.
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:53.820]   Now they shoot you with electromagnetics and you're going.
[01:52:53.820 --> 01:52:56.100]   So there's a whole new realm of propulsion
[01:52:56.100 --> 01:52:58.280]   that sometimes it's our ability to develop
[01:52:58.280 --> 01:53:00.600]   the technology to support theory.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:04.600]   We are just now proving recently theories
[01:53:04.600 --> 01:53:07.040]   that Einstein had where people actually joked about 'em,
[01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:08.400]   and now we actually have the technology
[01:53:08.400 --> 01:53:10.680]   to prove that gravity can bend light.
[01:53:10.680 --> 01:53:11.880]   We have proven that.
[01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:13.520]   So you look at that when you go,
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:16.540]   well, does that mean that 70 years ago Einstein was wrong,
[01:53:16.540 --> 01:53:17.880]   or 80 years ago Einstein was wrong,
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:20.200]   or do you go, we just didn't have the ability
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.620]   to look that deep into space to actually find something
[01:53:22.620 --> 01:53:24.520]   that we could to actually measure,
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:25.360]   and I've seen this stuff--
[01:53:25.360 --> 01:53:26.640]   - And that's just 100 years,
[01:53:26.640 --> 01:53:28.960]   and the kind of things that can happen in a few centuries.
[01:53:28.960 --> 01:53:30.280]   - Look what we've done in the last 20 years.
[01:53:30.280 --> 01:53:31.520]   - Yeah, it's crazy.
[01:53:31.520 --> 01:53:34.040]   Let me direct, 'cause it's such an interesting topic
[01:53:34.040 --> 01:53:36.740]   from a career perspective, from a science perspective.
[01:53:36.740 --> 01:53:41.180]   I mean, you've spoke, you've been brave
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:44.920]   in telling your story, not some dramatic thing,
[01:53:44.920 --> 01:53:46.920]   but just telling the things you've seen.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:52.840]   Did it encounter, did it impact your career?
[01:53:52.840 --> 01:53:55.120]   Is that why more people haven't come out?
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:57.860]   Like you've mentioned Roswell,
[01:53:57.860 --> 01:54:02.380]   like how, what advice do you give to people,
[01:54:02.380 --> 01:54:05.240]   to the community, to me as a scientist,
[01:54:05.240 --> 01:54:08.140]   for ways to go forward about this topic,
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:11.220]   and still have a, you know,
[01:54:11.220 --> 01:54:14.140]   not being put in a bin in society,
[01:54:14.140 --> 01:54:16.700]   that he's a loon, or she's a loon, or that person--
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:19.300]   - Mine is to get away from the little green men.
[01:54:19.300 --> 01:54:23.500]   Divorce the two little green men,
[01:54:23.500 --> 01:54:26.540]   and I've talked to Lou Elizondo about this,
[01:54:26.540 --> 01:54:27.860]   and the group that they're working with,
[01:54:27.860 --> 01:54:28.700]   which is incredible.
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:29.800]   I mean, they've got Steve Justice,
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:33.900]   who used to run Skunk Works, where they built projects.
[01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:35.100]   - Now, Lou Elizondo, as you mentioned,
[01:54:35.100 --> 01:54:36.540]   was a program director.
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:38.420]   - He ran the AATIP program at the Pentagon.
[01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:40.620]   - And AATIP was a program that was tasked
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:45.100]   with investigating any kind of UFOs, UAPs.
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:47.540]   So what's funny is the unofficial official report
[01:54:47.540 --> 01:54:48.900]   that I joke about,
[01:54:48.900 --> 01:54:51.100]   the guy who wrote the unofficial official report
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:53.500]   was actually an original member of AATIP,
[01:54:53.500 --> 01:54:57.020]   and the original stuff that AATIP did was FOIA exempt.
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.260]   And people go, "How do you know that?"
[01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:00.380]   I go, "'Cause I stood there with the memo in my hand
[01:55:00.380 --> 01:55:02.540]   "that said these are, it literally,
[01:55:02.540 --> 01:55:05.460]   "I watched the DOD memo that said it, and it was signed."
[01:55:05.460 --> 01:55:07.060]   So he was one.
[01:55:07.060 --> 01:55:09.620]   So that's why I call it the unofficial official report.
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.200]   It was never releasable, 'cause people go,
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.100]   "Oh, I put in a FOIA request, and I didn't get that."
[01:55:14.100 --> 01:55:15.500]   I go, "Well, just 'cause you put in a FOIA request
[01:55:15.500 --> 01:55:16.340]   "didn't get it."
[01:55:16.340 --> 01:55:18.140]   I go, "Because how much time do you think
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.780]   "that guy's gonna spend to get you the information
[01:55:19.780 --> 01:55:21.660]   "that you requested if he can't find it?"
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:23.260]   I actually got called by the Navy.
[01:55:23.260 --> 01:55:26.520]   I had a commander in the Navy call me about,
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:29.940]   right before the article came out in the New York Times.
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.540]   This was starting to come back,
[01:55:31.540 --> 01:55:33.920]   and she had called me 'cause there was a FOIA request
[01:55:33.920 --> 01:55:35.380]   for stuff about the Nimitz incident.
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:37.900]   And I said, "Do you know of anything?"
[01:55:37.900 --> 01:55:39.520]   She called me, she goes, "Do you know of anything else
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:43.180]   "besides the situation reports that come off the ship?"
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.980]   And you gotta remember, when the situation report
[01:55:44.980 --> 01:55:46.660]   comes off the ship, that's like third hand.
[01:55:46.660 --> 01:55:48.740]   So we tell someone, they tell someone,
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:50.700]   that person has to write it up.
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.860]   So there's all kinds of inaccuracies in it.
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:55.500]   But then there's the unofficial official report
[01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:56.660]   that's actually pretty well written.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.500]   There's some errors in it, but it was,
[01:55:58.500 --> 01:56:00.300]   I didn't help write it, I just did it.
[01:56:00.300 --> 01:56:02.180]   And he did a really good job of researching it
[01:56:02.180 --> 01:56:04.880]   and figuring out who's who in the zoo and the players.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:09.060]   So she called me and said, "Is there anything out there?"
[01:56:09.060 --> 01:56:10.620]   And I said, "Officially out there?"
[01:56:10.620 --> 01:56:11.440]   She said, "Yes."
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:12.700]   I said, "I don't know of anything."
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.460]   I knew of the unofficial official report,
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:16.660]   which is that one, but I'm not,
[01:56:16.660 --> 01:56:18.060]   if you don't know about it, I'm not gonna tell you,
[01:56:18.060 --> 01:56:20.660]   'cause that's not my job, and nor did I care.
[01:56:20.660 --> 01:56:25.220]   - I mean, in that whole situation, you mentioned Lou,
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:29.140]   did you think about your impact to your career?
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:30.660]   Just to get back to the question,
[01:56:30.660 --> 01:56:35.660]   do you think others, other pilots, other people
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:39.100]   like in Roosevelt are thinking about this kind of thing?
[01:56:39.100 --> 01:56:40.340]   Why aren't they talking about this?
[01:56:40.340 --> 01:56:42.860]   Why are people afraid to talk about this?
[01:56:42.860 --> 01:56:45.260]   - Well, honestly, the military and the press,
[01:56:45.260 --> 01:56:47.740]   there's a distrust, I'll just tell you that right now.
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:49.740]   We typically don't like talking to the press,
[01:56:49.740 --> 01:56:54.340]   because if I talk to you, especially when I do,
[01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:57.000]   even the TV shows, 'cause I've been on a couple of shows,
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:58.700]   when you look at it, they come to my house
[01:56:58.700 --> 01:57:00.740]   and they film me for two hours.
[01:57:00.740 --> 01:57:03.340]   And then what you see on the screen is five minutes.
[01:57:03.340 --> 01:57:05.260]   - Well, and the other thing with the press,
[01:57:05.260 --> 01:57:07.900]   let me give you my perspective from autonomous vehicles,
[01:57:07.900 --> 01:57:12.900]   is the clipping happens, yes, but also the incompetence.
[01:57:12.900 --> 01:57:15.660]   Let me just call out journalism.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:21.940]   They're not thinking, I mean, so here's the thing.
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:26.940]   I have a PhD and I've taken painfully too many classes
[01:57:26.940 --> 01:57:29.440]   from like physics and math,
[01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:33.040]   and I also have a deep curiosity about the world.
[01:57:33.040 --> 01:57:34.500]   I read a lot.
[01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:36.100]   That seems to be missing with journalism.
[01:57:36.100 --> 01:57:38.140]   So you're talking to a person who is not gonna
[01:57:38.140 --> 01:57:41.060]   push the story forward in an interesting way,
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:43.660]   not the story, but the actual investigation
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:47.700]   of perhaps one of the most amazing things
[01:57:47.700 --> 01:57:49.700]   that humans have witnessed in history.
[01:57:49.700 --> 01:57:52.780]   Like it might've been nothing, who knows?
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.820]   What you witnessed might've been,
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:56.700]   from a sort of debunking perspective,
[01:57:56.700 --> 01:57:59.220]   might've been some kind of trick of mind.
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:01.900]   You and others have hallucinated something.
[01:58:01.900 --> 01:58:04.940]   It could be some simple explanation,
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:09.940]   but possibly it was something not of this world.
[01:58:09.940 --> 01:58:15.180]   And to not do justice to this story
[01:58:15.180 --> 01:58:17.520]   from a scientific perspective,
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:20.780]   it seems at best negligence.
[01:58:20.780 --> 01:58:23.220]   And so, yeah, that's true for journalists,
[01:58:23.220 --> 01:58:25.140]   that's true for other scientists.
[01:58:25.140 --> 01:58:27.180]   - It's just, it's human nature.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:30.740]   If we see something that we can't explain,
[01:58:30.740 --> 01:58:34.620]   then sometimes if you just, eh, maybe it's just me,
[01:58:34.620 --> 01:58:36.980]   and you let it go away and you don't think about it,
[01:58:36.980 --> 01:58:40.500]   and maybe it'll just, you ignore it.
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:43.900]   The other side is the inquisitive mind that says,
[01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:46.460]   well, what was that, and I wanna dig more into it.
[01:58:46.460 --> 01:58:51.060]   And if you look at it or you're going against the norm,
[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:53.940]   you can get ostracized.
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:56.460]   And if you look at, and Einstein's the perfect example.
[01:58:56.460 --> 01:58:59.020]   I mean, when he started coming up with some of his theories,
[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:01.900]   some of the top physicists in the world were like,
[01:59:01.900 --> 01:59:03.380]   dude, you're a nut job.
[01:59:03.380 --> 01:59:05.900]   And he's literally proving them,
[01:59:05.900 --> 01:59:09.060]   but he didn't have, he proved them in theory,
[01:59:09.060 --> 01:59:11.500]   but he didn't have the means to actually do the experiment
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.460]   to prove his theory.
[01:59:13.460 --> 01:59:15.900]   - There's a great book that I recommend people read
[01:59:15.900 --> 01:59:19.460]   called "Proving Einstein Right" by Jim Gates
[01:59:19.460 --> 01:59:22.580]   that talks about the hard work
[01:59:22.580 --> 01:59:24.900]   that people try to do years after
[01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:29.060]   to try to experimentally validate the predictions
[01:59:29.060 --> 01:59:32.140]   that Einstein made with his theories.
[01:59:32.140 --> 01:59:33.340]   It's fascinating.
[01:59:33.340 --> 01:59:35.660]   But yes, at the time, it's kind of crazy.
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.660]   What are you saying?
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:38.740]   - Yeah, if you look at it back at the time,
[01:59:38.740 --> 01:59:39.980]   don't we look at it now and go,
[01:59:39.980 --> 01:59:42.380]   well, the guy was a walking genius, and he was.
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:44.700]   But if you go back in time when he was doing it,
[01:59:44.700 --> 01:59:46.700]   it was like, what are you talking about?
[01:59:46.700 --> 01:59:52.340]   - But one of the challenges is your eyewitness,
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.300]   one of the challenges is your,
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:56.260]   essentially an eyewitness account.
[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.700]   Like we don't have good data.
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:02.420]   We have very limited data of the incident
[02:00:02.420 --> 02:00:03.820]   that you've experienced.
[02:00:03.820 --> 02:00:05.100]   So let me kind of dig in.
[02:00:05.100 --> 02:00:09.560]   Let me just ask some questions of maybe to see if there's,
[02:00:09.560 --> 02:00:12.900]   just to paint more and more of the picture.
[02:00:12.900 --> 02:00:15.540]   One, you kind of mentioned, so tic-tac shape.
[02:00:15.540 --> 02:00:18.460]   Let's break apart two situations.
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:19.700]   One is the video.
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:21.660]   Let's look at the actual eye account,
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:25.060]   the eyewitness account that you saw with your own eyes.
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:28.220]   What can you say about the shape of the thing?
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:30.980]   Is there interesting aspects outside of the tic-tac?
[02:00:30.980 --> 02:00:33.180]   Like, is there any appendages?
[02:00:33.180 --> 02:00:37.020]   Is there some texture to it that--
[02:00:37.020 --> 02:00:41.380]   - No, smooth, white, tic-tac.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:44.780]   You know, you don't see, there's no wings,
[02:00:44.780 --> 02:00:48.300]   no visible propulsion, no windows,
[02:00:48.300 --> 02:00:50.580]   no probes that we could see.
[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:51.780]   We don't notice, like I said,
[02:00:51.780 --> 02:00:53.580]   we don't see the little things on the bottom of it
[02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:56.900]   until we see the video in the TV mode
[02:00:56.900 --> 02:00:58.940]   when it's zoomed in, right before.
[02:00:58.940 --> 02:01:00.620]   It's shortly, you kind of see them zoom in.
[02:01:00.620 --> 02:01:02.780]   You don't see it typically on the YouTube stuff
[02:01:02.780 --> 02:01:03.620]   that's out there.
[02:01:03.620 --> 02:01:06.980]   But remember, we're looking at the original tape,
[02:01:06.980 --> 02:01:10.220]   so there's basically no degradation.
[02:01:10.220 --> 02:01:11.380]   - But when you saw with your eyes,
[02:01:11.380 --> 02:01:12.500]   there's no kind of appendages.
[02:01:12.500 --> 02:01:13.460]   - No, none.
[02:01:13.460 --> 02:01:15.300]   - What about, like somebody asked,
[02:01:15.300 --> 02:01:17.180]   a lot of people asked you questions,
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:19.460]   so I appreciate you spending your time here.
[02:01:19.460 --> 02:01:21.420]   Let me ask some of them.
[02:01:21.420 --> 02:01:23.860]   Did you, I mean, you chased it,
[02:01:23.860 --> 02:01:26.100]   so you flew close to it, relatively speaking.
[02:01:26.100 --> 02:01:30.020]   Was there, did you feel any wake?
[02:01:30.020 --> 02:01:33.380]   Like any, did you feel it in any way
[02:01:33.380 --> 02:01:36.300]   in terms of your interaction, like aerodynamically?
[02:01:36.300 --> 02:01:37.140]   - No.
[02:01:37.140 --> 02:01:37.980]   - Nothing.
[02:01:37.980 --> 02:01:39.100]   - Nothing.
[02:01:39.100 --> 02:01:42.340]   - So another aspect of it,
[02:01:42.340 --> 02:01:44.060]   there's an interesting thing you've developed,
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:47.920]   a feel for objects in the air.
[02:01:47.920 --> 02:01:52.920]   Did you feel like it was surprised by your arrival?
[02:01:52.920 --> 02:01:56.040]   Or did it, let me ask a few questions around it.
[02:01:56.040 --> 02:01:59.920]   So did it feel like the thing was surprised?
[02:01:59.920 --> 02:02:03.000]   Did it feel like it wanted to be seen
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.540]   almost to show off its capability?
[02:02:06.540 --> 02:02:10.440]   And did it, what did it feel like
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:15.040]   relative to if you were doing an air fight
[02:02:15.040 --> 02:02:20.040]   against sort of like a, I don't know, a foreign jet?
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:24.920]   - So one, I think it knew we were there when we showed up.
[02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:26.880]   It's just, it's me.
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:27.800]   It's kind of like an animal.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:29.560]   If you've ever been around deer in a field,
[02:02:29.560 --> 02:02:30.700]   you know, the deer will look up,
[02:02:30.700 --> 02:02:33.040]   and if it sees you and you're on the other side of the field,
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:34.920]   it'll actually go, no threat, and it'll start eating.
[02:02:34.920 --> 02:02:36.000]   You know, they don't put their tail up.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:37.880]   As you move closer to the deer, then it goes,
[02:02:37.880 --> 02:02:40.640]   oh, it's there, and I'm gonna react, or I'm gonna move.
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:41.960]   So as we were up high,
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:44.220]   and it's down doing whatever it was doing,
[02:02:45.180 --> 02:02:47.620]   you know, which I don't know,
[02:02:47.620 --> 02:02:48.460]   someone asked, what do you think?
[02:02:48.460 --> 02:02:50.140]   I go, oh, maybe it was communicating with something.
[02:02:50.140 --> 02:02:51.860]   I joked on "Good Morning America."
[02:02:51.860 --> 02:02:53.260]   Maybe it's like talking to the whales,
[02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:55.420]   kind of like "Star Trek," you know?
[02:02:55.420 --> 02:02:56.660]   And I actually used that clip.
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:02:57.900]   It was kind of funny, but.
[02:02:57.900 --> 02:03:00.060]   - Yeah, we're a little human-centric.
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:03.020]   We think like it would, it'd show up to talk to us,
[02:03:03.020 --> 02:03:04.300]   but maybe it's talking to the dolphins.
[02:03:04.300 --> 02:03:05.860]   - Maybe it was, yeah, it was to whatever, you know,
[02:03:05.860 --> 02:03:07.340]   'cause it was hanging around that whitewater,
[02:03:07.340 --> 02:03:08.660]   and I don't know, was there something there?
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:09.500]   Was there seamount?
[02:03:09.500 --> 02:03:10.320]   We just didn't find it again?
[02:03:10.320 --> 02:03:11.540]   I don't know.
[02:03:11.540 --> 02:03:13.460]   But once we started to descend,
[02:03:13.460 --> 02:03:16.220]   and it actually reoriented its longitudinal axis,
[02:03:16.220 --> 02:03:17.740]   and it started mirroring us coming up,
[02:03:17.740 --> 02:03:19.060]   then it was obviously where we were there,
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:20.140]   and it was really coming up,
[02:03:20.140 --> 02:03:21.540]   just, you know, you figure I'm at 20,
[02:03:21.540 --> 02:03:24.580]   and it's coming up, and it ends up getting up to 12,
[02:03:24.580 --> 02:03:27.420]   where I cut across a circle.
[02:03:27.420 --> 02:03:29.220]   I think it was very aware that we were there,
[02:03:29.220 --> 02:03:30.140]   because it interacted.
[02:03:30.140 --> 02:03:31.460]   We call it a two-circle fight
[02:03:31.460 --> 02:03:34.100]   when you're fighting another airplane.
[02:03:34.100 --> 02:03:37.500]   But, you know, was it,
[02:03:37.500 --> 02:03:39.860]   were we afraid?
[02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:40.680]   I don't think so.
[02:03:40.680 --> 02:03:42.860]   I mean, and to me, it was more curious.
[02:03:42.860 --> 02:03:44.580]   You know, the curiosity overcomes any fear
[02:03:44.580 --> 02:03:47.100]   that you would have, and I always felt, to be honest,
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:48.880]   if I was inside the airplane,
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:51.860]   especially as long, as much time as I'd spent
[02:03:51.860 --> 02:03:54.460]   inside the airplane flying and doing stuff,
[02:03:54.460 --> 02:03:57.700]   I felt totally, it was like a safe zone.
[02:03:57.700 --> 02:03:59.500]   I mean, I felt totally comfortable
[02:03:59.500 --> 02:04:01.720]   inside the airplane as most, you can't,
[02:04:01.720 --> 02:04:03.320]   if you're in the airplane and you feel scared,
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:04.580]   it's not the job for you.
[02:04:04.580 --> 02:04:05.740]   You have to feel that,
[02:04:05.740 --> 02:04:08.060]   because the airplane is part of you now.
[02:04:08.060 --> 02:04:09.160]   You know, I am inside.
[02:04:09.160 --> 02:04:10.780]   I have the stick, I have the throttles,
[02:04:10.780 --> 02:04:12.200]   I've got my wizard in the back seat,
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:14.220]   he's running all the displays.
[02:04:14.220 --> 02:04:18.980]   We are a team, we are in the state of the art airplane,
[02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:20.660]   you know, brand new.
[02:04:20.660 --> 02:04:21.780]   You feel pretty good.
[02:04:21.780 --> 02:04:23.960]   And then you get something that, you know,
[02:04:23.960 --> 02:04:25.700]   can climb from the surface up
[02:04:25.700 --> 02:04:26.880]   and then accelerate like it did,
[02:04:26.880 --> 02:04:28.720]   like it was like no big deal.
[02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:29.540]   You know, for an airplane,
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.140]   if you just put me from a stance,
[02:04:31.140 --> 02:04:32.240]   so let's just say slow flight,
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:35.460]   just get me at a hundred knots above the water,
[02:04:35.460 --> 02:04:37.620]   and for me to, you can't just start a climb.
[02:04:37.620 --> 02:04:39.580]   I'd have to lower the nose, I'd have to accelerate,
[02:04:39.580 --> 02:04:40.820]   and then I'd have to start coming up,
[02:04:40.820 --> 02:04:45.380]   and this thing just did it like it was like no big deal.
[02:04:45.380 --> 02:04:46.740]   - Yeah, you mentioned that,
[02:04:46.740 --> 02:04:48.820]   like kind of your reaction to it was,
[02:04:48.820 --> 02:04:54.480]   like it's something that you would love to fly almost.
[02:04:54.480 --> 02:04:58.100]   So this object, just the curiosity you experience is like,
[02:04:58.100 --> 02:05:01.640]   like what it almost like,
[02:05:01.640 --> 02:05:03.660]   what the heck is that piece of technology
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:04.940]   and I want to fly it?
[02:05:04.940 --> 02:05:09.820]   Like what made you feel like it's something
[02:05:09.820 --> 02:05:10.820]   that you could fly?
[02:05:10.820 --> 02:05:13.460]   Do you think it's something that a human could fly?
[02:05:13.460 --> 02:05:16.020]   Like in terms of interpreting what you saw
[02:05:16.020 --> 02:05:17.700]   as a piece of technology,
[02:05:17.700 --> 02:05:22.700]   'cause another perspective on it is it was not,
[02:05:22.700 --> 02:05:26.420]   that the thing under the water was the key thing.
[02:05:26.420 --> 02:05:30.540]   And what you were seeing is some kind of projection
[02:05:30.540 --> 02:05:31.940]   or something that like-
[02:05:31.940 --> 02:05:32.860]   - I don't think it was a projection.
[02:05:32.860 --> 02:05:33.700]   I think it was a real object.
[02:05:33.700 --> 02:05:37.700]   - It was a physical hard object that could be flied.
[02:05:37.700 --> 02:05:39.100]   - Oh yeah.
[02:05:39.100 --> 02:05:40.860]   Yeah, I think all four of us will tell you the same thing.
[02:05:40.860 --> 02:05:43.260]   It wasn't, this was not, 'cause you go,
[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:46.780]   okay, let's just go on, it's a light projection.
[02:05:46.780 --> 02:05:48.780]   Well, if we were both sitting next to each other,
[02:05:48.780 --> 02:05:50.900]   we were looking at it from the exact same angle
[02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:51.740]   and all that and I go,
[02:05:51.740 --> 02:05:54.440]   "Oh, okay, there's a, in theory you could have that."
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:57.180]   But with an 8,000 foot altitude difference flying,
[02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:59.660]   and she's probably not directly above me,
[02:05:59.660 --> 02:06:02.580]   she's kind of hanging out watching this whole thing happen.
[02:06:02.580 --> 02:06:04.540]   You're getting two different perspectives
[02:06:04.540 --> 02:06:07.420]   from two different altitudes over a clear blue,
[02:06:07.420 --> 02:06:08.580]   if you've ever been at sea,
[02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:10.060]   and I don't mean like coastal,
[02:06:10.060 --> 02:06:11.260]   I mean like when you get out at sea,
[02:06:11.260 --> 02:06:13.720]   the ocean is the bluest, it's incredible.
[02:06:13.720 --> 02:06:18.780]   You got a bright white object over a deep blue ocean.
[02:06:18.780 --> 02:06:20.700]   You got pretty high contrast.
[02:06:20.700 --> 02:06:22.920]   And for this thing just to disappear,
[02:06:22.920 --> 02:06:26.060]   it's wasn't, I'm telling you, I would,
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:31.980]   I mean, I know we all have the same recollection
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:33.300]   of what happened.
[02:06:33.300 --> 02:06:35.140]   There's some details because it's so long ago,
[02:06:35.140 --> 02:06:37.300]   but for the most part, we know what we saw
[02:06:37.300 --> 02:06:39.100]   and we all came back and looked at each other like,
[02:06:39.100 --> 02:06:40.380]   "What the hell was that?"
[02:06:40.380 --> 02:06:42.540]   - What if, I mean, do you think about
[02:06:42.540 --> 02:06:45.140]   the thing under the water that's not often talked about
[02:06:45.140 --> 02:06:47.260]   if there's something under the water?
[02:06:47.260 --> 02:06:49.360]   Couldn't have been something gigantic?
[02:06:49.360 --> 02:06:51.300]   - It could be.
[02:06:51.300 --> 02:06:52.120]   - Like what, like do you ever think of--
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:53.780]   - It's the abyss.
[02:06:53.780 --> 02:06:54.620]   Big ship comes up. - I mean, that's why,
[02:06:54.620 --> 02:06:57.460]   as a person, so I love like swimming out into the ocean,
[02:06:57.460 --> 02:06:59.940]   my mom's an Olympic swimmer, so like,
[02:06:59.940 --> 02:07:02.500]   I love that feeling, but I'm also terrified when I swim
[02:07:02.500 --> 02:07:04.980]   'cause the abyss, anything could be under there.
[02:07:05.900 --> 02:07:09.580]   Like there's not enough focus on that,
[02:07:09.580 --> 02:07:11.300]   perhaps because there's no visibility,
[02:07:11.300 --> 02:07:14.140]   but is there anything interesting to say
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:16.740]   about the possibility that was anything underneath there?
[02:07:16.740 --> 02:07:17.820]   - Could be, I mean, think about it.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:20.160]   If you're gonna hide on this planet,
[02:07:20.160 --> 02:07:25.340]   what's the least explored spot on the planet?
[02:07:25.340 --> 02:07:26.840]   Two thirds of it's the ocean.
[02:07:26.840 --> 02:07:31.100]   There's literally, I mean, come on,
[02:07:31.100 --> 02:07:34.420]   the Malaysia airplane, the 777,
[02:07:34.420 --> 02:07:35.940]   I think it was a 777 that crashed,
[02:07:35.940 --> 02:07:37.780]   they turned, they didn't go where they're supposed to
[02:07:37.780 --> 02:07:39.980]   and they just disappeared and they've been searching for it
[02:07:39.980 --> 02:07:41.740]   and they found pieces of it,
[02:07:41.740 --> 02:07:44.100]   but you would think there's large objects that,
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:46.540]   when that thing hit the water, depending on how it broke up,
[02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:48.420]   there's big pieces that would be, you'd find something,
[02:07:48.420 --> 02:07:51.220]   they haven't found anything except what floated.
[02:07:51.220 --> 02:07:54.660]   So to hide something underwater, I think would be easy.
[02:07:54.660 --> 02:07:57.540]   - So, okay, let's go a little bit in speculation land,
[02:07:57.540 --> 02:07:59.940]   but it's the best we can do,
[02:07:59.940 --> 02:08:04.300]   which is the basic question of what do you think
[02:08:04.300 --> 02:08:05.700]   was it?
[02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:07.860]   So if you had to put money on it,
[02:08:07.860 --> 02:08:11.820]   is it like advanced human created technology?
[02:08:11.820 --> 02:08:13.580]   Is it alien technology?
[02:08:13.580 --> 02:08:16.820]   Is it an unknown physical phenomena?
[02:08:16.820 --> 02:08:18.540]   You know, like a ball lightning, for example,
[02:08:18.540 --> 02:08:20.100]   there's a lot of fascinating things
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:22.340]   we probably humans don't really understand.
[02:08:22.340 --> 02:08:26.140]   Is it, like I said, some perception, cognition
[02:08:26.140 --> 02:08:29.020]   that led you, some kind of hallucination
[02:08:29.020 --> 02:08:31.700]   that made you to misinterpret the things you were seeing?
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:33.540]   Let me put those things on the table.
[02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:37.380]   Or is it misinterpretation of some known physical phenomena
[02:08:37.380 --> 02:08:40.300]   like an ice cloud or something like that?
[02:08:40.300 --> 02:08:41.220]   What do you think it was?
[02:08:41.220 --> 02:08:43.100]   - Oh, it's definitely, I don't think it's an ice cloud
[02:08:43.100 --> 02:08:46.380]   'cause ice clouds don't fly around and react to you.
[02:08:46.380 --> 02:08:48.980]   Do I think it was a light?
[02:08:48.980 --> 02:08:50.700]   I'd say no, because of the aspects
[02:08:50.700 --> 02:08:53.300]   and what we looked and watched it do, I'd say no.
[02:08:53.300 --> 02:08:54.660]   - What do you mean by light?
[02:08:54.660 --> 02:08:57.340]   - Like a light ball, you know, some type of perception,
[02:08:57.340 --> 02:09:02.100]   you know, there's, like plasma, you can do plasma
[02:09:02.100 --> 02:09:03.940]   and you can go, oh, I can see it, but it's really not,
[02:09:03.940 --> 02:09:05.300]   you know, it's plasma.
[02:09:05.300 --> 02:09:07.140]   I don't think so.
[02:09:07.140 --> 02:09:09.580]   So you would see distortions, I think, as it moved.
[02:09:09.580 --> 02:09:12.180]   Maybe not, I mean, I'm not a theoretical physicist
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:15.020]   in some, you know, I'm not an MIT.
[02:09:15.020 --> 02:09:20.220]   I would say no, I mean, it looked, from all my experience
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:22.940]   and I had quite a bit of it when this happened,
[02:09:22.940 --> 02:09:26.660]   no, I think it was a hard object.
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:28.540]   It was aware that we were there.
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:31.580]   It reacted exactly like if I was another airplane
[02:09:31.580 --> 02:09:33.060]   and I had to come up and do something,
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:35.980]   exactly what I would do, you know, it mirrored me.
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:38.540]   It wasn't aggressive, you know, there was taco,
[02:09:38.540 --> 02:09:39.860]   it flopped behind us and never,
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:42.700]   it was never offensive on us, it never did that.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:43.540]   It just mirrored us.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:45.620]   So as we're coming down, it's just like, you know,
[02:09:45.620 --> 02:09:48.780]   you're kind of, you know, you said you do martial arts,
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.940]   you know, or wrestling, you know, you see people out
[02:09:50.940 --> 02:09:53.660]   on the, when they get into the ring,
[02:09:53.660 --> 02:09:54.780]   especially with collegiate wrestling,
[02:09:54.780 --> 02:09:56.780]   'cause my roommate in college was a collegiate wrestler.
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:58.780]   So I de facto became a wrestler
[02:09:58.780 --> 02:10:01.260]   'cause he beat me up every night.
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:03.500]   We joke, I talked to him literally probably three,
[02:10:03.500 --> 02:10:04.420]   four times a week.
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:07.340]   But, you know, you see wrestlers when they get out,
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:08.900]   they kind of, you're kind of feeling each other
[02:10:08.900 --> 02:10:09.740]   as you're walking.
[02:10:09.740 --> 02:10:10.780]   Boxers do the same thing.
[02:10:10.780 --> 02:10:11.700]   It was doing that same thing.
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:13.380]   It's like, what's going on as it comes around,
[02:10:13.380 --> 02:10:14.220]   as it comes around.
[02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:16.220]   And then it was like, hey, we're gonna get here.
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:18.780]   And when I got too close to it, you know,
[02:10:18.780 --> 02:10:19.900]   it decided I'm out of here.
[02:10:19.900 --> 02:10:22.180]   And then it did something that we've never seen.
[02:10:22.180 --> 02:10:23.020]   The other question is,
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:24.540]   what if I didn't cut across the circle?
[02:10:24.540 --> 02:10:26.220]   What if I just kept going around a circle?
[02:10:26.220 --> 02:10:27.060]   - We just keep going like that?
[02:10:27.060 --> 02:10:28.060]   - I could have just watched it.
[02:10:28.060 --> 02:10:30.980]   I mean, my one regret out of the whole thing is,
[02:10:30.980 --> 02:10:33.020]   we have a camera in our helmet, in the joint helmet.
[02:10:33.020 --> 02:10:33.860]   There's a little camera,
[02:10:33.860 --> 02:10:35.900]   but we never use it because it's nauseating to watch
[02:10:35.900 --> 02:10:37.620]   'cause you've ever put a GoPro on someone's head
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:39.020]   where they're looking around like this all the time,
[02:10:39.020 --> 02:10:40.780]   it'll nauseate you.
[02:10:40.780 --> 02:10:42.180]   So we never turn that on.
[02:10:42.180 --> 02:10:43.700]   And all, you know, it's the one thing I didn't do
[02:10:43.700 --> 02:10:45.900]   is reach down and hit the switch, you know?
[02:10:45.900 --> 02:10:47.140]   And then we didn't go back and,
[02:10:47.140 --> 02:10:48.500]   'cause our tapes didn't have anything
[02:10:48.500 --> 02:10:50.140]   'cause we didn't get it on radar
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:53.300]   because I tried to lock it up
[02:10:53.300 --> 02:10:54.820]   'cause I can move the radar with my head,
[02:10:54.820 --> 02:10:56.380]   but I couldn't, it wouldn't lock.
[02:10:56.380 --> 02:10:57.220]   The radar wouldn't lock.
[02:10:57.220 --> 02:10:58.940]   And so-
[02:10:58.940 --> 02:11:00.500]   - So then the question is,
[02:11:00.500 --> 02:11:02.060]   and this is unanswerable,
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:05.660]   but let's try to get some hints at it.
[02:11:05.660 --> 02:11:06.980]   Do you think it's human,
[02:11:06.980 --> 02:11:09.780]   like advanced human-created technology
[02:11:09.780 --> 02:11:14.780]   that's simply top secret that we're just not aware of?
[02:11:14.780 --> 02:11:18.500]   Or is it not something not of this world?
[02:11:18.500 --> 02:11:21.660]   - So if you'd asked me in 2004,
[02:11:21.660 --> 02:11:23.180]   I'd have said, "I don't know."
[02:11:23.180 --> 02:11:28.500]   If you ask me now, so we're coming up on 16 years ago,
[02:11:28.500 --> 02:11:29.340]   - Yeah.
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:32.820]   - for a technology like that,
[02:11:32.820 --> 02:11:35.420]   and let's assume that it didn't have
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.180]   a conventional propulsion system in it,
[02:11:37.180 --> 02:11:38.580]   'cause I don't think it did.
[02:11:38.580 --> 02:11:42.860]   I would like to think that if we had a technology
[02:11:42.860 --> 02:11:44.820]   that would advance mankind leaps and bounds
[02:11:44.820 --> 02:11:46.380]   from what we normally do,
[02:11:46.380 --> 02:11:47.940]   then it would start coming out.
[02:11:47.940 --> 02:11:50.420]   But to hide something like that for 16 years,
[02:11:50.420 --> 02:11:52.380]   and I understand,
[02:11:52.380 --> 02:11:54.780]   and I don't speak for the United States government,
[02:11:54.780 --> 02:11:56.500]   and I never will speak for the United States government,
[02:11:56.500 --> 02:11:57.980]   but I understand how some of that stuff works
[02:11:57.980 --> 02:12:00.940]   for classification levels and why we classify stuff.
[02:12:00.940 --> 02:12:03.300]   Is it detrimental to national defense?
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.180]   But there's a point where you have to look and go,
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:06.580]   if we had a technology like this
[02:12:06.580 --> 02:12:11.340]   that could literally change the way mankind travels,
[02:12:11.340 --> 02:12:13.460]   how we get things into space,
[02:12:13.460 --> 02:12:14.980]   our ability to do things.
[02:12:14.980 --> 02:12:17.220]   You talk about, are we gonna go to Mars?
[02:12:17.220 --> 02:12:19.460]   Well, if you have something that has the ability to go,
[02:12:19.460 --> 02:12:20.740]   'cause remember, these things were coming down
[02:12:20.740 --> 02:12:22.740]   when the cruiser tracked them from above 80,000 feet,
[02:12:22.740 --> 02:12:24.220]   which is space,
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:26.020]   and they would come down and they would come straight down,
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:27.660]   they'd hang out at like 20,000 feet,
[02:12:27.660 --> 02:12:29.900]   and then three or four hours later, they'd go back up.
[02:12:29.900 --> 02:12:31.780]   We don't have anything that can come down, hang out,
[02:12:31.780 --> 02:12:33.060]   and once, you know,
[02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:35.660]   and I'm talking hold out in a spot.
[02:12:35.660 --> 02:12:36.660]   Well, we all know there's winds.
[02:12:36.660 --> 02:12:37.940]   They're not drifting like a balloon.
[02:12:37.940 --> 02:12:39.140]   They're just sitting there.
[02:12:39.140 --> 02:12:40.660]   And then they would go back up.
[02:12:40.660 --> 02:12:42.140]   And they tracked up to the,
[02:12:42.140 --> 02:12:43.780]   when I talked to the controller,
[02:12:43.780 --> 02:12:46.060]   he's like, "We've seen up to 10 of these things."
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:49.020]   There's other guys, and it was raining and all this other,
[02:12:49.020 --> 02:12:52.660]   let's just say they tracked a groups of these things
[02:12:52.660 --> 02:12:55.220]   coming down, hanging out, and going up.
[02:12:55.220 --> 02:12:57.860]   - So it's not just propulsion and the way it moves.
[02:12:57.860 --> 02:12:59.180]   It's also fuel.
[02:12:59.180 --> 02:13:00.100]   - It's everything.
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:05.100]   - The whole of it indicates a kind of technology
[02:13:05.100 --> 02:13:07.460]   that's highly advanced.
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:09.820]   But you don't think, in your sense,
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:11.340]   that you actually don't know,
[02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:14.380]   but you know more than a lot of people,
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:18.860]   in your sense, the top secret military technology,
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:19.980]   if you think about skunkworks,
[02:13:19.980 --> 02:13:21.380]   if you think about like that,
[02:13:21.420 --> 02:13:25.340]   it cannot be more than 15 years ahead.
[02:13:25.340 --> 02:13:27.860]   - I would say, for a leap like that,
[02:13:27.860 --> 02:13:32.420]   and a perfect example in modern times is the 117.
[02:13:32.420 --> 02:13:34.060]   Because now a lot of the data on the 117
[02:13:34.060 --> 02:13:36.460]   is out like it was developed at this time.
[02:13:36.460 --> 02:13:38.900]   It flew for this long before it was actually acknowledged
[02:13:38.900 --> 02:13:39.980]   by the United States government.
[02:13:39.980 --> 02:13:40.820]   - What's the 117?
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:42.260]   - That's the stealth fighter.
[02:13:42.260 --> 02:13:43.260]   The original stealth fighter,
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:44.540]   not the B-2, but the stealth fighter.
[02:13:44.540 --> 02:13:48.140]   So you look at that, yeah, you can,
[02:13:48.140 --> 02:13:50.220]   I think you can hide things for a while.
[02:13:51.180 --> 02:13:52.740]   But I think a technology, a leap,
[02:13:52.740 --> 02:13:54.940]   I mean, this is not a,
[02:13:54.940 --> 02:13:55.900]   hey, we developed this
[02:13:55.900 --> 02:13:59.460]   and we're kind of pushing the edge of technology.
[02:13:59.460 --> 02:14:02.340]   This is a giant leap in technology.
[02:14:02.340 --> 02:14:06.340]   And the other one is, do we have the basis to do that?
[02:14:06.340 --> 02:14:08.900]   Because usually when you have a technology like that,
[02:14:08.900 --> 02:14:12.460]   universities, especially the one you're working at, MIT,
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:13.940]   a lot of the leading edge stuff
[02:14:13.940 --> 02:14:16.140]   is coming out of the top tier universities.
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:17.980]   So you've got MIT, you've got Caltech,
[02:14:17.980 --> 02:14:21.420]   you've got Stanford, Georgia Tech, Virginia Tech,
[02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:23.620]   Carnegie Mellon, I'm just naming schools.
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:25.660]   Naval Postgraduate School is another one.
[02:14:25.660 --> 02:14:29.100]   There's usually indicators, there's papers of,
[02:14:29.100 --> 02:14:31.420]   hey, this is where we're going.
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:32.980]   I don't think there's a whole bunch of papers
[02:14:32.980 --> 02:14:36.460]   on developing a gravity-based propulsion system
[02:14:36.460 --> 02:14:38.500]   that literally, I've got an object,
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:41.060]   'cause how much power would it cost
[02:14:41.060 --> 02:14:44.100]   to create a gravity field of your own
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:45.460]   that could actually be strong enough
[02:14:45.460 --> 02:14:48.340]   to counter the giant orb that we live on?
[02:14:48.340 --> 02:14:50.420]   - So by the way, you mentioned gravity-based.
[02:14:50.420 --> 02:14:53.540]   That's kind of like the hypothesizing that people do
[02:14:53.540 --> 02:14:55.780]   in terms of propulsion,
[02:14:55.780 --> 02:15:00.780]   like what kind of propulsion would have to be involved
[02:15:00.780 --> 02:15:03.200]   in order to result in that kind of movement.
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:06.140]   To me, all the gravity discussion just seems insane
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:08.240]   from a physics perspective, but of course,
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:13.700]   it would seem insane until it's not.
[02:15:13.700 --> 02:15:16.620]   Because remember, we only know what we know.
[02:15:16.620 --> 02:15:18.780]   - Yeah, and which is very little, relatively.
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:21.980]   - And as someone has to think out of the box to go,
[02:15:21.980 --> 02:15:25.500]   is this possible at all?
[02:15:25.500 --> 02:15:28.380]   - Yeah, well, okay, so you're saying
[02:15:28.380 --> 02:15:30.980]   that if you had to bet money, all your money,
[02:15:30.980 --> 02:15:35.380]   it would be something that's alien technology,
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:37.700]   so it's not human-created technology.
[02:15:37.700 --> 02:15:39.420]   - Well, I don't like to get into little green men,
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:42.740]   but I would say that I don't think we've developed it.
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:44.940]   I don't think we've developed it.
[02:15:44.940 --> 02:15:46.420]   You know, 'cause the other one, someone had asked me,
[02:15:46.420 --> 02:15:47.460]   they said, "What if there wasn't,
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:50.780]   "maybe it was just a drone, maybe it was a UAV
[02:15:50.780 --> 02:15:53.980]   "that got sent here from someplace else."
[02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:56.340]   I mean, we've got stuff out there flying around,
[02:15:56.340 --> 02:15:59.820]   so I don't know.
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:01.580]   I mean, I'd like to sit around and talk to some
[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:03.900]   of the giant brains that think this stuff up.
[02:16:03.900 --> 02:16:06.340]   I was supposed to be on a podcast with one of 'em.
[02:16:06.340 --> 02:16:08.780]   But-- - Which topic?
[02:16:08.780 --> 02:16:11.060]   Which, you mean for drones?
[02:16:11.060 --> 02:16:13.980]   - Just space travel, technology,
[02:16:13.980 --> 02:16:15.660]   because if you look at where we're going,
[02:16:15.660 --> 02:16:17.940]   'cause everyone talks about Mars.
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:19.460]   - Yeah, okay, and we're, hey,
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:20.740]   are we gonna be able to colonize,
[02:16:20.740 --> 02:16:22.060]   and I know Elon is big into that.
[02:16:22.060 --> 02:16:26.020]   - Yeah, what do you think about Elon, SpaceX, NASA?
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:29.700]   We put humans back up there.
[02:16:29.700 --> 02:16:33.740]   - My theory, so it's funny, 'cause I know one of the guys
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:37.020]   that was, he was one of the original employees at SpaceX.
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:39.740]   He's a friend of mine, and I won't say his name,
[02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:41.860]   but he knows Elon, he knows Elon,
[02:16:41.860 --> 02:16:45.180]   and he actually worked on the entire Falcon 1 project.
[02:16:45.180 --> 02:16:46.260]   He's one of the lead guys on that.
[02:16:46.260 --> 02:16:48.140]   So he's got some great, as a matter of fact,
[02:16:48.140 --> 02:16:49.740]   there's a movie, there's a book coming out
[02:16:49.740 --> 02:16:51.300]   that comes out in about a year on this,
[02:16:51.300 --> 02:16:53.020]   the original, the first years of space,
[02:16:53.020 --> 02:16:56.260]   first six years of SpaceX, and he's named in the book,
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:57.460]   and they're supposed to make a movie on it,
[02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:59.860]   so I'm like, hey, who's gonna play it?
[02:16:59.860 --> 02:17:03.500]   But what he's done, to me, it changed the game,
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:06.220]   and here's why, because I said,
[02:17:06.220 --> 02:17:07.900]   I think it was '62 when Eisenhower warned
[02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:10.300]   of the industrial defense complex,
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:13.940]   which it has become, everything he warned us of,
[02:17:13.940 --> 02:17:18.260]   it has become, and it's really driven by,
[02:17:18.260 --> 02:17:20.180]   there's the big three in defense,
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:23.700]   which is really Northrop, Lockheed, and Boeing.
[02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:25.580]   Those are the big, those are your biggest,
[02:17:25.580 --> 02:17:28.340]   and Raytheon's kind of like a subset of that,
[02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:29.780]   but they're, Raytheon's pretty big too,
[02:17:29.780 --> 02:17:32.340]   but in US defense, those are the big guys, right?
[02:17:32.340 --> 02:17:33.940]   That's actually where a lot of military guys go
[02:17:33.940 --> 02:17:35.140]   when they retire, they go do stuff like that.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:39.500]   So when you look at that, and you go,
[02:17:39.500 --> 02:17:41.620]   and the way government contracting is working,
[02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:44.180]   and how we charge, and why things cost so much,
[02:17:44.180 --> 02:17:47.460]   and then you go, you got Elon,
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:49.940]   who's got an ego, and he doesn't like
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:51.020]   to do things a certain way,
[02:17:51.020 --> 02:17:53.260]   and I've talked to the guy that worked there on,
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:55.380]   'cause the government likes to have oversight of contracts,
[02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:57.540]   where he was like, no, just tell me what you want,
[02:17:57.540 --> 02:17:59.420]   I'll build it, and I'll give you a bill when it's done,
[02:17:59.420 --> 02:18:01.180]   and then if I do it for half the price,
[02:18:01.180 --> 02:18:04.180]   I make a ton of money, 'cause he's a money-driven guy,
[02:18:04.180 --> 02:18:07.420]   which I like, capitalism at its best.
[02:18:07.420 --> 02:18:08.860]   So now you look at the two things,
[02:18:08.860 --> 02:18:13.100]   so you got the SpaceX, which is the Dragon capsule,
[02:18:13.100 --> 02:18:14.540]   and then you've got Boeing.
[02:18:14.540 --> 02:18:19.140]   So Elon did what Boeing is contracted to do
[02:18:19.140 --> 02:18:21.340]   in less time for half the money.
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:24.780]   And oh, by the way, because he can reuse the boosters,
[02:18:24.780 --> 02:18:25.940]   'cause they come back and land,
[02:18:25.940 --> 02:18:27.540]   and you don't have to, like, Morton Thaikol,
[02:18:27.540 --> 02:18:29.220]   we reused 'em on the space shuttle,
[02:18:29.220 --> 02:18:31.100]   but they had to take 'em all apart and do a bunch of stuff,
[02:18:31.100 --> 02:18:32.260]   'cause they landed in salt water,
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:33.900]   and then you had to put 'em all back together,
[02:18:33.900 --> 02:18:35.020]   where Elon gets 'em down,
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:36.020]   'cause I was joking with this guy,
[02:18:36.020 --> 02:18:36.860]   I go, "What do they do?
[02:18:36.860 --> 02:18:38.980]   "Do they, like, rehaul, you know, overhaul?"
[02:18:38.980 --> 02:18:40.100]   He goes, "No, actually, they clean 'em up,
[02:18:40.100 --> 02:18:40.980]   "and they can use 'em again.
[02:18:40.980 --> 02:18:43.140]   "They're reusable systems."
[02:18:43.140 --> 02:18:45.540]   Incredible leap in technology that no one thought of,
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:46.940]   but here's a private company.
[02:18:46.940 --> 02:18:48.340]   So being able to put people on,
[02:18:48.340 --> 02:18:49.980]   and the capsule and the spacesuits,
[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:51.180]   I mean, it's literally like sci-fi,
[02:18:51.180 --> 02:18:52.780]   when you watch when they went up.
[02:18:52.780 --> 02:18:56.820]   So I'm a huge fan of what he and his company
[02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:58.980]   have been able to do, because, you know,
[02:18:58.980 --> 02:19:01.180]   the fact that we were paying huge amounts of money
[02:19:01.180 --> 02:19:02.740]   to the Russian government, you know,
[02:19:02.740 --> 02:19:04.180]   and oh, by the way, if you didn't know,
[02:19:04.180 --> 02:19:06.620]   'cause I have some friends that are astronauts,
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:09.660]   they all have to learn Russian, right?
[02:19:09.660 --> 02:19:11.540]   And they have to do, it's what, level five,
[02:19:11.540 --> 02:19:13.940]   where the test is a phone call,
[02:19:13.940 --> 02:19:15.260]   where they call you up, and they, you know,
[02:19:15.260 --> 02:19:17.860]   'cause they would go, so I went to the pinning,
[02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:19.660]   and two friends of mine,
[02:19:19.660 --> 02:19:20.940]   the one actually had a mission date,
[02:19:20.940 --> 02:19:21.780]   the one got one later,
[02:19:21.780 --> 02:19:23.620]   so it's cool when you're watching your friends
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:26.020]   doing a spacewalk, you know, 'cause I would pull up,
[02:19:26.020 --> 02:19:26.940]   because if I knew what was going on,
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:28.780]   I'd pull up the NASA thing, I was at a meeting one day,
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:31.540]   and I've got NASA on, and makers out there
[02:19:31.540 --> 02:19:33.420]   floating around, you know, doing his stuff,
[02:19:33.420 --> 02:19:34.980]   and I saw one, he's in the space station
[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:35.940]   while they're doing a spacewalk,
[02:19:35.940 --> 02:19:37.020]   so it's kind of cool when you go,
[02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:37.940]   oh, yeah, I know that dude,
[02:19:37.940 --> 02:19:40.620]   he's up there in space floating around.
[02:19:40.620 --> 02:19:44.260]   So, when you look at what those,
[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:46.820]   they're capable of doing, and then you go,
[02:19:46.820 --> 02:19:50.020]   what Elon is bringing to the fact that now,
[02:19:50.020 --> 02:19:52.820]   it's back in America, it's actually,
[02:19:52.820 --> 02:19:56.760]   to me, it's cost-effective for us
[02:19:56.760 --> 02:19:58.540]   to be able to do more stuff.
[02:19:58.540 --> 02:20:00.740]   I think it opens the door to,
[02:20:00.740 --> 02:20:01.860]   do we go back to the moon?
[02:20:01.860 --> 02:20:03.240]   Is there a reason to go back to the moon?
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:04.300]   Personally, I think if we're gonna,
[02:20:04.300 --> 02:20:05.740]   if they're really gonna go, you know,
[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:06.860]   in years from now, go to Mars,
[02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:08.540]   I think that the moon is the stepping stone
[02:20:08.540 --> 02:20:11.700]   to go back, to start proving some of the technology,
[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:14.060]   to go, hey, we can build this, we can get on the moon,
[02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:16.200]   and now we can get back off the moon,
[02:20:16.200 --> 02:20:19.620]   because we did this on a,
[02:20:19.620 --> 02:20:21.700]   less than a compact computer in the '60s,
[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:23.420]   which is the whole reason that I flew,
[02:20:23.420 --> 02:20:24.740]   'cause I'm obsessed, matter of fact,
[02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:27.820]   I have the giant Lego Apollo at home,
[02:20:27.820 --> 02:20:30.620]   and the lander, and I have one that my dad built me
[02:20:30.620 --> 02:20:32.760]   in 1969, right after that.
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:36.220]   And Neil Armstrong's an Ohio boy, and so am I.
[02:20:36.220 --> 02:20:38.100]   Matter of fact, I have a picture of him in a car
[02:20:38.100 --> 02:20:39.580]   in Wapakoneta, Ohio, at the parade
[02:20:39.580 --> 02:20:40.500]   after he walked on the moon,
[02:20:40.500 --> 02:20:42.660]   'cause his parents didn't live far from my aunt and uncle
[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:45.020]   in Wapakoneta, and they were out at the parade.
[02:20:45.020 --> 02:20:48.420]   So, I've been obsessed with this since I was a child.
[02:20:48.420 --> 02:20:51.100]   - Do you hope to, do you think, do you hope
[02:20:51.100 --> 02:20:55.640]   that you'll go out to space one day?
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:20:58.300]   - Me, if I had the opportunity, I'd go in a second.
[02:20:58.300 --> 02:20:59.140]   You know, I am not--
[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:01.180]   - 'Cause I mean, that's one of the hopes
[02:21:01.180 --> 02:21:04.860]   of the commercial space flight, is that, you know,
[02:21:04.860 --> 02:21:08.300]   like people like, I mean, it would be tourism,
[02:21:08.300 --> 02:21:10.420]   but you certainly wouldn't wanna, in terms of,
[02:21:10.420 --> 02:21:13.140]   you're now kind of a civilian, right?
[02:21:13.140 --> 02:21:15.180]   I mean, in a sense that you're just a normal person,
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.600]   you're not a fighter jet pilot currently,
[02:21:17.600 --> 02:21:20.500]   but it seems like if we send a civilian up there,
[02:21:20.500 --> 02:21:23.860]   it would be somebody like you, in the next, like, 20 years.
[02:21:23.860 --> 02:21:25.980]   - I'd be, you know, if Elon wants to throw me
[02:21:25.980 --> 02:21:27.220]   on one of those things, I'd be all over it.
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.140]   I don't know what my wife would say,
[02:21:28.140 --> 02:21:30.240]   but you know, sometimes you gotta get your kicks
[02:21:30.240 --> 02:21:31.100]   while you're alive.
[02:21:31.100 --> 02:21:32.900]   - I'd love to hear that discussion with your wife.
[02:21:32.900 --> 02:21:35.460]   Listen, there's the pros and cons.
[02:21:35.460 --> 02:21:37.940]   - She's, I mean, I've known her since high school,
[02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:40.580]   so she, yeah, she knows how I am, you know.
[02:21:40.580 --> 02:21:41.740]   Most people that know me are like,
[02:21:41.740 --> 02:21:42.980]   yeah, you're pretty much the same person
[02:21:42.980 --> 02:21:43.820]   you were in high school.
[02:21:43.820 --> 02:21:46.520]   You know, I was a class clown, and I still am that way.
[02:21:46.520 --> 02:21:48.300]   So--
[02:21:48.300 --> 02:21:49.460]   - Let me ask you this question about,
[02:21:49.460 --> 02:21:52.140]   so I'm talking to Elon again soon.
[02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:55.020]   I'm curious to get your perspective on it.
[02:21:57.140 --> 02:21:59.500]   If I wanted to talk to him about Tic Tac,
[02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:04.500]   about these weird, out-there propulsion ideas,
[02:22:04.500 --> 02:22:07.260]   which are obviously, just like you said,
[02:22:07.260 --> 02:22:08.900]   if there's something to it,
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:11.160]   if it can be investigated somehow,
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:13.960]   it would be extremely useful for us to understand
[02:22:13.960 --> 02:22:17.180]   in the effort of developing propulsion systems
[02:22:17.180 --> 02:22:20.420]   that can get us cheaply out to space.
[02:22:20.420 --> 02:22:23.320]   What should Elon think about this stuff?
[02:22:23.320 --> 02:22:24.340]   What should he do?
[02:22:24.340 --> 02:22:25.980]   What should people like him--
[02:22:25.980 --> 02:22:28.060]   - I think people need to open their aperture up
[02:22:28.060 --> 02:22:32.500]   and stay off of, take the next step and go,
[02:22:32.500 --> 02:22:35.220]   you know, we are tied to fuels,
[02:22:35.220 --> 02:22:38.260]   and either solid rocket or liquid, or whatever we do,
[02:22:38.260 --> 02:22:41.340]   but it's a thrust generated where we rapidly expand gas
[02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:44.740]   to create thrust, which is really, in layman's terms,
[02:22:44.740 --> 02:22:47.540]   you know, we can get into what, but that's what it does.
[02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:52.200]   If you have something that you can contain
[02:22:52.200 --> 02:22:54.940]   that is a fuel source that would last
[02:22:54.940 --> 02:22:58.180]   a significant amount of time, you know,
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:22:59.840]   those rocket boosters go, and when they're done,
[02:22:59.840 --> 02:23:01.620]   they're done, there's enough to get 'em back down,
[02:23:01.620 --> 02:23:03.460]   and that's it, there's not a huge, you know,
[02:23:03.460 --> 02:23:04.300]   not coming back and go,
[02:23:04.300 --> 02:23:05.700]   "Oh, I still got three quarters of a tank,
[02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:07.260]   "let's bolt 'em on and do it again."
[02:23:07.260 --> 02:23:08.860]   His system's not doing that.
[02:23:08.860 --> 02:23:13.540]   But, you know, the way contracting,
[02:23:13.540 --> 02:23:14.380]   especially in the government,
[02:23:14.380 --> 02:23:15.780]   the government has tons of money,
[02:23:15.780 --> 02:23:18.060]   but you gotta remember the government has to justify
[02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:20.020]   how they spend our tax dollars for the most part.
[02:23:20.020 --> 02:23:22.600]   There's times where they can hide money in the budget
[02:23:22.600 --> 02:23:24.920]   to get stuff done, but then when you look at,
[02:23:24.920 --> 02:23:26.220]   and I'm just gonna throw a few out there,
[02:23:26.220 --> 02:23:30.860]   but if you look at what Amazon, you know,
[02:23:30.860 --> 02:23:33.580]   does with Bezos, and you've got Elon,
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:37.100]   there's some big money out there.
[02:23:37.100 --> 02:23:38.580]   I mean, you're talking, you know,
[02:23:38.580 --> 02:23:43.060]   Bezos alone could buy companies, like big companies.
[02:23:43.060 --> 02:23:44.060]   Apple's another one.
[02:23:44.060 --> 02:23:47.740]   These companies got huge, huge amounts of money,
[02:23:47.740 --> 02:23:49.840]   and then just go over to the Gates Foundation,
[02:23:49.840 --> 02:23:52.800]   and they've got gazillions and gazillions of dollars.
[02:23:52.800 --> 02:23:53.940]   We've got universities.
[02:23:53.940 --> 02:23:55.120]   There's so much money out there.
[02:23:55.120 --> 02:23:57.580]   If we really wanted to do it,
[02:23:57.580 --> 02:23:59.500]   aside from what the government wants to do,
[02:23:59.500 --> 02:24:02.020]   because we do live in a free society,
[02:24:02.020 --> 02:24:05.820]   I think there's enough to go, "How do we do this?"
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:08.720]   Because when you work outside of
[02:24:08.720 --> 02:24:10.540]   what the government would wanna do,
[02:24:10.540 --> 02:24:12.860]   so we're not working on this necessarily
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:15.420]   for the United States, although I am a huge giant.
[02:24:15.420 --> 02:24:17.980]   - American. - I would never,
[02:24:17.980 --> 02:24:18.820]   yeah, I am an American.
[02:24:18.820 --> 02:24:20.700]   - You're talking to somebody born in the Soviet Union.
[02:24:20.700 --> 02:24:23.140]   I can't believe you agreed to this.
[02:24:23.140 --> 02:24:26.060]   - But when I, no. - You haven't killed me yet.
[02:24:26.060 --> 02:24:28.180]   (laughs)
[02:24:28.180 --> 02:24:29.480]   - Yeah, well, you're here.
[02:24:29.480 --> 02:24:32.300]   And you've been here for a while.
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:33.460]   - No, no, no, I'm joking.
[02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:34.580]   I'm an American citizen.
[02:24:34.580 --> 02:24:36.620]   I'm actually pretty much American through and through.
[02:24:36.620 --> 02:24:37.460]   - But see, when you do that,
[02:24:37.460 --> 02:24:40.060]   so you look at, let's just look at American universities.
[02:24:40.060 --> 02:24:41.460]   So there's some brilliant minds,
[02:24:41.460 --> 02:24:43.740]   and we'll just use MIT, 'cause you worked down there.
[02:24:43.740 --> 02:24:44.860]   There's some brilliant minds,
[02:24:44.860 --> 02:24:46.900]   but there's a huge chunk of those brilliant minds
[02:24:46.900 --> 02:24:48.100]   that are not American citizens.
[02:24:48.100 --> 02:24:50.180]   So if you wanna get into government stuff,
[02:24:50.180 --> 02:24:51.620]   and you are not an American citizen,
[02:24:51.620 --> 02:24:53.860]   it gets really, really, really hard.
[02:24:53.860 --> 02:24:57.660]   But if I take money, like Bezos money, Elon money,
[02:24:57.660 --> 02:25:00.460]   and they, let's just say they wanna work together,
[02:25:00.460 --> 02:25:02.740]   they can split it up 50/50, the two of 'em,
[02:25:02.740 --> 02:25:04.500]   when the technology gets developed.
[02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:07.160]   But now I'm not constrained by who has to do the work.
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:08.980]   I just wanna make sure that I try and keep it
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:12.140]   in the United States, because technology is technology,
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:14.580]   and if it gets developed and gets over to where,
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:17.300]   a country gets ahold of it,
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:18.860]   and then just basically uses it for their own,
[02:25:18.860 --> 02:25:21.460]   because you save 'em all the research time.
[02:25:21.460 --> 02:25:22.660]   You don't wanna do that.
[02:25:22.660 --> 02:25:24.220]   But if we can get to the point where we can,
[02:25:24.220 --> 02:25:25.660]   we do it on the International Space Station.
[02:25:25.660 --> 02:25:27.860]   We realized that space was too expensive
[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:29.820]   for one country to do alone.
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:31.300]   So we made the International Space Station,
[02:25:31.300 --> 02:25:34.540]   and we have a conglomerate.
[02:25:34.540 --> 02:25:36.460]   It's the one thing that the Russians and the US
[02:25:36.460 --> 02:25:38.060]   actually work together on.
[02:25:38.060 --> 02:25:39.380]   Think about it, that's it.
[02:25:39.380 --> 02:25:41.660]   We work together on space, because we realize
[02:25:41.660 --> 02:25:45.060]   it's way too expensive for us to do alone, and effective.
[02:25:45.060 --> 02:25:46.380]   So we've got this thing that's been out there
[02:25:46.380 --> 02:25:48.540]   floating around for God now, what is it, like 20 years,
[02:25:48.540 --> 02:25:50.000]   that thing's been up there floating around?
[02:25:50.000 --> 02:25:52.140]   So it's getting old, we're gonna have to replace parts
[02:25:52.140 --> 02:25:55.140]   and do stuff, but if we can pool the money together
[02:25:55.140 --> 02:25:56.820]   and come up with something that would literally
[02:25:56.820 --> 02:25:58.420]   change mankind and change travel,
[02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:00.740]   and allow us to actually do a more effective thing
[02:26:00.740 --> 02:26:03.660]   of exploring, 'cause if you develop that technology,
[02:26:03.660 --> 02:26:06.140]   I'm not, you don't even have to send a man person.
[02:26:06.140 --> 02:26:08.340]   If you can develop a technology that's so,
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:10.260]   and with our automation and where we're progressing
[02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:13.980]   and our competing power, to send something out
[02:26:13.980 --> 02:26:15.540]   that's not just floating around,
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:18.460]   when, you know, that can react a lot quicker,
[02:26:18.460 --> 02:26:20.280]   something that could actually go down to the surface
[02:26:20.280 --> 02:26:21.480]   and come back up, so right now,
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:23.160]   everything we get out of Mars, it goes down there
[02:26:23.160 --> 02:26:25.560]   and it just sends data back, you can analyze it.
[02:26:25.560 --> 02:26:27.200]   But if I've got a technology that can go up there
[02:26:27.200 --> 02:26:28.680]   really quick, I'm not worried about, man,
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:30.320]   I don't have life support systems and all that,
[02:26:30.320 --> 02:26:32.920]   but it can go down, it can go, it can cruise around,
[02:26:32.920 --> 02:26:34.760]   it can hover above, it can take samples,
[02:26:34.760 --> 02:26:38.520]   and it can actually take Martian soil and then bring it back
[02:26:38.520 --> 02:26:41.040]   so we can analyze it here, that's a game changer.
[02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:42.080]   It's a complete game changer,
[02:26:42.080 --> 02:26:44.920]   because it opens up all the planets.
[02:26:44.920 --> 02:26:49.920]   - Exactly, so in a sense, the tic-tac is a symbol,
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:54.020]   so whatever you think, even from a debunking perspective,
[02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:58.380]   there's a non-zero probability that it's alien technology,
[02:26:58.380 --> 02:27:03.380]   and in that sense, it serves as a beacon of hope
[02:27:03.380 --> 02:27:08.060]   and a reason to, like you said, widen the aperture
[02:27:08.060 --> 02:27:11.300]   and to invest big amounts of money
[02:27:11.300 --> 02:27:13.300]   into thinking outside the box.
[02:27:13.300 --> 02:27:18.300]   It's almost a hope to say we can do better propulsion,
[02:27:18.300 --> 02:27:25.320]   we can overcome physics in an order of magnitude better way,
[02:27:25.320 --> 02:27:27.280]   and it's worthwhile to try.
[02:27:27.280 --> 02:27:28.500]   - I think, and I don't think the money,
[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:30.320]   if you look at the big picture with the amount of money,
[02:27:30.320 --> 02:27:31.420]   some of that's out there floating around
[02:27:31.420 --> 02:27:34.220]   in these private companies, I think if you said,
[02:27:34.220 --> 02:27:36.700]   hey, I've got, let's just say $100 million,
[02:27:36.700 --> 02:27:38.540]   which really, $100 million relative to,
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:40.420]   Bezos has got, what, a hundred and some billion dollars
[02:27:40.420 --> 02:27:41.460]   in that work. - A billion, yeah.
[02:27:41.460 --> 02:27:44.140]   - So if he said, hey, $100 million,
[02:27:44.140 --> 02:27:46.180]   you drop $100 million, and I go,
[02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:48.260]   and I'm gonna put a, like the government will send
[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:50.540]   a broad area announcement out that says,
[02:27:50.540 --> 02:27:53.420]   hey, we're looking for this technology, or a DARPA program,
[02:27:53.420 --> 02:27:57.060]   but what if I just said, hey, who's to stop Bezos and Elon
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:58.740]   from doing that on their own to say, hey,
[02:27:58.740 --> 02:28:00.060]   I wanna go pool universities
[02:28:00.060 --> 02:28:01.540]   'cause they have fewer restrictions
[02:28:01.540 --> 02:28:02.700]   because it's not tax dollars,
[02:28:02.700 --> 02:28:03.660]   they don't have the checks and balances,
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:05.460]   they can do whatever they want, so their money,
[02:28:05.460 --> 02:28:08.940]   oh, sorry about that, to go, hey, I'm gonna put this out,
[02:28:08.940 --> 02:28:11.300]   and I'm gonna get the best physicists
[02:28:11.300 --> 02:28:13.900]   that are working at CERN, that are at MIT,
[02:28:13.900 --> 02:28:15.740]   that are at Caltech, at the schools I mentioned,
[02:28:15.740 --> 02:28:17.980]   and oh, by the way, a few of these guys
[02:28:17.980 --> 02:28:20.220]   are propulsion experts, and I'm gonna basically,
[02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:23.380]   I'm gonna fund you guys for 10 years.
[02:28:23.380 --> 02:28:25.300]   So you get $10 million a year,
[02:28:25.300 --> 02:28:26.620]   and I'm gonna give you your salaries,
[02:28:26.620 --> 02:28:28.180]   and we're gonna do that, or whatever the amount works,
[02:28:28.180 --> 02:28:30.940]   so let's cut it down to five so we can pay you well, right,
[02:28:30.940 --> 02:28:32.500]   to do the research, but oh, by the way,
[02:28:32.500 --> 02:28:36.540]   the research is, it's not classified, but it's controlled.
[02:28:36.540 --> 02:28:38.860]   So we're not gonna publicly just put this out in journals,
[02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:41.660]   but if we make a leap that we think would advance,
[02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:44.220]   because although those, let's say there's 10 of 'em,
[02:28:44.220 --> 02:28:45.820]   those 10 scientists come up with something,
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:48.500]   and they put out a paper, there might be another,
[02:28:48.500 --> 02:28:51.100]   a number 11 at another university that reads that paper
[02:28:51.100 --> 02:28:53.740]   and says, hey, I kinda had this idea,
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:56.300]   and now you can get a thought pool that pushes us in
[02:28:56.300 --> 02:28:59.220]   and gets us out of the mindset,
[02:28:59.220 --> 02:29:01.340]   'cause we have a tendency to,
[02:29:01.340 --> 02:29:03.500]   we evolve the stuff that we create,
[02:29:03.500 --> 02:29:07.060]   but it's like I was joking, 'cause I know a ton of guys
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:10.020]   with PhDs and girls, and I said, but you know,
[02:29:10.020 --> 02:29:12.340]   how much, when a person gets a PhD in engineering,
[02:29:12.340 --> 02:29:14.180]   how much new math is really being done?
[02:29:14.180 --> 02:29:16.060]   I said, there's a handful of people in the world
[02:29:16.060 --> 02:29:19.460]   that are really doing, I'm talking Stephen Hawking's type
[02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:22.980]   brilliance that is going, I'm really doing something
[02:29:22.980 --> 02:29:25.940]   that's totally different.
[02:29:25.940 --> 02:29:28.380]   - That's a big, dramatic thing now going on in physics
[02:29:28.380 --> 02:29:32.140]   that everybody's converged towards this local minima
[02:29:32.140 --> 02:29:34.260]   or local maxima, however you think about it,
[02:29:34.260 --> 02:29:38.260]   and it's, again, same as with the TIC-TAC,
[02:29:38.260 --> 02:29:43.260]   thinking outside the box is not accepted,
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:44.980]   and it probably should be.
[02:29:44.980 --> 02:29:47.020]   - But it's hard, because if you go back,
[02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:49.700]   go back to Einstein, back to the original,
[02:29:49.700 --> 02:29:52.980]   he was out of the box.
[02:29:52.980 --> 02:29:54.660]   He did not think the norm. - That's a true genius.
[02:29:54.660 --> 02:29:56.860]   - Had he not thought out of the box
[02:29:56.860 --> 02:29:59.860]   and came up with some of his theories, where would we be?
[02:29:59.860 --> 02:30:02.980]   - Okay, we're jumping around a little bit.
[02:30:02.980 --> 02:30:06.740]   So we talked a little bit about Elon and Mars and space,
[02:30:06.740 --> 02:30:11.740]   but let me jump back to a few questions that folks had.
[02:30:11.740 --> 02:30:14.660]   I have to kind of bring up some debunking stuff,
[02:30:14.660 --> 02:30:19.140]   because I think, not the actual facts of the debunking,
[02:30:19.140 --> 02:30:24.140]   but the nature of the true believers versus the debunkers
[02:30:24.140 --> 02:30:26.780]   hurts my heart a little bit, because people are just
[02:30:26.780 --> 02:30:29.780]   talking past each other, but let me kind of bring it up.
[02:30:30.780 --> 02:30:35.220]   Mick West, I've just recently started to pay attention,
[02:30:35.220 --> 02:30:37.540]   just in preparing to talk to you about this world,
[02:30:37.540 --> 02:30:39.580]   and Mick West is one of the better known people
[02:30:39.580 --> 02:30:44.500]   who kind of makes a career out of trying to debunk.
[02:30:44.500 --> 02:30:48.480]   So his natural approach to all situations
[02:30:48.480 --> 02:30:50.340]   is that of a skeptic.
[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:52.460]   I think it's very useful and powerful,
[02:30:52.460 --> 02:30:55.180]   especially for me coming from a scientific perspective,
[02:30:55.180 --> 02:30:56.980]   to take the approach he does.
[02:30:56.980 --> 02:31:00.260]   It's valuable, and I think no matter what,
[02:31:00.260 --> 02:31:03.140]   I think there's, I hope that people,
[02:31:03.140 --> 02:31:04.820]   quote unquote true believers,
[02:31:04.820 --> 02:31:07.980]   are a little bit more open-minded to the work of Mick West.
[02:31:07.980 --> 02:31:10.940]   I think it's quite useful and brilliant work.
[02:31:10.940 --> 02:31:14.020]   So let me ask, he has a bunch of videos,
[02:31:14.020 --> 02:31:16.860]   a bunch of ideas, where he kind of suggests
[02:31:16.860 --> 02:31:19.020]   possible other explanations of the things
[02:31:19.020 --> 02:31:20.780]   that are out there.
[02:31:20.780 --> 02:31:25.260]   He has some explanations of the things that you've seen
[02:31:25.260 --> 02:31:28.660]   with the Tic Tac, like with your own eyes.
[02:31:28.660 --> 02:31:33.540]   Like he says that it's possible that you miscalculated
[02:31:33.540 --> 02:31:36.140]   the size and the distance of the thing,
[02:31:36.140 --> 02:31:37.820]   and so on, when you were flying around.
[02:31:37.820 --> 02:31:41.020]   I don't find that as, I mean, maybe you can comment on that.
[02:31:41.020 --> 02:31:42.220]   - No, let me do it right now.
[02:31:42.220 --> 02:31:43.060]   - Sure.
[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:43.880]   - So, 'cause that comes up.
[02:31:43.880 --> 02:31:45.900]   Like how did you know it was about 40 feet long?
[02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:50.900]   I go, okay, so 16 years, flying against other airplanes,
[02:31:50.900 --> 02:31:53.260]   know what stuff looks like, you know,
[02:31:53.260 --> 02:31:54.820]   I've looked down on things.
[02:31:54.820 --> 02:31:56.620]   So if I know, I know, here's the known things.
[02:31:56.620 --> 02:32:00.820]   I know when we saw the Tic Tac, I was at 20,000 feet-ish,
[02:32:00.820 --> 02:32:02.060]   right around there.
[02:32:02.060 --> 02:32:04.300]   So when I look down, I know what a Hornet looks like
[02:32:04.300 --> 02:32:05.780]   looking down on 'em, 'cause I've done it
[02:32:05.780 --> 02:32:07.260]   for all those years.
[02:32:07.260 --> 02:32:08.340]   I mean, I got a good idea.
[02:32:08.340 --> 02:32:09.700]   So that's why I said 40 feet,
[02:32:09.700 --> 02:32:11.820]   'cause it's about Hornet size.
[02:32:11.820 --> 02:32:14.380]   So, and as I go around, you get to the point
[02:32:14.380 --> 02:32:16.900]   where you have to be able to judge distance
[02:32:16.900 --> 02:32:19.380]   when we fly out of experience.
[02:32:19.380 --> 02:32:22.240]   And you can tell if something's small or big, you know.
[02:32:23.460 --> 02:32:27.260]   So I would argue the fact of, you know, peer experience.
[02:32:27.260 --> 02:32:30.040]   There's, you know, professional observers,
[02:32:30.040 --> 02:32:32.180]   which is what we're actually trained to do,
[02:32:32.180 --> 02:32:36.540]   and having done it for so long, no, it was,
[02:32:36.540 --> 02:32:38.100]   and everyone came back with the same thing.
[02:32:38.100 --> 02:32:40.140]   They're like, yeah, it's about the size of a Hornet.
[02:32:40.140 --> 02:32:42.380]   - From a human factors perspective,
[02:32:42.380 --> 02:32:46.580]   how often in your experience of those 16 years
[02:32:46.580 --> 02:32:50.860]   do you find that what you see
[02:32:50.860 --> 02:32:52.900]   is the incorrect state of things?
[02:32:52.900 --> 02:32:56.260]   So like how often do you make mistakes with vision?
[02:32:56.260 --> 02:33:00.180]   - You actually, you make vision issues a lot,
[02:33:00.180 --> 02:33:02.060]   because you're, and the sad part is,
[02:33:02.060 --> 02:33:04.620]   is your brain believes what your eyes see.
[02:33:04.620 --> 02:33:07.260]   We are actually trained to do the opposite of that,
[02:33:07.260 --> 02:33:08.980]   especially when you instrument fly,
[02:33:08.980 --> 02:33:13.100]   because your brain and eyes can tell you one thing,
[02:33:13.100 --> 02:33:14.340]   but you gotta trust your instrument.
[02:33:14.340 --> 02:33:16.100]   So let's go back to landing at night.
[02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:18.580]   So your eyes-- - How do you do that?
[02:33:18.580 --> 02:33:19.420]   Yeah, land at night,
[02:33:19.420 --> 02:33:20.500]   that's the problem. - Your eyes assume
[02:33:20.500 --> 02:33:22.940]   that the runway, and your brain assumes
[02:33:22.940 --> 02:33:24.180]   that the runway is fixed,
[02:33:24.180 --> 02:33:26.700]   but you know that the runway is moving.
[02:33:26.700 --> 02:33:29.580]   So if I try and do stuff visually,
[02:33:29.580 --> 02:33:31.220]   you die every time.
[02:33:31.220 --> 02:33:33.060]   Not every time, but you die close to every time
[02:33:33.060 --> 02:33:34.500]   trying to land on a boat.
[02:33:34.500 --> 02:33:35.820]   So we actually use instruments
[02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:37.660]   which are counter to your brain,
[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:39.220]   so, and there's actually all kinds of things
[02:33:39.220 --> 02:33:41.060]   that we go through in training.
[02:33:41.060 --> 02:33:43.580]   They have this thing, I think they still use it,
[02:33:43.580 --> 02:33:45.180]   it's called the MSDD,
[02:33:45.180 --> 02:33:47.380]   multispatial disorientation device,
[02:33:47.380 --> 02:33:49.560]   or the spin and puke.
[02:33:50.080 --> 02:33:51.040]   (laughing)
[02:33:51.040 --> 02:33:52.560]   It looks like a giant carousel
[02:33:52.560 --> 02:33:53.680]   and you're in these little modules,
[02:33:53.680 --> 02:33:54.520]   and when you get out,
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:55.800]   you think the thing goes really fast
[02:33:55.800 --> 02:33:58.040]   and you can make yourself think
[02:33:58.040 --> 02:33:59.840]   that I'm descending or climbing,
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:01.800]   but you're actually only going around in circles
[02:34:01.800 --> 02:34:04.080]   at a very slow rate, as fast as a human can talk,
[02:34:04.080 --> 02:34:06.880]   but as they spin you around in a little sub thing,
[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:08.280]   and slow it down and speed it up,
[02:34:08.280 --> 02:34:09.640]   your body does this, and you,
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:11.880]   you know, and then by visuals of showing you,
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:14.480]   like they can spin it sideways to the outside wall,
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:16.320]   but they can show like lines that are,
[02:34:16.320 --> 02:34:17.520]   they can make the line stand still
[02:34:17.520 --> 02:34:18.600]   'cause they're moving the same velocity,
[02:34:18.600 --> 02:34:19.440]   they can move the other way,
[02:34:19.440 --> 02:34:20.600]   and you'll think you're screaming.
[02:34:20.600 --> 02:34:23.440]   You see it in amusement parks all the time.
[02:34:23.440 --> 02:34:26.680]   You do all that because it gives you a sense of the A,
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:28.160]   but you're really not doing,
[02:34:28.160 --> 02:34:29.000]   you're sitting there.
[02:34:29.000 --> 02:34:29.940]   So we get trained on all that stuff,
[02:34:29.940 --> 02:34:31.760]   so if you, if you wanna look at it and go,
[02:34:31.760 --> 02:34:33.440]   well, you're disoriented or this,
[02:34:33.440 --> 02:34:35.160]   I'd be like, I'd argue going, no, I'm not,
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:37.440]   because, you know, when I'm flying the airplane,
[02:34:37.440 --> 02:34:38.760]   even as I'm looking at the tic-tac,
[02:34:38.760 --> 02:34:40.000]   I've got a heads up display
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.280]   that tells me what my airplane's doing.
[02:34:42.280 --> 02:34:44.680]   So I've got, I know what I'm doing,
[02:34:44.680 --> 02:34:45.520]   I can look outside,
[02:34:45.520 --> 02:34:46.580]   I've got a sense of what I'm doing,
[02:34:46.580 --> 02:34:48.740]   but I'm also looking inside to cross check
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:51.120]   of what I'm seeing is in reality what I'm doing.
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:53.480]   - So you actually, your brain gotten good at combining,
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:56.400]   almost adding extra sensory information.
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:57.240]   - You have to.
[02:34:57.240 --> 02:34:58.360]   - You have like supervision.
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:00.280]   So you're combining what you're seeing
[02:35:00.280 --> 02:35:02.020]   and adjusting what the sensors,
[02:35:02.020 --> 02:35:03.240]   what you call an instrument,
[02:35:03.240 --> 02:35:06.000]   so giving you, and that in turn,
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:08.680]   it's a loop that adjusts the perception system
[02:35:08.680 --> 02:35:12.400]   that like, that adjusts your brain's interpretation
[02:35:12.400 --> 02:35:13.240]   of what you're seeing.
[02:35:13.240 --> 02:35:14.440]   - Yeah, you'd be amazed at how good,
[02:35:14.440 --> 02:35:15.740]   so here's another example.
[02:35:15.740 --> 02:35:17.960]   So if we go out over the water,
[02:35:17.960 --> 02:35:19.860]   so there's no land in sight,
[02:35:19.860 --> 02:35:20.820]   and we're gonna fight.
[02:35:20.820 --> 02:35:22.580]   So when we fight, you know, two airplanes,
[02:35:22.580 --> 02:35:23.720]   we're gonna dog fight.
[02:35:23.720 --> 02:35:29.380]   As an instructor, and I was for most of my time,
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:31.420]   you have to come back and you have to recreate it.
[02:35:31.420 --> 02:35:33.400]   So we call it drawing arrows.
[02:35:33.400 --> 02:35:37.240]   So you have to recreate that stuff.
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:39.480]   So you get pretty good at going, you know,
[02:35:39.480 --> 02:35:40.980]   like I would take off and say, all right,
[02:35:40.980 --> 02:35:43.040]   we're starting heading due east.
[02:35:43.040 --> 02:35:45.920]   And I know where the sun is at,
[02:35:45.920 --> 02:35:47.360]   'cause in this short couple minutes
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:35:48.360]   that we're gonna fight, the sun's really
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:49.800]   not gonna move much, it's gonna be in a rel,
[02:35:49.800 --> 02:35:52.240]   so now I know that the sun is at,
[02:35:52.240 --> 02:35:56.600]   you know, let's just say 195 degrees, right?
[02:35:56.600 --> 02:35:58.000]   So I'm starting going east,
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:00.680]   and it's actually be down off my right-hand side.
[02:36:00.680 --> 02:36:01.840]   So now I know as I'm fighting,
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:03.240]   'cause in the water, you don't have any reference,
[02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:04.600]   like, oh, I passed land, I passed land.
[02:36:04.600 --> 02:36:06.000]   No, you don't, and you can't use clouds
[02:36:06.000 --> 02:36:07.300]   'cause clouds do move.
[02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:08.580]   But you gotta come back 'cause you go,
[02:36:08.580 --> 02:36:10.160]   here's where I started, and then you,
[02:36:10.160 --> 02:36:11.520]   as soon as you end, you go, all right,
[02:36:11.520 --> 02:36:14.200]   I ended heading 355.
[02:36:14.200 --> 02:36:17.160]   And then you recreate the turns and the amount of turns,
[02:36:17.160 --> 02:36:19.120]   and use the sun relative, so you can create
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:21.800]   this entire battle that went on with Aero,
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:23.440]   so that you can come back and debrief the guy
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:26.920]   that you were teaching on exactly what happened.
[02:36:26.920 --> 02:36:28.760]   And you get really, really good at that.
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:30.240]   So when you come up and go, well, Dave,
[02:36:30.240 --> 02:36:31.400]   how do you know you were at six o'clock?
[02:36:31.400 --> 02:36:32.820]   And he went around and he came up here.
[02:36:32.820 --> 02:36:36.120]   I go, because I'm trained to do all that,
[02:36:36.120 --> 02:36:38.920]   and I take all the notes, why I'm flying, you can do it.
[02:36:38.920 --> 02:36:41.240]   But usually, you memorize it all,
[02:36:41.240 --> 02:36:42.640]   and you get done, and then you read,
[02:36:42.640 --> 02:36:43.880]   as soon as you're done, you knock it off,
[02:36:43.880 --> 02:36:44.960]   you look at the other airplane, you get set,
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:46.280]   and you start writing all your notes down.
[02:36:46.280 --> 02:36:47.600]   - Yeah.
[02:36:47.600 --> 02:36:49.120]   - And you're writing it really fast on your cart,
[02:36:49.120 --> 02:36:50.120]   and you go out with a stack of cards,
[02:36:50.120 --> 02:36:51.520]   and you stick a new one on your kneeboard cart,
[02:36:51.520 --> 02:36:54.120]   so you're ready to go, and here's the next setup.
[02:36:54.120 --> 02:36:57.580]   - It's kind of, it's in some way similar
[02:36:57.580 --> 02:37:01.640]   to what, like, at the highest level chess players do.
[02:37:01.640 --> 02:37:06.640]   I mean, you're, I mean, they recap the games,
[02:37:06.640 --> 02:37:12.000]   but the richness of the representation that they use
[02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:15.080]   in remembering, like, how the games evolved.
[02:37:15.080 --> 02:37:19.480]   It's not like, it's much richer than the actual moves.
[02:37:19.480 --> 02:37:21.880]   It's like these, a bunch of patterns
[02:37:21.880 --> 02:37:23.080]   that are hard to put into words,
[02:37:23.080 --> 02:37:27.520]   like all the richness of thinking they have
[02:37:27.520 --> 02:37:30.040]   about the way the game evolved.
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:31.680]   It's more, like, instinctual,
[02:37:31.680 --> 02:37:34.120]   from years and years of experience.
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:36.720]   So they try to put it into words, but they really can't.
[02:37:36.720 --> 02:37:37.560]   It's just--
[02:37:37.560 --> 02:37:38.680]   - No, I understand that.
[02:37:38.680 --> 02:37:41.760]   It's because, for us, if we don't come back with anything,
[02:37:41.760 --> 02:37:43.400]   then there's no learning to be had.
[02:37:43.400 --> 02:37:45.480]   'Cause the whole thing is, the debrief,
[02:37:45.480 --> 02:37:46.720]   when we get back and we talk about it,
[02:37:46.720 --> 02:37:48.600]   that's really where the learning is.
[02:37:48.600 --> 02:37:50.960]   And it's the same thing if you wanna go back to chess.
[02:37:50.960 --> 02:37:53.600]   When you start off, you try and learn,
[02:37:53.600 --> 02:37:55.000]   because you're remembering what you're doing.
[02:37:55.000 --> 02:37:56.800]   If you play against someone, I'm always a big place,
[02:37:56.800 --> 02:37:58.880]   play with someone better than you.
[02:37:58.880 --> 02:37:59.720]   That's how you learn.
[02:37:59.720 --> 02:38:00.720]   If you're constantly beating people,
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:01.560]   you're not learning anything.
[02:38:01.560 --> 02:38:02.640]   You're just learning that they're not good,
[02:38:02.640 --> 02:38:03.960]   and you're better.
[02:38:03.960 --> 02:38:06.760]   When you challenge yourself against someone
[02:38:06.760 --> 02:38:09.920]   that is going to, is better than you, you learn.
[02:38:09.920 --> 02:38:13.360]   So I learned how to fight an airplane with,
[02:38:13.360 --> 02:38:16.880]   he's actually one of my best friends, we'll call him Tom.
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:17.720]   I won't give his call sign,
[02:38:17.720 --> 02:38:19.120]   'cause I don't know what he wanna say.
[02:38:19.120 --> 02:38:21.880]   So Tom took me out and taught me how to fight,
[02:38:21.880 --> 02:38:23.840]   because Tom had just left Top Gun.
[02:38:23.840 --> 02:38:26.240]   He was the training officer at Top Gun,
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:27.840]   which, so that's the guy.
[02:38:27.840 --> 02:38:30.800]   The training officer's the main guy at Top Gun.
[02:38:30.800 --> 02:38:32.360]   So Tom was the training officer at Top Gun.
[02:38:32.360 --> 02:38:35.320]   So Tom, when I learned, 'cause I had come out of A6,
[02:38:35.320 --> 02:38:37.800]   and we really don't fight, 'cause it was a bomber.
[02:38:37.800 --> 02:38:39.680]   So I get in F-18s, and I wanna learn how to fight,
[02:38:39.680 --> 02:38:41.040]   'cause it's a whole other side of the mission.
[02:38:41.040 --> 02:38:42.680]   It's the F in F fighter attack.
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:44.380]   The F-A-18 is fighter attack.
[02:38:44.380 --> 02:38:46.240]   So I had to learn how to fight.
[02:38:46.240 --> 02:38:48.880]   So now I got one of the best fighter pilots in the world,
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:51.200]   who's gonna teach me how to do it.
[02:38:51.200 --> 02:38:53.000]   And he did, and I would do something,
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:54.360]   and then he would go,
[02:38:54.360 --> 02:38:56.400]   I'd get to a situation where I had never been,
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:58.080]   and then I would go, "Well, I'm gonna do this."
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:38:59.480]   And then he would destroy me,
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:01.300]   and he would come back and go,
[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:02.720]   "Here's why you don't do that."
[02:39:02.720 --> 02:39:04.160]   And then I would take that knowledge,
[02:39:04.160 --> 02:39:06.800]   and I would put it in my little basket of tricks.
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:08.280]   And over time, 'cause you don't,
[02:39:08.280 --> 02:39:09.880]   no one walks out into that world,
[02:39:09.880 --> 02:39:11.440]   I don't care how gifted of an aviator,
[02:39:11.440 --> 02:39:15.200]   and go, "I am the man," or the woman, "I am it."
[02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:17.360]   No, it's a learning process.
[02:39:17.360 --> 02:39:19.800]   - And so, over all those years, you've gotten good.
[02:39:19.800 --> 02:39:24.800]   So I mean, so what are the chances
[02:39:24.800 --> 02:39:28.920]   that your eyes betrayed you when you saw the Tic Tac?
[02:39:28.920 --> 02:39:31.560]   Low. - Zero.
[02:39:31.560 --> 02:39:34.160]   - Well, I mean, I'm not zero.
[02:39:34.160 --> 02:39:37.800]   So let me be clear. - Okay, 90, I am 99.9%.
[02:39:37.800 --> 02:39:40.160]   So 0.1%, my eyes deceive me.
[02:39:40.160 --> 02:39:42.160]   But remember, if it deceived me,
[02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:43.800]   it had to deceive the other four people.
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:45.520]   So the percentage is even lower.
[02:39:45.520 --> 02:39:46.560]   - Yeah, okay.
[02:39:46.560 --> 02:39:49.280]   Well, I don't find that a particular debunking case
[02:39:49.280 --> 02:39:51.280]   that you said, but I'm glad you put it,
[02:39:51.280 --> 02:39:54.900]   you said those words out loud.
[02:39:54.900 --> 02:39:57.060]   So for me, from my perspective,
[02:39:57.060 --> 02:39:59.760]   coming into this world and looking at it,
[02:39:59.760 --> 02:40:01.960]   I'm a little bit more skeptical.
[02:40:01.960 --> 02:40:04.480]   So your eye account, I think,
[02:40:04.480 --> 02:40:05.960]   is the most fascinating story.
[02:40:05.960 --> 02:40:10.960]   And I think that's inspiring to me
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:13.880]   and should be inspiring to a lot of scientists out there.
[02:40:13.880 --> 02:40:17.080]   On so many levels, just like we said,
[02:40:17.080 --> 02:40:18.400]   on the engineering level,
[02:40:18.400 --> 02:40:20.080]   that maybe there's propulsion systems
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:21.080]   where we can actually build,
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:24.680]   that can do some crazy, amazing stuff.
[02:40:24.680 --> 02:40:28.160]   So it's at the very least intriguing
[02:40:28.160 --> 02:40:30.040]   and at the best, inspiring.
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:30.860]   I just wanna say that.
[02:40:30.860 --> 02:40:35.040]   But on the video side, it's like,
[02:40:35.960 --> 02:40:40.960]   it's the videos for the FLIR video,
[02:40:40.960 --> 02:40:45.560]   the GoFast and the Gimbal video,
[02:40:45.560 --> 02:40:50.360]   they are only interesting to me
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:52.960]   in the context of your story.
[02:40:52.960 --> 02:40:56.680]   Like without that, they're kind of low resolution.
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:01.680]   It's like, it's easier to build a debunking story
[02:41:01.680 --> 02:41:02.680]   to be skeptical.
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:04.140]   So this is where I'm coming from.
[02:41:04.140 --> 02:41:05.840]   Maybe you can convince me otherwise.
[02:41:05.840 --> 02:41:08.380]   But so to bring up Mick West one more time,
[02:41:08.380 --> 02:41:11.600]   he looks at the FLIR video
[02:41:11.600 --> 02:41:14.960]   and he says that one of the most amazing parts
[02:41:14.960 --> 02:41:17.400]   of the FLIR video, for people who haven't seen it,
[02:41:17.400 --> 02:41:19.100]   is at the end of it,
[02:41:19.100 --> 02:41:26.840]   the Tic Tac flies or appears to fly very quickly
[02:41:26.840 --> 02:41:28.840]   to the left--
[02:41:28.840 --> 02:41:29.680]   - Off the screen.
[02:41:29.680 --> 02:41:30.880]   - Off the screen.
[02:41:30.900 --> 02:41:35.900]   And what Mick West says is that,
[02:41:35.900 --> 02:41:37.580]   Mick West, probably others,
[02:41:37.580 --> 02:41:42.580]   that the way to explain that is the tracking system.
[02:41:42.580 --> 02:41:45.180]   Like we said, it's vision-based tracking
[02:41:45.180 --> 02:41:50.180]   simply loses the object, the tracking loses it.
[02:41:50.180 --> 02:41:55.580]   And so it simply allows the object to float off screen
[02:41:55.580 --> 02:41:57.980]   because it's no longer tracking it.
[02:41:57.980 --> 02:42:02.360]   So I find that at least a plausible explanation
[02:42:02.360 --> 02:42:03.240]   of that video.
[02:42:03.240 --> 02:42:07.380]   Looking at your face, you do not.
[02:42:07.380 --> 02:42:12.380]   So can you maybe comment to that debunking aspect?
[02:42:12.380 --> 02:42:16.820]   - So it's funny how people can extrapolate stuff
[02:42:16.820 --> 02:42:18.280]   who've never operated the system.
[02:42:18.280 --> 02:42:19.120]   - No, for sure.
[02:42:19.120 --> 02:42:20.800]   - And that's like me going,
[02:42:20.800 --> 02:42:22.920]   'cause I'm a big Formula One fan,
[02:42:22.920 --> 02:42:25.020]   that's like me going, oh my God, Lewis,
[02:42:25.020 --> 02:42:25.860]   what were you doing?
[02:42:25.860 --> 02:42:26.760]   You could have done this with the car
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:27.600]   and you'd have won the race.
[02:42:27.600 --> 02:42:29.960]   And Lewis Hamilton right now is defending
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:30.960]   world champion two-time,
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:32.720]   well he's four-time, four or five-time world champion.
[02:42:32.720 --> 02:42:35.600]   But that would be pretty stupid of me
[02:42:35.600 --> 02:42:38.100]   to try and tell Lewis Hamilton how to drive a car.
[02:42:38.100 --> 02:42:43.060]   Or a matter of fact, anyone driving a Formula One car.
[02:42:43.060 --> 02:42:45.120]   So I can't tell you how many times I've watched.
[02:42:45.120 --> 02:42:47.040]   You gotta remember when we looked at this thing,
[02:42:47.040 --> 02:42:49.080]   when Chad came back with the video,
[02:42:49.080 --> 02:42:50.040]   we sat there and watched it.
[02:42:50.040 --> 02:42:51.160]   I mean, I can't tell you how many times
[02:42:51.160 --> 02:42:52.800]   I watched it off the original tapes going,
[02:42:52.800 --> 02:42:55.200]   all right, right, all right, let's look at this.
[02:42:56.240 --> 02:42:59.080]   Because you can look and see where the airplane's going,
[02:42:59.080 --> 02:43:00.680]   you can see if it's looking left or right.
[02:43:00.680 --> 02:43:01.920]   And if you actually watch all that stuff,
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:02.760]   it doesn't do that.
[02:43:02.760 --> 02:43:04.720]   It actually, when the vehicle starts to move,
[02:43:04.720 --> 02:43:07.320]   the bars, the tracking gate starts to open up,
[02:43:07.320 --> 02:43:09.080]   and the people at Raytheon could probably add to this
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:10.880]   'cause they built the pod.
[02:43:10.880 --> 02:43:13.200]   The tracking gate'll start to open up,
[02:43:13.200 --> 02:43:16.040]   but the thing, when it leaves so fast off the screen,
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:17.400]   the pod can't move fast enough.
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:19.780]   It has gimbal rates on how fast that thing can move around.
[02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:21.440]   'Cause there's another theory that,
[02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:23.200]   oh, the pod's looking forward.
[02:43:23.200 --> 02:43:24.760]   When the pod passes underneath the airplane,
[02:43:24.760 --> 02:43:26.560]   so if I'm looking at you and you pass underneath me,
[02:43:26.560 --> 02:43:28.760]   as it does this, the ball will actually flip around
[02:43:28.760 --> 02:43:32.480]   to kind of finish off, and it swaps ends
[02:43:32.480 --> 02:43:34.000]   'cause it has, it's a gimbal.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:36.340]   It can't just, it's not free floating.
[02:43:36.340 --> 02:43:39.040]   But there's a theory on one of them,
[02:43:39.040 --> 02:43:40.000]   oh, it's here and it flipped over.
[02:43:40.000 --> 02:43:41.520]   It doesn't do that when it's looking out in front.
[02:43:41.520 --> 02:43:42.940]   It stays like this.
[02:43:42.940 --> 02:43:45.840]   So yet another debunker who doesn't know this.
[02:43:45.840 --> 02:43:48.480]   So, and Mick has had several theories
[02:43:48.480 --> 02:43:50.360]   on some of the other videos,
[02:43:50.360 --> 02:43:52.760]   like one of them, the go fast as a bird,
[02:43:52.760 --> 02:43:54.920]   and Jeremy Corbell actually did a nice job
[02:43:54.920 --> 02:43:58.720]   of saying, no, it's not because he's on black hot.
[02:43:58.720 --> 02:44:01.380]   So the white object is actually colder than the ocean.
[02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:03.200]   That's fine.
[02:44:03.200 --> 02:44:04.480]   Well, birds aren't colder than the ocean.
[02:44:04.480 --> 02:44:05.700]   They'd be dead.
[02:44:05.700 --> 02:44:10.160]   - So the gimbal video, to comment on the amazing aspect
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:13.360]   of that video is the rotation,
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:15.000]   the apparent rotation of the object
[02:44:15.000 --> 02:44:19.920]   that is something that is not possible to do
[02:44:19.920 --> 02:44:22.520]   with systems that we know of.
[02:44:22.520 --> 02:44:27.160]   And Mick West suggests that a flare,
[02:44:27.160 --> 02:44:30.960]   like reflections or whatever can explain.
[02:44:30.960 --> 02:44:32.820]   - No, because what Mick West doesn't see is,
[02:44:32.820 --> 02:44:35.120]   so when they take, 'cause I've talked to the,
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:37.600]   one of them actually I work with.
[02:44:37.600 --> 02:44:40.600]   So I know him, I know I talk to him all the time.
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:44.480]   So, and it's his best friend actually shot the video.
[02:44:44.480 --> 02:44:45.680]   One of his best friends.
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:46.520]   - For the gimbal video.
[02:44:46.520 --> 02:44:47.880]   - The gimbal video, both of them.
[02:44:47.880 --> 02:44:50.480]   The go fast and the gimbal were shot by the same person.
[02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:51.320]   Okay.
[02:44:51.320 --> 02:44:53.960]   So, and they were in each other's wedding.
[02:44:53.960 --> 02:44:55.480]   So that's how well they know each other.
[02:44:55.480 --> 02:44:56.320]   Okay.
[02:44:56.320 --> 02:44:58.520]   So what you don't see is,
[02:44:58.520 --> 02:45:01.460]   so the airplanes they're flying still super Hornets,
[02:45:01.460 --> 02:45:02.880]   but they have the APG-79,
[02:45:02.880 --> 02:45:04.760]   which is the new phased array radar
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:06.840]   that's made by Raytheon, things incredible.
[02:45:06.840 --> 02:45:08.360]   Okay.
[02:45:08.360 --> 02:45:10.160]   It doesn't, usually if it's out there
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:11.380]   and it sees it, it's real.
[02:45:11.380 --> 02:45:13.040]   So at first they thought they were ghost tracks
[02:45:13.040 --> 02:45:13.920]   when they started seeing stuff.
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:14.880]   And then they actually threw one
[02:45:14.880 --> 02:45:16.240]   of the targeting pods out there.
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:17.840]   Well, the targeting pod, if there's heat signature
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:19.840]   and you go, hey, dot heat signature, something's there.
[02:45:19.840 --> 02:45:20.680]   It's real.
[02:45:20.680 --> 02:45:22.720]   You're not picking up some extraneous things.
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:25.320]   So what you see in the gimbal video
[02:45:25.320 --> 02:45:27.360]   of the thing and it rotates and you go, holy shit,
[02:45:27.360 --> 02:45:28.200]   look at that thing.
[02:45:28.200 --> 02:45:29.100]   It's just sitting there and it's in the wind
[02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:30.760]   and it's going against the wind.
[02:45:30.760 --> 02:45:32.600]   Why it's doing this.
[02:45:32.600 --> 02:45:33.640]   Someone goes, oh, it's an airplane.
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:34.680]   Now, if an airplane does this,
[02:45:34.680 --> 02:45:36.320]   it's eventually going to start to change aspect
[02:45:36.320 --> 02:45:37.320]   because it's in a turn.
[02:45:37.320 --> 02:45:38.440]   This thing doesn't change aspect.
[02:45:38.440 --> 02:45:39.280]   It just rotates.
[02:45:39.280 --> 02:45:40.100]   - It's just rotating.
[02:45:40.100 --> 02:45:40.940]   - Right.
[02:45:40.940 --> 02:45:43.300]   The other thing that you see when you talk to them is,
[02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:44.680]   so they're on their radar,
[02:45:44.680 --> 02:45:47.720]   there's an object that they identify
[02:45:47.720 --> 02:45:49.400]   as their number one priority
[02:45:49.400 --> 02:45:50.860]   or their launch and steering.
[02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:52.800]   So when they designate that,
[02:45:52.800 --> 02:45:54.400]   that's where the targeting pod is going to look.
[02:45:54.400 --> 02:45:56.320]   That's what you get on the gimbal video.
[02:45:56.320 --> 02:45:58.320]   There's five other, I think it's five.
[02:45:58.320 --> 02:46:01.080]   They're kind of in a V, you know, like a geese would fly
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:01.960]   that are out in front of it.
[02:46:01.960 --> 02:46:04.120]   And they're actually coming, they're out in front of it.
[02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.560]   And they actually turn on the radar and go the other way
[02:46:06.560 --> 02:46:08.520]   while they're filming the gimbal video,
[02:46:08.520 --> 02:46:14.400]   which it's, I know Ryan has come out and talked about it,
[02:46:14.400 --> 02:46:17.520]   but when you see it, you go, you know,
[02:46:17.520 --> 02:46:19.080]   if you take it in context, cause you go,
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:20.600]   oh, it's just the video.
[02:46:20.600 --> 02:46:22.120]   Well, if you take the video with the radar going,
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:23.480]   no, there's actually other things out there
[02:46:23.480 --> 02:46:25.380]   because there's at least 60 people
[02:46:25.380 --> 02:46:28.840]   that have seen these things on radar off the vacates.
[02:46:28.840 --> 02:46:31.000]   It was, it actually became,
[02:46:31.000 --> 02:46:32.920]   I called a buddy of mine who was running the wing
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:34.600]   at the time, the fighter wing.
[02:46:34.600 --> 02:46:35.920]   I said, dude, what are you guys doing about this?
[02:46:35.920 --> 02:46:37.160]   He goes, well, we got a NOTAM out,
[02:46:37.160 --> 02:46:38.180]   which is a notice to airmen,
[02:46:38.180 --> 02:46:40.480]   which means there's these objects out there
[02:46:40.480 --> 02:46:41.720]   in the warning area.
[02:46:41.720 --> 02:46:43.880]   So anyone can, you can fly a Cessna through the warning area
[02:46:43.880 --> 02:46:45.320]   it's all the warning area tells you is that
[02:46:45.320 --> 02:46:47.360]   there's high military traffic and training out here.
[02:46:47.360 --> 02:46:48.960]   It's probably best not to be here,
[02:46:48.960 --> 02:46:52.320]   but there's nothing that prohibits you from going in there.
[02:46:52.320 --> 02:46:53.760]   So these things have the right,
[02:46:53.760 --> 02:46:56.120]   wherever they're from or whatever they are,
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:46:57.720]   you know, cause people are like, oh, they're balloons.
[02:46:57.720 --> 02:46:59.160]   Well, balloons float.
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:01.960]   Balloons don't sit in 70 knots of wind
[02:47:01.960 --> 02:47:02.960]   and stay in the same location.
[02:47:02.960 --> 02:47:05.200]   They actually, they had an airplane cause there was two.
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:06.040]   There's the gimbal thing.
[02:47:06.040 --> 02:47:08.080]   That's a pretty big object.
[02:47:08.080 --> 02:47:09.360]   There's also, they talk about,
[02:47:09.360 --> 02:47:11.480]   it looks like a cube that's inside of a sphere.
[02:47:11.480 --> 02:47:12.520]   - A translucent sphere.
[02:47:12.520 --> 02:47:14.600]   What the hell is that?
[02:47:14.600 --> 02:47:15.960]   - And they almost hit one.
[02:47:15.960 --> 02:47:17.360]   - It's almost hit them.
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:20.360]   So that's another, that's one of the biggest,
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.120]   another biggest account is like almost hit a plane,
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:26.120]   something that appeared to be a cube
[02:47:26.120 --> 02:47:27.400]   in a translucent sphere.
[02:47:27.400 --> 02:47:28.640]   What do you make of that?
[02:47:28.640 --> 02:47:31.560]   - Again, you know.
[02:47:31.560 --> 02:47:35.960]   - What, I mean, that's the most dangerous thing.
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:36.800]   - You're right.
[02:47:36.800 --> 02:47:38.480]   The biggest frustration is when you do that and you go,
[02:47:38.480 --> 02:47:40.880]   okay, so this thing passed between two airplanes
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:42.880]   and it was, I think it was in the like a hundred feet
[02:47:42.880 --> 02:47:45.560]   or something like that of the airplane that almost hit it.
[02:47:45.560 --> 02:47:46.680]   So what they do is they come back and go,
[02:47:46.680 --> 02:47:48.320]   hey, I had a near midair.
[02:47:48.320 --> 02:47:49.520]   What'd you have a near midair with?
[02:47:49.520 --> 02:47:52.080]   Well, this floating beach ball with this cube inside of it.
[02:47:52.080 --> 02:47:53.640]   And you go, huh?
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:55.440]   And you know, so they send out a NOTAM again
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:57.920]   and they do what's called a hazard report that says,
[02:47:57.920 --> 02:47:59.120]   hey, there's these objects out there.
[02:47:59.120 --> 02:48:00.240]   We almost hit one.
[02:48:00.240 --> 02:48:01.200]   You're right, and that gets sent off
[02:48:01.200 --> 02:48:02.560]   to the Naval Safety Center.
[02:48:02.560 --> 02:48:06.520]   What was done, I mean, what are you gonna do?
[02:48:06.520 --> 02:48:08.720]   Can you catch one, go out with a giant net
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:10.360]   and try and bag one?
[02:48:10.360 --> 02:48:11.440]   You don't know because they've seen them.
[02:48:11.440 --> 02:48:13.240]   They've picked them up like hovering on radar.
[02:48:13.240 --> 02:48:14.520]   And then all of a sudden they're traveling
[02:48:14.520 --> 02:48:15.600]   at really high rates of speed.
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:17.200]   So, you know-
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:18.040]   What are you gonna do?
[02:48:18.040 --> 02:48:18.880]   Yeah, what are you gonna do?
[02:48:18.880 --> 02:48:20.240]   Well, let me ask this
[02:48:20.240 --> 02:48:22.600]   'cause this is what people kind of think about.
[02:48:22.600 --> 02:48:29.400]   After you witnessed Tic Tac and after these incidents,
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:32.740]   as far as we know, with the gimbal and the go fast,
[02:48:32.740 --> 02:48:37.120]   it seems like people in the military
[02:48:37.120 --> 02:48:42.120]   did not react like, did not freak out.
[02:48:42.880 --> 02:48:46.480]   It almost like was like a mundane event.
[02:48:46.480 --> 02:48:47.600]   How do you explain that?
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:51.280]   Why didn't the people on the ship, not the higher-ups,
[02:48:51.280 --> 02:48:53.280]   why wasn't there a big freak out?
[02:48:53.280 --> 02:48:55.400]   Or as some people suggest,
[02:48:55.400 --> 02:48:57.960]   the higher-ups knew about it all along
[02:48:57.960 --> 02:49:00.040]   and just were not letting everyone know
[02:49:00.040 --> 02:49:03.040]   that there's some kind of secret military tests almost.
[02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:07.720]   So, let's talk about it.
[02:49:07.720 --> 02:49:10.320]   So, let's say you've got this cool new toy,
[02:49:10.320 --> 02:49:12.240]   let's call it a cool new toy.
[02:49:12.240 --> 02:49:14.080]   You typically don't take your cool new toy out
[02:49:14.080 --> 02:49:16.320]   into an area where the cool new toy could get damaged
[02:49:16.320 --> 02:49:18.560]   or what if the airplane would have actually
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:20.560]   hit your cool new toy and you got two people
[02:49:20.560 --> 02:49:23.960]   that are ejecting or dead and you got a $80 million airplane
[02:49:23.960 --> 02:49:25.960]   that's now in the bottom of the Atlantic.
[02:49:25.960 --> 02:49:30.720]   Tests are normally done in controlled environments.
[02:49:30.720 --> 02:49:32.640]   It's like any test, a lab test or whatever.
[02:49:32.640 --> 02:49:35.320]   When you take things out into the real world,
[02:49:35.320 --> 02:49:37.000]   you're still going to test it in an area
[02:49:37.000 --> 02:49:38.200]   where if something goes wrong.
[02:49:38.200 --> 02:49:40.920]   So, when they started, and we'll go back to Elon,
[02:49:40.920 --> 02:49:42.800]   so my friend that worked there,
[02:49:42.800 --> 02:49:45.680]   they had a rocket go off, they were out in Kwajalein
[02:49:45.680 --> 02:49:47.200]   and when the rocket went up,
[02:49:47.200 --> 02:49:49.320]   a fuel line ruptured in the rocket
[02:49:49.320 --> 02:49:51.520]   and it ran out of fuel before it got all the way up
[02:49:51.520 --> 02:49:53.280]   and it came falling back down.
[02:49:53.280 --> 02:49:56.240]   Well, when you're out on an atoll in the Pacific,
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:57.640]   if it's going up above you,
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:59.240]   the worst case is it's gonna land on you
[02:49:59.240 --> 02:50:01.560]   so you're worried about where else is it going to land
[02:50:01.560 --> 02:50:03.440]   and it actually crashed next to the atoll
[02:50:03.440 --> 02:50:08.240]   and Elon wasn't happy and threw this guy under the bus.
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:11.080]   So, that's a test environment
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:12.680]   because you don't know what's going to happen.
[02:50:12.680 --> 02:50:15.160]   So, 'cause someone said, well, when we chased the Tic Tac,
[02:50:15.160 --> 02:50:16.800]   well, it could have been some secret government thing.
[02:50:16.800 --> 02:50:17.800]   Well, secret government things
[02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:20.600]   typically just don't come out and test to where--
[02:50:20.600 --> 02:50:24.240]   - On unknowing pilots, you can't control a lot of things.
[02:50:24.240 --> 02:50:25.080]   - You're exactly right.
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:29.440]   So, you go, it's not the doctor evil scientist
[02:50:29.440 --> 02:50:31.680]   that's gonna throw shit out there to get,
[02:50:31.680 --> 02:50:34.600]   there's control and there's reasons that we do it
[02:50:34.600 --> 02:50:37.720]   because a lot of stuff, especially when you get to,
[02:50:37.720 --> 02:50:40.920]   you build something in theory, you model it,
[02:50:40.920 --> 02:50:43.040]   you go, hey, it looks like it's gonna work,
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:46.440]   you get funding, you build it, you test it some more,
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:47.720]   you bench test it.
[02:50:47.720 --> 02:50:50.640]   Like an airplane with digital flight controls,
[02:50:50.640 --> 02:50:52.400]   before it even leaves the ground,
[02:50:52.400 --> 02:50:54.440]   they've got things over the pitot-static system
[02:50:54.440 --> 02:50:56.600]   that are changing what the airplane thinks
[02:50:56.600 --> 02:50:58.000]   is the airspeed, talking to it
[02:50:58.000 --> 02:51:00.400]   and it's probably up on jacks, so the gear up.
[02:51:00.400 --> 02:51:03.040]   So, it thinks it's flying, it doesn't know,
[02:51:03.040 --> 02:51:04.640]   it's sitting on jack stands
[02:51:04.640 --> 02:51:05.960]   and they're just changing the pressure
[02:51:05.960 --> 02:51:07.000]   on the pitot-static system
[02:51:07.000 --> 02:51:09.040]   so they can actually make the flight controls move
[02:51:09.040 --> 02:51:10.880]   and they can get all the data back to go,
[02:51:10.880 --> 02:51:12.360]   hey, it looks like it's gonna work.
[02:51:12.360 --> 02:51:14.840]   And then there's a bunch of stuff that they do.
[02:51:14.840 --> 02:51:15.920]   - That's a control environment
[02:51:15.920 --> 02:51:16.920]   which you can do the testing in.
[02:51:16.920 --> 02:51:18.680]   - Yeah, throwing shit out in the middle
[02:51:18.680 --> 02:51:21.000]   of where people are doing exercises
[02:51:21.000 --> 02:51:25.320]   is the most preposterous thing that I've heard.
[02:51:25.320 --> 02:51:26.800]   Is it possible?
[02:51:26.800 --> 02:51:27.640]   Yes.
[02:51:27.640 --> 02:51:30.960]   Is it more really, is it--
[02:51:30.960 --> 02:51:31.800]   - It's more likely--
[02:51:31.800 --> 02:51:34.280]   - It's more likely they're not doing that.
[02:51:34.280 --> 02:51:37.160]   And the other side of that question is,
[02:51:37.160 --> 02:51:39.880]   why do you think people on the Nimitz
[02:51:39.880 --> 02:51:41.800]   and in the US government in general
[02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:45.720]   not freak out more at the incredible thing that you've seen?
[02:51:45.720 --> 02:51:46.960]   Freak out in a positive way,
[02:51:46.960 --> 02:51:48.720]   freak out in a negative way,
[02:51:48.720 --> 02:51:50.760]   like what are the Russians up to again?
[02:51:50.760 --> 02:51:53.640]   Or more like, what is this?
[02:51:53.640 --> 02:51:56.440]   Like, so more turmoil up the ranks.
[02:51:56.440 --> 02:51:59.080]   - If you were to put a Chinese flag on the side of it
[02:51:59.080 --> 02:52:00.400]   or a Russian flag on the side of it,
[02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:01.760]   and I said, yeah, I had a big Russian flag
[02:52:01.760 --> 02:52:03.040]   on the side of it, dude,
[02:52:03.040 --> 02:52:04.880]   then it would have got a lot of attention.
[02:52:04.880 --> 02:52:06.520]   It would have went high order.
[02:52:06.520 --> 02:52:08.720]   You don't have to say Russia or China,
[02:52:08.720 --> 02:52:11.560]   just say, if there was another country's emblem
[02:52:11.560 --> 02:52:13.920]   on the side of this thing that we saw and said,
[02:52:13.920 --> 02:52:17.640]   oh, it belonged to them, then it's a big deal.
[02:52:17.640 --> 02:52:18.640]   So here's what's going on.
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:20.440]   So we're literally in the middle of workups
[02:52:20.440 --> 02:52:21.320]   and it was a joint workup.
[02:52:21.320 --> 02:52:22.760]   Normally we go out for a month,
[02:52:22.760 --> 02:52:24.240]   go come back, do stuff, go out for a month.
[02:52:24.240 --> 02:52:26.240]   This was a two month at sea period
[02:52:26.240 --> 02:52:27.840]   where we actually had to beg for them to let us
[02:52:27.840 --> 02:52:29.120]   when the ship pulled in at Thanksgiving
[02:52:29.120 --> 02:52:31.080]   so we could run home up to the Central Valley,
[02:52:31.080 --> 02:52:32.120]   have Thanksgiving with our family
[02:52:32.120 --> 02:52:33.280]   and then run back down and do this.
[02:52:33.280 --> 02:52:34.240]   Okay?
[02:52:34.240 --> 02:52:38.000]   So, you know, and I had just taken over,
[02:52:38.000 --> 02:52:40.680]   I had had the squadron for a month, right?
[02:52:40.680 --> 02:52:44.200]   So I'm a brand new CO, I'm the most junior guy
[02:52:44.200 --> 02:52:47.480]   on the, as far as a commanding officer goes,
[02:52:47.480 --> 02:52:48.720]   for time in the Navy.
[02:52:48.720 --> 02:52:51.160]   And actually at the time, I think it was the most junior CO
[02:52:51.160 --> 02:52:53.680]   for O5 command in the Navy, right?
[02:52:53.680 --> 02:52:55.920]   So you go, okay, so I'm out here,
[02:52:55.920 --> 02:52:59.040]   I got my squadron, I'm running it, I see this thing,
[02:52:59.040 --> 02:53:00.640]   you know, we catch shit for it.
[02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:02.160]   I have a squadron to run.
[02:53:02.160 --> 02:53:04.600]   I have the, the Tic Tac was over here
[02:53:04.600 --> 02:53:07.120]   and although an extraordinary event,
[02:53:07.120 --> 02:53:10.320]   I have 17 air crew and 300 sailors
[02:53:10.320 --> 02:53:12.600]   that I'm responsible for, right?
[02:53:12.600 --> 02:53:15.000]   Their wellbeing, making sure they're fed,
[02:53:15.000 --> 02:53:17.040]   making sure they're happy, they're birthing,
[02:53:17.040 --> 02:53:18.640]   you know, and I'm working with my master chief
[02:53:18.640 --> 02:53:21.760]   and I'm working with my XO, SNAP,
[02:53:21.760 --> 02:53:23.800]   and we're going through all this stuff.
[02:53:23.800 --> 02:53:27.600]   I don't have a lot of time to worry about the Tic Tac.
[02:53:27.600 --> 02:53:28.440]   - Yeah.
[02:53:28.440 --> 02:53:29.520]   - If people need to talk to me,
[02:53:29.520 --> 02:53:32.520]   so you gotta remember, you got the captain of the ship,
[02:53:32.520 --> 02:53:34.840]   you got the air wing commander and you got the admiral.
[02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:36.000]   Those are the top three.
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.360]   And you got the CEO of the Princeton,
[02:53:38.360 --> 02:53:40.160]   who is a major command guy.
[02:53:40.160 --> 02:53:41.680]   And that's really your big major command.
[02:53:41.680 --> 02:53:43.560]   And then everything else is you got all the squadrons,
[02:53:43.560 --> 02:53:45.880]   which are O5 command, and you got the small boys
[02:53:45.880 --> 02:53:47.160]   that are out there, which is O5 command.
[02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:50.400]   So in the hierarchy, as far as rank and responsibility
[02:53:50.400 --> 02:53:54.040]   of what's going on, I'm pretty much in the top 20
[02:53:54.040 --> 02:53:55.240]   with all my peers.
[02:53:55.240 --> 02:53:57.800]   And then I've got obviously the captain
[02:53:57.800 --> 02:53:59.000]   and the admiral, right?
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:01.720]   And then he's got some post command guys on his staff
[02:54:01.720 --> 02:54:02.560]   that we were friends with.
[02:54:02.560 --> 02:54:04.920]   - So you're responsible for a lot of things.
[02:54:04.920 --> 02:54:05.840]   - Yes.
[02:54:05.840 --> 02:54:06.680]   Oh yeah.
[02:54:06.680 --> 02:54:07.520]   - Busy schedule.
[02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:08.340]   - Yeah.
[02:54:08.340 --> 02:54:09.180]   - There's missions.
[02:54:09.180 --> 02:54:11.440]   You have to do a lot, get the job done.
[02:54:11.440 --> 02:54:13.760]   And there's no time for silly things.
[02:54:13.760 --> 02:54:14.640]   - That's exactly right.
[02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:17.600]   So, and we're the integration, you know,
[02:54:17.600 --> 02:54:19.360]   when a battle group deploys,
[02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:20.960]   especially when you go to the Middle East
[02:54:20.960 --> 02:54:24.040]   for what we were doing, the air power is the key.
[02:54:24.040 --> 02:54:25.980]   It's we take our airport with us,
[02:54:25.980 --> 02:54:27.280]   we can park it anywhere we want
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:29.560]   and we can do what we need to do.
[02:54:29.560 --> 02:54:30.680]   So we're kind of key players.
[02:54:30.680 --> 02:54:32.120]   So when you get the theory that,
[02:54:32.120 --> 02:54:33.740]   oh, all these men in suits showed up.
[02:54:33.740 --> 02:54:36.120]   So the captain of the ship never said anything to me.
[02:54:36.120 --> 02:54:37.320]   The admiral never saying to me,
[02:54:37.320 --> 02:54:39.080]   the people on his staff that I was friends with
[02:54:39.080 --> 02:54:41.160]   never saying to me, the other COs that I talked to
[02:54:41.160 --> 02:54:43.040]   on a daily basis never said anything to me.
[02:54:43.040 --> 02:54:44.500]   And no one ever came and talked to me
[02:54:44.500 --> 02:54:45.540]   and I'm the guy that chased it.
[02:54:45.540 --> 02:54:47.880]   So in all the theories and all the debunkers
[02:54:47.880 --> 02:54:49.480]   and all the stories, because I don't know if people think
[02:54:49.480 --> 02:54:50.360]   they're gonna get rich on this,
[02:54:50.360 --> 02:54:52.120]   'cause I made a big donut on this.
[02:54:52.120 --> 02:54:53.320]   I can tell you what I got paid for.
[02:54:53.320 --> 02:54:55.480]   I got paid to go out and spend 21 hours of my day
[02:54:55.480 --> 02:54:58.040]   going to LA and do a five minute talk for someone.
[02:54:58.040 --> 02:54:59.440]   And I'm like, and it wasn't for the talk
[02:54:59.440 --> 02:55:01.600]   'cause I'll talk for free 'cause you're not paying me.
[02:55:01.600 --> 02:55:05.440]   I said, and then I got paid to go to the McMinnville Fest
[02:55:05.440 --> 02:55:07.920]   because my wife and I got to go
[02:55:07.920 --> 02:55:09.040]   'cause it was just looked like fun
[02:55:09.040 --> 02:55:10.720]   'cause the whole town gets involved.
[02:55:10.720 --> 02:55:12.960]   And it's the only time I've ever spoken publicly
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:14.560]   in front of a large audience about this
[02:55:14.560 --> 02:55:16.080]   because it was just, it was fun.
[02:55:16.080 --> 02:55:18.000]   And I got asked and Jeremy and George Knappen
[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:18.840]   went the year before.
[02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:21.000]   So I went with Bob Lazar.
[02:55:21.000 --> 02:55:22.720]   So I got to hang out with Bob and his wife
[02:55:22.720 --> 02:55:23.800]   and his wife and my wife.
[02:55:23.800 --> 02:55:26.760]   And we all hung out kind of talking,
[02:55:26.760 --> 02:55:27.840]   not about UFO stuff,
[02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:29.640]   but just getting to know each other as people
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:32.600]   because Bob's like me.
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:34.720]   The stuff that he talks about is not the center of his life.
[02:55:34.720 --> 02:55:37.080]   If anything, it ruined his life.
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:40.020]   He's just a really, really smart guy
[02:55:40.020 --> 02:55:43.600]   that's just like the rest of us trying to get through life.
[02:55:43.600 --> 02:55:46.200]   - Nevertheless, I mean, that was one of the sad things
[02:55:46.200 --> 02:55:51.200]   reading Lou Elizondo's resignation note from his,
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:56.460]   he was a program director at the AATIP program.
[02:55:56.460 --> 02:56:01.520]   One of the sad things is that he's mentioned
[02:56:01.520 --> 02:56:03.840]   that people in government
[02:56:03.840 --> 02:56:07.000]   just don't take this seriously as a threat,
[02:56:07.000 --> 02:56:09.680]   like UFOs as a threat.
[02:56:09.680 --> 02:56:12.600]   Like you said, if it doesn't have a Russian label on it.
[02:56:12.600 --> 02:56:14.680]   It's a sad thing to think about
[02:56:14.680 --> 02:56:18.160]   that we have such a busy schedule
[02:56:18.160 --> 02:56:19.940]   that the anomaly,
[02:56:21.480 --> 02:56:25.320]   it doesn't, is a distraction that we don't wanna deal with.
[02:56:25.320 --> 02:56:29.080]   And it kind of just fades into history.
[02:56:29.080 --> 02:56:32.040]   Like literally, it's kind of sad to think
[02:56:32.040 --> 02:56:33.780]   that if aliens showed up,
[02:56:33.780 --> 02:56:39.600]   like, and it just didn't,
[02:56:39.600 --> 02:56:42.600]   'cause they're not, like when aliens show up,
[02:56:42.600 --> 02:56:46.560]   they're not going to be a thing that's on the schedule.
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:49.720]   And if they don't start killing people,
[02:56:49.720 --> 02:56:54.320]   they just kind of show up in some very nonchalant,
[02:56:54.320 --> 02:56:57.400]   peaceful way, briefly,
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:58.800]   people would be like,
[02:56:58.800 --> 02:57:01.340]   that's, I don't have time for this.
[02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:03.480]   That's so sad.
[02:57:03.480 --> 02:57:04.720]   That's so sad. - It's like anywhere
[02:57:04.720 --> 02:57:05.560]   in the world.
[02:57:05.560 --> 02:57:09.080]   So, you know, go back, let's go back way back,
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:10.240]   way back in the time machine.
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:12.720]   You know, there were people kind of scattered
[02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:13.720]   around the globe.
[02:57:13.720 --> 02:57:15.900]   You know, and Europe's a perfect example.
[02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:18.680]   Why does France speak French?
[02:57:18.680 --> 02:57:21.000]   And then right next to them, Spanish,
[02:57:21.000 --> 02:57:22.880]   you know, Spain speaks Spanish.
[02:57:22.880 --> 02:57:25.200]   And then you'd kind of jump over and Germans are German
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:26.760]   and the Polish people,
[02:57:26.760 --> 02:57:28.120]   everyone speaks a different language
[02:57:28.120 --> 02:57:29.600]   because if you look at the way the terrain
[02:57:29.600 --> 02:57:32.920]   kind of subdivide the original people that were there,
[02:57:32.920 --> 02:57:34.840]   you know, thousands of years ago,
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:37.360]   they speak differently, right?
[02:57:37.360 --> 02:57:39.520]   You'd be like the US, but see, the US is different.
[02:57:39.520 --> 02:57:40.920]   We all speak English 'cause what happened?
[02:57:40.920 --> 02:57:43.400]   We came over and we started on the East Coast
[02:57:43.400 --> 02:57:44.760]   and we migrated West.
[02:57:44.760 --> 02:57:46.800]   We won't get into the, you know, what happened.
[02:57:46.800 --> 02:57:48.520]   And, you know, 'cause the Native Americans
[02:57:48.520 --> 02:57:50.120]   all spoke different languages.
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:50.960]   - Yeah.
[02:57:50.960 --> 02:57:52.120]   - You know, it's that same type of thing.
[02:57:52.120 --> 02:57:55.040]   So, but anytime we have a tendency to show up,
[02:57:55.040 --> 02:57:57.480]   you're actually, you think about it, you're an alien.
[02:57:57.480 --> 02:58:00.160]   If I go to a different area, if I just, you know,
[02:58:00.160 --> 02:58:02.200]   go back 500 years where, you know,
[02:58:02.200 --> 02:58:03.640]   or a thousand years where travel,
[02:58:03.640 --> 02:58:05.600]   we weren't traveling across oceans at the time.
[02:58:05.600 --> 02:58:06.800]   We were, well, we don't think we were,
[02:58:06.800 --> 02:58:08.240]   but the Vikings probably were.
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:10.800]   'Cause we had limited, you know,
[02:58:10.800 --> 02:58:12.580]   we had to have supplies and the boats weren't as big.
[02:58:12.580 --> 02:58:13.520]   We had to build them by hand.
[02:58:13.520 --> 02:58:14.980]   We didn't have power tools and all that stuff.
[02:58:14.980 --> 02:58:17.240]   So, you know, if you show up someplace,
[02:58:17.240 --> 02:58:19.160]   like when the conquistadors from Spain
[02:58:19.160 --> 02:58:21.840]   came over into South America and you've got, you know,
[02:58:21.840 --> 02:58:25.240]   the natives, you're actually an alien, you know?
[02:58:25.240 --> 02:58:27.160]   And then you look at what typically happens
[02:58:27.160 --> 02:58:30.760]   when aliens show up in a human alien world, you know?
[02:58:30.760 --> 02:58:33.760]   And when I say alien, I mean, you are not from that area.
[02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:38.560]   The other, we take what we want.
[02:58:38.560 --> 02:58:39.440]   And that's what happened.
[02:58:39.440 --> 02:58:42.320]   I mean, we literally defuncted civilizations
[02:58:42.320 --> 02:58:45.300]   because that's how we are, you know?
[02:58:45.300 --> 02:58:47.940]   Humans are, we're an interesting group.
[02:58:47.940 --> 02:58:49.740]   So you go, now what,
[02:58:49.740 --> 02:58:52.020]   what if something is from someplace else?
[02:58:52.020 --> 02:58:54.580]   Just, let's just go off the grid and go,
[02:58:54.580 --> 02:58:57.460]   let's say there are little green men.
[02:58:57.460 --> 02:58:58.300]   What are their intentions?
[02:58:58.300 --> 02:59:00.380]   Guy, Lou asked me this when we were talking to Lou Elizondo.
[02:59:00.380 --> 02:59:01.700]   And he said, what do you think they were here for?
[02:59:01.700 --> 02:59:03.100]   I said, I don't know.
[02:59:03.100 --> 02:59:03.940]   He goes, what?
[02:59:03.940 --> 02:59:05.340]   I go, oh, they were observing.
[02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:06.460]   They'd come down, they'd hang out.
[02:59:06.460 --> 02:59:07.280]   And he goes, well,
[02:59:07.280 --> 02:59:08.620]   what if they were prepping the battlefield?
[02:59:08.620 --> 02:59:11.740]   What if they were observing to figure out what we do?
[02:59:11.740 --> 02:59:12.760]   And you go, that's interesting.
[02:59:12.760 --> 02:59:14.220]   The other theory is,
[02:59:14.220 --> 02:59:16.320]   maybe there's a more advanced civilization out here
[02:59:16.320 --> 02:59:17.880]   and they just check in on us.
[02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:20.160]   Because the threat to an advanced civilization
[02:59:20.160 --> 02:59:23.140]   is when a civilization that's inferior to them
[02:59:23.140 --> 02:59:25.240]   actually develops enough and fast enough
[02:59:25.240 --> 02:59:26.860]   to become equal or above.
[02:59:26.860 --> 02:59:29.080]   Because now they become the threatened type.
[02:59:29.080 --> 02:59:32.120]   So you watch us grow until we start getting too much.
[02:59:32.120 --> 02:59:33.040]   You know, it's kind of like you go,
[02:59:33.040 --> 02:59:34.280]   well, 'cause they always have a tendency
[02:59:34.280 --> 02:59:35.880]   to hang out around nuclear, right?
[02:59:35.880 --> 02:59:37.360]   And you go, well, you know,
[02:59:37.360 --> 02:59:38.880]   if this is an advanced civilization,
[02:59:38.880 --> 02:59:40.760]   I'm gonna go science fiction, kind of comical.
[02:59:40.760 --> 02:59:41.920]   They come down and watch us and go,
[02:59:41.920 --> 02:59:45.380]   look at the crazy upright monkeys now
[02:59:45.380 --> 02:59:46.640]   have developed the atom bomb.
[02:59:46.640 --> 02:59:48.160]   Let's hope they don't destroy themselves.
[02:59:48.160 --> 02:59:49.800]   - Yeah, if I was an alien civilization,
[02:59:49.800 --> 02:59:51.960]   I would start paying attention with the atom bomb.
[02:59:51.960 --> 02:59:56.000]   That's why the, I mean, there's certainly an uptick of,
[02:59:56.000 --> 03:00:00.560]   what is it, UFO sightings since--
[03:00:00.560 --> 03:00:01.800]   - Since the nuclear era.
[03:00:01.800 --> 03:00:03.040]   - Since the nuclear era.
[03:00:03.040 --> 03:00:04.080]   - Yeah.
[03:00:04.080 --> 03:00:05.280]   - That's-- - You go--
[03:00:05.280 --> 03:00:07.800]   - Hmm. (laughs)
[03:00:07.800 --> 03:00:09.860]   Let me ask a little bit out there a question.
[03:00:09.860 --> 03:00:14.340]   Maybe it's a speculation, but maybe touching on Roswell.
[03:00:14.340 --> 03:00:19.640]   Do you think it's possible that there is
[03:00:19.640 --> 03:00:25.640]   out of this world aircraft or beings
[03:00:25.640 --> 03:00:30.320]   that are in the possession of one of the governments
[03:00:30.320 --> 03:00:32.680]   on this earth, like the US government?
[03:00:32.680 --> 03:00:34.440]   Is it possible?
[03:00:34.440 --> 03:00:37.720]   So the one perspective of that, if it's possible,
[03:00:38.700 --> 03:00:40.880]   is it possible to keep a secret like that?
[03:00:40.880 --> 03:00:42.120]   - I would say this.
[03:00:42.120 --> 03:00:44.060]   I think it's highly possible.
[03:00:44.060 --> 03:00:46.800]   Because if you go, if you just look at all the sightings,
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:49.240]   and let's go, just look at Project Blue Book.
[03:00:49.240 --> 03:00:52.000]   It was what, I forget how many thousands of sightings.
[03:00:52.000 --> 03:00:53.920]   There's a percentage, it's like 10 or 15%
[03:00:53.920 --> 03:00:55.680]   and they still can't explain.
[03:00:55.680 --> 03:00:57.000]   Like our Tic Tac is one of them.
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:00:58.680]   They basically, the government has come out and said,
[03:00:58.680 --> 03:00:59.880]   we don't know what that was.
[03:00:59.880 --> 03:01:04.000]   Okay, so if you go, okay, of that 15% that we don't know
[03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:06.560]   and of these thousands, there's still that 15%
[03:01:06.560 --> 03:01:07.680]   makes up a pretty big number.
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:09.460]   What are the chances that not one of them
[03:01:09.460 --> 03:01:13.680]   crashed somewhere on the globe and was recovered?
[03:01:13.680 --> 03:01:16.060]   And I don't care if it's an intact system
[03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:20.120]   or you got pieces of it of a metal that we can't explain
[03:01:20.120 --> 03:01:25.120]   or some biological matter, to say the least.
[03:01:25.120 --> 03:01:28.260]   It could be intact or it couldn't,
[03:01:28.260 --> 03:01:31.640]   but the odds of that now are starting to go down
[03:01:31.640 --> 03:01:33.140]   that that could never happen.
[03:01:33.140 --> 03:01:34.540]   And I'm not talking just the United States,
[03:01:34.540 --> 03:01:36.300]   I'm talking the world. - Globally.
[03:01:36.300 --> 03:01:38.340]   - So is there a chance that a foreign government
[03:01:38.340 --> 03:01:40.280]   actually possesses or our government
[03:01:40.280 --> 03:01:42.280]   or someone in the world, on the globe,
[03:01:42.280 --> 03:01:46.160]   of the seven plus billion people has something
[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:48.300]   that is not from this world, and I'm not talking a meteor,
[03:01:48.300 --> 03:01:51.320]   but something that was manufactured in some way
[03:01:51.320 --> 03:01:54.480]   that allowed transport or observation.
[03:01:54.480 --> 03:01:56.200]   Could be a drone, could be a foreign drone,
[03:01:56.200 --> 03:01:58.360]   you know, like Voyager flies around and does all that stuff.
[03:01:58.360 --> 03:02:00.600]   And we got stuff that just went past Pluto
[03:02:00.600 --> 03:02:02.320]   that's out in the Kuiper belt.
[03:02:02.320 --> 03:02:03.960]   You know, there's stuff out there floating around.
[03:02:03.960 --> 03:02:05.520]   And what about ours that's gonna crash
[03:02:05.520 --> 03:02:07.320]   into Jupiter eventually or whatever,
[03:02:07.320 --> 03:02:09.480]   'cause we've had stuff crash into planets.
[03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:12.760]   So if that's the case, you would think something
[03:02:12.760 --> 03:02:15.000]   is out there that we have something that we can't explain.
[03:02:15.000 --> 03:02:18.880]   And according to Lew, there is stuff that we can't explain.
[03:02:18.880 --> 03:02:21.360]   You know, and I would assume that Lew, who ran AATIP,
[03:02:21.360 --> 03:02:25.040]   has seen stuff that he can't openly talk about,
[03:02:25.040 --> 03:02:27.600]   because, you know, 'cause I had a clearance.
[03:02:27.600 --> 03:02:29.920]   When you have a clearance, you sign your name,
[03:02:29.920 --> 03:02:30.960]   you're bound to that.
[03:02:30.960 --> 03:02:34.520]   And to me, that's an important oath that you hold to.
[03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:37.120]   You know, and this is kind of where, you know,
[03:02:37.120 --> 03:02:39.160]   people have issues with Bob.
[03:02:39.160 --> 03:02:41.080]   So if, you know, and I leave it to you
[03:02:41.080 --> 03:02:42.520]   to determine if you believe Bob or not.
[03:02:42.520 --> 03:02:44.280]   I'll tell you, Bob is a straightforward,
[03:02:44.280 --> 03:02:47.400]   very sane, normal, super smart guy.
[03:02:47.400 --> 03:02:49.280]   - Bob Lazar, yeah. - Yes.
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:50.640]   There is the other side that says,
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:52.440]   well, should he have come out and talked?
[03:02:52.440 --> 03:02:54.600]   You know, to those who owe clearance
[03:02:54.600 --> 03:02:56.740]   who, you know, are true to the government,
[03:02:56.740 --> 03:02:58.840]   you would say, he should have never spoke.
[03:02:58.840 --> 03:03:02.560]   He was under an oath to not say anything, but he did.
[03:03:02.560 --> 03:03:05.000]   If you ask Bob, why did you say something?
[03:03:05.000 --> 03:03:08.080]   His answer was, I understand there's an oath,
[03:03:08.080 --> 03:03:12.040]   but I felt that the technology could benefit all of mankind
[03:03:12.040 --> 03:03:13.760]   and it shouldn't be locked away.
[03:03:13.760 --> 03:03:15.280]   And I'll leave it, if you believe Bob,
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:17.280]   that's kind of what Bob says.
[03:03:17.280 --> 03:03:21.160]   - And that's such a interesting key point.
[03:03:21.160 --> 03:03:24.240]   If there is aircraft, a technology,
[03:03:24.240 --> 03:03:27.840]   that's in the possession of the, say, the US government,
[03:03:27.840 --> 03:03:30.640]   should they make that publicly known?
[03:03:30.640 --> 03:03:32.160]   This is this note in question.
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:34.000]   This is the question of, like,
[03:03:34.000 --> 03:03:36.920]   do we release stuff that can potentially change
[03:03:36.920 --> 03:03:39.280]   the nature of human civilization?
[03:03:39.280 --> 03:03:44.280]   Like, the way we think about our place in the world.
[03:03:44.280 --> 03:03:49.800]   Also, if that technology is potentially useful
[03:03:49.800 --> 03:03:52.240]   for military applications,
[03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:55.160]   the nature of military conflict,
[03:03:55.160 --> 03:03:57.080]   should we release that information or not,
[03:03:57.080 --> 03:03:58.440]   if you were the government?
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:00.080]   - So here, well, here's exactly how.
[03:04:00.080 --> 03:04:02.560]   So for classified information,
[03:04:02.560 --> 03:04:05.440]   the government is the people that classify it.
[03:04:05.440 --> 03:04:07.960]   So I can't go, I can't look at something and go,
[03:04:07.960 --> 03:04:10.560]   "Oh my God, this Avion bottle is now top secret."
[03:04:10.560 --> 03:04:11.800]   I can't, I don't have the authority,
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:13.320]   the ability, or anyone to do that.
[03:04:13.320 --> 03:04:14.160]   That's up to the government.
[03:04:14.160 --> 03:04:16.280]   And I agree with that because I worked for the government
[03:04:16.280 --> 03:04:17.520]   for 24 years of my life.
[03:04:17.520 --> 03:04:20.240]   So I understand that.
[03:04:20.240 --> 03:04:25.680]   But now you go, there's reasons stuff is classified, okay?
[03:04:25.680 --> 03:04:27.720]   And it has to do with,
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:29.480]   sometimes information is classified
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:31.360]   by how it was obtained.
[03:04:31.360 --> 03:04:32.760]   It's just like the mob.
[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:34.960]   If I have a spy and I'm a mobster
[03:04:34.960 --> 03:04:36.240]   and you're the counter mobster,
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:37.360]   but I have a guy on the inside
[03:04:37.360 --> 03:04:39.760]   that's feeding me information, I can't do it.
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:42.680]   And a perfect example is if you've ever seen the,
[03:04:42.680 --> 03:04:44.200]   it's the Tom Cruise movie,
[03:04:44.200 --> 03:04:45.560]   what is it, Air America or whatever?
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:48.080]   But he plays the guy in Louisiana
[03:04:48.080 --> 03:04:50.520]   who was hauling drugs for Pablo Escobar.
[03:04:50.520 --> 03:04:52.480]   And he ended up getting a cargo plane
[03:04:52.480 --> 03:04:54.720]   and the government, the CIA was kind of funding him
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:55.960]   to do stuff.
[03:04:55.960 --> 03:04:57.320]   That's how he got hooked up with Pablo,
[03:04:57.320 --> 03:04:58.760]   but they put cameras on his airplane.
[03:04:58.760 --> 03:05:00.200]   When Reagan had come out and said,
[03:05:00.200 --> 03:05:01.440]   "Here's pictures, we have proof
[03:05:01.440 --> 03:05:03.120]   that they're running these drugs."
[03:05:03.120 --> 03:05:05.200]   It didn't take Pablo long to figure out those pictures
[03:05:05.200 --> 03:05:06.640]   were taken from inside of the plane
[03:05:06.640 --> 03:05:07.920]   of this guy he had been working with
[03:05:07.920 --> 03:05:09.680]   and that guy ends up dead.
[03:05:09.680 --> 03:05:10.720]   Does that make sense?
[03:05:10.720 --> 03:05:13.440]   So you classify to protect the source.
[03:05:13.440 --> 03:05:15.560]   You classify to protect the technology
[03:05:15.560 --> 03:05:17.480]   because if the technology would get out,
[03:05:17.480 --> 03:05:19.920]   it could be grave damage or there's levels,
[03:05:19.920 --> 03:05:22.120]   depending on if it's a secret or top secret.
[03:05:22.120 --> 03:05:23.880]   There are levels of damage that can be done
[03:05:23.880 --> 03:05:26.800]   to the US government and our wellbeing as a country.
[03:05:26.800 --> 03:05:29.800]   And we owe it to this because we're all Americans.
[03:05:29.800 --> 03:05:32.120]   To me, no matter what some people will say,
[03:05:32.120 --> 03:05:33.080]   even in this country,
[03:05:33.080 --> 03:05:35.320]   this is the greatest country on the planet.
[03:05:35.320 --> 03:05:37.400]   This is the only country that you have the ability
[03:05:37.400 --> 03:05:38.840]   to do what you wanna do.
[03:05:38.840 --> 03:05:40.240]   It's just don't be lazy.
[03:05:40.240 --> 03:05:42.760]   And I have stories of people that came over here
[03:05:42.760 --> 03:05:44.520]   and started with nothing
[03:05:44.520 --> 03:05:47.480]   and they're living the American dream.
[03:05:47.480 --> 03:05:48.360]   And they'll tell you,
[03:05:48.360 --> 03:05:51.640]   and they didn't get it because of, like you,
[03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:53.960]   you came over here from Russia,
[03:05:53.960 --> 03:05:56.800]   you get no minority status or anything else.
[03:05:56.800 --> 03:06:00.800]   You get, you're a white Anglo-Saxon, Protestant,
[03:06:00.800 --> 03:06:02.800]   whatever your religion, whatever.
[03:06:02.800 --> 03:06:04.120]   But you come over here,
[03:06:04.120 --> 03:06:06.720]   I kinda knew that from the last time.
[03:06:06.720 --> 03:06:08.000]   But you come over here,
[03:06:08.000 --> 03:06:10.480]   you basically have made yourself.
[03:06:10.480 --> 03:06:12.960]   You're educated, you're working at literally
[03:06:12.960 --> 03:06:17.800]   the top research university in the world, to be honest.
[03:06:17.800 --> 03:06:20.820]   - I can do whatever the hell I can create.
[03:06:20.820 --> 03:06:22.800]   With a bit of, with a lot of hard work,
[03:06:22.800 --> 03:06:24.040]   I can do quite a lot.
[03:06:24.040 --> 03:06:25.520]   - And no one gave it to you.
[03:06:25.520 --> 03:06:27.080]   So, I mean, and I have people--
[03:06:27.080 --> 03:06:32.080]   - I'm a believer that, I mean, we are a community.
[03:06:32.080 --> 03:06:35.080]   So there is a social aspect to it,
[03:06:35.080 --> 03:06:38.280]   but the freedom and the American dream is a real thing.
[03:06:38.280 --> 03:06:41.560]   And this is, I joke about being Russian,
[03:06:41.560 --> 03:06:43.340]   but I'm an American,
[03:06:43.340 --> 03:06:46.160]   and this is, I do believe, the greatest country on Earth.
[03:06:46.160 --> 03:06:49.460]   So there's a reason the nationalist pride,
[03:06:50.560 --> 03:06:52.800]   the pride in your nation is a powerful thing.
[03:06:52.800 --> 03:06:57.800]   And around that, this secrecy holds value.
[03:06:57.800 --> 03:07:02.960]   But to me, alien technology is bigger than that.
[03:07:02.960 --> 03:07:07.240]   I mean, it's not so much a threat
[03:07:07.240 --> 03:07:11.160]   as you're holding back something
[03:07:11.160 --> 03:07:14.960]   that could inspire the world, like human knowledge.
[03:07:14.960 --> 03:07:16.260]   - So let's talk in theory.
[03:07:16.260 --> 03:07:20.200]   So I'm gonna go back to Bob, 'cause I've talked to Bob.
[03:07:20.200 --> 03:07:24.360]   So Bob is a propulsion guy, right?
[03:07:24.360 --> 03:07:26.120]   Bob has a bicycle with a rocket motor.
[03:07:26.120 --> 03:07:29.320]   He built a rocket car, so he did that.
[03:07:29.320 --> 03:07:32.160]   So if you are trying to figure out a propulsion system,
[03:07:32.160 --> 03:07:36.080]   let's just say, I'm just talking, this is Dave's theory.
[03:07:36.080 --> 03:07:41.960]   I am, I own, I have custody of this thing
[03:07:41.960 --> 03:07:44.680]   from a technology that I don't understand,
[03:07:44.680 --> 03:07:46.720]   and I know it's a propulsion system.
[03:07:46.720 --> 03:07:49.240]   So now I gotta figure it out, right?
[03:07:49.240 --> 03:07:51.480]   So who are you gonna go to, right?
[03:07:51.480 --> 03:07:53.680]   You go find someone, so you go, wait,
[03:07:53.680 --> 03:07:57.040]   here's a guy who at the time was working at Los Alamos,
[03:07:57.040 --> 03:08:00.040]   which they have proven, who is big into propulsion.
[03:08:00.040 --> 03:08:03.280]   He designs all this, he builds his shit in his garage.
[03:08:03.280 --> 03:08:06.560]   Hey, he's super smart, why don't we bring him in?
[03:08:06.560 --> 03:08:08.480]   So you hire him on a contract and you go,
[03:08:08.480 --> 03:08:09.760]   hey, we're gonna brief you into a program,
[03:08:09.760 --> 03:08:11.920]   and he goes and works on wherever he says he worked.
[03:08:11.920 --> 03:08:14.200]   That's not important, but you get access to the technology
[03:08:14.200 --> 03:08:15.700]   to try and figure it out.
[03:08:15.700 --> 03:08:18.240]   And then you go, well, Bob comes out and says,
[03:08:18.240 --> 03:08:20.000]   you know, we're figuring out these things,
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:21.480]   but there's a part where our technology
[03:08:21.480 --> 03:08:24.320]   isn't advanced enough for us to figure the whole thing out.
[03:08:24.320 --> 03:08:27.880]   So then, and let's just say Bob doesn't come out
[03:08:27.880 --> 03:08:30.800]   and tell anyone, he works on it until he gets to the point
[03:08:30.800 --> 03:08:31.880]   where he's stagnated.
[03:08:31.880 --> 03:08:34.680]   He's at a wall.
[03:08:34.680 --> 03:08:35.600]   You go, ah, I can't do it.
[03:08:35.600 --> 03:08:37.560]   So sometimes the best thing is to bring in a fresh mind.
[03:08:37.560 --> 03:08:39.120]   So you go find someone else who's into propulsion,
[03:08:39.120 --> 03:08:41.040]   you bring him in, they work, they can't figure it out,
[03:08:41.040 --> 03:08:42.560]   or they get to the point where,
[03:08:42.560 --> 03:08:44.200]   kind of back to the Einstein theory where,
[03:08:44.200 --> 03:08:45.860]   hey, I've got all these theories on how it works,
[03:08:45.860 --> 03:08:46.960]   but we don't have the technology.
[03:08:46.960 --> 03:08:49.240]   We haven't advanced enough to actually do what we need to do.
[03:08:49.240 --> 03:08:51.240]   We still have to advance technology more.
[03:08:51.240 --> 03:08:52.080]   So then what do you do?
[03:08:52.080 --> 03:08:53.340]   You shelf it.
[03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:55.640]   You go, hey, good, project's over, end the contract.
[03:08:55.640 --> 03:08:58.880]   You shelf it, and you wait another 10 years.
[03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:01.080]   And you wait another 10 years until technology
[03:09:01.080 --> 03:09:04.520]   and our abilities and our research advances more.
[03:09:04.520 --> 03:09:06.080]   And then you go find new people to bring in
[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:07.300]   that are experts in that field and go,
[03:09:07.300 --> 03:09:08.760]   hey, we want you to work on this thing.
[03:09:08.760 --> 03:09:10.840]   And here's what we know about it so far.
[03:09:10.840 --> 03:09:13.400]   Or you don't tell them anything,
[03:09:13.400 --> 03:09:16.380]   'cause remember, if you reveal someone else's research,
[03:09:16.380 --> 03:09:17.560]   you can taint their beliefs.
[03:09:17.560 --> 03:09:18.920]   They'll start to sway in that direction.
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:20.960]   So you go, I'm not gonna tell you anything.
[03:09:20.960 --> 03:09:22.000]   I'm gonna give you this thing,
[03:09:22.000 --> 03:09:23.160]   and now you tell me what you think.
[03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:25.960]   And as they progress, if they get stuck on a problem
[03:09:25.960 --> 03:09:27.960]   that maybe Bob and someone else solved earlier,
[03:09:27.960 --> 03:09:28.920]   you can go, hey, what about this?
[03:09:28.920 --> 03:09:30.200]   You don't have to tell them where it came from.
[03:09:30.200 --> 03:09:31.040]   What about this?
[03:09:31.040 --> 03:09:31.920]   And now they can leapfrog,
[03:09:31.920 --> 03:09:35.760]   and they get another two steps closer to the final answer.
[03:09:35.760 --> 03:09:38.400]   And then we get stuck by our evolution of technology,
[03:09:38.400 --> 03:09:39.240]   and you shelve it again.
[03:09:39.240 --> 03:09:41.360]   - Do you think that's the right way to do it?
[03:09:41.360 --> 03:09:42.960]   Because it's heartbreaking.
[03:09:43.960 --> 03:09:46.140]   - Listen, I love government,
[03:09:46.140 --> 03:09:49.940]   but we just had this discussion about Elon and so on.
[03:09:49.940 --> 03:09:54.940]   The alternative approach is to release this to the world
[03:09:54.940 --> 03:09:57.180]   and say there's a mystery here.
[03:09:57.180 --> 03:09:59.580]   And then the Elons of the world, the Jeff Bezos,
[03:09:59.580 --> 03:10:01.820]   we talked about money, but it's also not just money.
[03:10:01.820 --> 03:10:05.740]   It's like this engine that's within,
[03:10:05.740 --> 03:10:07.500]   we talked about the American dream,
[03:10:07.500 --> 03:10:11.700]   to say I'm gonna be the one that cracks this mystery open.
[03:10:11.700 --> 03:10:13.740]   And that's within a lot of us.
[03:10:13.740 --> 03:10:17.880]   And money aside, people in their garage just will--
[03:10:17.880 --> 03:10:19.360]   - But you're thinking like a scientist.
[03:10:19.360 --> 03:10:22.280]   So now let's shift to, let me think like a country.
[03:10:22.280 --> 03:10:24.680]   So we have country A, B, and C.
[03:10:24.680 --> 03:10:26.440]   And you can look at the nuclear arms race.
[03:10:26.440 --> 03:10:28.880]   So we know that Germany was really close.
[03:10:28.880 --> 03:10:30.880]   We know that Russia was getting pretty close.
[03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:34.600]   We just won the race, and we were the first ones with it.
[03:10:34.600 --> 03:10:35.440]   And still to this day--
[03:10:35.440 --> 03:10:36.860]   - And Germany could have won.
[03:10:36.860 --> 03:10:38.160]   - They could have won.
[03:10:38.160 --> 03:10:40.240]   They could have won, but someone was smart enough
[03:10:40.240 --> 03:10:41.520]   to not finish the equation
[03:10:41.520 --> 03:10:43.240]   when they knew they had the answer.
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:44.740]   It's literally what it comes down to.
[03:10:44.740 --> 03:10:46.340]   Someone was smart enough to realize
[03:10:46.340 --> 03:10:49.780]   that if that got into the hands of the Nazis,
[03:10:49.780 --> 03:10:51.460]   that it would be the end.
[03:10:51.460 --> 03:10:54.700]   And that's a tough call to do that,
[03:10:54.700 --> 03:10:55.940]   knowing that you have the answer
[03:10:55.940 --> 03:10:56.940]   and you can't solve the problem
[03:10:56.940 --> 03:10:58.220]   because it will go into the wrong hand.
[03:10:58.220 --> 03:10:59.760]   And that's kind of the fear when you look at this.
[03:10:59.760 --> 03:11:02.060]   You go, okay, so if we do this,
[03:11:02.060 --> 03:11:05.980]   if we put it out there, we've got this technology,
[03:11:05.980 --> 03:11:08.220]   if we don't work on it kind of International Space Station
[03:11:08.220 --> 03:11:10.300]   like we're all gonna work on it together,
[03:11:11.300 --> 03:11:15.040]   like Antarctica is really supposed to be treaty-free
[03:11:15.040 --> 03:11:16.560]   from any weapons or anything,
[03:11:16.560 --> 03:11:17.840]   we got the international thing down there,
[03:11:17.840 --> 03:11:19.120]   we're all gonna work together.
[03:11:19.120 --> 03:11:21.420]   If you did it in the confines of that
[03:11:21.420 --> 03:11:24.440]   and you could control the flow in and out,
[03:11:24.440 --> 03:11:25.320]   because what you don't want
[03:11:25.320 --> 03:11:27.040]   is someone stealing information
[03:11:27.040 --> 03:11:28.120]   and getting it back to where,
[03:11:28.120 --> 03:11:30.160]   and countries are notorious to do this.
[03:11:30.160 --> 03:11:31.120]   Hey, we're doing it internationally,
[03:11:31.120 --> 03:11:32.840]   but we're secretly doing it ourselves
[03:11:32.840 --> 03:11:35.760]   to see who can come up with a solution first.
[03:11:35.760 --> 03:11:38.240]   That's the problem because we have this inherent thing
[03:11:38.240 --> 03:11:41.300]   of power and technology like that is power.
[03:11:41.300 --> 03:11:43.500]   It would literally change the game
[03:11:43.500 --> 03:11:45.180]   of the way the world operates.
[03:11:45.180 --> 03:11:48.940]   And from not just a transportation or mankind,
[03:11:48.940 --> 03:11:52.240]   but from a military aspect, it's got huge, huge.
[03:11:52.240 --> 03:11:57.620]   - Yeah, yeah, so beautifully, beautifully presented.
[03:11:57.620 --> 03:12:00.620]   And I feel like there's a tension between those two places,
[03:12:00.620 --> 03:12:02.580]   the scientist view of the world
[03:12:02.580 --> 03:12:05.060]   and the national security view of the world.
[03:12:05.980 --> 03:12:08.480]   Let me get to this kind of interesting point,
[03:12:08.480 --> 03:12:12.280]   which is a lot of conspiracy theorists
[03:12:12.280 --> 03:12:14.040]   kind of paint a picture of government
[03:12:14.040 --> 03:12:17.280]   as an exceptionally, as a hierarchical system
[03:12:17.280 --> 03:12:21.880]   that's exceptionally competent and good at hiding secrets.
[03:12:21.880 --> 03:12:24.280]   And then, I mean, I tend to not subscribe
[03:12:24.280 --> 03:12:26.240]   to almost any conspiracy theory,
[03:12:26.240 --> 03:12:29.640]   to the degree at least that the conspiracy theorists do.
[03:12:29.640 --> 03:12:30.480]   - I agree with you.
[03:12:30.480 --> 03:12:33.800]   - But there does seem to be,
[03:12:33.800 --> 03:12:35.200]   and I tend to think of government
[03:12:35.200 --> 03:12:40.160]   as unfortunately incompetent, at least the bureaucracy.
[03:12:40.160 --> 03:12:43.320]   It seems that the communication,
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:45.280]   like the three videos that were released
[03:12:45.280 --> 03:12:50.040]   and just the way of DoD in general talks
[03:12:50.040 --> 03:12:53.000]   about the things we've been talking about,
[03:12:53.000 --> 03:12:55.760]   it's just confused, it's contradictory,
[03:12:55.760 --> 03:13:00.480]   it's not inspiring, it's suspicious.
[03:13:00.480 --> 03:13:03.800]   It's just not, even the way they released the videos.
[03:13:03.800 --> 03:13:07.080]   You know, the TikTok, if presented correctly,
[03:13:07.080 --> 03:13:09.760]   could just inspire a generation of scientists.
[03:13:09.760 --> 03:13:13.220]   It's like us going to the moon.
[03:13:13.220 --> 03:13:15.680]   It's inspiring.
[03:13:15.680 --> 03:13:17.640]   I mean, it's incredible.
[03:13:17.640 --> 03:13:20.640]   And the way it was released, it was suspicious,
[03:13:20.640 --> 03:13:24.800]   it was like low-resolution video on a crappy website,
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:27.240]   like with some crappy documents.
[03:13:27.240 --> 03:13:31.200]   And I mean, why, I don't know how to ask this question,
[03:13:31.200 --> 03:13:32.840]   but can government do better?
[03:13:32.840 --> 03:13:34.520]   Why are they doing it this way
[03:13:34.520 --> 03:13:37.020]   in terms of communicating the things
[03:13:37.020 --> 03:13:38.480]   they do know to the public?
[03:13:38.480 --> 03:13:40.880]   - 'Cause I don't think they know how.
[03:13:40.880 --> 03:13:42.040]   Especially in this topic,
[03:13:42.040 --> 03:13:44.420]   it's been hidden for so many years.
[03:13:44.420 --> 03:13:46.000]   And I don't think,
[03:13:46.000 --> 03:13:48.380]   'cause I don't buy off on the conspiracy stuff,
[03:13:48.380 --> 03:13:51.240]   I just think that when it comes in, like I said,
[03:13:51.240 --> 03:13:53.560]   the government has a right to classify stuff,
[03:13:53.560 --> 03:13:56.420]   they classify everything 'cause they don't know.
[03:13:56.420 --> 03:13:57.560]   You have something, you don't know what it is,
[03:13:57.560 --> 03:13:58.400]   you don't know, so we just go,
[03:13:58.400 --> 03:14:02.000]   "Well, it must be top secret and let's put it in a vault."
[03:14:02.000 --> 03:14:03.240]   It's kind of like the Indiana Jones
[03:14:03.240 --> 03:14:05.120]   where they take the ark and they put it in,
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:06.920]   it's in the giant army warehouse.
[03:14:06.920 --> 03:14:10.520]   We don't even know what we have.
[03:14:10.520 --> 03:14:13.240]   So, but I also believe that,
[03:14:13.240 --> 03:14:14.440]   and I'll say this openly,
[03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:16.480]   I don't think that the American people
[03:14:16.480 --> 03:14:17.360]   need to know everything.
[03:14:17.360 --> 03:14:19.440]   I think there's a reason that stuff is classified
[03:14:19.440 --> 03:14:22.680]   for the protection of this country,
[03:14:22.680 --> 03:14:24.520]   and I totally believe in that.
[03:14:24.520 --> 03:14:27.440]   So, I was joking with Joe
[03:14:27.440 --> 03:14:30.000]   when he was talking about the Storm Area 51 stuff.
[03:14:30.000 --> 03:14:32.040]   I'm like, "Yeah, that's probably the worst idea
[03:14:32.040 --> 03:14:32.960]   "you could possibly have
[03:14:32.960 --> 03:14:35.340]   "is to just storm a military installation.
[03:14:35.340 --> 03:14:36.680]   "It's just stupid."
[03:14:36.680 --> 03:14:39.440]   There are reasons that we have things
[03:14:39.440 --> 03:14:41.160]   that we don't just let out to the public
[03:14:41.160 --> 03:14:43.880]   because if we do, as soon as you do
[03:14:43.880 --> 03:14:46.280]   let someone know that you have something,
[03:14:46.280 --> 03:14:47.880]   they immediately try and encounter it.
[03:14:47.880 --> 03:14:49.120]   And perfect example,
[03:14:49.120 --> 03:14:52.720]   the US in the '60s developed a bomber.
[03:14:52.720 --> 03:14:56.720]   It was a Mach 3 compression lift bomber called the XB-70.
[03:14:56.720 --> 03:14:58.440]   Okay, there was three of them built,
[03:14:58.440 --> 03:14:59.840]   three of them ever built.
[03:14:59.840 --> 03:15:03.880]   It was a 60,000 foot high Mach 3.
[03:15:03.880 --> 03:15:05.680]   It was an incredible airplane when you see it.
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:07.120]   And there's actually the last one remaining
[03:15:07.120 --> 03:15:08.960]   is in Dayton, Ohio at the museum.
[03:15:08.960 --> 03:15:10.640]   It would go, the wingtips would fold down.
[03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:12.940]   It looks like a Concorde, but it's way faster.
[03:15:12.940 --> 03:15:17.480]   When that got out that we were developing it,
[03:15:17.480 --> 03:15:20.480]   the Soviet Union developed the MiG-25,
[03:15:20.480 --> 03:15:22.800]   literally a high altitude interceptor
[03:15:22.800 --> 03:15:25.000]   to counter that bomber.
[03:15:25.000 --> 03:15:29.520]   And they built an entire fleet of MiG-25s.
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:33.980]   We built three XB-70s and we scrapped the program.
[03:15:33.980 --> 03:15:38.680]   Because now you go, well, the technology is cool.
[03:15:38.680 --> 03:15:40.360]   We proved it, but now it becomes obsolete.
[03:15:40.360 --> 03:15:41.760]   So it's not even worth building a whole fleet
[03:15:41.760 --> 03:15:42.680]   of these things.
[03:15:42.680 --> 03:15:44.720]   It's a chess game.
[03:15:44.720 --> 03:15:46.120]   We do something, they do something.
[03:15:46.120 --> 03:15:47.280]   We do something, they do something.
[03:15:47.280 --> 03:15:50.040]   And it's we do something and then they counter it.
[03:15:50.040 --> 03:15:51.640]   You gotta figure out how to defeat it.
[03:15:51.640 --> 03:15:52.960]   So you go, oh, we'll build something.
[03:15:52.960 --> 03:15:56.240]   So the more we keep quiet,
[03:15:56.240 --> 03:15:58.840]   especially from a defense standpoint, the better.
[03:15:58.840 --> 03:16:01.080]   Actually, I personally think we talk too much.
[03:16:01.080 --> 03:16:03.800]   And I think the military and the DOD is starting to see
[03:16:03.800 --> 03:16:05.680]   that we're too open.
[03:16:05.680 --> 03:16:08.460]   You announce, hey, we're building this
[03:16:08.460 --> 03:16:11.400]   because there's a budget line and we live in a free society.
[03:16:11.400 --> 03:16:15.800]   But you don't have to release all the specs.
[03:16:15.800 --> 03:16:17.760]   And you don't have to put everything in open source.
[03:16:17.760 --> 03:16:21.240]   But that's a problem when we go to the universities.
[03:16:21.240 --> 03:16:23.200]   If we wanna go do work with MIT
[03:16:23.200 --> 03:16:25.280]   and you wanna partner with MIT and you're a defense company
[03:16:25.280 --> 03:16:27.880]   and you wanna partner, you guys have a rule
[03:16:27.880 --> 03:16:30.160]   that if you create it, then it can be open source
[03:16:30.160 --> 03:16:31.320]   because the university owns it
[03:16:31.320 --> 03:16:34.120]   and we are an institution of learning.
[03:16:34.120 --> 03:16:35.720]   Where the defense side might go,
[03:16:35.720 --> 03:16:38.160]   we don't really want that published in a paper
[03:16:38.160 --> 03:16:40.120]   in Scientific America or I can't believe.
[03:16:40.120 --> 03:16:41.120]   - It's so heartbreaking.
[03:16:41.120 --> 03:16:44.040]   I talked to CTO of Lockheed, Keiko Jackson,
[03:16:44.040 --> 03:16:47.920]   and just Concord's, some of the best,
[03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:50.720]   if not the best engineering and science,
[03:16:50.720 --> 03:16:55.720]   but engineering really ever is done in secrecy.
[03:16:56.520 --> 03:16:59.520]   And it sucks because it's so inspiring
[03:16:59.520 --> 03:17:01.000]   and they can't talk about it.
[03:17:01.000 --> 03:17:03.080]   - It is, but some of it's due to funding.
[03:17:03.080 --> 03:17:05.840]   The US government has deep pockets.
[03:17:05.840 --> 03:17:07.660]   Some of this new technology that you develop
[03:17:07.660 --> 03:17:08.840]   for an open source, unless,
[03:17:08.840 --> 03:17:11.060]   and this goes back to the original conversation.
[03:17:11.060 --> 03:17:13.740]   We now, there's enough money in the private sector
[03:17:13.740 --> 03:17:15.640]   that individuals control.
[03:17:15.640 --> 03:17:20.680]   Bezos, I'm not talking Amazon, I'm talking Jeff Bezos.
[03:17:20.680 --> 03:17:21.520]   - A single individual.
[03:17:21.520 --> 03:17:23.560]   - It's worth over $100 billion.
[03:17:23.560 --> 03:17:25.320]   He has the ability to do stuff.
[03:17:25.320 --> 03:17:27.480]   I'll tell you what, the Gates Foundation,
[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:31.880]   between Bill Gates and his wife and Warren Buffett
[03:17:31.880 --> 03:17:32.720]   and some of the other money,
[03:17:32.720 --> 03:17:36.720]   'cause I think Bezos' ex-wife actually donated
[03:17:36.720 --> 03:17:39.400]   a huge chunk of her half into the Gates Foundation.
[03:17:39.400 --> 03:17:42.200]   So, I mean, what's the Gates Foundation worth these days?
[03:17:42.200 --> 03:17:46.520]   You know, and these are guys, you know, brilliant, brilliant.
[03:17:46.520 --> 03:17:48.720]   I mean, some of the greatest minds that we have to go,
[03:17:48.720 --> 03:17:49.560]   you know, what are they doing?
[03:17:49.560 --> 03:17:51.260]   Because they have the ability, it's a nonprofit.
[03:17:51.260 --> 03:17:52.560]   They can go, hey, I wanna fund this.
[03:17:52.560 --> 03:17:53.800]   I wanna fund this research.
[03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:55.960]   - They can look beyond the conflict between nations.
[03:17:55.960 --> 03:17:58.600]   - You can look beyond the conflict of having to have,
[03:17:58.600 --> 03:17:59.700]   you know, classification.
[03:17:59.700 --> 03:18:01.160]   You can do what you want.
[03:18:01.160 --> 03:18:02.960]   You know, it's just like, you know,
[03:18:02.960 --> 03:18:07.400]   we classify how to do, you know, the whole nuclear,
[03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:10.400]   how to create a critical mass, right?
[03:18:10.400 --> 03:18:12.280]   But there's really smart high school kids
[03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:13.640]   that have figured it out mathematically
[03:18:13.640 --> 03:18:14.680]   and they do their science project
[03:18:14.680 --> 03:18:15.840]   and then the government comes in and says,
[03:18:15.840 --> 03:18:17.040]   hey, we gotta classify your government
[03:18:17.040 --> 03:18:20.000]   'cause we just don't want this out in the public domain,
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:21.920]   which I understand, but they never stop them
[03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:23.560]   from free thought and developing that.
[03:18:23.560 --> 03:18:26.360]   It's just, hey, we really don't want this out there.
[03:18:26.360 --> 03:18:27.820]   Okay, so I understand that.
[03:18:27.820 --> 03:18:28.860]   I totally understand that.
[03:18:28.860 --> 03:18:32.120]   But if they, you know, if Bill and Melinda wanna do this
[03:18:32.120 --> 03:18:33.160]   and go, hey, we wanna do this
[03:18:33.160 --> 03:18:34.400]   and they're gonna work with Bezos
[03:18:34.400 --> 03:18:35.440]   and they're gonna work with Elon
[03:18:35.440 --> 03:18:37.520]   and we're gonna, I mean, you think about it.
[03:18:37.520 --> 03:18:39.320]   There's a significant amount of money
[03:18:39.320 --> 03:18:40.600]   that could be available to R&D
[03:18:40.600 --> 03:18:42.040]   and I'm not talking just science like this.
[03:18:42.040 --> 03:18:45.000]   I'm talking medical research and all this.
[03:18:45.000 --> 03:18:46.160]   But then you go, well, who gets it?
[03:18:46.160 --> 03:18:48.300]   Because now you're competing against
[03:18:48.300 --> 03:18:49.720]   the companies that actually do it.
[03:18:49.720 --> 03:18:52.040]   You go, is that, well, are they the greatest minds?
[03:18:52.040 --> 03:18:55.900]   I'd say, you know, we have a tendency to go,
[03:18:55.900 --> 03:18:58.160]   these are the best that we have.
[03:18:58.160 --> 03:19:00.720]   And I'd say, well, no, that's the best that we know we have.
[03:19:00.720 --> 03:19:01.800]   But there's probably people out there
[03:19:01.800 --> 03:19:02.920]   that don't wanna work.
[03:19:02.920 --> 03:19:04.640]   There's brilliant minds that don't wanna do anything
[03:19:04.640 --> 03:19:07.320]   with the fence 'cause they just disagree with what it does.
[03:19:07.320 --> 03:19:09.080]   So they go do another path.
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:10.200]   They go do something else.
[03:19:10.200 --> 03:19:13.080]   - And in a sense, the Elons of the world,
[03:19:13.080 --> 03:19:17.120]   the Jeff Bezos, actually, in a certain sense,
[03:19:17.120 --> 03:19:20.720]   much better than DOD at finding
[03:19:20.720 --> 03:19:22.840]   the brilliant, weird minds out there.
[03:19:22.840 --> 03:19:24.440]   - Because they're not tied to the government.
[03:19:24.440 --> 03:19:26.840]   So when you work a government contract,
[03:19:26.840 --> 03:19:29.440]   the government writes, they tell you what they want,
[03:19:29.440 --> 03:19:31.020]   and then they work with you on the requirements.
[03:19:31.020 --> 03:19:33.800]   And they usually have an end in mean.
[03:19:33.800 --> 03:19:36.680]   They have an idea that this is what I want it to be.
[03:19:36.680 --> 03:19:40.580]   Where if you go to like SpaceX,
[03:19:40.580 --> 03:19:43.160]   where they come up with,
[03:19:43.160 --> 03:19:46.840]   why don't we just land these things on a pad and reuse 'em?
[03:19:46.840 --> 03:19:48.160]   Well, if the government scientist,
[03:19:48.160 --> 03:19:49.160]   if you're on a government contract,
[03:19:49.160 --> 03:19:50.440]   says no, that's not the requirements.
[03:19:50.440 --> 03:19:51.280]   We're not paying for that.
[03:19:51.280 --> 03:19:52.120]   We want you to do this.
[03:19:52.120 --> 03:19:53.760]   You're kinda controlled.
[03:19:53.760 --> 03:19:55.560]   Or when Elon does it, his company,
[03:19:55.560 --> 03:19:56.800]   they can do whatever the hell they wanna do
[03:19:56.800 --> 03:19:58.540]   'cause they have no bounds.
[03:19:58.540 --> 03:20:00.560]   The only bounds they have is the liability
[03:20:00.560 --> 03:20:02.140]   if it doesn't work and it lands on something.
[03:20:02.140 --> 03:20:02.980]   So what do you do?
[03:20:02.980 --> 03:20:04.280]   You go out to quadulene and you test it.
[03:20:04.280 --> 03:20:05.840]   And if it crashes and it lands in the ocean,
[03:20:05.840 --> 03:20:07.100]   hey, we cleaned it up, no big deal.
[03:20:07.100 --> 03:20:09.420]   We lost some money, but we'll move on.
[03:20:09.420 --> 03:20:12.300]   Money makes the world go round,
[03:20:12.300 --> 03:20:13.760]   contrary to what everyone thinks.
[03:20:13.760 --> 03:20:16.060]   But there's a lot of money that's sitting around
[03:20:16.060 --> 03:20:17.920]   that you can do a lot of really cool stuff with.
[03:20:17.920 --> 03:20:18.760]   And I don't know.
[03:20:18.760 --> 03:20:22.200]   I mean, I'll guarantee that, what is it, Blue Origin?
[03:20:22.200 --> 03:20:23.560]   Isn't that Amazon? - Blue Origin, yeah.
[03:20:23.560 --> 03:20:25.240]   - You know, that they're doing some cool stuff
[03:20:25.240 --> 03:20:28.200]   because they have funny, and I joke with the guy
[03:20:28.200 --> 03:20:29.600]   I know that worked at SpaceX.
[03:20:29.600 --> 03:20:32.320]   And he was funny because they were building
[03:20:32.320 --> 03:20:35.200]   the first test thing and they were limited.
[03:20:35.200 --> 03:20:38.080]   And Elon found this like 400 acre thing,
[03:20:38.080 --> 03:20:40.580]   I think it's about 400 acres, down by Waco, Texas.
[03:20:40.580 --> 03:20:43.040]   And he's like, I go, "How?"
[03:20:43.040 --> 03:20:45.360]   He goes, "Dude, I worked with,"
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:47.800]   he goes, 'cause he's done government contract,
[03:20:47.800 --> 03:20:48.880]   he goes, "There's government contract
[03:20:48.880 --> 03:20:51.620]   "and then there's working at SpaceX with Elon money."
[03:20:51.620 --> 03:20:53.400]   And that's what he refers to it as, is Elon money,
[03:20:53.400 --> 03:20:55.440]   where it was like, I'll throw them,
[03:20:55.440 --> 03:20:57.400]   and he would throw the money at it and make it happen.
[03:20:57.400 --> 03:20:59.480]   And I'm talking this fast.
[03:20:59.480 --> 03:21:01.800]   I mean, he talks about, he has a great story about this.
[03:21:01.800 --> 03:21:03.600]   I mean, this is Elon, but this is how fast you can do
[03:21:03.600 --> 03:21:05.160]   in the private sector, vice the government,
[03:21:05.160 --> 03:21:07.100]   where there's the bureaucracy is.
[03:21:07.100 --> 03:21:09.420]   They had a company that was basically
[03:21:09.420 --> 03:21:11.200]   a tool and die machine shop that did a lot
[03:21:11.200 --> 03:21:14.440]   of their high precision parts for the rockets.
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:16.320]   They had went to the guy,
[03:21:16.320 --> 03:21:18.160]   but he had contracts with other companies.
[03:21:18.160 --> 03:21:20.000]   And when the economy was down,
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:22.120]   the guy was actually looking at going out of business.
[03:21:22.120 --> 03:21:24.640]   So the guy I know, he's telling me this story.
[03:21:24.640 --> 03:21:25.640]   He was talking to the guy,
[03:21:25.640 --> 03:21:26.840]   he had to go over there and get something.
[03:21:26.840 --> 03:21:28.120]   And he's like, "Holy shit," he goes, "Hang on."
[03:21:28.120 --> 03:21:30.400]   So he calls up on the phone, SpaceX.
[03:21:30.400 --> 03:21:32.020]   He says, "Hey, is Elon there?
[03:21:32.020 --> 03:21:33.120]   "Can you get him in the boardroom?
[03:21:33.120 --> 03:21:35.080]   "We'll be there in 20 minutes."
[03:21:35.080 --> 03:21:36.880]   So he grabs this guy who's literally
[03:21:36.880 --> 03:21:39.000]   gonna fold his company.
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:40.800]   They go over to SpaceX,
[03:21:40.800 --> 03:21:42.120]   and I may be getting some of this wrong
[03:21:42.120 --> 03:21:43.200]   if people are gonna fact check me,
[03:21:43.200 --> 03:21:44.680]   but this is pretty close.
[03:21:44.680 --> 03:21:46.000]   They go in the boardroom,
[03:21:46.000 --> 03:21:50.880]   and he said, literally, within like an hour or two,
[03:21:50.880 --> 03:21:53.560]   Elon has bought the guy's company.
[03:21:53.560 --> 03:21:57.180]   That guy is now a senior VP running his company,
[03:21:57.180 --> 03:21:58.820]   and they're gonna pull all the stuff
[03:21:58.820 --> 03:22:01.560]   into the SpaceX thing so they can actually build the parts,
[03:22:01.560 --> 03:22:05.240]   and they can still contract out to make the money outside.
[03:22:05.240 --> 03:22:07.040]   And it happened like that fast.
[03:22:07.040 --> 03:22:08.520]   - And it's not just money.
[03:22:08.520 --> 03:22:10.800]   It's 'cause I've witnessed it too with Elon.
[03:22:10.800 --> 03:22:14.680]   I think it's whatever the forces of capitalism
[03:22:14.680 --> 03:22:19.680]   that allow a person like Elon Musk to rise to the top,
[03:22:19.680 --> 03:22:24.200]   but 'cause I've also worked for DARPA for research
[03:22:24.200 --> 03:22:25.840]   in terms of a source of funding,
[03:22:25.840 --> 03:22:28.840]   there's a weight of bureaucracy
[03:22:28.840 --> 03:22:32.000]   when I was working, being funded by DARPA.
[03:22:32.000 --> 03:22:34.160]   And with Elon, I was literally in the presence
[03:22:34.160 --> 03:22:36.440]   of anything is possible,
[03:22:36.440 --> 03:22:39.920]   cutting across all the bullshit of paperwork,
[03:22:39.920 --> 03:22:42.000]   of the way things were done in the past,
[03:22:42.000 --> 03:22:45.040]   of the bureaucracy, the rules, the constraints,
[03:22:45.040 --> 03:22:48.240]   all of that stuff, just you can cut across immediately.
[03:22:48.240 --> 03:22:49.760]   - How much money and time do you waste
[03:22:49.760 --> 03:22:50.840]   dealing with your bureaucracy
[03:22:50.840 --> 03:22:52.960]   when you could actually be doing real work?
[03:22:52.960 --> 03:22:53.920]   That's the difference.
[03:22:53.920 --> 03:22:56.080]   This is why, honestly, when I went back
[03:22:56.080 --> 03:22:59.600]   to the industrial defense complex that we were warned about,
[03:22:59.600 --> 03:23:01.080]   when you look at it and go,
[03:23:01.080 --> 03:23:03.320]   SpaceX can do something for half the price
[03:23:03.320 --> 03:23:06.520]   ahead of schedule that what Boeing were paying Boeing,
[03:23:06.520 --> 03:23:08.840]   and you go, oh, well, this just came out.
[03:23:08.840 --> 03:23:11.880]   You go, well, then why are we even dealing with this side
[03:23:11.880 --> 03:23:13.440]   when we can deal with this side?
[03:23:13.440 --> 03:23:15.680]   Because you've got a fully automated capsule
[03:23:15.680 --> 03:23:18.600]   that has a manual mode that they got to fly around in.
[03:23:18.600 --> 03:23:19.720]   It worked like a champ.
[03:23:19.720 --> 03:23:23.600]   It went up, it hung out, it came back, it splashed down.
[03:23:23.600 --> 03:23:25.880]   It worked perfectly.
[03:23:25.880 --> 03:23:27.000]   We're gonna dust it off.
[03:23:27.000 --> 03:23:29.160]   And oh, by the way, unlike the Apollo capsules
[03:23:29.160 --> 03:23:32.400]   that were used and then put to museums,
[03:23:32.400 --> 03:23:34.120]   they're gonna reuse that dragon capsule.
[03:23:34.120 --> 03:23:35.560]   It came down, they're gonna dust it off,
[03:23:35.560 --> 03:23:36.600]   put a new coat of paint on it,
[03:23:36.600 --> 03:23:39.600]   slap it on top of another rocket, and away it goes.
[03:23:39.600 --> 03:23:41.160]   Holy cow. - It's amazing.
[03:23:41.160 --> 03:23:43.360]   - It's a shift, it's a complete shift in mentality.
[03:23:43.360 --> 03:23:46.240]   And for us as taxpayers, we can explore at half the cost.
[03:23:46.240 --> 03:23:47.960]   - Yeah, it's exciting,
[03:23:47.960 --> 03:23:51.040]   especially given putting the Tic Tac in context,
[03:23:51.040 --> 03:23:55.400]   like then the sky, or it's limitless,
[03:23:55.400 --> 03:23:57.520]   the possibilities we could do with this kind of mechanism.
[03:23:57.520 --> 03:23:58.360]   - I think it's exciting.
[03:23:58.360 --> 03:23:59.180]   - Yeah, super exciting. - I think we live
[03:23:59.180 --> 03:24:00.160]   in an exciting time right now,
[03:24:00.160 --> 03:24:02.840]   besides everything that's messed up in the world right now.
[03:24:02.840 --> 03:24:04.400]   - Well, this is a hopeful.
[03:24:04.400 --> 03:24:07.800]   Like there's so much conflict going on, so much tension.
[03:24:07.800 --> 03:24:10.880]   That's to me, space exploration at the moment
[03:24:10.880 --> 03:24:13.280]   is a reason to get up in the morning
[03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:16.480]   and have a hope for the future, to look up to the sky.
[03:24:16.480 --> 03:24:20.880]   And we're humans, we can solve so many,
[03:24:20.880 --> 03:24:22.120]   we can solve all of this.
[03:24:22.120 --> 03:24:24.000]   - I was talking about when I was doing the Tucker thing,
[03:24:24.000 --> 03:24:26.560]   and I said, "This would be great."
[03:24:26.560 --> 03:24:28.680]   'Cause when the government had come out a month ago
[03:24:28.680 --> 03:24:31.240]   and said, "Hey, this does exist, we're doing this,
[03:24:31.240 --> 03:24:33.720]   "and oh, by the way, we're gonna release more stuff."
[03:24:33.720 --> 03:24:37.120]   And I was texting like Lou and Chris Mellon and those guys
[03:24:37.120 --> 03:24:38.600]   before I went on, 'cause they had called me up
[03:24:38.600 --> 03:24:39.840]   to be on Tucker's show.
[03:24:39.840 --> 03:24:42.460]   And I'm like, "Hey," I go, "This would be great.
[03:24:42.460 --> 03:24:46.420]   "Just come out with this, find the relic of a spaceship,
[03:24:46.420 --> 03:24:49.240]   "like pull out the Roswell wreckage, if you have it.
[03:24:49.240 --> 03:24:51.640]   "Pull out the Roswell wreckage and do it."
[03:24:51.640 --> 03:24:54.860]   God, it would be so nice to not have to deal with
[03:24:54.860 --> 03:24:56.740]   the riots in the cities.
[03:24:56.740 --> 03:24:58.680]   And I mean, I know it's an election year and all that,
[03:24:58.680 --> 03:25:00.960]   but God, it would be something, it'd be refreshing
[03:25:00.960 --> 03:25:02.600]   to not have to turn on my TV
[03:25:02.600 --> 03:25:05.440]   and see everything that is just depressing in the world.
[03:25:05.440 --> 03:25:07.380]   To be, "Holy cow, we actually do have this,
[03:25:07.380 --> 03:25:09.280]   "and we're working on this technology."
[03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:11.240]   - Imagine if there is a Roswell aircraft
[03:25:11.240 --> 03:25:12.440]   and they pull it out.
[03:25:12.440 --> 03:25:14.720]   Imagine the innovation that happens
[03:25:14.720 --> 03:25:16.480]   in the next 10 to 20 years
[03:25:16.480 --> 03:25:18.440]   without any more information than that.
[03:25:18.440 --> 03:25:21.120]   Just the innovation that happens,
[03:25:21.120 --> 03:25:22.800]   the look on Elon Musk's face,
[03:25:22.800 --> 03:25:24.520]   the look on Jeff Bezos's face,
[03:25:24.520 --> 03:25:25.960]   and all the brilliant engineers.
[03:25:25.960 --> 03:25:26.800]   - It would change the game.
[03:25:26.800 --> 03:25:27.620]   - It would change the game.
[03:25:27.620 --> 03:25:28.520]   - It would change the game completely.
[03:25:28.520 --> 03:25:31.040]   - Let me ask the big question, I apologize
[03:25:31.040 --> 03:25:33.400]   for the absurd romantic nature of it.
[03:25:33.400 --> 03:25:35.360]   Outside, I mean, one of the things,
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:40.360]   the fact that you've laid your eyes on a UFO,
[03:25:40.360 --> 03:25:43.960]   probably opened your eyes to the possibility
[03:25:43.960 --> 03:25:45.780]   that some of the other sightings,
[03:25:45.780 --> 03:25:50.680]   there could be other sightings that have legitimacy to them.
[03:25:50.680 --> 03:25:53.740]   What to you is the, outside of your own sighting,
[03:25:53.740 --> 03:25:57.600]   is the most interesting sighting
[03:25:57.600 --> 03:26:01.840]   or UFO-related event in history?
[03:26:01.840 --> 03:26:03.600]   - I think there's several.
[03:26:03.600 --> 03:26:06.200]   What is it, Rameshawn Forest in England?
[03:26:06.200 --> 03:26:09.540]   The US guys that saw stuff and actually got radiation burns.
[03:26:09.540 --> 03:26:11.160]   One guy was medically disabled,
[03:26:11.160 --> 03:26:12.600]   but they weren't gonna give him,
[03:26:12.600 --> 03:26:15.840]   and he got help from John McCain.
[03:26:15.840 --> 03:26:20.060]   His office helped get the guy's disability reestablished.
[03:26:20.060 --> 03:26:21.320]   I think that's a big one.
[03:26:21.320 --> 03:26:25.000]   I think there's people out there that have seen stuff,
[03:26:25.000 --> 03:26:26.840]   and I'm talking credible,
[03:26:26.840 --> 03:26:28.520]   because you gotta remember,
[03:26:28.520 --> 03:26:31.360]   there's a huge chunk of these sightings that get disproven.
[03:26:31.360 --> 03:26:32.800]   They're actually explainable.
[03:26:32.800 --> 03:26:38.120]   You had sent me the question, the Phoenix Lights.
[03:26:38.120 --> 03:26:39.600]   - Phoenix Lights, yeah, somebody sent.
[03:26:39.600 --> 03:26:40.520]   What's that?
[03:26:40.520 --> 03:26:43.400]   So I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with some of these.
[03:26:43.400 --> 03:26:44.240]   - I'm not either.
[03:26:44.240 --> 03:26:45.080]   (Lex laughs)
[03:26:45.080 --> 03:26:46.160]   You want a funny story on that.
[03:26:46.160 --> 03:26:48.320]   So I was at a conference,
[03:26:48.320 --> 03:26:49.820]   and hopefully he doesn't watch this and get offended.
[03:26:49.820 --> 03:26:54.820]   But we had this, I call it speed dating.
[03:26:54.920 --> 03:26:57.480]   So there was a table, about eight people at a table,
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:26:58.640]   and we would go sit at the table,
[03:26:58.640 --> 03:26:59.720]   and they could ask us questions.
[03:26:59.720 --> 03:27:01.920]   And then after 10 minutes, we moved to the next table.
[03:27:01.920 --> 03:27:03.640]   So I was speed dating all these people
[03:27:03.640 --> 03:27:05.560]   that are really into this.
[03:27:05.560 --> 03:27:07.440]   It was kind of funny, but I'd sat down.
[03:27:07.440 --> 03:27:08.280]   And it's always funny,
[03:27:08.280 --> 03:27:09.840]   'cause some people will try and dominate it,
[03:27:09.840 --> 03:27:12.240]   but you have to kind of push the dominators away
[03:27:12.240 --> 03:27:14.360]   so that if you're quiet and introverted,
[03:27:14.360 --> 03:27:16.460]   you can ask your question too.
[03:27:16.460 --> 03:27:18.720]   So we got into this, and the guy starts naming all these.
[03:27:18.720 --> 03:27:19.560]   Well, what about this?
[03:27:19.560 --> 03:27:20.380]   What about the Phoenix Lights?
[03:27:20.380 --> 03:27:21.560]   I'm like, I don't know about the Phoenix Lights.
[03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:22.400]   What about this event?
[03:27:22.400 --> 03:27:23.240]   I don't know about that.
[03:27:23.240 --> 03:27:24.960]   And he goes, he looks at me and he goes,
[03:27:24.960 --> 03:27:26.520]   well, you're not a UFO guy.
[03:27:26.520 --> 03:27:30.040]   I go, no, I'm not, but I chased one, so I'm an expert.
[03:27:30.040 --> 03:27:31.000]   Have you?
[03:27:31.000 --> 03:27:32.320]   And you could see him get deflated
[03:27:32.320 --> 03:27:34.120]   'cause I'm kind of a smart ass like that.
[03:27:34.120 --> 03:27:37.040]   - Yeah, I mean, that first-hand experience from a credible,
[03:27:37.040 --> 03:27:39.160]   in some sense, these sightings have to do
[03:27:39.160 --> 03:27:41.360]   both with the evidence and the human.
[03:27:41.360 --> 03:27:43.960]   - Well, I think part of that is, to us,
[03:27:43.960 --> 03:27:45.080]   that's a credibility piece,
[03:27:45.080 --> 03:27:47.160]   'cause the four of us that actually saw it,
[03:27:47.160 --> 03:27:49.440]   plus the other two that were in the airplane
[03:27:49.440 --> 03:27:52.840]   that shot the video, none of us are UFO-obsessed people.
[03:27:53.400 --> 03:27:55.480]   So when we come out and say,
[03:27:55.480 --> 03:27:58.320]   because to me, it's just five minutes of my life.
[03:27:58.320 --> 03:28:01.000]   I did a lot of really cool,
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:03.720]   really kind of neat things I've been able to do.
[03:28:03.720 --> 03:28:08.040]   But when you look at it and go,
[03:28:08.040 --> 03:28:14.200]   to me, it's not the pinnacle of my life.
[03:28:14.200 --> 03:28:16.720]   To other people that, they live in the UFO world,
[03:28:16.720 --> 03:28:18.880]   and it's like they, if you talk to people,
[03:28:18.880 --> 03:28:22.120]   they'll go, they're really into it, who've never seen one.
[03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:25.080]   It kills them that they didn't see one.
[03:28:25.080 --> 03:28:28.880]   When here we are, because, and what's unique with ours,
[03:28:28.880 --> 03:28:30.560]   which kind of adds that level, is it wasn't,
[03:28:30.560 --> 03:28:31.960]   we just didn't see it.
[03:28:31.960 --> 03:28:33.760]   It wasn't like, oh, look, something in the sky,
[03:28:33.760 --> 03:28:34.840]   and it was weird.
[03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:36.360]   We actually engaged with it.
[03:28:36.360 --> 03:28:38.960]   You know, it was an engaged five-minute thing.
[03:28:38.960 --> 03:28:41.440]   And there's other stories from other countries.
[03:28:41.440 --> 03:28:43.480]   Like, there's a story in the,
[03:28:43.480 --> 03:28:45.800]   back when the Soviet Union existed,
[03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:47.880]   that they actually would chase these things,
[03:28:47.880 --> 03:28:50.320]   and one of them shot at some, you know, it shot at it,
[03:28:50.320 --> 03:28:51.880]   because they said, "Shoot at it," and it shot at it,
[03:28:51.880 --> 03:28:53.400]   and then it got shot down.
[03:28:53.400 --> 03:28:55.040]   And then they said, "Don't ever shoot at 'em again,
[03:28:55.040 --> 03:28:56.960]   "and don't chase them, just so you can observe them,
[03:28:56.960 --> 03:28:58.520]   "but don't go after them," because obviously,
[03:28:58.520 --> 03:29:00.400]   they have firepower that we can't control,
[03:29:00.400 --> 03:29:02.320]   'cause if you can make something float around
[03:29:02.320 --> 03:29:04.880]   and jam radars at will and do whatever you want,
[03:29:04.880 --> 03:29:07.440]   you know, modern terrestrial weapons
[03:29:07.440 --> 03:29:09.720]   are probably not very useful.
[03:29:09.720 --> 03:29:10.900]   You know, you can go to Independence Day,
[03:29:10.900 --> 03:29:11.960]   they had that force field around.
[03:29:11.960 --> 03:29:14.080]   Oh, we gotta, now you gotta cyber warfare,
[03:29:14.080 --> 03:29:16.120]   you gotta take the bug down, you gotta take the warfare,
[03:29:16.120 --> 03:29:18.920]   so now we can actually inhibit some type of damage.
[03:29:18.920 --> 03:29:21.080]   - So there's a, I mean, you mentioned the Phoenix Flies.
[03:29:21.080 --> 03:29:24.720]   This is somebody on, I think Reddit said,
[03:29:24.720 --> 03:29:27.600]   "Ask him any thoughts on mass UFO sightings
[03:29:27.600 --> 03:29:28.680]   "like the Phoenix Flies."
[03:29:28.680 --> 03:29:30.960]   So the interesting thing, like you said,
[03:29:30.960 --> 03:29:32.880]   with the Tic Tac is that multiple people
[03:29:32.880 --> 03:29:34.400]   laid their eyes on this.
[03:29:34.400 --> 03:29:36.200]   What are your thoughts about the Phoenix Flies,
[03:29:36.200 --> 03:29:37.040]   or many people have seen it?
[03:29:37.040 --> 03:29:39.840]   - So here's the deal with massive sightings.
[03:29:39.840 --> 03:29:41.520]   So the Phoenix Flies is unexplainable,
[03:29:41.520 --> 03:29:43.440]   although I know the Air Force had said something about it,
[03:29:43.440 --> 03:29:45.200]   it was an A-10 drop in flares.
[03:29:45.200 --> 03:29:46.040]   I don't think so.
[03:29:46.040 --> 03:29:48.160]   It's the, oh, flares don't burn that long,
[03:29:48.160 --> 03:29:51.560]   they just come out and they detract and they go away.
[03:29:51.560 --> 03:29:53.160]   Although on the other hand, there's,
[03:29:53.160 --> 03:29:54.400]   because clouds can do things.
[03:29:54.400 --> 03:29:58.080]   So I lived in Central California for 18 years,
[03:29:58.080 --> 03:30:00.720]   and you would get, oh my God, what was that in the sky?
[03:30:00.720 --> 03:30:03.400]   And it was really Vandenberg shooting a missile off.
[03:30:03.400 --> 03:30:05.120]   They were doing ICBM tests at one time
[03:30:05.120 --> 03:30:07.360]   where they shoot from Vandenberg and they fly across,
[03:30:07.360 --> 03:30:10.280]   then they go land in the ATOL at Kwajalein.
[03:30:10.280 --> 03:30:11.640]   And then they can check the displacement,
[03:30:11.640 --> 03:30:13.480]   the accuracy and all that stuff.
[03:30:13.480 --> 03:30:16.640]   It's stuff that we do 'cause we're a superpower.
[03:30:16.640 --> 03:30:17.920]   But when you see 'em go up,
[03:30:17.920 --> 03:30:19.440]   especially if you've ever watched a rocket
[03:30:19.440 --> 03:30:20.560]   really launch on a clear night,
[03:30:20.560 --> 03:30:21.720]   it'll have the stream, the glow,
[03:30:21.720 --> 03:30:22.720]   and you can tell it's a rocket.
[03:30:22.720 --> 03:30:24.680]   But if you don't look up until later,
[03:30:24.680 --> 03:30:26.880]   when it starts to get to the outer edge of the atmosphere
[03:30:26.880 --> 03:30:30.320]   where the plume coming out of the engine is not constrained,
[03:30:30.320 --> 03:30:31.640]   but, and you can watch this on TV
[03:30:31.640 --> 03:30:33.320]   when even the SpaceX ones go up,
[03:30:33.320 --> 03:30:34.560]   it's nice and narrow, narrow, narrow,
[03:30:34.560 --> 03:30:36.640]   and then it hits a point where it really starts to go up
[03:30:36.640 --> 03:30:37.680]   and it starts to come to the sides
[03:30:37.680 --> 03:30:39.760]   because the forces aren't holding that
[03:30:39.760 --> 03:30:41.640]   all into one unique thing.
[03:30:41.640 --> 03:30:43.200]   And it looks really odd.
[03:30:43.200 --> 03:30:46.440]   And then it'll go off because it burns out
[03:30:46.440 --> 03:30:47.560]   and you get state separation.
[03:30:47.560 --> 03:30:50.120]   Then you see the next one go off and then it's gone.
[03:30:50.120 --> 03:30:52.240]   And people don't understand that
[03:30:52.240 --> 03:30:53.640]   because they didn't watch it from launch.
[03:30:53.640 --> 03:30:54.840]   'Cause we used to sit in our driveway
[03:30:54.840 --> 03:30:56.840]   and Vandenberg is, it was a three-hour drive,
[03:30:56.840 --> 03:30:57.680]   but you could sit and watch it.
[03:30:57.680 --> 03:30:59.920]   Go in there and launch it at night, you'd watch.
[03:30:59.920 --> 03:31:02.400]   You'd watch and think it's really cool.
[03:31:02.400 --> 03:31:03.320]   If you don't see anything,
[03:31:03.320 --> 03:31:06.040]   what you see is the weird clouds from the exhaust plume,
[03:31:06.040 --> 03:31:08.520]   what's left, the residue that's sitting in the atmosphere
[03:31:08.520 --> 03:31:09.800]   and the wind starts blowing it.
[03:31:09.800 --> 03:31:13.200]   So you get these really kind of weird shapes in the sky.
[03:31:13.200 --> 03:31:14.960]   That's part, but when you go to Phoenix Lights
[03:31:14.960 --> 03:31:17.360]   and you go, "Hey, when a thousand people see something,
[03:31:17.360 --> 03:31:18.920]   "are you gonna discredit all a thousand people
[03:31:18.920 --> 03:31:20.440]   "or are you gonna try and explain it away
[03:31:20.440 --> 03:31:21.720]   "with something else?"
[03:31:21.720 --> 03:31:24.940]   It's a weather balloon.
[03:31:24.940 --> 03:31:27.360]   It's a weather balloon.
[03:31:27.360 --> 03:31:28.880]   - Again, just like the Tic Tac,
[03:31:28.880 --> 03:31:30.760]   I think is just inspiring
[03:31:30.760 --> 03:31:35.800]   for the limitless nature of the science.
[03:31:35.800 --> 03:31:37.400]   - I think more is gonna come out.
[03:31:37.400 --> 03:31:39.560]   I think some of the stuff
[03:31:39.560 --> 03:31:41.880]   that the To The Stars folks have done.
[03:31:41.880 --> 03:31:44.800]   - So there's a To The Stars Academy.
[03:31:44.800 --> 03:31:46.760]   What are your thoughts about them?
[03:31:46.760 --> 03:31:48.560]   - I talk to them quite a bit.
[03:31:48.560 --> 03:31:50.640]   I am not a part of To The Stars Academy.
[03:31:50.640 --> 03:31:55.600]   But I talked to Lou, I just was texting him before this.
[03:31:55.600 --> 03:31:58.000]   - What's their mission?
[03:31:58.000 --> 03:31:58.840]   What's their hope?
[03:31:58.840 --> 03:31:59.660]   What's their--
[03:31:59.660 --> 03:32:04.660]   - When they started, their mission was to try and,
[03:32:04.660 --> 03:32:06.320]   don't look at this as little green men,
[03:32:06.320 --> 03:32:08.800]   but let's look at this as a technology
[03:32:08.800 --> 03:32:11.560]   and let's try and almost reverse engineer
[03:32:11.560 --> 03:32:13.240]   and figure out how these things operate
[03:32:13.240 --> 03:32:17.000]   and how can we explain this from using our knowledge,
[03:32:17.000 --> 03:32:18.120]   physics-based knowledge to go,
[03:32:18.120 --> 03:32:20.000]   "How would something like this operate?"
[03:32:20.000 --> 03:32:21.160]   That's really their bottom line,
[03:32:21.160 --> 03:32:24.400]   was to try and use, and then couple that with,
[03:32:24.400 --> 03:32:27.160]   'cause they've got the series unidentified,
[03:32:27.160 --> 03:32:31.560]   couple that with television to get the word out.
[03:32:31.560 --> 03:32:34.600]   So you're actually putting something instead of,
[03:32:34.600 --> 03:32:36.320]   because everyone has a theory.
[03:32:36.320 --> 03:32:39.320]   Ancient Aliens covers all kinds of theories.
[03:32:39.320 --> 03:32:41.040]   It's kind of off of, "Oh my God."
[03:32:41.040 --> 03:32:42.260]   And I've seen the stuff
[03:32:42.260 --> 03:32:44.840]   and I've seen stuff that I've said taken out of context
[03:32:44.840 --> 03:32:46.940]   on shows that I did not talk to.
[03:32:46.940 --> 03:32:49.680]   So there's all that, because you can take a clip
[03:32:49.680 --> 03:32:51.440]   and go, "Oh, it's this, it's that."
[03:32:51.440 --> 03:32:52.640]   And if I know about stuff,
[03:32:52.640 --> 03:32:54.760]   like you can't technically use my likeness
[03:32:54.760 --> 03:32:56.400]   unless I tell you you can.
[03:32:56.400 --> 03:32:58.000]   So if I haven't signed something, you can't do it.
[03:32:58.000 --> 03:32:59.200]   There was a guy who put something out,
[03:32:59.200 --> 03:33:00.040]   and I was in it and I told him,
[03:33:00.040 --> 03:33:01.680]   "You can take it down and you can talk to lawyers
[03:33:01.680 --> 03:33:04.160]   "because I'm not supporting you."
[03:33:04.160 --> 03:33:05.840]   - So they use it to tell some kind of narrative
[03:33:05.840 --> 03:33:07.680]   that's not connected to reality.
[03:33:07.680 --> 03:33:09.760]   - 'Cause let's face it, if you're making TV shows,
[03:33:09.760 --> 03:33:10.840]   there's two reasons to do it.
[03:33:10.840 --> 03:33:12.220]   One, you wanna get word out,
[03:33:12.220 --> 03:33:15.060]   or two, you wanna make money, or three, both.
[03:33:15.060 --> 03:33:18.020]   And so usually it's, I would say the make money
[03:33:18.020 --> 03:33:20.500]   is probably the biggest thing to put a TV show out.
[03:33:20.500 --> 03:33:22.660]   - And the mission of the To The Stars Academy
[03:33:22.660 --> 03:33:23.820]   is to not do that.
[03:33:23.820 --> 03:33:27.100]   This is to try to get some--
[03:33:27.100 --> 03:33:29.180]   - When I started and I talked to them,
[03:33:29.180 --> 03:33:31.940]   'cause I've talked to Tom and I've talked to Lou,
[03:33:31.940 --> 03:33:33.820]   and those are the two main players,
[03:33:33.820 --> 03:33:37.620]   it was to basically demystify the fact
[03:33:37.620 --> 03:33:41.040]   and get rid of the stigma that's tied to UFOs,
[03:33:41.040 --> 03:33:42.880]   and let's look at it from a science base,
[03:33:42.880 --> 03:33:45.600]   and then use TV to get the word out on the progress.
[03:33:45.600 --> 03:33:47.020]   And they've done some pretty cool things.
[03:33:47.020 --> 03:33:49.560]   I mean, the Italian government gave them
[03:33:49.560 --> 03:33:52.600]   all kinds of files that had been property
[03:33:52.600 --> 03:33:53.440]   of their government.
[03:33:53.440 --> 03:33:56.920]   They got a bunch from, it might have been Argentina,
[03:33:56.920 --> 03:33:58.320]   gave them all kinds of stuff, like,
[03:33:58.320 --> 03:34:00.160]   "Here's all our records, what can you do with it?"
[03:34:00.160 --> 03:34:02.760]   To try and now pull from country-based
[03:34:02.760 --> 03:34:04.500]   to a more global-based research,
[03:34:04.500 --> 03:34:06.320]   which is what you were talking about,
[03:34:06.320 --> 03:34:08.100]   and then using independent scientists
[03:34:08.100 --> 03:34:09.840]   that are not tied to a government,
[03:34:09.840 --> 03:34:10.780]   I mean, any government,
[03:34:10.780 --> 03:34:12.860]   but just using independent research agencies
[03:34:12.860 --> 03:34:14.940]   to start looking at some of the metallurgy,
[03:34:14.940 --> 03:34:15.780]   'cause you go, "Oh, I found this.
[03:34:15.780 --> 03:34:17.100]   "We had this piece of metal, what is it?"
[03:34:17.100 --> 03:34:18.380]   And some of the stuff has been explained.
[03:34:18.380 --> 03:34:20.380]   They've got some objects, artifacts
[03:34:20.380 --> 03:34:21.900]   that have not been explained.
[03:34:21.900 --> 03:34:25.260]   And that's slowly coming out, and I think--
[03:34:25.260 --> 03:34:26.460]   - And your hope is the US government
[03:34:26.460 --> 03:34:27.300]   will release some more things.
[03:34:27.300 --> 03:34:28.820]   - Well, the government, the US government
[03:34:28.820 --> 03:34:30.300]   came out a month ago and said,
[03:34:30.300 --> 03:34:34.220]   "We have material that we cannot explain the origin."
[03:34:34.220 --> 03:34:36.020]   They have said that.
[03:34:36.020 --> 03:34:37.740]   They just haven't released the records
[03:34:37.740 --> 03:34:39.540]   from the Roswell thing, which I keep joking about.
[03:34:39.540 --> 03:34:41.760]   I'm like, "Come on, it's 70-some years old.
[03:34:41.760 --> 03:34:43.480]   "You can classify it, let it out."
[03:34:43.480 --> 03:34:45.260]   - I think you put it beautifully,
[03:34:45.260 --> 03:34:48.640]   that in this time, that will be a heck
[03:34:48.640 --> 03:34:51.080]   of an inspiring, hopeful thing to see.
[03:34:51.080 --> 03:34:53.440]   People don't-- - Just to distract.
[03:34:53.440 --> 03:34:55.520]   - Yeah, the division is, I mean,
[03:34:55.520 --> 03:34:59.960]   nothing will unite us humans, descendants of chimps,
[03:34:59.960 --> 03:35:05.200]   like the idea that there's life out there.
[03:35:05.200 --> 03:35:06.980]   - Oh, it would literally change.
[03:35:06.980 --> 03:35:08.180]   I said this a while ago, I forget,
[03:35:08.180 --> 03:35:10.140]   I think it was the London Sun-Times had called me,
[03:35:10.140 --> 03:35:12.260]   and I said, "Personally, I think this is a global issue.
[03:35:12.260 --> 03:35:13.340]   "It's not."
[03:35:13.340 --> 03:35:14.820]   If there is stuff coming down,
[03:35:14.820 --> 03:35:15.900]   which we're pretty sure there is,
[03:35:15.900 --> 03:35:18.420]   there's enough stuff that we can't explain.
[03:35:18.420 --> 03:35:19.620]   If there is stuff coming down,
[03:35:19.620 --> 03:35:21.140]   then this is not a country-based thing,
[03:35:21.140 --> 03:35:22.340]   and it's not about technology,
[03:35:22.340 --> 03:35:24.800]   and it's not about who's gonna win the next war,
[03:35:24.800 --> 03:35:26.860]   because you don't know what they're doing.
[03:35:26.860 --> 03:35:29.120]   So you got, really, a couple of theories.
[03:35:29.120 --> 03:35:33.460]   One, you've got E.T., or close encounters.
[03:35:33.460 --> 03:35:36.580]   And the other extreme is you've got Independence Day.
[03:35:36.580 --> 03:35:40.620]   Are you gonna prepare and bet on E.T. and close encounters,
[03:35:40.620 --> 03:35:42.360]   or do you actually try and do stuff
[03:35:42.360 --> 03:35:43.660]   in case it is Independence Day,
[03:35:43.660 --> 03:35:45.460]   you actually have a game plan?
[03:35:45.460 --> 03:35:46.980]   And when you get into Independence Day,
[03:35:46.980 --> 03:35:50.920]   that scenario, and I don't like going too much into sci-fi,
[03:35:50.920 --> 03:35:54.640]   but let's just say, in theory, that that becomes a reality.
[03:35:54.640 --> 03:35:59.640]   It's not a U.S., Russia, China, England, France, Spain,
[03:35:59.640 --> 03:36:02.880]   name any country and any continent.
[03:36:02.880 --> 03:36:05.380]   It becomes a global issue.
[03:36:05.380 --> 03:36:07.500]   And the only way you can deny, it's just like Americans.
[03:36:07.500 --> 03:36:10.700]   We all, we're divided.
[03:36:10.700 --> 03:36:11.840]   We've been that way forever.
[03:36:11.840 --> 03:36:13.140]   So if you think we won't get through this,
[03:36:13.140 --> 03:36:13.980]   we'll get through it,
[03:36:13.980 --> 03:36:15.820]   'cause we've had times just like this before.
[03:36:15.820 --> 03:36:17.300]   - Until Nazi Germany pops up.
[03:36:17.300 --> 03:36:18.780]   - But if Nazi Germany pops up,
[03:36:18.780 --> 03:36:21.060]   or someone flies two airplanes into the World Trade Center,
[03:36:21.060 --> 03:36:22.660]   and then all of a sudden, we're all united.
[03:36:22.660 --> 03:36:25.900]   We all also have very, very short memories.
[03:36:25.900 --> 03:36:27.100]   - Yes. - We do.
[03:36:27.100 --> 03:36:27.940]   - Exactly.
[03:36:27.940 --> 03:36:31.020]   - It's when you look and go, well, we can do this,
[03:36:31.020 --> 03:36:34.200]   and you go, no, no, if you think
[03:36:34.200 --> 03:36:37.120]   that everyone on the planet is good,
[03:36:37.120 --> 03:36:41.480]   you need to stop taking the drugs that you're taking.
[03:36:41.480 --> 03:36:42.420]   You know, we said this.
[03:36:42.420 --> 03:36:45.080]   There were people during the rise of Hitler.
[03:36:45.080 --> 03:36:46.920]   No, no, it's okay.
[03:36:46.920 --> 03:36:47.740]   No, no, it's okay.
[03:36:47.740 --> 03:36:48.720]   We're not gonna do, we're not gonna stop.
[03:36:48.720 --> 03:36:50.000]   No, no, it's okay.
[03:36:50.000 --> 03:36:51.280]   No, no, it's okay.
[03:36:51.280 --> 03:36:55.680]   And you gotta think, the only thing that stopped Hitler
[03:36:55.680 --> 03:36:59.120]   was his ego by going into Russia.
[03:36:59.120 --> 03:37:01.720]   If he'd have stuck with the pact with Stalin,
[03:37:01.720 --> 03:37:04.000]   and not went to the East, and had to fight,
[03:37:04.000 --> 03:37:06.860]   and it was really the Russian winner that crushed him,
[03:37:06.860 --> 03:37:10.700]   and he would have put all his high troops to the other side,
[03:37:10.700 --> 03:37:12.580]   there would have been a totally different outcome.
[03:37:12.580 --> 03:37:14.700]   The man in the iron, the man in the high tower,
[03:37:14.700 --> 03:37:15.820]   or whatever, it's a Netflix show,
[03:37:15.820 --> 03:37:17.700]   where Nazi actually wins it.
[03:37:17.700 --> 03:37:20.220]   And you look, you know, we didn't know everything
[03:37:20.220 --> 03:37:22.580]   that was going on, especially the atrocities
[03:37:22.580 --> 03:37:23.900]   with the concentration camps,
[03:37:23.900 --> 03:37:26.180]   and what he was doing to the Jews.
[03:37:26.180 --> 03:37:27.820]   I mean, you look at that going,
[03:37:27.820 --> 03:37:29.180]   if you really wanna see evil,
[03:37:29.180 --> 03:37:30.860]   and then there's the whole side of what Stalin did,
[03:37:30.860 --> 03:37:33.860]   because he actually exterminated more people than Hitler did,
[03:37:33.860 --> 03:37:35.740]   but that never gets the press.
[03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:40.740]   - And the thing is, we forget this history
[03:37:40.740 --> 03:37:41.780]   in our conflicts today.
[03:37:41.780 --> 03:37:44.100]   We forget that there is the nature of evil.
[03:37:44.100 --> 03:37:47.000]   We forget that there's real evil in the world.
[03:37:47.000 --> 03:37:50.460]   And the thing to fight that evil is to be united,
[03:37:50.460 --> 03:37:55.340]   to be both, it's like this interesting line,
[03:37:55.340 --> 03:37:56.940]   like you talked about Joe Rogan,
[03:37:56.940 --> 03:38:01.940]   of being both kind to each other, compassionate, empathetic,
[03:38:01.940 --> 03:38:07.900]   but also being strong and a bad motherfucker
[03:38:07.900 --> 03:38:11.420]   when you need to, to make sure that you,
[03:38:11.420 --> 03:38:14.860]   there's a balance between kindness and force.
[03:38:14.860 --> 03:38:18.420]   - What it is, you use force when force is necessary,
[03:38:18.420 --> 03:38:19.460]   but you don't have to walk around
[03:38:19.460 --> 03:38:20.860]   like Billy Badass all the time.
[03:38:20.860 --> 03:38:23.380]   I mean, some of the toughest people that I grew up with,
[03:38:23.380 --> 03:38:24.980]   that literally could kick the shit out
[03:38:24.980 --> 03:38:26.760]   of whoever came near 'em,
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:28.260]   they never got in fights 'cause one,
[03:38:28.260 --> 03:38:29.420]   even people that didn't know them,
[03:38:29.420 --> 03:38:31.220]   'cause they were actually nice guys.
[03:38:31.220 --> 03:38:35.860]   They were just good dudes, but if you cross them,
[03:38:35.860 --> 03:38:37.580]   like I had a friend of mine,
[03:38:37.580 --> 03:38:40.100]   he's a nationally ranked wrestler,
[03:38:40.100 --> 03:38:41.660]   went to Naval Academy with me.
[03:38:41.660 --> 03:38:43.560]   He's a very, very good friend of mine.
[03:38:43.560 --> 03:38:47.980]   And he is, when you meet him,
[03:38:47.980 --> 03:38:50.060]   and he wrestled at 190 pounds,
[03:38:50.060 --> 03:38:52.380]   and he did not lose a match his senior year
[03:38:52.380 --> 03:38:53.340]   until he went to nationals.
[03:38:53.340 --> 03:38:54.380]   He just had a bad day.
[03:38:54.380 --> 03:38:55.420]   He actually lost to a guy
[03:38:55.420 --> 03:38:57.640]   he had pummeled the shit out of.
[03:38:57.640 --> 03:38:59.120]   And he would cross, it was funny,
[03:38:59.120 --> 03:39:00.560]   we joke about it, even with him,
[03:39:00.560 --> 03:39:02.920]   'cause when you meet him, he's like the nicest local,
[03:39:02.920 --> 03:39:04.640]   hey, hey dude, hey, how you doing?
[03:39:04.640 --> 03:39:05.820]   He's super nice.
[03:39:05.820 --> 03:39:08.820]   He would cross that ring on a wrestling mat.
[03:39:08.820 --> 03:39:11.100]   As soon as he crossed that ring,
[03:39:11.100 --> 03:39:12.680]   it was like a totally different person.
[03:39:12.680 --> 03:39:15.440]   And he would go out there and just destroy people.
[03:39:15.440 --> 03:39:19.600]   I mean, physically destroy, like put a hurt on.
[03:39:19.600 --> 03:39:22.160]   And he would get done, and he's super humble,
[03:39:22.160 --> 03:39:23.320]   and they'd raise his hand,
[03:39:23.320 --> 03:39:25.280]   and he'd have this blank expression.
[03:39:25.280 --> 03:39:27.120]   He'd raise his hand, and he'd walk off,
[03:39:27.120 --> 03:39:28.520]   and as soon as he crossed the line,
[03:39:28.520 --> 03:39:29.720]   he'd look up and smile and go,
[03:39:29.720 --> 03:39:30.980]   hey, hi guys, how you doing?
[03:39:30.980 --> 03:39:32.020]   Like he literally just went
[03:39:32.020 --> 03:39:33.440]   and could rip someone's arms off.
[03:39:33.440 --> 03:39:34.280]   But as soon as he crossed the line,
[03:39:34.280 --> 03:39:35.320]   he was a totally different person.
[03:39:35.320 --> 03:39:37.400]   He's like, and he's that way today.
[03:39:37.400 --> 03:39:39.360]   And man, he wouldn't even tell you he's a wrestler.
[03:39:39.360 --> 03:39:43.760]   - Yeah, that's kind of a symbol of the best of America.
[03:39:43.760 --> 03:39:46.040]   That's what America is, that wrestler.
[03:39:46.040 --> 03:39:49.920]   You cross the line, you can be hard,
[03:39:49.920 --> 03:39:52.420]   but once you're off the mat,
[03:39:52.420 --> 03:39:54.820]   you're just a kind human being.
[03:39:54.820 --> 03:39:55.660]   - Yeah.
[03:39:55.660 --> 03:39:57.140]   - I know you're super humble,
[03:39:57.140 --> 03:40:01.960]   saying it's better to be lucky than good,
[03:40:01.960 --> 03:40:04.980]   but your story is inspiring.
[03:40:04.980 --> 03:40:09.440]   That the entire trajectory of having a dream,
[03:40:09.440 --> 03:40:11.060]   of accomplishing that dream,
[03:40:11.060 --> 03:40:13.560]   of having one hell of a career,
[03:40:13.560 --> 03:40:17.720]   what advice would you give to a young person,
[03:40:17.720 --> 03:40:20.860]   to a young version of yourself today
[03:40:20.860 --> 03:40:23.040]   that listens to this and is inspired,
[03:40:23.040 --> 03:40:27.200]   and wants to fly, or wants to go to space,
[03:40:27.200 --> 03:40:28.320]   and wants to build the rocket?
[03:40:28.320 --> 03:40:30.960]   Is there advice you could give them
[03:40:30.960 --> 03:40:33.880]   about life, about career, about anything?
[03:40:33.880 --> 03:40:35.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[03:40:35.040 --> 03:40:39.720]   First, let me start with,
[03:40:39.720 --> 03:40:42.480]   and you had a question on, inspirational people.
[03:40:42.480 --> 03:40:45.400]   So my grandfather, I had mentioned him earlier,
[03:40:45.400 --> 03:40:48.300]   huge funeral, beer delivery guy,
[03:40:48.300 --> 03:40:51.480]   was delivering beer in the '60s riots
[03:40:51.480 --> 03:40:54.160]   where the guys in the black neighborhoods
[03:40:54.160 --> 03:40:56.160]   where white people didn't go.
[03:40:56.160 --> 03:40:57.280]   And my grandfather's Sicilian,
[03:40:57.280 --> 03:40:58.560]   he was one of the first ones in his family
[03:40:58.560 --> 03:40:59.640]   born in the United States.
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:01.920]   So my great-grandmother, and I had aunts and uncles
[03:41:01.920 --> 03:41:04.560]   that I knew growing up that actually came over on the boat.
[03:41:04.560 --> 03:41:09.400]   Huge, huge guy, and just the nicest, friendliest,
[03:41:09.400 --> 03:41:11.200]   would give you the shirt off his back,
[03:41:11.200 --> 03:41:12.720]   obviously proven by his funeral.
[03:41:12.720 --> 03:41:14.400]   And I'm talking at his funeral,
[03:41:14.400 --> 03:41:16.720]   the head of the Black Panthers was at his funeral
[03:41:16.720 --> 03:41:18.420]   in Toledo, Ohio.
[03:41:18.420 --> 03:41:21.600]   The mafia guys were at his funeral in Toledo, Ohio.
[03:41:21.600 --> 03:41:25.400]   I mean, it was literally a mix of who's who.
[03:41:25.400 --> 03:41:27.260]   And he had told me once,
[03:41:27.260 --> 03:41:28.780]   because when you're little, you start looking.
[03:41:28.780 --> 03:41:30.620]   And I grew up basically,
[03:41:30.620 --> 03:41:32.300]   I was probably middle-class, lower middle-class.
[03:41:32.300 --> 03:41:33.300]   My dad was a fireman.
[03:41:33.300 --> 03:41:34.900]   You're not rich, he's working for the city.
[03:41:34.900 --> 03:41:38.300]   It was a paycheck to paycheck living is how I grew up.
[03:41:38.300 --> 03:41:39.540]   And I was talking to my grandfather one day,
[03:41:39.540 --> 03:41:40.580]   and he said something to me,
[03:41:40.580 --> 03:41:42.220]   and this is literally how I run my life.
[03:41:42.220 --> 03:41:43.860]   He said, it was about money,
[03:41:43.860 --> 03:41:45.180]   'cause you'd see, back in the day,
[03:41:45.180 --> 03:41:47.420]   if you saw someone in a Mercedes, that was rare.
[03:41:47.420 --> 03:41:48.540]   You know, they weren't everywhere.
[03:41:48.540 --> 03:41:49.380]   You know, people didn't,
[03:41:49.380 --> 03:41:51.020]   you couldn't lease a car, you actually bought a car,
[03:41:51.020 --> 03:41:53.620]   and usually you bought a car with cash.
[03:41:53.620 --> 03:41:55.860]   So it was totally different than we are now.
[03:41:55.860 --> 03:41:58.780]   And he said, he goes, you know, David, he goes,
[03:41:58.780 --> 03:41:59.780]   they're no better than you,
[03:41:59.780 --> 03:42:01.620]   and you're no better than anyone else.
[03:42:01.620 --> 03:42:02.740]   He goes, you gotta remember that.
[03:42:02.740 --> 03:42:03.780]   He goes, everyone's different.
[03:42:03.780 --> 03:42:05.580]   He goes, treat everyone with the respect
[03:42:05.580 --> 03:42:07.620]   and dignity that they deserve.
[03:42:07.620 --> 03:42:09.400]   He goes, and if they're poor, if they're homeless,
[03:42:09.400 --> 03:42:11.860]   he goes, it doesn't make them a bad person.
[03:42:11.860 --> 03:42:14.540]   It just, that's who they chose to be.
[03:42:14.540 --> 03:42:16.180]   And you make choices in your life,
[03:42:16.180 --> 03:42:17.740]   but never ever look down on someone,
[03:42:17.740 --> 03:42:19.840]   because, you know, there will always be someone
[03:42:19.840 --> 03:42:20.680]   that will look down on you,
[03:42:20.680 --> 03:42:22.180]   and you should never ever do that.
[03:42:22.180 --> 03:42:23.180]   And I kept that close to me.
[03:42:23.180 --> 03:42:24.580]   He was a huge influence.
[03:42:24.580 --> 03:42:25.880]   He was my mom's dad.
[03:42:25.880 --> 03:42:29.100]   Just a big, big influence in my life,
[03:42:29.100 --> 03:42:30.580]   and the way I carried myself.
[03:42:30.580 --> 03:42:34.420]   And he was one that would say, you know,
[03:42:34.420 --> 03:42:36.300]   you can be anything you wanna be.
[03:42:36.300 --> 03:42:38.620]   You know, he grew up dirt poor, you know,
[03:42:38.620 --> 03:42:40.540]   and the fact that he had bought a house
[03:42:40.540 --> 03:42:42.060]   and took good care of my grandmother
[03:42:42.060 --> 03:42:43.640]   and did stuff like that, you know,
[03:42:43.640 --> 03:42:45.580]   to him, that was a success.
[03:42:45.580 --> 03:42:46.660]   And to me, it was always, you know,
[03:42:46.660 --> 03:42:48.580]   trying to better and move on.
[03:42:48.580 --> 03:42:50.080]   And he was the one, you know,
[03:42:50.080 --> 03:42:52.380]   my parents were a big part of this too,
[03:42:52.380 --> 03:42:54.540]   was instilling that, that anything is possible.
[03:42:54.540 --> 03:42:58.540]   So when I'm four years and 11 months old in 1969,
[03:42:58.540 --> 03:43:00.860]   you know, and I'm watching Neil Armstrong walk on the moon,
[03:43:00.860 --> 03:43:02.260]   and I'm asking my mom, and she says,
[03:43:02.260 --> 03:43:03.820]   well, they were all military pilots,
[03:43:03.820 --> 03:43:05.300]   and, you know, we had an international guard
[03:43:05.300 --> 03:43:08.140]   that at the time was flying F-100, so I'm dating myself.
[03:43:08.140 --> 03:43:11.180]   And I was just fascinated with flight,
[03:43:11.180 --> 03:43:12.300]   and I just looked at that going,
[03:43:12.300 --> 03:43:13.260]   that's really what I wanna do.
[03:43:13.260 --> 03:43:14.380]   And I never lost sight of that.
[03:43:14.380 --> 03:43:16.220]   There was always, oh, I could do this or do that.
[03:43:16.220 --> 03:43:17.940]   And when I was gonna go to college,
[03:43:17.940 --> 03:43:19.580]   before I enlisted in the Marine Corps,
[03:43:19.580 --> 03:43:22.460]   I was accepted into Natural Resources at Ohio State.
[03:43:22.460 --> 03:43:24.140]   And I'm like, ah, if I can't fly,
[03:43:24.140 --> 03:43:25.180]   I'll go be a forest ranger,
[03:43:25.180 --> 03:43:26.000]   'cause I wanted to hang out
[03:43:26.000 --> 03:43:28.340]   in one of those towers in Colorado and look for fires,
[03:43:28.340 --> 03:43:30.780]   'cause that's just, I like that stuff.
[03:43:30.780 --> 03:43:32.220]   You know, it was that or be an oceanographer,
[03:43:32.220 --> 03:43:33.880]   because I was fascinated with Jacques Cousteau.
[03:43:33.880 --> 03:43:35.020]   And actually, that's my degree.
[03:43:35.020 --> 03:43:36.700]   My undergrad degree is Jacques Cousteau.
[03:43:36.700 --> 03:43:39.300]   So influences are Neil Armstrong and Jacques Cousteau.
[03:43:39.300 --> 03:43:40.860]   I have an oceanography degree.
[03:43:40.860 --> 03:43:43.200]   I got an MBA from University of Houston, go Cougs,
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:44.040]   gotta mention 'em.
[03:43:44.040 --> 03:43:47.140]   And then, so you look and people go,
[03:43:47.140 --> 03:43:48.300]   what are you gonna do with that?
[03:43:48.300 --> 03:43:50.740]   And I said, you know, I got an oceanography degree,
[03:43:50.740 --> 03:43:52.180]   'cause I go, well, I'm gonna sail on the ocean,
[03:43:52.180 --> 03:43:54.860]   so at least if the ship sinks, I'll know where I'm at.
[03:43:54.860 --> 03:43:56.460]   And that was kind of a running joke.
[03:43:56.460 --> 03:43:57.300]   And then--
[03:43:57.300 --> 03:44:00.620]   - And then so these passions and underneath it
[03:44:00.620 --> 03:44:03.980]   is the belief that you can be anything you wanna be.
[03:44:03.980 --> 03:44:04.820]   - You can.
[03:44:04.820 --> 03:44:06.580]   You know, I told my kids this, you know,
[03:44:06.580 --> 03:44:07.780]   when they were young.
[03:44:07.780 --> 03:44:09.460]   You know, it was tough, especially for my son.
[03:44:09.460 --> 03:44:10.940]   So when Nate was about five, six years,
[03:44:10.940 --> 03:44:12.520]   we knew Nate was colorblind.
[03:44:12.520 --> 03:44:15.400]   You know, my wife's brothers are both colorblind.
[03:44:15.400 --> 03:44:16.420]   It's really color deprived.
[03:44:16.420 --> 03:44:17.980]   Colorblind, you see black and white.
[03:44:17.980 --> 03:44:20.700]   He can't tell, he has issues with greens, reds, browns.
[03:44:20.700 --> 03:44:23.100]   It's funny if you're ever around someone like that,
[03:44:23.100 --> 03:44:24.300]   'cause he'll go, I'll go, what are you looking at?
[03:44:24.300 --> 03:44:25.420]   He goes, right over there by the red thing.
[03:44:25.420 --> 03:44:27.300]   I'm like, what are you looking at?
[03:44:27.300 --> 03:44:28.140]   I go, this?
[03:44:28.140 --> 03:44:28.980]   I'm like, he had a hat on one day.
[03:44:28.980 --> 03:44:29.800]   I go, which one are you getting?
[03:44:29.800 --> 03:44:31.140]   He had a hat in his hand, it was green.
[03:44:31.140 --> 03:44:32.100]   He goes, I'm gonna get the green one.
[03:44:32.100 --> 03:44:33.020]   I go, oh, this one right here.
[03:44:33.020 --> 03:44:33.900]   He goes, no, the one on my head.
[03:44:33.900 --> 03:44:34.940]   I go, Nate, that one's brown.
[03:44:34.940 --> 03:44:37.140]   He's like, leave me alone, Dad.
[03:44:37.140 --> 03:44:40.200]   He got the brown hat, 'cause to him it looked green.
[03:44:40.200 --> 03:44:41.600]   So he couldn't fly.
[03:44:41.600 --> 03:44:43.120]   He came to me, he said, I go, what do you wanna do, Nate?
[03:44:43.120 --> 03:44:44.120]   You know, you're talking to your kids,
[03:44:44.120 --> 03:44:44.960]   and what do you wanna do?
[03:44:44.960 --> 03:44:45.800]   He goes, I wanna be a pilot.
[03:44:45.800 --> 03:44:48.100]   Now I gotta tell him, 'cause he's looking at me,
[03:44:48.100 --> 03:44:50.640]   'cause I'm a pilot, dude, you can't be a pilot.
[03:44:50.640 --> 03:44:51.960]   He's like, why can't I be a pilot?
[03:44:51.960 --> 03:44:54.840]   I said, because you got eye issues.
[03:44:54.840 --> 03:44:56.520]   You know, so you gotta redirect.
[03:44:56.520 --> 03:44:58.920]   And the other one was, because I stopped flying,
[03:44:58.920 --> 03:45:01.240]   I was 42 years old, and I was like,
[03:45:01.240 --> 03:45:02.400]   and it was my childhood dream.
[03:45:02.400 --> 03:45:03.560]   So it's like a pro athlete.
[03:45:03.560 --> 03:45:05.240]   I know exactly what it feels like
[03:45:05.240 --> 03:45:08.300]   when Brett Favre has to walk away from the NFL
[03:45:08.300 --> 03:45:09.780]   when you still can do it.
[03:45:09.780 --> 03:45:11.340]   - Good choice of quarterback, by the way.
[03:45:11.340 --> 03:45:12.780]   The greatest of all time, but whatever.
[03:45:12.780 --> 03:45:16.180]   - So you do, and you look at it, and you go,
[03:45:16.180 --> 03:45:17.660]   I understand what those guys feel like
[03:45:17.660 --> 03:45:19.180]   when you have to walk away from something that you love
[03:45:19.180 --> 03:45:20.880]   and you think you can still do it.
[03:45:20.880 --> 03:45:24.500]   So I told them, I said, look,
[03:45:24.500 --> 03:45:25.820]   I was talking to both of my kids, and I said,
[03:45:25.820 --> 03:45:29.700]   you know, find something that you wanna do,
[03:45:29.700 --> 03:45:33.500]   that you love to do, and that you can do your whole life.
[03:45:33.500 --> 03:45:37.400]   And you should be able to do good things for other people.
[03:45:37.400 --> 03:45:39.760]   You wanna be able to help other people.
[03:45:39.760 --> 03:45:40.600]   That's what I said.
[03:45:40.600 --> 03:45:43.800]   So both of my kids, and there's no one in my family,
[03:45:43.800 --> 03:45:45.720]   both of my children, one of them is,
[03:45:45.720 --> 03:45:48.160]   my daughter is a doctor doing a residency
[03:45:48.160 --> 03:45:49.800]   in internal medicine right now,
[03:45:49.800 --> 03:45:52.080]   and my son is in his third year.
[03:45:52.080 --> 03:45:53.720]   And they're both gonna be doctors.
[03:45:53.720 --> 03:45:55.520]   And so I look at it as, you know,
[03:45:55.520 --> 03:45:56.680]   people go, oh, you got two doctors.
[03:45:56.680 --> 03:45:57.500]   I don't care.
[03:45:57.500 --> 03:45:59.400]   I told my kids, if you wanna be a garbage man,
[03:45:59.400 --> 03:46:01.280]   or you wanna dig ditches, I don't care.
[03:46:01.280 --> 03:46:04.620]   Just be the best ditch digger that you can be.
[03:46:04.620 --> 03:46:05.780]   I said, and be happy doing it,
[03:46:05.780 --> 03:46:07.860]   because what you also find is that
[03:46:07.860 --> 03:46:09.740]   we are in this big pursuit of money, money, money, money,
[03:46:09.740 --> 03:46:10.580]   money, money, money.
[03:46:10.580 --> 03:46:11.980]   That's what makes the world go round.
[03:46:11.980 --> 03:46:14.260]   But what you realize, and I'll go back to my grandfather,
[03:46:14.260 --> 03:46:16.140]   who didn't have a lot of money,
[03:46:16.140 --> 03:46:18.300]   and he was probably one of the most happy people on life.
[03:46:18.300 --> 03:46:20.380]   And unfortunately, he died at 65.
[03:46:20.380 --> 03:46:21.620]   He had a massive heart attack,
[03:46:21.620 --> 03:46:23.140]   because he didn't tell that,
[03:46:23.140 --> 03:46:24.660]   he kind of knew it was happening,
[03:46:24.660 --> 03:46:26.860]   and he just made the choice to do it.
[03:46:26.860 --> 03:46:29.060]   And it was devastating to the entire family.
[03:46:29.900 --> 03:46:32.160]   But he didn't have a lot of money.
[03:46:32.160 --> 03:46:33.000]   But I'll tell you what,
[03:46:33.000 --> 03:46:34.560]   I know a lot of rich people who have funerals,
[03:46:34.560 --> 03:46:36.440]   and there's nobody at 'em.
[03:46:36.440 --> 03:46:39.040]   And my grandfather, who's a beer delivery guy, had,
[03:46:39.040 --> 03:46:42.160]   literally, it was like three miles long.
[03:46:42.160 --> 03:46:43.440]   - The Pope. - It was crazy.
[03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:44.280]   Yeah, who died the Pope?
[03:46:44.280 --> 03:46:45.600]   That was 'cause it was like, hey, he's a Catholic.
[03:46:45.600 --> 03:46:46.560]   He's just Italian.
[03:46:46.560 --> 03:46:48.440]   He goes, who died, the Pope?
[03:46:48.440 --> 03:46:49.720]   And I go, no, that was my grandfather.
[03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:52.820]   And then the next funeral I went to was my aunt, his sister,
[03:46:52.820 --> 03:46:54.440]   and there was like 30 people.
[03:46:54.440 --> 03:46:55.800]   And I looked at my mother, and I said,
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:46:57.240]   where's everybody at?
[03:46:57.240 --> 03:47:00.380]   She goes, oh, no, this is normal.
[03:47:00.380 --> 03:47:02.540]   This is what a normal funeral looks like.
[03:47:02.540 --> 03:47:07.540]   So for young kids, bottom line, one, be nice.
[03:47:07.540 --> 03:47:10.340]   Kindness will get you, I'm a big believer in karma.
[03:47:10.340 --> 03:47:12.600]   Kindness will get you a long way in the world.
[03:47:12.600 --> 03:47:15.660]   It's easy to be nice.
[03:47:15.660 --> 03:47:17.580]   It doesn't cost you anything.
[03:47:17.580 --> 03:47:19.740]   I said, and get rid of the hate.
[03:47:19.740 --> 03:47:22.140]   And number two is, follow your dreams.
[03:47:22.140 --> 03:47:23.660]   Because everyone is capable of everything.
[03:47:23.660 --> 03:47:25.020]   And there's a self-realism.
[03:47:25.020 --> 03:47:27.880]   Like, if you really have trouble with math,
[03:47:27.880 --> 03:47:29.480]   getting a PhD in applied math
[03:47:29.480 --> 03:47:32.080]   is probably not something you're going to be able to do.
[03:47:32.080 --> 03:47:35.240]   But understand yourself what your own capabilities are,
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:36.280]   and you know inside your heart.
[03:47:36.280 --> 03:47:38.400]   Don't let anyone ever tell you what you can and can't do.
[03:47:38.400 --> 03:47:40.360]   You have to determine that yourself.
[03:47:40.360 --> 03:47:41.280]   And go for it.
[03:47:41.280 --> 03:47:43.640]   And you can do anything.
[03:47:43.640 --> 03:47:46.920]   It's just, it's a great, the world's incredible.
[03:47:46.920 --> 03:47:48.240]   It really is.
[03:47:48.240 --> 03:47:52.460]   - Let me ask the last big, ridiculous question.
[03:47:52.460 --> 03:47:55.880]   So you've lived much of your life,
[03:47:55.880 --> 03:47:59.280]   your career is kind of at the edge of life and death.
[03:47:59.280 --> 03:48:04.280]   So, let me ask kind of several different ways,
[03:48:04.280 --> 03:48:05.960]   the same kind of question.
[03:48:05.960 --> 03:48:10.720]   One, do you, have you pondered your mortality,
[03:48:10.720 --> 03:48:12.520]   the finiteness of it?
[03:48:12.520 --> 03:48:14.560]   And the bigger question to ask,
[03:48:14.560 --> 03:48:19.560]   even in the context of your tic-tac encounter,
[03:48:21.340 --> 03:48:24.200]   is what do you think is the meaning of this
[03:48:24.200 --> 03:48:25.680]   thing we got going on here?
[03:48:25.680 --> 03:48:28.700]   The meaning of life, human life, in this sense?
[03:48:28.700 --> 03:48:33.640]   - So let me start with, have I pondered my own mortality?
[03:48:33.640 --> 03:48:35.380]   Yes, quite often.
[03:48:35.380 --> 03:48:39.620]   And I don't get into my religious beliefs or what I am,
[03:48:39.620 --> 03:48:42.580]   but I will tell you that I do believe in God.
[03:48:42.580 --> 03:48:44.600]   I've just seen too many things in the world
[03:48:44.600 --> 03:48:46.560]   that I can't explain.
[03:48:46.560 --> 03:48:48.520]   And some people will explain it by subconscious.
[03:48:48.520 --> 03:48:49.400]   So I'll give you a story,
[03:48:49.400 --> 03:48:50.880]   and this kind of puts in the thing of,
[03:48:50.880 --> 03:48:52.720]   do I fear death?
[03:48:52.720 --> 03:48:54.760]   So I had a good friend of mine that I used to fly with.
[03:48:54.760 --> 03:48:56.120]   We were stationed in Japan together,
[03:48:56.120 --> 03:48:58.720]   and Japan had this incinerator
[03:48:58.720 --> 03:49:00.360]   that put all kinds of dioxins.
[03:49:00.360 --> 03:49:01.720]   So there's a real high cancer rate
[03:49:01.720 --> 03:49:04.620]   for those that served on the base in Atsuki, Japan.
[03:49:04.620 --> 03:49:09.500]   Him and his wife had one son,
[03:49:09.500 --> 03:49:11.600]   and their son passed away
[03:49:11.600 --> 03:49:13.680]   just before his 18th birthday of cancer.
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:18.300]   And I was hanging out with, I'll call him John,
[03:49:18.300 --> 03:49:19.800]   and I was hanging out with John.
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:20.660]   We were in oil and gas.
[03:49:20.660 --> 03:49:21.840]   He had come to the same company,
[03:49:21.840 --> 03:49:24.320]   and we were doing an event together.
[03:49:24.320 --> 03:49:25.560]   And he was opening up to me,
[03:49:25.560 --> 03:49:27.080]   'cause we were actually the demo pilots.
[03:49:27.080 --> 03:49:29.920]   We do the demonstration for air shows and stuff.
[03:49:29.920 --> 03:49:32.520]   And him and I were sitting there talking,
[03:49:32.520 --> 03:49:36.200]   and he was giving me the whole story
[03:49:36.200 --> 03:49:39.400]   and how it really changed his look on life,
[03:49:39.400 --> 03:49:41.160]   that we're only here for a finite time
[03:49:41.160 --> 03:49:42.960]   and that we're all going to die.
[03:49:42.960 --> 03:49:44.600]   Well, unfortunately, after all that,
[03:49:44.600 --> 03:49:45.640]   when it was really going,
[03:49:45.640 --> 03:49:48.300]   him and his wife had moved to a location
[03:49:48.300 --> 03:49:50.520]   that would fit there close to the water
[03:49:50.520 --> 03:49:52.880]   where they could do stuff, and I won't say where.
[03:49:52.880 --> 03:49:55.200]   And he was doing what he loved to do,
[03:49:55.200 --> 03:49:57.400]   and he got diagnosed with throat cancer.
[03:49:57.400 --> 03:50:01.720]   And I was talking to him,
[03:50:01.720 --> 03:50:05.780]   it was probably about maybe two months before he died.
[03:50:05.780 --> 03:50:11.480]   And I said, "Dude, you're sad.
[03:50:11.480 --> 03:50:13.360]   "I mean, this is your friend."
[03:50:13.360 --> 03:50:15.000]   And I'm kind of really bummed out.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:18.080]   And this is the guy, this is a guy that's dying of cancer.
[03:50:18.080 --> 03:50:19.040]   And here's what he tells me.
[03:50:19.040 --> 03:50:23.360]   He says, "Dave, dude, we're all gonna die."
[03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:25.340]   He goes, "But I have to look at it.
[03:50:25.340 --> 03:50:28.360]   "I have to make the best of the time that I have."
[03:50:28.360 --> 03:50:30.360]   And I said, "I understand that."
[03:50:30.360 --> 03:50:32.380]   And he goes, "With the exception
[03:50:32.380 --> 03:50:36.040]   "of not being with my wife, who he loved dearly."
[03:50:36.040 --> 03:50:39.320]   He goes, "I'm okay with dying.
[03:50:39.320 --> 03:50:41.020]   "I've had a really good life."
[03:50:41.020 --> 03:50:47.960]   'Cause actually the original announcement
[03:50:47.960 --> 03:50:50.240]   when he finally passed away, a buddy of mine called me,
[03:50:50.240 --> 03:50:51.280]   'cause I don't do Facebook,
[03:50:51.280 --> 03:50:54.680]   and his wife had put it on Facebook that he had passed.
[03:50:54.680 --> 03:50:57.460]   And about the day before he died,
[03:50:57.460 --> 03:51:00.200]   for some reason I was thinking about him.
[03:51:00.200 --> 03:51:03.760]   And I had a dream, or I think it was a dream,
[03:51:03.760 --> 03:51:06.200]   or an altered reality, you can get into whatever.
[03:51:06.200 --> 03:51:09.920]   But he was there, it was just him and I.
[03:51:09.920 --> 03:51:13.440]   And I was really sad in the dream.
[03:51:13.440 --> 03:51:15.240]   I was actually crying, and he was there.
[03:51:15.240 --> 03:51:17.920]   And he was actually in his uniform, he was in his whites,
[03:51:17.920 --> 03:51:19.440]   'cause he was a Navy.
[03:51:19.440 --> 03:51:20.920]   And we were just talking, and he looked at me,
[03:51:20.920 --> 03:51:22.560]   and he said, "And this isn't my dream."
[03:51:22.560 --> 03:51:25.480]   He's like, "Dave, it's all gonna be okay."
[03:51:25.480 --> 03:51:28.560]   And this is a vivid conversation I have,
[03:51:28.560 --> 03:51:31.480]   and people are gonna think I'm weird about this.
[03:51:31.480 --> 03:51:33.360]   But I know what my dream was,
[03:51:33.360 --> 03:51:36.120]   and maybe it's my subconscious creating the dream.
[03:51:36.120 --> 03:51:38.160]   But in reality, to me, this was real,
[03:51:38.160 --> 03:51:39.920]   that it was put there for a reason.
[03:51:39.920 --> 03:51:42.640]   And he basically explained everything.
[03:51:42.640 --> 03:51:45.960]   It's okay, I'm gonna be fine, my wife is fine.
[03:51:45.960 --> 03:51:49.320]   And he goes, "This is what's meant to be."
[03:51:49.320 --> 03:51:50.720]   But the bottom line was,
[03:51:50.720 --> 03:51:52.480]   "Make use of every day that you have,
[03:51:52.480 --> 03:51:54.400]   "because you don't know."
[03:51:54.400 --> 03:51:57.200]   And literally two days later, I find out that he passed.
[03:51:57.200 --> 03:52:04.040]   - But ultimately, he accepted the finiteness of it.
[03:52:04.040 --> 03:52:05.680]   - He did, well, you have to.
[03:52:05.680 --> 03:52:07.480]   And it's like I talk about money,
[03:52:07.480 --> 03:52:09.160]   and job position, and this and that.
[03:52:09.160 --> 03:52:11.560]   And I said, "You can go to a company."
[03:52:11.560 --> 03:52:13.360]   Just remember, when you wanna be a VP of a company,
[03:52:13.360 --> 03:52:15.020]   you sell your soul to the company.
[03:52:15.020 --> 03:52:16.400]   You have to.
[03:52:16.400 --> 03:52:18.640]   I said, "If you look," I joke with people at work,
[03:52:18.640 --> 03:52:20.640]   and I said, "You know, when you ever think
[03:52:20.640 --> 03:52:22.320]   "that you're important, or this guy has that,"
[03:52:22.320 --> 03:52:25.320]   I said, "When you're sitting on 93 or 95, 128,
[03:52:25.320 --> 03:52:27.060]   "and you're sitting in traffic, and we're stopped."
[03:52:27.060 --> 03:52:28.680]   Which doesn't happen right now 'cause of COVID,
[03:52:28.680 --> 03:52:30.520]   but normally it's bumper to bumper,
[03:52:30.520 --> 03:52:31.360]   and you're sitting there,
[03:52:31.360 --> 03:52:33.480]   like I was coming down here by the gas tank.
[03:52:33.480 --> 03:52:36.800]   When you're sitting there, look left and look right.
[03:52:36.800 --> 03:52:38.920]   You know, and there can be a Lamborghini,
[03:52:38.920 --> 03:52:41.560]   or an S550 Mercedes, and on the other side,
[03:52:41.560 --> 03:52:43.580]   there could be some piece of crap car.
[03:52:44.680 --> 03:52:47.480]   We're all sitting on the same freeway at the same time,
[03:52:47.480 --> 03:52:48.780]   trying to do the same thing,
[03:52:48.780 --> 03:52:51.420]   which is just get home so we can be with our family.
[03:52:51.420 --> 03:52:54.360]   'Cause the most important thing that we have,
[03:52:54.360 --> 03:52:57.420]   it ain't money, it ain't our job, it's not our position.
[03:52:57.420 --> 03:52:59.120]   I go, 'cause when it's all said and done,
[03:52:59.120 --> 03:53:01.900]   you could be, you know, you can be,
[03:53:01.900 --> 03:53:04.340]   with the exception of the presidents of the United States,
[03:53:04.340 --> 03:53:07.020]   I mean, name the vice presidents.
[03:53:07.020 --> 03:53:08.460]   Most people can't.
[03:53:08.460 --> 03:53:10.400]   And eventually, they're going to die.
[03:53:10.400 --> 03:53:12.500]   Or eventually, you're gonna see a statue of a guy
[03:53:12.500 --> 03:53:14.420]   from the 1700s in the Boston area,
[03:53:14.420 --> 03:53:17.060]   and you're gonna go, I don't even know who that guy was.
[03:53:17.060 --> 03:53:18.140]   Did he impact my life?
[03:53:18.140 --> 03:53:18.960]   He probably did.
[03:53:18.960 --> 03:53:21.180]   But eventually, people forget.
[03:53:21.180 --> 03:53:23.140]   You realize what's important now,
[03:53:23.140 --> 03:53:25.420]   and the one thing that you have
[03:53:25.420 --> 03:53:29.460]   is your family and your close friends, and that's it.
[03:53:29.460 --> 03:53:31.300]   You can take all the money or everything else,
[03:53:31.300 --> 03:53:33.020]   if you're down on your luck, you know,
[03:53:33.020 --> 03:53:34.460]   who is gonna be, we always just joke,
[03:53:34.460 --> 03:53:36.140]   who are your true friends?
[03:53:36.140 --> 03:53:38.400]   It's the person, well, there's ones that I won't say,
[03:53:38.400 --> 03:53:40.620]   but you know, hey, you're broke down on a road
[03:53:40.620 --> 03:53:41.860]   in the middle of nowhere,
[03:53:41.860 --> 03:53:43.120]   and it's three o'clock in the morning.
[03:53:43.120 --> 03:53:44.620]   Who you gonna call is gonna get in their car
[03:53:44.620 --> 03:53:46.900]   without complaining and come and get you.
[03:53:46.900 --> 03:53:47.860]   - And that's life.
[03:53:47.860 --> 03:53:48.980]   Those-- - That is life.
[03:53:48.980 --> 03:53:50.820]   - The people you love.
[03:53:50.820 --> 03:53:53.380]   - It's the people you truly care about.
[03:53:53.380 --> 03:53:54.900]   And contrary to, I have, you know,
[03:53:54.900 --> 03:53:57.980]   oh my God, I got 6,000 Facebook friends.
[03:53:57.980 --> 03:53:59.940]   You got about that many real friends
[03:53:59.940 --> 03:54:01.820]   that you can count on, and that's it.
[03:54:01.820 --> 03:54:03.180]   - Everything else doesn't matter.
[03:54:03.180 --> 03:54:04.340]   - No, it doesn't matter.
[03:54:04.340 --> 03:54:05.240]   It doesn't mean you're not gonna be nice.
[03:54:05.240 --> 03:54:06.780]   I mean, I have, there's acquaintance friends
[03:54:06.780 --> 03:54:07.780]   that I'll do anything for,
[03:54:07.780 --> 03:54:09.060]   and they can come to my house and stuff,
[03:54:09.060 --> 03:54:11.060]   but then there's the people that, you know,
[03:54:11.060 --> 03:54:15.220]   like my cousins who are like my brothers that, you know,
[03:54:15.220 --> 03:54:17.740]   at a moment's notice, you know,
[03:54:17.740 --> 03:54:21.940]   when my uncle passed away at a young age, you know,
[03:54:21.940 --> 03:54:24.380]   who lived literally right down the street from me,
[03:54:24.380 --> 03:54:26.740]   and my cousin Chad, and I got two boys,
[03:54:26.740 --> 03:54:28.540]   there's 14 of us, but there's only two boys.
[03:54:28.540 --> 03:54:29.600]   There's three of us together.
[03:54:29.600 --> 03:54:30.980]   And we all grew up in the same neighborhood,
[03:54:30.980 --> 03:54:34.020]   same schools, played football together, all that.
[03:54:34.020 --> 03:54:37.020]   I said, if one of those, if Ray or Chad ever needs me,
[03:54:37.020 --> 03:54:38.820]   if something happens, like when my uncle died,
[03:54:38.820 --> 03:54:41.460]   it wasn't an issue if I'm coming home.
[03:54:41.460 --> 03:54:42.620]   It's I'm booking the ticket
[03:54:42.620 --> 03:54:44.060]   and I don't give a shit what it costs
[03:54:44.060 --> 03:54:47.500]   because I will be there to be there with you.
[03:54:47.500 --> 03:54:49.740]   And then those two guys,
[03:54:49.740 --> 03:54:51.500]   and my college roommate is another one
[03:54:51.500 --> 03:54:55.020]   that I'm very, very close with, you know,
[03:54:55.020 --> 03:54:59.380]   I have a handful of people that, you know,
[03:54:59.380 --> 03:55:01.180]   I will drop literally everything,
[03:55:01.180 --> 03:55:03.660]   even if my wife would be pissed at me at times.
[03:55:03.660 --> 03:55:05.900]   She's like, seriously, I gotta do it.
[03:55:05.900 --> 03:55:08.420]   And now she knows, and it's the same thing with her.
[03:55:08.420 --> 03:55:11.180]   I mean, she knows that there are certain people in her life
[03:55:11.180 --> 03:55:13.340]   that if they really need her and she has to go,
[03:55:13.340 --> 03:55:15.580]   she would go and I would let her go.
[03:55:15.580 --> 03:55:17.300]   So.
[03:55:17.300 --> 03:55:19.100]   - Given all that,
[03:55:19.100 --> 03:55:21.820]   I'm honored that you would come here
[03:55:21.820 --> 03:55:24.040]   and talk to me and take the time.
[03:55:24.040 --> 03:55:26.660]   Dave, it was one of the best conversations I've ever had.
[03:55:26.660 --> 03:55:27.500]   Thank you so much.
[03:55:27.500 --> 03:55:28.500]   - It's a pretty long one.
[03:55:28.500 --> 03:55:31.340]   - It's probably sets the record for the longest one.
[03:55:31.340 --> 03:55:35.580]   So I mean, I'm at a loss of words.
[03:55:35.580 --> 03:55:36.820]   One of my favorite conversations.
[03:55:36.820 --> 03:55:38.220]   Thank you so much for talking to me, Dave.
[03:55:38.220 --> 03:55:39.140]   - You're welcome.
