[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.960]   She has been at Vanguard since 2014.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.040]   Today, we'll be discussing Vanguard's economic and market
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.320]   outlook for 2024, a report that was recently published
[00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.680]   and is available to you online.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.080]   So with no further ado, let me introduce Dr. Tian Wang.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.480]   Welcome to the podcast.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.760]   Thank you, Rick, so much.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.880]   First, I would say, great job pronouncing my name,
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.360]   which is not easy.
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.880]   My name, Tian, has the same pronunciation in Chinese
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.880]   as money.
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.920]   Oh, no kidding.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.560]   So Rick, money is coming to your podcast today.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.760]   Well, there we go.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.440]   We hope money comes to all of our listeners as well.
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.800]   Tian, you are on a very powerful team.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.480]   Vanguard's global economics and markets team
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.560]   consists of four PhDs, and you are one.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.440]   And Joe Davis is the global chief economist.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.040]   And you are the Asia-Pacific chief economist
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.480]   and the global head of Vanguard's capital markets
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.040]   model, which we'll get into in a bit.
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.520]   But before we get into this report that you helped publish,
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.400]   I want to ask about your background.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.960]   Tell us a little bit about yourself
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.120]   and how you ended up at Vanguard.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.120]   The true meaning of my name, obviously it's not money,
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.680]   is actually a short name for my hometown.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800]   So if you read Chinese, people can easily
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.040]   tell where I come from.
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.320]   I remember back in early '90s, China just
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.120]   started a market economy.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.360]   Yet in the college, the teacher still taught us Marxism,
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.560]   where only labor, not capital, creates value.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:20.800]   And then I wonder, if capital doesn't create a value,
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.240]   then who's willing to make investment at all?
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.400]   So I remember in 1997, when I graduated from college,
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.040]   I traveled all the way to the US for my graduate study,
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.160]   first in the East Coast, Duke University, go Blue Devil,
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.000]   and then come to the West Coast, Denver, for my PhD.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.240]   So after graduate, I have been working
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.000]   as a professor, a Southside economist,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.400]   Sovereign Wealth Fund.
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.200]   And then eventually, when I come to Vanguard,
[00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.320]   I feel like I found the answer to a lot of my questions.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.160]   So great place to be.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.160]   Well, we're certainly happy to have you.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.880]   And every year, we interview a different economist.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.120]   We've had Joe Davis on a few years ago.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.800]   Last year, we had Ed Yardeni.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.720]   And you are the noted economist this year.
[00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   So again, thank you for joining us.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.280]   Thank you.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.920]   I want to get into your report, which
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.600]   is the Vanguard Economic and Market Outlook for 2024.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.160]   And the byline is a return to sound money.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.920]   So before we get into the meat of the report,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.960]   what do you mean by a return to sound money?
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   By sound money, we are talking about a persistent real interest
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.720]   rate.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.560]   Basically, that means what we have
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.200]   seen, the nominal interest rate, that
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.040]   is going to be higher than inflation.
[00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.640]   This actually, in our view, is the single best
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.520]   financial development over the past two decades.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.040]   It really set the foundation for a solid risk-adjusted return
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.840]   for our long-term investors.
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.240]   By that, do you mean just short-term, like T-bills?
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.800]   Or you're talking about a 10-year treasury?
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.680]   What do you mean by a real rate of return over the inflation
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.520]   rate?
[00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.200]   For all asset classes, we talk about higher interest rate
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.000]   environment.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.920]   Part of the reason is because we feel
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:14.760]   like the risk-free rate, which is determined by our star,
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.600]   the neutral rate.
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.520]   We can talk about that later.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.480]   It's higher.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.840]   Now, you think about it.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.880]   Risk-free rate is the foundation for all asset returns.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.120]   You get the yield for long-duration bond risk return
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:28.640]   plus term premium.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:30.600]   You get the yield for credit.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.000]   You plus credit spread, equity risk premium.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.160]   You get the earnings yield, so equity return.
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.600]   So leaving the price change aside,
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.280]   then higher risk-free rate means you
[00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.800]   get higher expected rate for all asset classes.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.720]   Isn't that good?
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.800]   I think it's good to actually outperform the inflation rate
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.600]   because, of course, we haven't factored in taxes yet.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.360]   To outperform inflation is a good start.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.080]   Central bank has been literally going to zero,
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.120]   or in some places, negative interest rate.
[00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.160]   And that raises a lot of concerns,
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.880]   especially when investors also see a significant fiscal policy
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.840]   expansion.
[00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.360]   That raises a lot of concern about future inflation
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.560]   and also devaluation of fiat currency.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.120]   I think that's one of the reasons why cryptocurrencies
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.200]   start to gain its popularity.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.960]   So now, I think when central banks are exiting
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.160]   those ultra-accommodated monetary policy,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   that together with some kind of more prudent fiscal policy
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.640]   down the road, I think that will restore people's confidence
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:35.120]   in the fiat currency.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.200]   And to me, that's another way to interpret this,
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.480]   the return to sound money.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.320]   Well, it's kind of interesting that you bring up
[00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.600]   cryptocurrencies and this.
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.760]   But I never really thought about it.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.520]   But you're right.
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:50.200]   The fear that monetary policy would cause a devaluation
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.120]   of the dollar--
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.960]   most people who are big followers of cryptocurrencies
[00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:56.800]   believe that this is needed in order to just have
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.640]   a stable currency--
[00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:01.240]   that if the new policy, long term,
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.880]   is to have positive real rates, then that solves the problem.
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:08.480]   The budget deficit, though, how does that
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.680]   work into all of that?
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.760]   How do you maintain real rates above inflation
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:16.880]   when we have such a large budget deficit and it keeps growing?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.080]   Yeah, totally.
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:21.080]   So this is where, when I say the transition into a higher
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.040]   interest rate environment is best
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.880]   a financial development for in the long term.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:29.800]   But I'm also saying that the transition could be very bumpy.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.520]   When everybody is adjusting to that higher interest rate
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:37.600]   environment, for household, saving will be more attractive.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.080]   But for corporate, that also means
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.560]   when you make investment, you're going to be more prudent.
[00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:45.200]   And you need to allocate the resource
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:48.720]   to the most productive, profitable opportunities.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.720]   I think that also has very profound implications
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.400]   for government fiscal policy.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:57.640]   You could have a very vicious cycle
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:00.080]   between higher government budget deficit
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:01.800]   and also higher interest rate.
[00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:03.800]   That would raise a lot of concern
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:06.120]   about fiscal sustainability.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.320]   I think this is one of the questions a lot of people
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.200]   were asking at this moment.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:13.240]   Now, one thing I would say is that Vanguard actually
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.880]   has quite some research there trying
[00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:18.720]   to think about how much can the fiscal expansion
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.480]   go down the road.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.360]   So one of the exercises we did is
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:26.240]   that we tried to calculate the maximum sustainable debt
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.720]   burden for the US.
[00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:31.400]   Because at this moment, the US federal government debt
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:35.080]   is about 100% of GDP by the end of 2022.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.640]   You could say, wow, that's high.
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.880]   Because remember, people always have the 60% number in mind.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:43.320]   That's what European Union said.
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.440]   That's a limit.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:46.200]   But then you think about Japan.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.640]   Japan has government debt at 260% of GDP,
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:51.280]   yet the government's still running.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:55.720]   But Japan has had negative interest rates forever.
[00:08:55.720 --> 00:08:56.560]   Exactly.
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:00.080]   So the maximum sustainable debt burden
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.320]   is actually different across countries,
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:05.120]   really depending on three things.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.080]   One, the maximum primary balance the government
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.160]   is willing to or able to implement.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.720]   Basically, the primary balance of payment,
[00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:16.200]   that means the difference between your revenue
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.840]   and spending, netting out the interest rate payment.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.920]   And then the second is interest rate,
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.360]   as you point out correctly.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.480]   And the third is the country's economic growth in the future.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:30.560]   So Japan, yes, that was sustainable
[00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:31.800]   because of low interest rate.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.640]   But even for Japan, now we are talking
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.760]   about they're going to lift up interest rates down the road.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.080]   So this kind of higher interest rate, higher debt-serving cost
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:44.560]   will make fiscal sustainability into question.
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.080]   We assume that if the US government is
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:52.520]   willing to run our primary budget surplus of 2%,
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:55.920]   and if we follow the CBO, Congress Budget Office,
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:59.920]   forecast of interest rate and economic growth down the road,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:02.720]   then we estimate that maximum sustainable debt GDP
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:06.360]   ratio for the US is actually 225%.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.040]   Don't give them any ideas now.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:08.920]   Come on.
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:09.320]   I know.
[00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:09.800]   I know.
[00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:12.320]   I hope nobody in Washington DC is listening to this.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.600]   But the condition is that they need
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.560]   to run a fiscal surplus of 2% surplus.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.760]   And guess what we are going to do down the road?
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.960]   The CBO office is estimating, projecting
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:31.480]   a deficit of greater than 3% of GDP in coming decade.
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.880]   So the government is going to significantly
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.200]   eat into this fiscal buffer over the coming years.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:40.400]   And the fiscal space, the estimation,
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.040]   is based on some quite favorable projection of interest rate
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.400]   and economic growth.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:48.600]   What if we end up with another severe recession?
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:50.920]   What if the demographic trends worsen?
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.400]   Or what if the investors panic and interest rate
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.440]   grows more than expected?
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.360]   And then in that case, the fiscal space
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.760]   will be much lower.
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.040]   So to us, the rising debt has become
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.400]   an issue that must be tackled by this generation, not the next.
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.240]   So that's where we caution against complacency.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:14.440]   And you mentioned a maximum taxation level.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.520]   And you had done this work on a report.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.560]   And what did you come up with?
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.440]   Well, this is where we think the government,
[00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:24.800]   instead of running the 3% structural deficit,
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:27.400]   persistent fiscal deficit, they have
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:30.440]   to be more prudent with how much they spend
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:33.280]   and also what kind of tax revenue they collect.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.320]   So turning from over 3% deficit into a 2% surplus
[00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.680]   takes a lot of efforts there.
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.760]   So this is where we think either they
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.480]   may want to minimize unproductive spending,
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:49.880]   limiting contingent liability, and make them more targeted,
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.600]   and also increase taxes where the revenue are
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:54.640]   low by international standard.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:56.120]   That should be helpful.
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:58.400]   So overall, I think it's very critical
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:01.880]   to maintain a prudent approach to the government finance
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.520]   down the road.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.160]   Well, we could get into this for hours.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.400]   But we're going to move on to the next level.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.040]   Now, the Fed has two mandates.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.520]   One is to limit inflation.
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.320]   And their target is 2%.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:16.600]   And the other is to maintain low unemployment.
[00:12:16.600 --> 00:12:20.440]   In an era where there was zero interest rate environment
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:22.280]   or negative real interest rate environment,
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:24.080]   it became really hard for the Fed
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.720]   to do anything to stimulate the economy.
[00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:30.280]   Do you feel as though now this has been resolved
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.160]   because we have higher interest rates that Fed policy
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:35.480]   may become more effective?
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:36.600]   So thank you, Rick.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:40.160]   I do think that the transition to a higher interest rate
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:42.360]   actually works well for central banks.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.440]   Because in the case of economic downturn or a recession,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.680]   where you do have GDP contracting, labor market
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.200]   softening, unemployment rates are rising,
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.760]   then the Fed has more room to cut interest
[00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:57.040]   rate to support the economy.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.880]   But I think at this time, one thing we do want to highlight
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.840]   is that we are expecting an economic downturn,
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.160]   a minor recession in the second half of 2024.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.880]   And we do expect the Fed will cut interest rate,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.200]   the Fed fund rate, probably starting in July.
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.040]   But one thing we do want to highlight
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.920]   is that we don't think that it will cut back to zero
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:18.640]   anytime soon this time.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.200]   I think a very important part of that
[00:13:21.200 --> 00:13:23.400]   is indeed because of the r-star.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:24.560]   Neutral rate is higher.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:27.280]   Could you explain what r-star is?
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:28.240]   Yes.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:32.480]   r-star is our equilibrium interest rate level
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.920]   that is consistent with stable growth, full employment,
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:39.080]   and 2% inflation.
[00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:42.680]   So that is a theoretical interest rate level
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:46.120]   that is neither stimulating or restricting economic growth.
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:48.920]   And what level is that, do you believe?
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:53.040]   Yeah, one thing, Rick, is that neutral rate is not observable.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.560]   So you can only infer that from how
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.960]   the economy is faring in the face of monetary policy
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:00.600]   tightening.
[00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.200]   So one thing we will say is that, well, it
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:07.960]   was estimated that before the pandemic,
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:10.480]   during after the GFC period, it was
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:15.760]   estimated that the neutral rate is about 2.5% in nominal terms,
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.200]   2% inflation plus 0.5% real rates.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.280]   And this is a T-bill.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.160]   This is very short-term money.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.680]   Yes, very short-term.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.240]   The fact that after the pandemic in the last several years,
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.560]   that the economy has fared so well
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.400]   in the face of aggressive monetary policy tightening,
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:36.320]   literally 500 base point hike in less than two years,
[00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:40.080]   actually is telling us that the neutral rate, the equilibrium
[00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.880]   interest rate level, should be higher.
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.920]   It should be higher than 2.5 nominally,
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:48.800]   which if the Fed's target is 2% would mean a half a percent.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:50.720]   So you're saying it actually should be higher
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:53.240]   than a half a percent real.
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:53.840]   Yes.
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:57.120]   I think then the next question is, how much higher?
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.640]   That would have been my next question, yes.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:03.680]   So this is where we actually have done our estimation model,
[00:15:03.680 --> 00:15:06.360]   now metrics model, to estimate what
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:09.520]   is exactly the level of the neutral rate at this moment.
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:14.360]   And our model shows us, because of this demographic changes,
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:18.480]   because of this persistent structural deficit,
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:22.520]   fiscal deficit, and also because of higher productivity growth
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:26.360]   down the road, we do see that the neutral rate in the US
[00:15:26.360 --> 00:15:29.800]   nowadays is 100 base points higher than what
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.600]   we have seen in the past.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.680]   We are actually expecting a 3.5% of neutral rate
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.760]   in nominal terms at this moment.
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:42.960]   So at 3.5%, if the Fed gets inflation down to 2%,
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.840]   and you could get 3.5% from a money market,
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:48.240]   and then you have about 10 years,
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:50.640]   and you've got to pick up 1% there as well,
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.520]   so you're at 4.5%, that's going to compete against equities.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.920]   Will it not?
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:15:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.280]   I mean, totally.
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:00.880]   I mean, Rick, this is where we say, at this moment,
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:04.880]   one of the big messages from our paper is that the bond is back.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.280]   Bond is back.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.720]   Yeah, bond is back.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.640]   I think in the past decade, when you have very low yield
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.360]   from the bond market, then essentially, I
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:17.560]   think it's a very tough time for our bond investors.
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.840]   Basically, the only return you get
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.800]   is because of the price changes.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.600]   For bond, you have two components of return.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:28.240]   One is the coupon income, and the other is a price change.
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.000]   When your coupon income is very low or zero,
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:34.240]   then you actually suffer a lot from the volatility
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   in price changes.
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:38.760]   But down the road, what we have, the coupon income return
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.640]   is back.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.520]   I think when you could have, let's say, 4.5%
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:46.200]   from this long-duration bond return,
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:48.000]   the valuation is reasonable.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.280]   That's decent to return from your fixed income portfolio.
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:56.240]   Now, on the other hand, you have equity valuation
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.960]   pretty stretched at this moment, especially in the US market.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.080]   This is where we actually see the US equity market.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.880]   The valuation is currently about 15%
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.200]   above our fair value estimate.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.400]   So given this very compressed equity risk premium,
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:16.960]   we would actually prefer to go into bond,
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:21.360]   go into fixed income portfolio more in a balanced bond equity
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.280]   portfolio.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.840]   We're going to get to the market model.
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:26.400]   But I wanted to continue to move on
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:29.800]   with the implications for a higher interest
[00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:32.920]   rate to consumers.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.000]   Go to buy a car, it's going to cost more money.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.120]   Go to buy a house, mortgage rates are going to be high.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:44.200]   And this is going to drain money from consumers.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:49.800]   And so how did this new regime of higher real rates
[00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.680]   in the long term affect consumer spending?
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:57.120]   Yeah, higher risk obviously will make saving much more
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.080]   attractive for consumers.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.920]   And I think they will also be more discreet in making
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:08.600]   boring decisions as housing, also big ticket items that
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.880]   are often financed with debt becomes more expensive.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:15.880]   So I think this actually will bring consumers
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:19.640]   into a more healthy situation, which is actually
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.360]   going to benefit the economy, make the economy more
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.680]   resilient in the longer term.
[00:18:24.680 --> 00:18:27.320]   Because there would be propensity for people
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.120]   to save more and maybe spend a little less.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.640]   Your forecast for GDP growth, economic growth in the United
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.480]   States, still positive, but much lower
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:43.520]   than it's been, say, even in the last 12 months.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:46.360]   Rick, I think this is where we differentiate
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:50.840]   our more long term outlook with our more near term outlook.
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.240]   When you think about why the economy has
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.120]   stayed so resilient in the face of over 500 base
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:01.760]   points tightening by Fed, consumer, right?
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:05.040]   Consumption spending is one of the very important factors
[00:19:05.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   behind that.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:10.720]   Consumption has been holding up so well in 2023.
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:15.000]   There are several setting factors, fiscal support.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.360]   When you think about a lot of the fiscal support
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:20.240]   during the pandemic to the household, the small business,
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:22.800]   and also the fact that we cannot really
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:24.680]   spend that much during the pandemic.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.560]   And consumers end up with a lot of excess savings.
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:29.720]   And we haven't seen that excess saving
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:32.200]   being exhausted at this moment.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.200]   We'll soon, but not yet.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.800]   And then they also have very healthy balance sheets
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.720]   and leverage on the other side.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:43.920]   Let's compare now to 2008 during the GFC period.
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:49.280]   A lot of the consumer loans at this moment are fixed rated.
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:52.680]   So only 8% of consumer credit at this moment
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:57.400]   is based on variable rate compared to 40% in 2008.
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:20:01.200]   So that actually shelled them from the pain of higher
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:02.120]   interest rate.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.080]   And also more excess saving on their balance
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.800]   sheet means that they don't need to borrow
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:07.120]   that much at this moment.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:09.880]   Plus, labor market is so tight.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:11.880]   Wage growth is pretty decent.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.360]   So all of those actually has supported consumer spending
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.320]   so far.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:21.440]   Now in 2024, what we expect is that some of those offsetting
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:23.200]   factors will fade.
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:26.880]   So we do have excess savings will largely exhausted
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.240]   probably towards the middle of next year.
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.440]   It has already exhausted for low income cohorts of household.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:37.400]   And then some of the fiscal support actually will fade.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:40.840]   And then you also have labor market that will start to cool.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.880]   And also another reason, when you look at the business side,
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:46.960]   I think in the last several years,
[00:20:46.960 --> 00:20:50.520]   we had a lot of industry that financed industry policy
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.560]   from the government.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:54.600]   Actually, that supported a booming pace
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.120]   of investment in the infrastructural and also
[00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:58.560]   construction space.
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:01.960]   Those things are actually supporting the economic growth
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:03.920]   in the past 12, 24 months.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.800]   But the pace could also slow down the road.
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.840]   So this is why we are expecting the economic growth to slow,
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:16.320]   especially when monetary policy finally becomes more restrictive
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:17.520]   when inflation fall.
[00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:19.840]   So in real terms, monetary policy
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:22.640]   will become more restrictive and start to bite.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.560]   So this is where we expect the economy to cool down,
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.560]   labor market to cool.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:30.400]   And then the economy comes into a minor recession
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:31.640]   in the second half.
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:34.040]   I am 65 years old.
[00:21:34.040 --> 00:21:37.040]   I live in an over 55 community with a whole bunch
[00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:42.000]   of people around me who are in their late 50s, 60s, 70s.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:43.680]   People around here are spending money,
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:45.280]   but their homes are paid off.
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:46.680]   They've got money in the bank.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:48.880]   They've got Social Security coming in.
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:52.680]   They've got 401(k)s that have a good amount of money in it.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.000]   They're spending money.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   So these higher interest rates don't
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.640]   affect certain demographics.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.160]   And the boomers are a huge demographic.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.400]   I just see that this will continue for a while
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.400]   until my generation gets older and doesn't
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:09.160]   go on as many vacations.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.280]   How is that affecting the scenario
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.920]   that you just laid out?
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.880]   Rick, I think that's one of the reasons
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:18.720]   we expect the recession to be a pretty mild one.
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:21.560]   The consumer fundamentals is actually--
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:24.400]   the private sector fundamental is pretty resilient,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:25.640]   pretty solid.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.200]   So I think this is where it's very different from 2008
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:33.360]   during the subprime crisis, GFC, when the consumer sector is
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.080]   so highly leveraged.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.800]   And then when you have the subprime crisis,
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:40.520]   this trigger a much deeper downturn
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:43.520]   led by the deleveraging of the private sector.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.760]   Now, I think when you look at what we have right now,
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.680]   especially in the consumer sector, as we just mentioned,
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   balance sheet look pretty solid.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.080]   And then the labor market, what we are expecting
[00:22:55.080 --> 00:22:57.280]   is that because of a structural labor
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:00.760]   shortage in this economy, even in a minor recession,
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.000]   in a recession, we are not expecting the unemployment rate
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.440]   to shoot up significantly.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.520]   In a typical recession, unemployment rate
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.960]   will shoot up to, say, over 6%.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.120]   What do we expect?
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:17.240]   We're expecting 4.8%, like 1% higher than what we have today.
[00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.840]   This is higher than what Fed is expecting.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.280]   But still, it's not a big jump.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:25.600]   So I think overall, those things coming together,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.240]   I think that's helped to explain why the economic downturn
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.760]   and the economic recession will be rather mild.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:35.440]   People will be more prudent when they spend,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.600]   but they probably will continue to spend.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:40.120]   Well, let's look outside the United States,
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:41.760]   the rest of the world.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:45.000]   Are we leading the world, or are we in line with the world,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.680]   or are we behind the rest of the world
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.000]   as far as the recovery from COVID?
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.280]   I mean, I think in the past several years,
[00:23:52.280 --> 00:23:55.000]   the US obviously has been leading
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.920]   the global economic recovery.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:59.400]   I think that's also one of the reasons why the US
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:00.920]   dollar has been so strong.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:03.480]   Because the currency is like a horse race.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.080]   It's not just about how fast you run,
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:08.920]   but also how fast or slow the other horses run.
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.880]   This is what we call the US exceptionalism,
[00:24:11.880 --> 00:24:13.480]   US economy being strong.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.760]   And then that is where we are seeing the currency actually
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.160]   has been strong.
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:21.240]   But I think in 2024, what we are expecting
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:24.960]   is that what we call the fading of US exceptionalism.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:29.000]   In 2023, what do we have in terms of economic growth?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.320]   It's 2.5% to 3%, well above the trend growth
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   that in our estimate is about 1.8%.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:38.120]   So now you think about the US economy
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:43.720]   has been holding so well in 2023 to the very resilient
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.880]   private sector and also a lot of the offsetting factors.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.840]   In fact, in our estimation, we think the US growth
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.480]   could have been 0% growth this year
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.600]   without those offsetting factors.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.560]   But instead, this year what we see
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.760]   is about 2.5% to 3% growth.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.320]   But in 2024, what we expect is a slowdown
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:08.040]   in the US economic growth.
[00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:13.280]   We are actually expecting only about 0.5% growth to 1%
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.800]   in 2024.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:17.520]   And then the rest of the world, the Europe,
[00:25:17.520 --> 00:25:21.240]   will stay muted around 0.5% as well.
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.480]   And then emerging market is actually
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:25.560]   going to hold up pretty well.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:28.080]   In fact, I would say a milder recession from the US
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:30.960]   is probably the second best thing for emerging market.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:33.560]   A recession means Fed will cut interest rate.
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.600]   And then a milder recession means the growth shock
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   won't be too big for emerging market.
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:42.200]   So with US actually slowed down more evidently,
[00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:46.360]   then this is what we call a fading of US exceptionalism.
[00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:50.520]   Probably US is no longer leading the global recovery next year.
[00:25:50.520 --> 00:25:52.960]   Interesting that you said when the Fed cuts,
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:54.680]   the emerging markets benefit.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:56.400]   Could you explain that a little bit more?
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:00.280]   How do the emerging markets benefit when our US Fed cuts?
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:04.400]   So when you think about the link between the emerging market
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:07.360]   economy and the US, emerging market actually
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.760]   face significant the global financial condition.
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:13.920]   That actually will significantly influence emerging market.
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:15.440]   A lot of emerging market actually
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.200]   gets funding, US dollar funding, rely
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.840]   on the international capital flow for their funding.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:27.000]   So when US, the Fed, start to cut, US dollar weaken.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.400]   And risk appetite will start to turn more positive
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   towards more risky asset.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.600]   And that's where money actually will flow back
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.080]   to emerging market.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.800]   This is where emerging market central banks,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:43.120]   they also get more room to cut their own interest rate.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.240]   So that's where I would say they could actually
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.760]   benefit from the Fed cut.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:49.800]   You said that it's been a muddled recovery in Europe
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:52.440]   for several years, and it's going to continue.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.480]   What's holding Europe back?
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.640]   Yeah, there's a lot of structural problem in Europe.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.680]   But it is really about the monetary policy tightening.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:03.040]   The monetary policy tightening is actually
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:05.960]   much more effective in Europe compared to the US,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:09.520]   because they don't really have those offsetting factors.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:12.160]   And also when you think about the monetary policy
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:15.640]   transmission channel in Europe, the European economy
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:19.080]   is much more reliant on the bank credit.
[00:27:19.080 --> 00:27:21.120]   So that is where banks can quickly
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.280]   adjust those interest rates.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:25.400]   So that's where higher interest rate actually
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.000]   bites into the European economy much faster than what
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:30.280]   we've seen in the US.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.200]   And then that's where we see the European economy is already
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:36.400]   flirting with a recession by the end of this year.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:40.720]   So their economic growth was very muted in 2023,
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:44.680]   and also will continue to be muted in 2024.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:48.040]   And plus, they don't have the fiscal policy buffer.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:50.480]   This is very different from the US as well.
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.680]   Fiscal policy has been restrictive in 2023,
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:56.520]   and also in 2024 for Europe.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:59.560]   Well, let's go to the other side of the world
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.280]   and speak to us about China.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:05.560]   Our presidents just got together trying to bring
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:08.360]   in an era of better cooperation.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.080]   It seems as though they need us.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.440]   We need them.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.320]   And so let's talk about our differences.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.200]   That's the way I see it, but you have much better insight.
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.320]   Could you tell us your views on what's
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.960]   going on with China and the US and the relationship,
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.280]   and also China's economy?
[00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:28.800]   Yeah, I mean, Rick, there's a lot of uncertainty
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:33.720]   around the US-China relationship since the 2018 trade war.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:36.120]   I think that's also one of the reasons why
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.240]   the domestic confidence, especially
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:42.480]   among the business person, is pretty low at this moment.
[00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:45.160]   Now, for the US-China relationship,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.000]   I think one thing we have to understand,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.520]   this is a structural issue that cannot be solved overnight
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.120]   or just by a meeting between the two presidents.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.400]   I think there are two reasons for that.
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:00.000]   One is that between the two countries,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.200]   there are so many discrepancies on many fundamental issues,
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:08.640]   like the economic model, the role of the government,
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:11.800]   intellectual property protection, investment,
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.520]   and even many political or geopolitical issues.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:19.880]   And second, I think, let's say, even China, say,
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.360]   continue to make the market reforms or even
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:25.800]   get into political reform, I think
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.320]   the long-term competition between US and China
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.280]   is still unavoidable.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:32.480]   From a historian perspective, there
[00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:34.840]   will always be competition, tension
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:38.480]   between a rising superpower and an existing superpower.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.000]   That's what people call the "suicidist trap."
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.440]   I think the tension between the US-China
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:46.480]   will just continue in coming years and probably decades
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:47.480]   as well.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.840]   Now, of course, I would say G7 realized
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:55.320]   that it may not be realistic or possible to entirely cut
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:59.080]   the economic tie with China, given how much China is
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.880]   actually integrated in the global trade,
[00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:05.040]   the global economy, and increasingly nowadays
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:07.240]   in the global financial system.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:10.840]   So I think that's where they raise the concept to say,
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.960]   it's not about decoupling from China.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.600]   It's de-risking, de-risking.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.160]   So that is a 3C strategy.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.480]   They're going to collaborate in some areas,
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.240]   for example, climate change.
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.680]   They're going to compete in certain areas,
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:26.600]   like technology.
[00:30:26.600 --> 00:30:28.120]   And then they're going to confront
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.240]   in some areas, like human rights and geopolitical issues.
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:35.120]   So I think this will be the strategy down the road.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:36.920]   And it's not going to be surprising
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.680]   that this will have profound implications
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:40.760]   for the whole world.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:45.040]   We are going to see a slower and also more fragmented
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:47.000]   globalization down the road.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:48.960]   We don't think it's de-globalization.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:52.920]   But the pace is going to be slower and more fragmented.
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:56.040]   And this actually will have negative implication
[00:30:56.040 --> 00:30:59.200]   on the resource allocation across the world.
[00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.760]   Think about capital, technology, and talent.
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.720]   So I think this will be a hit on the productivity growth
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.680]   and economic growth everywhere, for everybody.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.680]   - Interesting.
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.280]   Can we talk about Japan?
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:17.440]   There seems to be a renaissance starting in Japan, finally,
[00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:22.440]   since basically the market collapsed in 1990,
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.160]   and it hasn't been back since.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.080]   - Yeah.
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:29.800]   You know, I think Japan has suffered three decades, right?
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.320]   It's not just one lost decade.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:35.200]   It's lost three decades ever since the market collapsed.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.560]   So I think over the past 30 years,
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:40.920]   I think the biggest problem for the Japan economy
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.040]   is actually lack of confidence.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.840]   People don't really see the future.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.360]   Now, one of the thing over the past three years,
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.720]   you know, some people call balance sheet recession.
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.680]   It's basically deleveraging.
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:54.000]   Both household and corporate,
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.760]   they are trying to clean up their balance sheet,
[00:31:56.760 --> 00:32:00.280]   reduce their leverage, their assets.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:03.800]   And then because of this lack of confidence
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.480]   about the future outlook,
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:08.360]   then there is no incentive for people to spend,
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:10.440]   especially when there's deflation,
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:14.280]   and there's no incentive for business to make investment.
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.000]   After all, demographic
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.560]   is one of the very important factor there.
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.960]   By the United Nation estimation,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:24.520]   Japan population will be 40% lower
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:26.120]   by the end of the century.
[00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.040]   - Yes.
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:29.000]   - If you don't really see people,
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.040]   and we know that immigration policy in Japan
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:33.600]   has been more strict,
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:36.280]   then who are you gonna invest for?
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.720]   You know, you build up the factory,
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.440]   you produce those products for whom, right?
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.960]   So I think a very important thing,
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.600]   you know, happened over the past 30 years.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:46.440]   Two things.
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:49.680]   One, deleveraging for the private sector.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:53.360]   That's also why the Japanese government debt is so high,
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.160]   because without private demand,
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:57.000]   it's really the government public spending
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.720]   that's holding up the economy.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:33:00.960]   And second, the lack of confidence.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:05.120]   So coming to now, 30 years later, what do we have?
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:07.200]   One, the private sector balance sheet
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.680]   is pretty healthy at this moment.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:11.400]   They have a lot of money to spend.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:15.240]   And second, the confidence has finally start to turn around,
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.800]   because inflation is now up, right?
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:19.400]   People see inflation down the road.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:24.320]   And there is a structural change in the price setting,
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.040]   and which setting behavior,
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.160]   which growth is finally picking up,
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:31.240]   because of the structural labor shortage.
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:32.240]   And then behind the scene,
[00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.880]   the government has done a lot of reform,
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.960]   trying to push for labor market reform,
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.720]   corporate governance reform.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:39.440]   So I think at this moment,
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:41.920]   this kind of higher inflation after the pandemic
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:43.600]   was really just a trigger.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.840]   When inflation is back, confidence is back,
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:49.040]   private sector has money to spend.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.800]   That's where we think the Japanese economy
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:55.680]   will actually start to continue to grow down the road.
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.920]   - I just have one more country that I wanna ask about,
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.880]   because it's been coming up so much in the news,
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.920]   and it seems really interesting, and that's India.
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.320]   Can you tell us a little bit about outlook for India?
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:11.680]   - Yeah, I think from an economic perspective,
[00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:16.000]   we are indeed quite positive about India.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.960]   This is a vast market with a very large population.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.640]   It will resemble China a little bit,
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.720]   almost 30 or 40 years ago.
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:28.360]   And especially when the government,
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.160]   the Modi government is actually starting
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:32.080]   to do a lot of structural reform,
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:34.440]   land reform, building up the infrastructural,
[00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.080]   financial reforms, right?
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:38.320]   So this is where actually they are ready
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:42.360]   to leverage the significant potential of the economy.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:44.320]   In fact, most recently you do see
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:45.920]   that India is benefiting
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:49.000]   from this global supply chain adjustment as well.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:51.800]   They are actually getting more FDI,
[00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:54.600]   foreign direct investment, building up factories.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.160]   So I think this is where India actually will benefit
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.120]   from this global supply chain adjustment
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:05.160]   and continue to unleash its gross potential down the road.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   Now, I think the question for investor is again,
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.280]   the most important question,
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.840]   what is the price we are paying for that?
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.040]   Because sometimes what I see is
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.600]   that investor get too optimistic,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:22.120]   and we know that structural reforms is not that easy.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.160]   I think there's a lot of encouraging progress in India,
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.920]   structural reforms, macro reforms,
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:31.320]   they do come up with a decent macro policy framework
[00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:33.560]   like monetary policy, fiscal discipline.
[00:35:33.560 --> 00:35:36.000]   A lot of them are very encouraging,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.440]   but structural reforms,
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:40.880]   especially when it involves vested interest group,
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:43.200]   you know, sometimes it takes much longer
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.600]   than people expect it.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:46.840]   So I think that is where we would say,
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:50.160]   yes, on the economic front, we see a lot of potential,
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.720]   but on the equity side,
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:53.120]   I think on the investment side,
[00:35:53.120 --> 00:35:54.920]   I think investors should be careful
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.040]   about what price we are paying for that
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:36:00.000]   and what is priced in by the market.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:00.960]   - Interesting.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.080]   Let's go ahead and get into the second part of this,
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.960]   which is valuation and actual investing.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:09.000]   So we're gonna take the economic side
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.600]   of everything that we talked about,
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:15.280]   and we're going to equate it back to expected returns
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:19.400]   from US stocks, international developed market stocks,
[00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.720]   emerging market stocks, bonds,
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:23.800]   both in the US and internationally.
[00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:26.720]   And we're just gonna go through these asset classes.
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.760]   And again, this is Vanguard's view
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:31.200]   based on your economic outlook.
[00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:33.080]   And starting with the US stock market,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.440]   I'm just using a very simple model of expected return,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.680]   which would be three parts,
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:41.720]   which would be earnings growth,
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:44.880]   a dividend yield, which would include some buybacks,
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:47.760]   and valuation change.
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.240]   So using that as a backdrop
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:52.200]   for looking at the US stock market,
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:55.680]   you see lower returns going forward.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.000]   And how would that break down among earnings growth,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.520]   dividends, and change in valuation,
[00:37:01.520 --> 00:37:03.560]   which is price to earnings ratio?
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.400]   - Yeah.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.840]   When you look at the three components,
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:11.360]   I think what is driving lower return in the US market,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:12.840]   the one biggest thing I would say
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.000]   is indeed the valuation change.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.440]   In fact, I would say what is really driving
[00:37:18.440 --> 00:37:20.960]   the outperformance of the US equity market
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:21.800]   in the past decade,
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:24.120]   it was really because of the significant
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:25.720]   validation expansion.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.480]   Now that I think it has something to do
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:28.800]   with the macro environment,
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.280]   a low interest rate, low gross environment,
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.200]   and also the nature of the US equity market.
[00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:36.040]   As we know that US equity market
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.080]   was more tilting towards gross company,
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:40.240]   like IT technology companies,
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.920]   where their cashflow usually happens
[00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.920]   much later in the future.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:47.440]   So a low interest rate environments,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:51.080]   the discount rate for future cashflow is pretty low.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.800]   That gives you a higher price.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:55.080]   And also in a low gross environment,
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.840]   investors gross is scarce,
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:37:59.480]   and then investors are willing to pay
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:01.840]   a higher price for gross.
[00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:04.560]   So this actually explain the valuation,
[00:38:04.560 --> 00:38:09.040]   significant valuation expansion in the US market.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.760]   - And particularly those mega cap eight stocks,
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:14.080]   whereas the rest of the market,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:16.600]   the small cap, mid cap really didn't see that.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.480]   - No.
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:20.400]   I think it's perfectly fine for investor
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:21.600]   to be forward looking.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.640]   You incorporate a future news into today's price,
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.120]   but sometimes investor just get too optimistic,
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:31.160]   and sometimes we get ahead of ourselves.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.960]   So I think at this moment,
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.280]   what we've seen is that the US market
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:38.480]   is quite overvalued at this moment.
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:40.520]   We have a fair value estimation,
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:42.680]   and we found that at this moment,
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:45.640]   the US equity market is about 15%
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.160]   above the fair value estimate.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:51.240]   We say trees does not grow to the sky.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:53.600]   It will have to eventually converge.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:56.440]   Now, first it will converge to its fair value,
[00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:58.440]   and then even the fair value itself
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.160]   will start to decrease in a higher interest rate environment.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.600]   So this valuation normalization or contraction
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.240]   is one of the bigger reason that we expect
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.320]   the expected return for the next decade
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:13.560]   will be much lower than what we have seen
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.520]   in the past decade.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:17.320]   You talk about the building blocks,
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.800]   other than the valuation contraction,
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:23.440]   then the other ones obviously is also earnings growth.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.040]   Earnings growth will be lower, right,
[00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:28.040]   than what we have seen in the past.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:30.160]   Now, I think a very important reason
[00:39:30.160 --> 00:39:32.320]   is because of the profit margin
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.960]   that will start to come down.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:37.240]   Important reason like the nearshoring, unshoring.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   When we focus the global supply chain adjustment
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.360]   focus more on resilience, security,
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.960]   in addition to efficiency,
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:47.960]   then that tells you there will be more cost involved.
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:51.560]   And then also the slower pace of globalization,
[00:39:51.560 --> 00:39:54.800]   more fragmented, also means that we may not be able
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:57.600]   to enjoin the low labor cost across the world
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:58.600]   in the best way.
[00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.560]   That also increase labor cost.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:02.920]   And we know there is a structural labor shortage
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:05.120]   even domestically as well.
[00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   So this is where we actually see earnings growth
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.160]   will also be lower down the road.
[00:40:11.160 --> 00:40:13.640]   - And yet, when we look at the valuations
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.720]   of small cap stocks and mid cap stocks,
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:19.960]   the PEs, forward looking PEs are at the lowest
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:23.040]   they've been in decades.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:25.760]   Do you see any improvement there?
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:29.080]   - Yeah, I mean, Rick, I think that's exactly what you said.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.200]   Yes, overall, it seems like the US equity market
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:35.320]   is overvalued, but not for everybody.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.600]   If you think about the market performance,
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:40.880]   this year, it was pretty much all because
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:42.720]   of the Magnificent Seven.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.560]   - Yes.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.960]   - There could be opportunities, actually,
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:47.520]   if you look into the market.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:51.560]   What we see is that large cap and also gross company
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.960]   are pretty overvalued.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.600]   But on the other hand, we do see opportunities
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.240]   of value company as well as small caps,
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:00.960]   especially when we get into a higher interest rate
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:04.040]   environment, and those company will benefit more.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.880]   - So let's go outside the US.
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.920]   We don't have the high valuations.
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:12.480]   PEs are almost half, not quite, but price to book,
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:16.600]   return on equity, everything showing foreign stocks
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:19.840]   look very much like mid cap value companies.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:23.480]   So what is your outlook for expected returns
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:26.400]   from developed markets and then emerging markets?
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:29.160]   - Right, so when you look across the world,
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:32.680]   what we have seen is that non-US development market
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.440]   valuation are pretty reasonable.
[00:41:34.440 --> 00:41:37.640]   They didn't really expand that much over the past decade.
[00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:40.960]   So at this moment, I would say they are actually
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:44.760]   reasonably valued, and in some places, even undervalued.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.760]   And then emerging markets is also undervalued in our view.
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.400]   So this is where, in terms of the outlook
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:54.440]   for the next 10 years, we actually expect
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.640]   international market, that's non-US market,
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:58.520]   to outperform the US.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:00.360]   Let me give you some numbers here.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:03.840]   We actually expect about the annualized return
[00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:08.840]   in the coming decades, about 4.2 to 6.2% for the US market.
[00:42:08.840 --> 00:42:11.960]   But on the other hand, our expectation
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:15.400]   for non-US developed market is about 7 to 9% per year
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.160]   over the next 10 years, and 6 to 6 to 8.6% per year
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.480]   for emerging market.
[00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.840]   So this is where we would encourage our investors
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.600]   to have a globally diversified portfolio.
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:31.000]   - And part of this is the currency change.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:34.520]   You're expecting the dollar to be softer,
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.720]   say, over the next several years,
[00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:40.120]   and this will boost up international stock returns
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.040]   because they trade in native currency.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.960]   According to your report, about 1.1% or 1%
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.080]   as you're expecting.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:46.920]   - Right.
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:49.800]   First, I would say the US dollar is also expensive.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:53.520]   We also estimate that the US dollar is about 12%
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:56.080]   above our estimates of fair value.
[00:42:56.080 --> 00:42:58.360]   And the second thing, in the coming decade,
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:01.800]   we do think that there's more headwinds to the US dollar
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:05.920]   than tailwinds because of the structural fiscal deficit,
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:09.040]   and also because of the current account deficit as well.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:12.080]   Those do not bode that well for US dollar.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:14.800]   So we do expect the US dollar to depreciate
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.280]   in the coming decade.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:18.400]   But Rick, one thing I would emphasize
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.920]   is that when we make those forecast,
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.560]   it's really for the long-term, right?
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.320]   So they expected a return.
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:28.720]   We are not saying that every year, you know,
[00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:31.360]   international market will give 8% return.
[00:43:31.360 --> 00:43:34.280]   We're saying that on an annualized basis,
[00:43:34.280 --> 00:43:35.960]   this will be realized.
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.920]   It could be that in the near term,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:41.120]   especially if we get into a sharper economic downturn,
[00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.200]   investor risk appetite start to decrease significantly
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:47.760]   and everybody fly to safe assets.
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:50.920]   But we are talking about when your investment horizon
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.360]   is actually much longer,
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:55.680]   then the fundamental will reassert themselves.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.080]   And that is where we see the US dollar
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:00.640]   is heading towards depreciation.
[00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:02.840]   And this is indeed one of the reason
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:06.520]   we expect international equity to outperform
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.800]   in US dollar terms.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.960]   - So before we get to your Vanguard capital markets model,
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.040]   where you provide guidance on percentages
[00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.440]   to each one of the asset classes,
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:20.560]   I just wanna summarize what the report says.
[00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.560]   And there are three parts.
[00:44:22.560 --> 00:44:26.920]   The first one is monetary policy will bear its teeth.
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:27.760]   - Yep.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:30.680]   So I think this is where we all know
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.720]   that there is a long and variable lag
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.680]   of monetary policy transmission.
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:40.360]   And then we also had a lot of offsetting factor in 2023
[00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:45.360]   that actually keeps the economy gross pretty solid, right?
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:46.520]   In 2023.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:50.720]   However, in 2024, we expect those offsetting factors
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:53.560]   will fade and then monetary policy
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:57.800]   will become increasingly restrictive when inflation fall.
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:01.600]   So monetary policy will be more restrictive in real terms.
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.320]   And that actually will weigh on the economy
[00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:07.760]   where we see the economics actually get into
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.880]   a minor recession in the second half of next year.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.160]   - But we also see our start,
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:18.120]   which is the neutral rate where it's neither recessionary
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.720]   nor expansionary, that this number you believe
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:25.200]   is actually going to be moving higher
[00:45:25.200 --> 00:45:27.680]   and has moved higher and will stay higher.
[00:45:27.680 --> 00:45:28.520]   - Yeah.
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:30.760]   - And you mentioned that you thought it would be about
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:35.320]   a real return of about 1.5% on short-term money,
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.200]   which would be T-bills.
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:38.040]   - Yes.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.280]   This come to the monetary policy,
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.560]   what Fed will do in response to that economic downturn.
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:46.040]   We think of Fed and global central banks
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:48.480]   will cut interest rate next year.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.560]   But even if they cut, we don't think we will get back
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.040]   to zero interest rate anytime soon.
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.640]   Zero rates are just yesterday's news.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.400]   You know, beyond this business cycle,
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.800]   we believe we will settle
[00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.240]   into a higher interest rate environment.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.800]   A very key important reason, as you just mentioned,
[00:46:04.800 --> 00:46:08.600]   is because of the R star, the equilibrium interest rate
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:11.320]   that is neither stimulating nor restricting
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:14.000]   the economic growth is permanently higher.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.240]   In the U.S., we estimate that neutral rate level
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.600]   is now 3.5%, 100 base point higher
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.040]   than what we have seen in the past decade.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:28.720]   - And so all this leads for investors to bonds are back,
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.760]   U.S. stocks, not so much, but developed markets
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:35.200]   and particularly emerging markets look good.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:36.040]   - Yeah.
[00:46:36.040 --> 00:46:38.480]   I think it's a great news for our bond investors,
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:41.200]   not just that coupon income is back,
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:44.800]   but also, you know, at this more reasonable valuation
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.400]   and higher yield, the diversification benefit of bond
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.880]   actually is coming back as well.
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:53.640]   With bond actually being returned,
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:55.720]   outlook being pretty attractive,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.280]   and also because the equity market evaluation
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.360]   is somewhat stretched, especially in the U.S.,
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:03.800]   we would actually, number one, of course,
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:06.640]   they continue to stay diversified, stay long-term.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.040]   But on the other hand, I think that they could actually
[00:47:09.040 --> 00:47:11.480]   come up with a more defensive portfolio.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.080]   That is where we could overweight bond
[00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.520]   and underweight equity a little bit.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.560]   And then within the equity,
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:22.240]   we would also overweight international equity.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:23.760]   And that includes emerging market
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:27.680]   as well as non-U.S. development market as well.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:29.880]   - Well, let's go ahead and get into that model.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:34.800]   And the model is the Vanguard Capital Markets model,
[00:47:34.800 --> 00:47:36.360]   which you chair the committee?
[00:47:36.360 --> 00:47:37.200]   - Yes.
[00:47:37.200 --> 00:47:38.040]   - This is your thing.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:38.880]   - Yeah.
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:40.560]   - It's in the report, so you can look at it.
[00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.960]   It has all the breakdown,
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.920]   not only just U.S. stocks, international stocks,
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:46.720]   but it gets into factors, you know, value versus growth.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:47.560]   - Yeah.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:48.400]   - So let's go ahead and go through
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.720]   just the numbers really quickly.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:53.280]   You compared it to our basic 60/40 portfolio,
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:55.320]   60% stocks, 40% bonds,
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:58.640]   where 36% of these stocks were U.S.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:01.120]   and 24% were international,
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.640]   which is the global split between U.S. and international.
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:07.720]   And on the bonds, you had 28% U.S.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.840]   and then international, you had 12%.
[00:48:09.840 --> 00:48:11.080]   So that's the benchmark.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:11.920]   - Right.
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.200]   - That never changes.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:14.040]   - Right.
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:17.000]   - But your time varying asset allocation,
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.480]   if you were going to be a tactical,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.560]   I know you maybe don't like that word tactical,
[00:48:22.560 --> 00:48:24.040]   but I'm using it.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.520]   If you were gonna be tactical,
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.240]   it would look much different.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.400]   First of all, the stock and bond mix
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:33.240]   would be far less equity.
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:36.080]   I see here you have equities overall
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:38.800]   would be just over 40%
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   and bonds or fixed income overall
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:43.080]   would be just shy of 60%.
[00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:44.280]   So talk about that first
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:46.680]   and then we can get into the nitty gritty.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:48.040]   - I think the first thing, Rick,
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:51.280]   is that our time varying asset allocation model
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:54.040]   is different from a tactical asset allocation.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:54.880]   - Okay.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:58.920]   - Because as it's long-term and also strategic in nature.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.440]   So I think when we say time varying, what do we mean?
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:04.320]   We mean, we take the current market evaluation
[00:49:04.320 --> 00:49:07.360]   into consideration because through our research,
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:09.600]   we do find that starting valuation,
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:11.240]   both for bond and equity,
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:14.000]   is the most reliable predictor
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.440]   for the long-term expected return,
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:18.600]   not for the short-term, for long-term.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.040]   So that is where we actually get more confident
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:25.160]   with this forecast when the time horizon gets longer.
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:27.440]   And then we are still trying to maximize
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.800]   the risk-adjusted long-term return of a balanced portfolio.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.400]   In this case, we actually have a 10-year time horizon.
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:36.840]   I think this is a critical difference
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:39.440]   between us and a tactical asset allocation.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:42.880]   We are not focusing on the performance in the short-term.
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:46.160]   And then I think coming to this,
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:48.280]   how we allocate and make an allocation, right?
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:50.000]   We look at the global 60/40.
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.400]   I think sometimes when people talk about global 60/40,
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.280]   is really that exact number?
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.120]   I doubt.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:00.200]   I think the 60/40 is really like symbolized
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:02.440]   the concept of diversification.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:04.760]   It's a mix between bond and equity
[00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:07.920]   when you have bond as a ballast to the portfolio
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:11.520]   when you are experiencing equity downturn, right?
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:12.720]   So I think it is really about
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.400]   that concept of diversification.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.480]   But I think coming down the road,
[00:50:17.480 --> 00:50:21.280]   I think when we use the global 60/40 as a benchmark,
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:24.800]   so we say, if we want to achieve the same expected return
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:27.320]   for global 60/40 in 10 years,
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.840]   and then we take into the current valuation
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:31.960]   into consideration, what can we do?
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:36.640]   And we found that if we go 59% fixed income
[00:50:36.640 --> 00:50:41.480]   and 41% equity, that still give us the same expected return
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:45.120]   as global 60/40, but at a lower risk.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.480]   So essentially we end up with higher risk adjusted return.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:49.320]   Very good.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.600]   So on the equity side, it's interesting
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:55.160]   because rather than having total market equities,
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:59.520]   total U.S. market being 60% and international being 40%,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:03.120]   you are taking a heavier weighting towards value
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:06.400]   and a lesser weighting towards growth.
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:09.560]   You are taking a larger weighting towards small cap.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:13.880]   You are taking quite an equal weighting
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:16.320]   between emerging markets and developed markets.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.200]   These are pretty radical shifts.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:22.200]   I mean, you're not ignoring U.S. large cap growth.
[00:51:22.200 --> 00:51:24.440]   You're not ignoring developed markets,
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:27.320]   but you're really focusing on value,
[00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:29.720]   small cap, emerging markets,
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:31.320]   the ones where you see valuation.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:34.800]   Yes, this is where we do see the value,
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:37.000]   the opportunity in the longterm.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.560]   A large part of that is because of the valuation
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:40.960]   that we just mentioned.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.600]   We do see that relatively speaking,
[00:51:43.600 --> 00:51:46.720]   value, small cap, and also emerging market
[00:51:46.720 --> 00:51:48.400]   and non-U.S. developed market
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:51.920]   are relatively more reasonably valued,
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:54.040]   or even in some cases, undervalued.
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:58.880]   So that is where we do see higher expected return
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.160]   in the longterm.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.360]   Now, I think there are several things
[00:52:02.360 --> 00:52:03.760]   I do want to highlight.
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.520]   When we talk about valuation,
[00:52:05.520 --> 00:52:06.520]   and I just mentioned,
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.040]   valuation is the most reliable indicator
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.000]   for longterm expected return.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   But even so, I would say,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.320]   remember the keyword of longterm.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.640]   It doesn't mean that immediately
[00:52:18.640 --> 00:52:20.360]   the valuation will converge,
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.560]   will contract or increase.
[00:52:22.560 --> 00:52:25.600]   I would say valuation is never really a good timing tool
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:27.920]   for the short-term development.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:31.200]   In fact, valuation can stay overvalued
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.560]   or undervalued for a very longterm,
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:35.600]   especially if the macro environment,
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:39.120]   say interest rate has stayed persistently lower for longer,
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.600]   or higher for longer, right?
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:42.480]   So I think that's one caveat.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.280]   Don't use that, say, to predict value
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.240]   or small cap will immediately outperform
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:49.840]   next year or next month, right?
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:50.920]   So that's one caveat.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:53.320]   - I think that small cap value investors
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.760]   have learned that lesson over the last several years.
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:56.600]   - Yeah.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:57.920]   And the other thing I do want to say
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:01.400]   is that our performance is not guaranteed.
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:04.880]   So this comes back to our Vanguard capital market model.
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.040]   The VCMI model operates in a probabilistic framework.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.480]   When we predict about the future,
[00:53:10.480 --> 00:53:12.320]   it's not just one scenario.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:15.080]   We actually do 10,000 simulation.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:18.200]   There could be 10,000 scenarios in the future.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:22.560]   And that gives you a probability distribution of the future.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:24.920]   Everything is about probability.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.960]   So let me use the international versus US as an example.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:33.840]   Back in 2015, we say, oh, there is a 65% chance
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:36.200]   for international market to outperform
[00:53:36.200 --> 00:53:38.480]   in the next 10 years.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.120]   And today, the chance actually increased to 70%.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.080]   So you could always argue there is still a chance
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:48.400]   that the US continue to outperform over the next decade.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:49.960]   But even if that happens,
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:53.160]   our analysis suggests that it will still be difficult
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.560]   for the US to outperform to the same degree
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.720]   as it did over the last decade
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:00.960]   because of the higher interest rate environment.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:03.960]   So I think in the end, this is where we still say,
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:06.120]   we say we caution our US investor
[00:54:06.120 --> 00:54:08.160]   against a very strong home bias,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:09.880]   or we caution against, let's say,
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:12.640]   putting all your bet into one sector.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:15.880]   Diversification is still the best preparation
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:17.400]   and also stay long-term
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:20.600]   for all kinds of possible outcomes in the future.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.080]   - Let's get to your fixed income asset allocation
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:28.000]   because here, again, you've got almost 60% allocated
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.120]   to fixed income, of which a little bit more than half
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:35.920]   of that is allocated to the US fixed income markets.
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:38.000]   But a large majority of this,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.520]   almost all of it is allocated to treasury bonds,
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.520]   and a very minor amount is allocated
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.840]   to the aggregate bond market,
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.160]   which would also have corporate bonds, mortgages, and so forth.
[00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:52.760]   So you see a real undervaluation
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:56.160]   relative to credit risk and mortgage risk.
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:55:00.560]   You see intermediate-term treasuries as the place to be.
[00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.360]   - Yeah, I think that actually is based
[00:55:03.360 --> 00:55:06.040]   on our assessment of the valuation,
[00:55:06.040 --> 00:55:09.640]   where we actually see the treasury is more fairly valued.
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.320]   On the other hand, I would say,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:13.880]   when you think about the credit spread,
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.840]   to us at this moment, it's still somewhat pretty tight.
[00:55:16.840 --> 00:55:19.360]   The credit market may not have priced in
[00:55:19.360 --> 00:55:21.880]   a lot of the downside risk down the road,
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.200]   especially if we get into a recession
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.400]   and also in a higher interest rate environment,
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:31.600]   then the profit margin of the company will also get squeezed.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:33.880]   So this is where we are a little bit cautious
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:35.360]   about the credit.
[00:55:35.360 --> 00:55:37.000]   We think on the treasury side,
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.760]   that is where the valuation is pretty decent at this moment.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:43.400]   - And you also think international bonds
[00:55:43.400 --> 00:55:45.400]   would deserve a higher allocation,
[00:55:45.400 --> 00:55:48.320]   being almost 50% of the fixed income is in international,
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:52.400]   whereas the 60/40, it's far less than that.
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:55.520]   Now, is this hedged or non-hedged?
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:55:56.360]   - Hedged.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.600]   Rick, this is a difference between our equity investment
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:01.720]   and also bond investment.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.560]   Equity investment is unhedged.
[00:56:04.560 --> 00:56:07.000]   When you invest in the international market,
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.080]   that's why we need to watch for the currency change.
[00:56:11.080 --> 00:56:14.040]   That will have an impact on the relative performance.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:16.480]   But on the other hand, the bond market,
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:19.800]   we do actually hedge the currency risk.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:21.520]   To that extent, in the end,
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.760]   the U.S. bond expected to return,
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.720]   and the return from the international bond market
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:28.520]   is actually very similar.
[00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.480]   We actually had a U.S. bond to return
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.280]   a nominal annualized 4.8 to 5.8% over the next decade,
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.920]   and then it's 4.7 to 5.7%
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:39.600]   from the international bond market.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:40.960]   It's not that different.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:44.800]   But this is where I think we come to a very important concept
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.680]   about why we want to go international.
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:50.320]   It's more than just the return outlook,
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.720]   both in the equity side and also the bond side.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.240]   It's because of the diversification benefit.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:58.720]   When you think about the rest of the world,
[00:56:58.720 --> 00:57:02.200]   they may not be perfectly aligned with the U.S. market
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:03.880]   in terms of their business cycle,
[00:57:03.880 --> 00:57:06.400]   in terms of their policy cycle.
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   So especially for emerging market,
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.480]   and even to a certain extent China,
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:13.320]   the correlation there could be even lower.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.200]   So I think regardless of the outlook,
[00:57:16.200 --> 00:57:19.760]   bring in those into a diversified portfolio,
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:23.080]   help you to harvest those diversification benefit.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:24.800]   Essentially, that's where you reach
[00:57:24.800 --> 00:57:27.480]   the same expected return, but with lower risk.
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:28.880]   - Well, that's all the time we have.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:31.840]   It's Qian, been a very interesting discussion.
