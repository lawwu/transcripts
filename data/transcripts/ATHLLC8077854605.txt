[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:05.080]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.720]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.880]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins,
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.200]   and joining me today is entrepreneur, author,
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.020]   and friend, Noah Kagan.
[00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.840]   If you don't know Noah, he runs a company called AppSumo,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.160]   which is actually the seventh million dollar business
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.520]   he's started, and he adamantly believes
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.240]   that anyone that puts their mind to it
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.200]   can launch a million dollar business.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.000]   But not just that, he thinks you can do it in a weekend,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.180]   and is gonna lay out the framework for us today.
[00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.720]   That's not to say you all need to plan
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.260]   on quitting your jobs right now,
[00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.360]   but it is such an incredible time in the world
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.600]   for entrepreneurship, and even if it's just
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.480]   a new side hustle you might wanna start,
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.120]   I feel like the opportunities are endless.
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.440]   So today we're gonna cover what idea you might wanna start,
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   how to get over some of the things that might hold you back,
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.360]   all the steps you actually need to follow
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.800]   to launch a business in 48 hours,
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.840]   how to apply these lessons to an existing job,
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.160]   even if you're not ready to be an entrepreneur yet,
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.500]   and a lot more.
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.360]   I am so excited for this conversation,
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.700]   and honestly I wish I would've had it a few decades ago.
[00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.820]   So let's jump in right after this.
[00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.160]   There is nothing I love more than learning
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.240]   that something I enjoy is actually so good for you,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.080]   and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.640]   It has so many health benefits,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.440]   and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume it
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.960]   is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.520]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold extracted
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.600]   using only wild harvested leaves
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.360]   from 250 year old tea trees,
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.560]   rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.960]   Then everything is triple toxin screened
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.680]   for pesticides, heavy minerals,
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.520]   and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.840]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero prep
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.300]   because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.160]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds,
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.280]   and are so travel friendly.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.840]   They have so many products,
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.840]   but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.400]   for mental clarity and energy,
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.800]   and the black Pu-erh,
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.620]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.400]   with a rich earthy flavor that is so good,
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.920]   and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.200]   And if you need another reason,
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.640]   search for all the amazing research-backed benefits
[00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.880]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome,
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.520]   heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.240]   and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.040]   in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.680]   But you don't even have to take my word
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.760]   or do any research because Peak offers free US shipping,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.600]   free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.760]   And for a limited time,
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.140]   you can get up to 15% off and a free quiver
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.240]   with 12 tea samples at my link
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.060]   at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.240]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.120]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.780]   P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.720]   Noah, thanks for being here.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.320]   - Chris, thank you for having me.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.160]   - So from the title of the book,
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.960]   it seems you might think that starting a company
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.680]   is the best way to build wealth.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.720]   Is that true?
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.280]   Did you always think that, if it is?
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.400]   - Coming in hot.
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.220]   I love it.
[00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.480]   Let's just look at data.
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.760]   So do you put your money in the stock market at all?
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.580]   - I do.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.440]   - Yeah, like a great return on the S&P 500 is like 10%.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.280]   - Wow.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.920]   Yeah, if I could lock in 10%, boy, would I be happy.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   - If you could do that, right?
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.320]   But if you look at the data since 1900,
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.800]   that's what you get at around 10 to 12% a year.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.040]   Then if you look at housing, maybe it appreciates,
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.320]   but generally a house, give or take,
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.280]   will do 5% to 7% return.
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:21.600]   Now, I'll just give you an example.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.840]   With AppSumo, I put in $50 to start it,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.540]   and last year I made $3.3 million.
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.680]   And I'm not saying that everyone can do that within a year,
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.760]   but over some time, the returns and upside
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:33.440]   of entrepreneurship are unlimited,
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.320]   while a lot of the costs are much smaller.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.240]   And so, it's kind of maybe something I've thought about
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.080]   for a lot of people.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.360]   It's like, you can work your butt trying to get clean
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.880]   an attic, and then literally my house yesterday flooded,
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.760]   a real estate house I have,
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   or you can just start your own business.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.640]   There's different problems, but at least the upside
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.280]   and the influence of it are much higher.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.280]   - Did you always think of it this way?
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.440]   I think you and I both share a similar background.
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.400]   Early careers all in startup land in Silicon Valley
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.160]   seemed like building tech companies
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.280]   is the way you make money,
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.580]   and then we probably had other friends that made money,
[00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.600]   and then we're like, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.500]   maybe the way money is real estate.
[00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.840]   Maybe real estate is how we make money.
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.040]   I keep hearing that this is the best thing ever.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.840]   I have both FOMO about not buying more real estate
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.640]   and deep satisfaction only owning my house.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.600]   - My next book is called "Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and Stepdad."
[00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:26.080]   And (laughs) it's like there's another dad
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.980]   that no one ever talked about that was just like,
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.000]   I don't know why these guys are working so hard.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.920]   I think what's interesting, we talked before
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:33.860]   about my YouTube channel.
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.560]   One of the coolest things is that there's so many
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.920]   different ways of getting rich.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.120]   And when you grew up, I grew up a few miles from Apple.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.760]   My father sold copiers, and my stepfather
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.440]   was a computer programmer.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.520]   And I thought that's just the way to have money.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.040]   But I realized, wow, there's so many other ways,
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.740]   like fruit selling, (laughs)
[00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.320]   basements, this guy Larry Janeski.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:54.860]   Michael Hudger did ships.
[00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.160]   Paul Mitchell did hair care.
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.160]   Hair care.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.560]   And yes, there is a lot of money in the internet, too,
[00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.520]   which just came out 24 years ago, if you think about it.
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.160]   And that always gets me so excited,
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:07.280]   is that there's so many different ways
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.760]   for people to find what they're interested in.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.840]   And look, if you have a day job,
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:11.760]   I think that's even better,
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.240]   'cause now you have an investor, which is your employer,
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.120]   to now explore all these other options
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.800]   that can create unlimited wealth for you.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.560]   - And do you think this is a path for everyone,
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.780]   or how do you think about building companies
[00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.840]   and starting side hustles for someone
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.760]   who maybe never thought that was for them?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.240]   - Most people wanna be time millionaires.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.400]   I would say that's universal.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.680]   And most people would like to be a millionaire, or beyond.
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.920]   And they actually realize that you probably need less money
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.000]   to live a very satisfied life.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.080]   That's why in the book I've talked about
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.120]   the freedom number, 'cause you realize
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.040]   that number's actually a lot less than you think.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.960]   What I've recognized, though, is that most people
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.440]   think it's this big, scary thing.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.240]   Like take my brother, for instance, he's a doctor.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.440]   So he went to school for 10 years,
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.040]   he got a certificate to do his stuff.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.520]   And what's crazy about entrepreneurship,
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.280]   you don't need a certificate. (laughs)
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.420]   Everyone has permission.
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.560]   And you don't even have to be tall.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.020]   You know, I'm only 5'10".
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.200]   You could be really short, or you could be super tall,
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.040]   or you could be anything.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.740]   And I think that's just so amazing
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.520]   how accessible it can be.
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.640]   And the reality, though, is that we create
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.960]   this big, scary monster of,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:08.320]   well, I've gotta be a talkative person,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.960]   or I've gotta go be on Twitter,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.760]   or I've gotta go sell, and that's just not the case.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.880]   But you do have to think, wow, I could maybe do this.
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:18.920]   Let me see how I can maybe change my life in a weekend,
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.840]   which I would say is possible for everyone out there.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:23.120]   And especially if you have a day job.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:25.040]   I don't know if you've ever been fired, Chris.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.320]   You ever been fired? - I have.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.420]   - And I've been fired twice.
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.160]   And thank you, Mark, and thank you, Matt Kohler.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.000]   Thank you, Aaron Patzer.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.460]   And the beauty of getting fired is the moment I realize
[00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:39.040]   that I'm not in control of my livelihood.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.840]   These two people at two companies,
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.000]   Facebook and Mint, which I was early at,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.760]   I decided that I'm not good to be there anymore.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.720]   So it really sparked with me.
[00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:50.680]   Then got early on, like, wow, if that could happen,
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.200]   I need to protect myself.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.600]   And so you can create a business.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.080]   It could be a flower shop.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.400]   And then keep your day job as well.
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.480]   So at AppSumo, where I work, we have this lady, Amy,
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.600]   she has a flower shop and a hair salon.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.600]   And she's also our head of customer support.
[00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.560]   (laughs)
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.640]   You have Nick Christensen,
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:09.840]   who has a teeth whitening clinic up in Dallas.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.680]   And he leads our growth team.
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.400]   And so it doesn't mean you have to quit your day job.
[00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.640]   Ideally, maybe have both.
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.540]   At least have that option available to you.
[00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.380]   - I think, and maybe it's Silicon Valley,
[00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.440]   but it felt to me for so long,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.280]   maybe until this podcast, that starting a company was like,
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.240]   I'm gonna start a thing that's all-consuming,
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.760]   that's gonna be everything to me,
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.480]   and I'm gonna work a million hours a day
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:32.120]   and have thousands of employees, or it's a failure.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:32.960]   - I love the line, like,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:36.560]   don't trade your nine-to-five for a five-to-nine, right?
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.680]   The whole point of being an entrepreneur
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.960]   is that you can then become a time millionaire as well.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:43.720]   Like, I'm going to Spain in two weeks to have a family.
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.160]   And that's a lot, you know,
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.520]   if I had a boss who was like, no, you can't travel,
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.680]   you gotta come to the office, you gotta,
[00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.800]   I don't know, but entrepreneurship
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:51.400]   gives me that affordability.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:54.120]   And with business, the greatest part about it,
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.700]   which people don't recognize is that, yes,
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:56.960]   it does take some effort to get started.
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:58.340]   Yes, you have to find something people are excited
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:07:59.520]   to give you money for,
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.160]   but you can ultimately spend most of your time,
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.700]   if not all of it, in just the areas you like.
[00:08:04.700 --> 00:08:05.540]   And guess what?
[00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:07.080]   There's people that like doing customer support,
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:08.480]   like Amy, which I don't know how she does it.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:10.100]   Shout out, Amy, I love you.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.880]   And there's people who like doing operational stuff.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.840]   Dusty, Vanessa, thank you guys for doing that.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.960]   And they're happy there,
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:17.240]   and they get to live their dream lives,
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.560]   and that is available.
[00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:19.680]   It's not such this, like,
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:21.000]   oh, I've got to spend all night
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.960]   and don't have any free time around it.
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.120]   That's what this stuff enables you
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.640]   to have that option available.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:27.160]   - And you said the freedom number people need
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.900]   is a lot smaller than you think.
[00:08:28.900 --> 00:08:30.560]   - Yeah, for me, it always seemed risky,
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.400]   this freedom number, that way I realized it,
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:35.080]   and I've noticed that a lot of other entrepreneurs have had,
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:36.800]   it always seems so risky to have these day jobs,
[00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:38.000]   like I did at Intel.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.520]   And then I thought, oh man, entrepreneurship,
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:41.540]   I don't know how much I have to make.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.380]   And then I recognized, like,
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.760]   well, how much do I need to really be able
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.440]   to do the thing I want to do and have freedom?
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.400]   And it was way less than I expected.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.960]   And it really came down to kind of three categories,
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:51.520]   which is like living, entertainment, and savings,
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.960]   or living, food, savings.
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.680]   And for me, it was $3,000.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.960]   And when I was at my day job, I was like,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.600]   well, if I can get the side hustle to that number,
[00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:02.020]   then I can quit.
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:03.440]   And I never encourage people
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.240]   to actually go take a risky thing.
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.240]   It seemed risky to quit your job
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:07.880]   to try to hopefully start a business.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:08.920]   It's not what I want people to do.
[00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.020]   And when you realize how much smaller that number is
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.480]   than you expect, you realize it's also more attainable.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:16.880]   And so I've twice quit jobs and then gone on
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.800]   once I hit my $3,000 freedom number.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.880]   - And so for you, that's $3,000.
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:22.480]   But do you think that gets a lot harder as people age,
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:24.760]   have more responsibility, family?
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.160]   - Yeah, it just takes longer.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.600]   Everyone has their own number based on their own lifestyle.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.080]   So today, I think my credit card, I don't know.
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.920]   By the way, the cool part about eventually getting money
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.560]   is that you don't have to worry about budgeting
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.080]   or worry about having enough for retirement.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.440]   You don't even have to think about it.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   And I think that's available for everyone.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   But I just had to do a CNBC show.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:44.560]   I think my credit card bill, with all things,
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:46.840]   is like $25,000 a month.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.880]   So it goes up over time, but then, obviously,
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.600]   I've built up businesses and stuff like that.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.760]   But what people are trying to do, if you have kids,
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.720]   and I've noticed there's a guy named Jake
[00:09:55.720 --> 00:09:56.640]   who ran Million Dollar Weekend.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.960]   He's got three kids, he's got a wife, they got a house.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:01.680]   So it's not something you can just quit overnight.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.520]   But if you never get started,
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:04.880]   then he's never even gonna get to that number.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.120]   I think for him, my guess, I think it was around $10,000.
[00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.960]   But you have to get started
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.080]   so that you can even get to that point.
[00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.760]   Same as I got started with AppSumo.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:14.320]   I started with a weekend and I made my first $12,
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.160]   my first sale.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:17.440]   - And so, weekend, why a weekend?
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:19.040]   Why not a week, why not a month?
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:21.180]   Why do people need to figure this out so quickly?
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:22.080]   - You have a family, right?
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:22.920]   You have two kids.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.440]   And you have, I mean, you have this podcast,
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.320]   but you have a job and you have a wife to take care of.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.440]   Most people don't have a lot of time, right?
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:29.400]   It's hard.
[00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:31.240]   And you already got your obligations,
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.480]   you got commitments, and you're like,
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:34.160]   maybe it's just easier to put in the stock market.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.460]   But what everyone has is a weekend.
[00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.880]   Everyone has at least one weekend they can do something.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.120]   Right, maybe not every single weekend,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:42.720]   which is everyone's got 52 of them, but maybe one a year.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.320]   And because we don't have as much time available,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:50.040]   how do we find what's just the essence of getting started?
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   And if you can do that in a very limited time,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.400]   which creates a lot more creativity,
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:56.880]   I do believe limitation instills creation.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.760]   And when you have this limitation, you're like,
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:00.320]   well, I'm not gonna mess around.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:02.240]   And I can't goof around and buy a bunch of ads,
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.860]   or I can't, I don't have time to make a YouTube channel
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:05.560]   because I only got a weekend to get this done.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.960]   And especially someone like yourself,
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.440]   if you were in that tech job
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:10.140]   and had a family where you are today,
[00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:11.320]   you don't have a lot of time for that.
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:13.940]   And so how do we focus on just the things that matter?
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:15.720]   And what I have found through myself
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.980]   starting businesses in a weekend and through others,
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.540]   this 48 hour time period is the best window
[00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:22.240]   to change your life.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.780]   - And how far do you have to get?
[00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:25.560]   I look at this podcast as an example
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:29.040]   that's now my full-time job and my wife's full-time job.
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:31.160]   But when I started it, it was like,
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:33.040]   it was just a side project that I liked.
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.960]   It cost money and did not make any money at the beginning.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.980]   You could argue I maybe started it in a weekend,
[00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:40.080]   but I didn't have those ambitions.
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.880]   Where does stuff like that fit into this?
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.840]   - How long did it take for you to quit your day?
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.880]   Did you quit your day job when you started this
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:46.720]   or did you?
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:51.120]   - It probably took, I started the podcast in May, 2021,
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.240]   and I quit my day job in December, 2022.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:55.880]   - And how much were you making at the pod
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:57.920]   that you felt comfortable to quit your day job?
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:01.280]   - It crossed to a point that it replaced my work income.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:02.600]   - That's your freedom number.
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.320]   And so the reality is that in a weekend,
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:09.160]   you could find out if something that people want.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.560]   And then the other part of success,
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:11.720]   and you asked about billionaires,
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.080]   which I've interviewed a lot on my YouTube channel
[00:12:13.080 --> 00:12:14.720]   and worked for them directly,
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.960]   is that you become a billionaire,
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:17.900]   but you have to do compounded action
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.600]   over a long period of time.
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.240]   And most people are quitting too soon.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:22.320]   So you have to initially find something
[00:12:22.320 --> 00:12:23.980]   people actually really want.
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:25.180]   And then you do have to stick with it
[00:12:25.180 --> 00:12:27.400]   for some period of time where like at AppSumo,
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.500]   I don't think I made my first million dollars a year
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:31.320]   salaried until year seven.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.000]   I paid myself, I think $0 first year, 40,000 next year.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.760]   And frankly, if I would've just stayed at Intel
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:37.680]   or any of these other jobs,
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:39.240]   I probably would've made more most of the time,
[00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.640]   but I kept sticking with it,
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:42.160]   kept having good results promising.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.000]   And then over time, it was like,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:44.040]   wow, now we actually have enough.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.160]   I can take a little bit for myself.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.480]   And then eventually it was like a lot for myself,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.920]   but you have to start and then you have to stick.
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.200]   And you were a great example of that.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.040]   - So the goal of the weekend
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.400]   isn't to kind of fast track your way to millionaire status.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.520]   It's to make sure you validated
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:58.600]   that the thing you're working on
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.760]   could really be big enough
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.720]   to be the thing you want to do full-time.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.520]   - It's recognizing that you can create
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.920]   a million dollar opportunity for yourself
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.380]   in a very short period of time.
[00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:07.680]   And I think in 10 years,
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.620]   I believe someone will make a million dollars in a weekend,
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.280]   legitimately, not like through drug dealing
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.120]   or something shady.
[00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.880]   - Or that app that was like $20,000 or something.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:15.920]   - It could be that.
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.320]   You could sell pinball machines.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:18.720]   This is actually, you could totally validate a pin.
[00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:19.560]   I love pinballs.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   I got an arcade at my house.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.400]   You could sell $15,000 pinballs.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.000]   And I walk people through business models
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.720]   and such in the book, one minute business models,
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.240]   'cause you don't have a lot of time.
[00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.320]   To make a million dollars selling 15,000 pinballs,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.560]   depending on what the costs are like,
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:34.240]   maybe you'll need to sell 100 or two.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:36.440]   It's not a bad business over the next few years.
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:37.260]   - Yeah.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:38.100]   - It was actually pretty crazy.
[00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:38.920]   Do you know Stern Pinball?
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:39.760]   - Yeah.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.680]   - So let's say you love arcades.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.520]   And this is the thing, again,
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:42.520]   you can make money in different ways.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.480]   Maybe it's a podcast show.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:44.920]   Maybe it's videos.
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:45.900]   Maybe it's lawn care.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.440]   Maybe it's games.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.080]   And Stern Pinball,
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:50.980]   which I don't know if they do a billion dollars in sales,
[00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:52.880]   but definitely in the tens, if not hundreds of millions.
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:54.520]   It's the number one pinball maker.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.080]   They showed a video about how they make pinball.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.440]   And it's the same stuff I teach in Million Dollar Weekend,
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.200]   which I thought was so unique.
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.800]   Is that instead of building this whole pinball thing
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.280]   and making sure people like it,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.260]   they literally take a piece of wood,
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:06.640]   and then they, pretty much the same day,
[00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:08.520]   they put pieces of metal on the wood,
[00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:09.920]   and they throw a ball at it.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.460]   And they see what happens is they throw the ball
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:13.040]   at this piece of wood.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:14.740]   And then you realize, wow,
[00:14:14.740 --> 00:14:16.080]   pretty quickly they can see if the game
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.580]   that they're starting to think of is gonna be interesting.
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.480]   And that's the same thing you can apply in business,
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.320]   which is, how can I see if this is something
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.140]   people really want?
[00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:23.000]   Maybe it's a show.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.560]   Maybe it's a pinball game.
[00:14:24.560 --> 00:14:25.600]   Maybe it's gonna be food.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:26.520]   Maybe it's a software product.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:27.600]   Maybe it's lawn care.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.320]   So that if I'm gonna work on it for some period of time,
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:31.760]   I know that there's at least customers who are excited
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:33.760]   to be purchasing it and be a part of it.
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.920]   - I'm not sure what's on tap for your 2024.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.560]   Maybe you're thinking about buying a house,
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:40.880]   planning to launch a business,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:43.320]   or welcoming a new addition to the family.
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.320]   If that sounds like you,
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.440]   and you want some help preparing for these events
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.360]   with confidence, you have to check out Facet.
[00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:52.000]   In fact, when I shut down my financial planning firm,
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.940]   we did extensive research on what financial service company
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.100]   to recommend to our clients, and we landed on Facet.
[00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.480]   So I'm excited to have them as a sponsor today.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.060]   Facet makes financial planning accessible to everyone
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.000]   and addresses one of my biggest frustrations
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.140]   with this industry.
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:08.320]   I've long hated how so many advisors
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:11.200]   charge a high percentage of your assets, but not Facet.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:14.140]   They only charge a flat annual membership fee,
[00:15:14.140 --> 00:15:17.380]   which means you actually keep more of what you invest.
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:18.500]   Through their tech platform,
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:20.240]   you'll get access to financial experts
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.880]   and a team of specialists across investments,
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:24.380]   taxes, and more.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:28.400]   So don't miss Facet's limited time $450 kickstart offer
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   when you go to allthehacks.com/facet, that's F-A-C-E-T.
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.300]   You'll get $200 into your brokerage account if you invest
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.400]   and maintain $5,000 within your first 90 days,
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.300]   plus the $250 enrollment fee will be waived
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.840]   for new annual members.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.000]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/facet.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.320]   Facet Wealth is an SEC registered investment advisor.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.520]   This is not an offer to buy or sell securities,
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.920]   nor is it investment, legal, or tax advice.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.560]   Past performance is not a guarantee of future performance.
[00:15:56.560 --> 00:15:59.240]   Offer expires March 31st, 2024.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.720]   Terms and conditions apply.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:04.400]   Did you know that someone new gets impacted
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.120]   by identity theft every two seconds?
[00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.960]   It makes sense when there's so much
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:11.560]   of our personal information getting shared online
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:13.080]   without our consent.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:17.040]   I found a listing for my dad on a site called Family Tree Now
[00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:20.160]   that had his name, age, address, phone number,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.880]   email, past addresses, and the names of his relatives,
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:28.400]   and that was just one of the 69 listings that had his info.
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.560]   Fortunately, instead of spending hours
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:32.360]   finding all the sites with his info
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.520]   and submitting the request to take it down,
[00:16:34.520 --> 00:16:37.760]   I got it all done in minutes with Delete.me from Abine,
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:39.720]   and I am so excited to be partnering
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:41.040]   with them for this episode.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.020]   Delete.me is an amazing service that will not just find
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:46.080]   and remove your personal information
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:48.880]   from over 500 data broker websites,
[00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:52.000]   but they'll continuously scan for new data that shows up
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.640]   and get that removed as well.
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:56.840]   On average, Delete.me finds and removes over 2,000 pieces
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.440]   of data for a customer in their first two years,
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:02.920]   and to date, they've removed over 35 million pieces
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:04.280]   of data for their customers.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.840]   So if you wanna get your personal information removed
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.840]   from all these listings on the internet,
[00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:13.840]   go to allthehacks.com/deleteme and get 20% off a plan
[00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.400]   for you or your entire family.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:20.280]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/deleteme.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:22.960]   What's the high-level process someone needs to go through?
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:25.480]   I was gonna joke, like, well, it's in the book.
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.400]   It's a good investment. (laughs)
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.320]   But no, I'll give it to you for free.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.240]   I'll give it to you for free.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:30.760]   So if you have to break it down,
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.080]   there's three categories of getting
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.600]   a million-dollar weekend business going,
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:36.080]   which is starting it, building it, and growing it,
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:39.200]   and I would say there's so many business books out there,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.360]   and especially for a lot of your audience.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.960]   You have really good-looking audience, that's a fact.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.480]   You have a lot of six-figure audience,
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.400]   that a lot of have kids,
[00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:48.400]   and they're probably happy with the S&P 500 12%,
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.100]   or maybe they got crypto lucky,
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:52.280]   or they bought some silly NFT moon cats,
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:54.340]   which I didn't, lost a lot of money on.
[00:17:54.340 --> 00:17:57.700]   I do think most people wanna have more money,
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:59.600]   and what I've seen from it,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.720]   there's start it, build it, and grow it.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:02.640]   There's a woman who was at Warby Parker named McKinsey,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.120]   and she dreamed the same thing.
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:05.500]   So the first part, though,
[00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:07.760]   is how do you get good at starting and asking?
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:08.800]   Those are the two biggest things
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:10.520]   holding people back from success
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.680]   in really entrepreneurship, but also in life.
[00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.060]   I would say this book is almost as much self-help
[00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:17.000]   as it is start a business in a weekend.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.440]   So how do you practice starting right now?
[00:18:19.440 --> 00:18:22.040]   'Cause the more that you can get started,
[00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:23.520]   and let's say you wanna do a podcast.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.960]   Let's put an episode out today.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.640]   I have a YouTube channel, a million subscribers.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.880]   My first video that I did three years ago
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:32.320]   was with an iPhone 10, and me shirtless,
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.320]   and it was just a video talking about COVID.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:37.320]   Fast forward, today, each video costs $20,000 to make,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.000]   but I got started, and then over time,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.680]   I was able to add maybe a videographer,
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:43.840]   or a little better camera, or a little better lighting,
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.720]   a little better scripts, a little better thumbnails,
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:47.600]   and you stick with it, you keep improving it,
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.360]   and then now, the videos are more polished and so forth,
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:52.040]   but you have to practice how do you get started right now.
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:53.840]   Second thing is asking.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:55.280]   Everything in life is asking, like your wife.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:58.680]   You had to ask her to marry you, right?
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.680]   You have to ask for a raise.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.680]   You have to ask for things,
[00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.520]   and so people have a negative connotation of asking,
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:05.440]   and then they have this fear of rejection,
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.060]   this really strong fear of, wow,
[00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:09.800]   I'm not good enough, or they don't like me,
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.440]   and so when we can do that in silly things,
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:15.760]   like McKinsey, so she dreamed of having her own business,
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:17.800]   and so she loved connection,
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:21.240]   and so she wanted to start a greetings card company,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:22.720]   and it's called marymakery.com.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:23.920]   I gotta give her a shout out.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.560]   She's Red Million Dollar Weekend,
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.480]   and she emailed some of her coworkers at Warby Parker.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.040]   She said, "I wanna do a greeting card.
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:32.400]   "Does anyone wanna buy some of my greeting cards?"
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:34.400]   And she asked, and the beauty of asking
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:35.720]   is that you can get what you want.
[00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:37.600]   If you don't ask, you can't get,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.440]   and you didn't have to build a big website.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:40.480]   You didn't have to buy a domain.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:41.320]   You didn't have to do anything,
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:43.000]   but you practice this in small things,
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.940]   and then in her first year of sales so far,
[00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:47.000]   she's done $50,000 in greeting cards.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.400]   Greeting cards, and by the way,
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:52.080]   Hallmark has a TV show or a channel,
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.160]   and they started the exact same way.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.120]   I think people never make their million dollars
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.520]   'cause they don't make their first dollar,
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.360]   and they're not making their first dollar
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:58.180]   'cause they don't get started,
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.020]   and they don't realize it can be fun
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.180]   and you can't get started today.
[00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:01.580]   The second section of the book is like,
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:02.720]   okay, you started things.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.620]   You feel good about yourself.
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.460]   You got momentum.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:05.280]   You got the skills.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.720]   Now, how do you build it?
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:08.840]   And so I would say there's kind of three pieces of that.
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.320]   How do you find ideas?
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:11.520]   And there's more than enough,
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:13.160]   and we can go through some today.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.800]   How do you make sure it's a million dollar opportunity?
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:16.800]   How do you make sure that there's a business model there?
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.500]   And then the part three of the book is grow it,
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.760]   which is like, can we really get customers?
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.820]   And then how do you take it to 1,000,
[00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:25.960]   10,000, million dollars, and beyond?
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:29.760]   So let's take an example of,
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:32.000]   for me, I've found that there's three ways to get business,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.400]   but let me just show people in the audience
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.280]   one thing right now.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:35.520]   Let's just do a fun one.
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.960]   So for people listening, text someone right now,
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.320]   "Hey, what kind of business do you think I would start?"
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.040]   And that's an ask, and that's a start, right?
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.880]   You're starting something right now.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:46.720]   You're doing it, and guess what?
[00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:48.000]   You're gonna get a result.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.040]   And that's a free business idea
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.420]   that you can already do for yourself.
[00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:52.480]   And one of the best ways to think about business ideas
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:54.360]   is what have you gotten paid for in the past,
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.080]   or who do you have influence around?
[00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:58.520]   Who do you have in your zone of influence in your network?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:00.040]   Make it easy on yourself.
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:01.240]   So I'll give you three other business ideas
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:02.480]   in three minutes in three ways.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.620]   So number one, just think about your day-to-day
[00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.160]   and break it out, breakfast, lunch, dinner.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:07.640]   Think of something that annoyed you.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.520]   That's a business opportunity.
[00:21:08.520 --> 00:21:10.640]   Every problem is a business opportunity.
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:11.680]   The other one, number two,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:13.000]   think about something you spend money on.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.320]   Look at your credit card bill.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.800]   I was really annoyed with DocuSign.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:19.400]   I keep signing up for new accounts so I don't have to pay.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:21.040]   So I was like, "I'm tired of that."
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.080]   And so two weeks ago, I read "Million Dollar Weekend,"
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:27.000]   and I followed the process, and I made $3,000 in one day.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.160]   And now in the next 30 days,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.640]   I'm delivering a DocuSign alternative.
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:31.080]   I don't have a website.
[00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:31.920]   I don't have a domain.
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.800]   I don't know what we should call it.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.660]   If people have ideas, let me know.
[00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:37.020]   But I have a million dollar business opportunity.
[00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.980]   And then the third one is what have you avoided doing?
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.180]   What's on your to-do list that you have not done?
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.020]   There are other ways in the book.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.420]   There's six other ways, but I'm giving some quick ones
[00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.500]   that people can start thinking about themselves.
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.860]   Now the two other high pieces, and again,
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:49.900]   if you go to milliondollarweekend.com,
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.700]   it's super broken out there.
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:53.380]   But next up, is it a million dollar opportunity?
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.740]   Is there at least a million dollars of money being spent?
[00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:57.220]   And then what does the business model look like
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.900]   for you to actually make a million bucks?
[00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:01.220]   And so I was doing lawn care
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:02.920]   because that's what people told me to start as a business.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.360]   I wanted to prove how to do it.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.600]   Now, if you do lawn care
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.920]   and you're selling one-off lawn care,
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.560]   you have to, let's say 50 bucks a lawn.
[00:22:09.560 --> 00:22:11.160]   That's a lot of lawns.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.840]   So by just having a one-minute business model,
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:13.680]   it's like, all right,
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:15.260]   well, I need to sell monthly subscriptions.
[00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.640]   And what I aim for in the business model and in general
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.240]   is how hard does this actually look?
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:22.040]   Like, do I have to sell 5,000 different lawn care things?
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:23.360]   That's tough.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:24.880]   Now, next up, you have the idea.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.840]   You've done the typical check in the business model.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   You have to see if you can actually get customers for it.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.500]   And I always recommend three customers in 48 hours.
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.220]   I found that if you cannot get three,
[00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:34.460]   you're not gonna be able to get beyond that
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:35.640]   after the weekend.
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:36.480]   And there's three ways you can do it.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.920]   You can pre-sell it.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:39.280]   You can post it on marketplaces.
[00:22:39.280 --> 00:22:41.040]   So you can post it on Etsy, Craigslist,
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.540]   indie hackers, Reddit, things like that,
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.300]   where there's people that are looking to pay.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:46.580]   Or the third way is landing pages and ads.
[00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:48.380]   I love pre-selling 'cause it's the most direct.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.820]   And you could do it in a non-salesy way.
[00:22:50.820 --> 00:22:52.420]   You can just get feedback from people
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.660]   that you think you can help.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.640]   That's pretty detailed about it.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:58.100]   And then grow it is how do you set up your social media?
[00:22:58.100 --> 00:22:59.020]   How do you set up your email list,
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:00.220]   which everyone should do?
[00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:01.900]   And then setting up your growth machine
[00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:03.540]   to make this stuff on repeat.
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:05.020]   That's the million dollar weekend at a high level.
[00:23:05.020 --> 00:23:06.740]   And you have someone like McKenzie
[00:23:06.740 --> 00:23:09.020]   who quit a very high-paying job.
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:10.580]   I did not recommend that.
[00:23:10.580 --> 00:23:13.240]   And in one year was able to get to around $50,000.
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.380]   And I have a friend, he works at Amazon.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.640]   He makes 400K, which is very common.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.100]   I mean, okay, 400K is a lot.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:21.740]   But let's just say 120K or something like that.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:23.580]   And he started a side hustle.
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.420]   And in his first year, he made a thousand bucks,
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:27.660]   which is great.
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.900]   And he quit.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.740]   And the question that I always think about for myself is,
[00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:34.820]   what is the 10 years from now Noah gonna thank me for?
[00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:36.540]   And for him, if he would have stuck with that,
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:38.220]   this was a few years ago now,
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.820]   I promise that for him and for everyone out there,
[00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.520]   if you can find something that actually works,
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.940]   which it was working for him,
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.140]   he was making content about food.
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:47.620]   You know, these like food cooking shows?
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:48.460]   - Yeah.
[00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:49.900]   - If he would have stuck with it, it was working.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:50.740]   You know, five years from now,
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   that could have easily surpassed the amount of revenue
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:53.700]   that he's getting in his day job.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.020]   And you keep both, or he can have that option
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:57.460]   to do that full-time if he wants.
[00:23:57.460 --> 00:24:00.900]   - I found firsthand, you don't have to give it up, right?
[00:24:00.900 --> 00:24:03.700]   I was working for 18 months while doing this.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:06.940]   And when you talked about pre-selling, it was interesting.
[00:24:06.940 --> 00:24:09.100]   There are some businesses like what we're doing,
[00:24:09.100 --> 00:24:11.740]   we're selling, you know, the person who might pay the bill
[00:24:11.740 --> 00:24:13.620]   isn't the person, the audience.
[00:24:13.620 --> 00:24:16.340]   But what I did when I started was I made a trailer
[00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:19.020]   and I was like, will anyone subscribe to this podcast
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.900]   after hearing just the trailer?
[00:24:20.900 --> 00:24:22.500]   I didn't even have to make an episode.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.380]   - I love that.
[00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:25.900]   - I recorded a one minute trailer, two minute trailer,
[00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:28.100]   and was like, this is what this show's about.
[00:24:28.100 --> 00:24:30.180]   And fortunately, Apple and Spotify will show you.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.620]   Like, did you get followers?
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:33.900]   Did people say, I wanna see what happens next?
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:34.780]   Give that example.
[00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:37.180]   - So I'm guessing you follow kind of the same playbook
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:38.980]   I'm gonna recommend in the book and beyond.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:40.860]   And again, I think people think it's so simple.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.580]   They're like, no, but I gotta make it more complicated.
[00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:43.820]   Right, isn't this stuff supposed to be fancy?
[00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:45.780]   It's like, yes, it eventually gets fancy.
[00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:48.060]   Right, like AppSumo now has a 20 person engineering team,
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.180]   20 person plus marketing team.
[00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.900]   But it starts that you just kind of post it on there
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.940]   and then you tell some friends
[00:24:52.940 --> 00:24:54.180]   and then you kind of do that a little bit more
[00:24:54.180 --> 00:24:55.020]   and a little bit more.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.060]   So there's other parts of the process.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:24:59.780]   But I think people wanna, not trick,
[00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.420]   but make you believe it's much more complicated
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:04.020]   and people are further away skill-wise than they think.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:06.860]   And I've seen so many smart people stuck in jobs
[00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:08.340]   that are, if not better than me,
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.060]   and skilled just as good as me,
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:12.380]   they just have been a little bit more afraid than me.
[00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.480]   And if they just do some small things today,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.260]   I think they'll be shocked at their confidence
[00:25:16.260 --> 00:25:17.860]   and their abilities of what they can actually do.
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:19.100]   For yourself with your podcast,
[00:25:19.100 --> 00:25:20.580]   how did you get your first few listeners?
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.300]   I don't think you just posted it and prayed.
[00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.540]   - Basically, I had like six or seven projects
[00:25:24.540 --> 00:25:25.500]   that had email lists.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.020]   And I was like, okay, well, when I launched this thing,
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:29.100]   I'm just gonna email all these people.
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:30.740]   And someone was like, "Well, if you do that,
[00:25:30.740 --> 00:25:32.820]   "they might get upset and report you as spam."
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:33.940]   I was like, "Why do you even have a newsletter?"
[00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.200]   But they had subscribed and opted into something.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:38.100]   So I felt that was okay. - Exactly.
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:40.900]   - And then it started when a friend of mine,
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:42.800]   I told him, I was like, "I was thinking of starting a podcast."
[00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.580]   He was interviewing me about something random
[00:25:44.580 --> 00:25:46.100]   on his podcast.
[00:25:46.100 --> 00:25:48.240]   And he was like, "Pause."
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.620]   And then like kind of, he goes,
[00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.140]   "All right, I want you to go home
[00:25:51.140 --> 00:25:53.360]   "and record a one-minute trailer.
[00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.980]   "And then we'll just splice it in."
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.020]   And so I spliced in this audio that was like,
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.020]   "All right, so the podcast is called this."
[00:25:59.020 --> 00:26:02.100]   I only had two days to name this podcast
[00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:04.620]   because he interviewed me about the podcast
[00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:05.740]   and he's like, "I need a name.
[00:26:05.740 --> 00:26:07.300]   "I need you to send me an audio file."
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:09.700]   So I was forced, I don't know if it was a weekend,
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.420]   but I was forced in like 48 hours to name the podcast
[00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:14.760]   and set up a website and create a trailer
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:15.600]   and put it up there.
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.460]   But I hadn't lined up an interview at all.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:20.880]   - Well, I think most people get it wrong
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.100]   is that that's what they believe they have to do first.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:24.220]   They're like, "All right, well, I need to go learn
[00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:25.320]   "how to even set up a website.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.420]   "Now I gotta waste time on that.
[00:26:26.420 --> 00:26:27.640]   "And then I gotta pay for domain.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:29.180]   "And then I need to do this and this and this."
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:30.780]   And no, just put out a trailer,
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:32.780]   send it to friends and see if anyone subscribes.
[00:26:32.780 --> 00:26:35.440]   If people do, great, now do all these other things.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.600]   Most people just do it backwards.
[00:26:36.600 --> 00:26:38.700]   And I think that's been a big misconception.
[00:26:38.700 --> 00:26:41.300]   Like there's a guy, Jake, who read the book
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.340]   and he has three kids, day job, very common.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:46.840]   He's had the same idea for 24 months.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:48.800]   He wanted to be a good example to his kids.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:49.940]   That's what he told me.
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:51.980]   So I read the book and in a weekend,
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.260]   which he was like, "Yeah, it's worth it."
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:55.340]   I asked him what he would tell others.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:56.660]   He's like, "It's just worth it."
[00:26:56.660 --> 00:26:58.740]   He didn't want to wonder what if.
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:26:59.780]   And I thought that was amazing.
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:02.260]   And in one weekend, he was able to validate
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:05.100]   his golf trips for guys business.
[00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:05.940]   What a unique idea.
[00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:07.100]   And now he has five customers.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.740]   They've paid $15,000, I think $3,000 each.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.460]   And he's aiming to get eight of them.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.620]   And in August of this year,
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.140]   he's gonna take these guys on a golf trip someplace.
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:18.140]   I don't know anything about golf, but some course.
[00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:19.380]   (laughs)
[00:27:19.380 --> 00:27:21.260]   And I think he's gonna make, I don't know, 5K,
[00:27:21.260 --> 00:27:22.140]   give or take for himself.
[00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:22.980]   And guess what?
[00:27:22.980 --> 00:27:23.800]   That's the start.
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.640]   And that's amazing.
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.700]   - And he didn't quit his job to do it.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.540]   - No, he still has his job.
[00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:27.660]   And I was like, "Do you have any social media?"
[00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:28.580]   He's like, "No."
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:30.540]   He's like, "I have my email address."
[00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:34.340]   So I think it was like jakemdw.311.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:35.960]   Anyways, message me and I'll put you in touch with Jake
[00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:38.180]   if you like golf trips and wanna have fun with other dudes.
[00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:39.220]   - Well, one thing you didn't say,
[00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.380]   but I know you said in the book 'cause I read it,
[00:27:41.380 --> 00:27:43.460]   was you have to love the thing
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:44.620]   and it makes it so much easier.
[00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.740]   Maybe you don't have to, but it really helped.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.180]   I often tell people they're thinking of ideas.
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.740]   I'm like, "What would you go do for free?"
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:51.860]   Look at your internet history.
[00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:53.620]   Where did you spend all of your time?
[00:27:53.620 --> 00:27:56.940]   If you love going, researching X, Y, and Z,
[00:27:56.940 --> 00:27:59.200]   is there something that you could do there?
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:03.620]   And for me, everyone I knew was always like,
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:04.580]   "You always do all this homework.
[00:28:04.580 --> 00:28:05.980]   "Can you just tell me the answer?"
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:08.900]   Like, I would go to a dinner table and someone's like,
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:10.040]   "Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know you know
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.040]   "all the credit card stuff.
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:12.260]   "Can you just tell me which one to get?
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:13.760]   "Or can you just tell me
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.620]   "what insurance is the right policy?"
[00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.760]   And I was like, "Oh, what if I just did all this research
[00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:19.600]   "and shared it?
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   "Or what if instead of doing the research,
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.440]   "I interviewed the people while I was doing it
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.260]   "and shared it?"
[00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:27.620]   And so I think it didn't start with the ambition
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.420]   of being a full-time job or anything.
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.340]   It just started as a thing that I liked doing.
[00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.380]   And in fact, it actually started
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:36.860]   as an idea of a parenting podcast.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.900]   And one of my pieces of advice I'll give people,
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.980]   friends are often too nice.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.820]   And so I told people, I was like,
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:44.580]   "Oh, I'm gonna start this parenting podcast."
[00:28:44.580 --> 00:28:46.700]   'Cause right before we had our first child,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:49.140]   I got really into going down all these rabbit holes
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.800]   of parenting research.
[00:28:50.800 --> 00:28:53.060]   And I was researching strollers.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.820]   I think that I have the most comprehensive
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:28:57.400]   stroller comparison database and spreadsheet
[00:28:57.400 --> 00:28:59.220]   that exists out in the world.
[00:28:59.220 --> 00:29:00.620]   It's about three years out of date,
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:03.280]   but for circa 2020, it's the best.
[00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:05.700]   And I had gotten caught up in the fact
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:07.560]   that I love doing all this research and thinking,
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:08.900]   "Wow, I'm doing it on this topic.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:11.740]   "I should start a podcast on this topic."
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:14.240]   And everyone I knew was like, "That's a great idea."
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.980]   And then I was like, "You know what?"
[00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:18.420]   After we had the kid and we bought the stroller
[00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:20.720]   and we bought all the items, I was like,
[00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:22.500]   "I think I liked researching things
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.100]   "more than I liked that topic solely."
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.580]   And I was like, "What if I just did it about all the hacks
[00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.100]   "and it was just me researching everything?"
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:30.820]   And all my friends said, "Oh, that's so much better.
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:32.420]   "That's exactly who you are."
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:33.660]   And I was like, "Well, then why didn't you
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.640]   "tell me that before?"
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:38.700]   So I like the fact that instead of texting your friends
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:40.500]   and saying, "What do you think of X?"
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:42.040]   Ask them first.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:44.580]   Because I've found in the past that if you tell them
[00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:46.700]   you wanna do something, they're often either
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:49.380]   completely dismissive or completely supportive.
[00:29:49.380 --> 00:29:50.940]   And it's very hard for them to think,
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:52.220]   "Oh, well, that's great,
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:54.440]   "but this other thing might be better."
[00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:55.620]   - A common theme I've heard,
[00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:56.460]   "Find something you love,
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.980]   "you never work a day in your life."
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:30:00.180]   I think that's said by people who actually like their jobs
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:02.860]   and there's people who, I'd say 80% don't.
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:04.740]   And then what they'll do to avoid it is like,
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:06.800]   "Well, I wouldn't wanna do that for a living.
[00:30:06.800 --> 00:30:08.820]   "I like researching a lot, but that's just more my hobby."
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:10.060]   And it's like, you know what happens in business
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.360]   as you get going, you don't do any of the actual work.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.220]   Which is counterintuitive.
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.160]   Like, you know the last time I got an AppSumo deal?
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:19.640]   2011, right?
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.360]   Right, you know, like, it's been 13 years.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.840]   And I remember someone saying that and I was like,
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.680]   "Oh, interesting.
[00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.920]   "So don't trade your time for money,
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.400]   "trade your money for someone else's time."
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.080]   And that's how business happens.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.660]   And if you do enjoy it, frankly, you're like,
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:33.400]   "Hey, actually, no, I like customer support.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:34.560]   "I like all these areas."
[00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.520]   Great, but it doesn't always have to be that case.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.340]   And I love your highlight of find something
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.880]   that you just enjoy doing.
[00:30:39.880 --> 00:30:41.880]   I always like the idea too, if you have a million dollars,
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:43.020]   like I send you a million dollars today,
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.380]   what are you doing tomorrow?
[00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.320]   I am doing it.
[00:30:45.320 --> 00:30:47.220]   I'm doing it.
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:48.060]   I'm talking about a book,
[00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.500]   'cause this is what I wish I would have had
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:50.320]   when I was getting started.
[00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:51.900]   I get to promote deals on AppSumo.
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:53.700]   Like, I get to make YouTube content
[00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:55.660]   or interview rich people and ask how they did it.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:57.300]   I don't know, like, I can't believe it.
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:30:58.700]   Most days, I can't believe this is my career.
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:01.300]   I like type on a keyboard and like money comes.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:03.820]   And then I also recognize that it started as a hobby.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.900]   I think that's a big thing people don't think of.
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:07.700]   They're like, "No, no, it's gotta be a million dollar
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:08.540]   "crazy thing."
[00:31:08.540 --> 00:31:11.520]   I don't know, most big billion trillion dollar businesses
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:14.320]   started as just curiosity, right?
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:17.160]   Airbnb, one of my favorite examples, started in a weekend.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:18.000]   They emailed people saying,
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.140]   "Hey, does anyone wanna stay at our couch
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.200]   "for this design conference in SF?"
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.600]   Someone did.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:24.620]   Hmm, that's kind of interesting.
[00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:26.320]   They weren't setting out to change, you know,
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:27.720]   annoy everybody in the world
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.420]   and make the world kind of cooler.
[00:31:29.420 --> 00:31:32.320]   And same thing with a lot of these other businesses.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.800]   - I was talking to a mentor of mine.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.560]   Well, I might get back on the show, Andy Ratcliffe,
[00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:39.060]   who started Wealthfront and he told me two things
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:39.900]   that are pretty relevant.
[00:31:39.900 --> 00:31:42.240]   One, he's like, "I've done a lot of investing in my career.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.300]   "At the earliest stage, I honestly don't even know
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:47.420]   "if the idea matters at all.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.380]   "The idea might change, the idea might evolve.
[00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:51.640]   "People haven't really baked it.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.680]   "It's really about how excited is a person about this idea
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:56.220]   "and how driven are they?"
[00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.400]   And then he said, "And the one skill I value the most
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:01.140]   "is intellectual curiosity."
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:04.300]   He just wants people that are excited about a thing
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:05.800]   and wanna learn more about it.
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:07.860]   And he's like, "That is something I really value."
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.260]   And so, you know, it made me think,
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:12.020]   "Oh, we're having this conversation today.
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:13.620]   "That was a couple of days ago."
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:14.920]   What are you just curious about?
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:15.740]   Like, what are the things
[00:32:15.740 --> 00:32:17.620]   that you just can't stop thinking about?
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:20.660]   And how could you solve some problem?
[00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:23.980]   Again, I spent a career also in product management.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.140]   Forget about solutions.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.300]   Just figure out what people are having problems with.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:28.940]   Ask them what's wrong in their day.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:29.880]   I love this exercise.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.100]   Walk through a friend's day and just be like,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.100]   "All right, tell me everything that sucked
[00:32:34.100 --> 00:32:35.340]   "in lots of details."
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.200]   Like, okay, you were making breakfast.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.320]   What would have made breakfast less frustrating?
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:40.160]   I don't know.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.780]   My cast iron skillet's always hot.
[00:32:41.780 --> 00:32:44.300]   I don't know what the idea is right now.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:46.920]   I forgot to turn the stove off, which I did this morning.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.500]   When it comes to building wealth,
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:52.180]   taxes are such a big part of the strategy.
[00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.860]   And even if you've already filed,
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.320]   being proactive about this year
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.020]   to lower your future liability is so important.
[00:32:58.020 --> 00:32:59.680]   And now that I'm working with Gelt,
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.860]   I finally feel like I have a partner I can trust
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:05.180]   to handle everything for my business and personal taxes.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.660]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:10.260]   Think of Gelt as the ultimate modern CPA.
[00:33:10.260 --> 00:33:12.680]   They not only offer an amazing tech platform
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:14.280]   that gives you personalized guidance
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:17.140]   to maximize deductions, tax credits, and savings,
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:19.820]   but also everything is backed by an in-house team
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:22.080]   of expert CPAs who can recommend
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.980]   the most effective tax strategies
[00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:26.180]   to minimize risk and grow your wealth.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:27.060]   And best of all,
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.220]   you can have this transparent open communication
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.020]   with your team in whatever way works best for you,
[00:33:32.020 --> 00:33:34.340]   whether that's on their platform, over email,
[00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:36.540]   in Slack, or scheduling a call.
[00:33:36.540 --> 00:33:37.820]   Finally, my favorite story
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:39.900]   is that when we first onboarded with Gelt,
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:41.420]   they reviewed our past returns
[00:33:41.420 --> 00:33:44.220]   and found a huge mistake our prior CPA had made.
[00:33:44.220 --> 00:33:47.100]   So they refiled and got us back all that money.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.980]   So if you're ready for a more premium,
[00:33:48.980 --> 00:33:52.580]   proactive tax strategy to optimize and file your taxes,
[00:33:52.580 --> 00:33:54.460]   you have to check out Gelt.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:55.920]   And as an All The Hacks listener,
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.460]   you can skip the wait list and get started today.
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:34:02.780]   Just head to allthehacks.com/Gelt, G-E-L-T.
[00:34:02.780 --> 00:34:06.640]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/G-E-L-T.
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:10.300]   It seems like with every business,
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.640]   you get to a certain size and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:16.500]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:18.860]   and you have too many manual processes
[00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.060]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:24.060]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers,
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.380]   37,025, one.
[00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:29.660]   37,000, that's the number of businesses
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:31.940]   which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.580]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:37.140]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system,
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.300]   streamlining accounting, financial management,
[00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:41.580]   inventory, HR, and more.
[00:34:41.580 --> 00:34:44.500]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:48.340]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less,
[00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:52.420]   close their books in days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.740]   And one, because your business is one of a kind,
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:59.100]   so you get a customized solution for all your KPIs

[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.300]   which I can tell you from all the companies I've run,
[00:35:11.300 --> 00:35:13.500]   makes everything so much better.

[00:35:54.380 --> 00:35:55.220]   Let's take a little turn.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.020]   You mentioned you've interviewed a lot of millionaires,
[00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:57.940]   billionaires.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.340]   What are some of the lessons you've learned
[00:35:59.340 --> 00:36:00.780]   from all those conversations?
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:02.300]   - I've also worked for them, right?
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:05.740]   So one thing I've noticed is that
[00:36:05.740 --> 00:36:08.660]   I think we all imagine that they're better than us.
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:10.420]   And when you actually meet millionaires,
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.420]   or multi-millionaires, or billionaires,
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.940]   nope, not really.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.620]   And that's beautiful, right?
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:18.020]   'Cause that means that everyone has a chance
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.540]   to create whatever life they want.
[00:36:19.540 --> 00:36:20.420]   There are gifted people.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:22.620]   Like Zuckerberg is definitely smarter than most people.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.780]   Bill Gates, who I've worked for, is smarter than most people.
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:26.300]   Peter Thiel, who I've gotten to hang out with a little bit,
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:27.620]   smarter than most people.
[00:36:27.620 --> 00:36:29.900]   But there's also a lot of billionaires, Larry Janeski.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:31.060]   I would say he's very smart,
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.060]   but he's also a pretty normal guy,
[00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:34.980]   that I think a lot of us can do.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.880]   Now, I would say some of the things in common
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:41.620]   between them is that most of them got rich off one thing,
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.220]   but all of us diversify.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.980]   (laughs)
[00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:46.180]   Right, it's actually counterintuitive.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:47.220]   They're like, diversify, diversify,
[00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.740]   but they only really got rich one way.
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:51.500]   You know, go look at any of these rich person lists.
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.060]   You know, it's either real estate or it's tech.
[00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:55.060]   You know, outside of inheritance,
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.300]   it's almost exclusively one thing.
[00:36:57.300 --> 00:36:59.980]   They stick with it for extraordinary long periods of time.
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:00.820]   Extraordinary.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.740]   And I think, you know, especially with your show, Chris,
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.380]   we talk about what to choose for stocks or index funds,
[00:37:05.380 --> 00:37:06.980]   things like that, and investing.
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.900]   You know, think about compound business.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.940]   So sticking with something for 20 years.
[00:37:10.940 --> 00:37:12.580]   Like, you've been doing your show three years?
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:14.580]   Think about it in 30 years.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.700]   Right, like how big that will be,
[00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:16.540]   where each year you're just like,
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:17.620]   getting a little better at your craft,
[00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:18.580]   getting a little more popular,
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:20.180]   and you just stick with it and stick with it.
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:22.300]   And all these guys got rich to become billionaires
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.500]   in around 20 years,
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:26.700]   which I think is super, super interesting.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.660]   I like John Paul DeGioia a lot.
[00:37:28.660 --> 00:37:31.340]   I don't know if all of them were happy.
[00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:32.500]   A lot of them seemed to have regret
[00:37:32.500 --> 00:37:34.180]   that they didn't spend more time with their family.
[00:37:34.180 --> 00:37:36.180]   I'm glad I got to learn that from them.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:37.180]   But I would say John Paul DeGioia
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:39.060]   seemed like he had the right balance,
[00:37:39.060 --> 00:37:40.740]   where, and as I said earlier, you know,
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.180]   the book starts with how to get good at asking.
[00:37:42.180 --> 00:37:43.660]   He said that the most important skill
[00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:46.980]   that he's ever had is sales, which is really asking.
[00:37:46.980 --> 00:37:49.140]   And I liked his approach of businesses,
[00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.020]   which he said, find the best product
[00:37:51.020 --> 00:37:52.900]   that you really love in a category
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:54.860]   that needs to be reordered,
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.620]   and just do that for a very long period of time.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.740]   And so he did tequila, Patron,
[00:37:59.740 --> 00:38:00.820]   sold out for three and a half billion,
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.700]   'cause you keep, I guess people keep drinking,
[00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:04.300]   and then he did haircare, Paul Mitchell Haircare,
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:06.860]   which you keep using haircare.
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:08.300]   And then I'd say the last thing specifically,
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:09.460]   especially from him,
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:12.380]   'cause a lot of these guys seem frustrated
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.620]   or seem like they're chasing still more sometimes,
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.500]   which I was like, oh, I don't want that.
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:18.340]   He seemed just kind.
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.820]   He seemed really, really kind.
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:21.980]   I really admired that.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:24.380]   He was kind with me, his staff was kind,
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.500]   he was kind to the other people that were filming.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.100]   The day he sold Patron,
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:30.300]   he gave a $50 million check to charity.
[00:38:30.300 --> 00:38:32.180]   He seemed genuinely kind with himself
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.020]   and then kind with others,
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:35.540]   and that's something I've worked on in the past few years,
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:37.180]   and I love that from him.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.900]   - Yeah, I had a great conversation with Gary V.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:41.660]   about kindness and just how he thinks
[00:38:41.660 --> 00:38:45.580]   it's the most underrated business skill in the market.
[00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:48.100]   - I think self-kindness is probably underrated.
[00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.540]   I think we're all disgusting to ourselves.
[00:38:51.540 --> 00:38:53.780]   I think we're really harsh on ourselves,
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.060]   and that's something I've definitely worked on.
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.340]   I try to think of underrated skills.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.460]   I'll tell you, underrated skill is gift-giving.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:02.100]   Super underrated in business.
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:03.500]   So, so underrated.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:05.220]   And as well, doing the work for people
[00:39:05.220 --> 00:39:07.820]   you want to have help from or people you want to ask.
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.820]   If you want to come on someone's show,
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:10.780]   I could have even done more for you,
[00:39:10.780 --> 00:39:12.220]   even though we just met yesterday,
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:13.700]   or we connected yesterday,
[00:39:13.700 --> 00:39:16.500]   but hey, let me come back with ideas for you.
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.420]   Or, I was able to meet the people from CNBC,
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:20.180]   so I'm coming on the show Make It,
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:22.740]   and the guy loves his new dog.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:24.460]   And so I asked someone who loves dogs
[00:39:24.460 --> 00:39:25.860]   for what's the coolest dog toy,
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.660]   and so it's this thing from Fable
[00:39:27.660 --> 00:39:30.420]   where it spits out dog food as a game.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:33.380]   So it's a little gift thing, like 50 bucks.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:35.860]   Like, that's gonna create a cool relationship for life.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:36.940]   So I think those are kind of two things
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:38.660]   that I would say are definitely underrated
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.900]   in a business, or frankly, in life.
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.340]   - Now that I'm just thinking about
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.060]   ways that you've changed your life,
[00:39:45.060 --> 00:39:47.540]   how does your routine look on a day-to-day basis
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:49.460]   in terms of when you're doing business,
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:51.380]   when you're spending time on yourself,
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:53.420]   your partner, your health?
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:56.180]   - Yeah, I think a lot of the more morning routine content
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:57.380]   is very overrated.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:40:00.100]   I think it's so overrated.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:03.020]   It's like, oh, get up and meditate and fucking journal,
[00:40:03.020 --> 00:40:05.460]   sorry, freaking journal, and then drink whatever,
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:07.100]   I don't know, people don't drink Bulletproof coffee anymore,
[00:40:07.100 --> 00:40:08.900]   I don't know, whatever the new coffee fat is,
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.140]   and then, I don't know,
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.220]   jump in a cold shower and all that crap.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.260]   What I found is just look at the days
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.100]   that worked out well for you
[00:40:15.100 --> 00:40:17.380]   and try to have common elements between 'em.
[00:40:17.380 --> 00:40:19.180]   So what I have recognized is like,
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.620]   I do like journaling on Monday morning, that works out,
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.180]   and I've copied that from the book "Artist's Way,"
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:24.900]   which is amazing, if you haven't read it,
[00:40:24.900 --> 00:40:27.620]   I highly recommend, about how to be a creative person.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.620]   So I do that on Monday mornings,
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:31.180]   and I don't eat until 12, 'cause it makes me feel like,
[00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.780]   okay, it's good to feel a little hungry sometimes,
[00:40:32.780 --> 00:40:33.860]   so that's Mondays.
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:34.740]   And then the rest of my week,
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:36.700]   I don't do anything else before noon.
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:37.540]   That's every day.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:38.740]   I'm trying to think of high-level things
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:39.980]   that I can recommend for most people.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:41.180]   I color-code my calendar,
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.620]   I think that's probably one of the cooler things
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.460]   that people can do,
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.340]   and it's really just showing you your asset allocation
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:48.380]   or your time allocation, if you think about it,
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:50.540]   where, all right, how much did I spend with my family,
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:51.620]   how much did I spend in fitness,
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.780]   how much did I spend at work, how much did I spend myself,
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:55.620]   and a lot of my stuff is on repeat.
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.780]   So I know that every Monday, I'm gonna have a journal,
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:40:58.620]   it's in my calendar.
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:00.700]   Every month, I have my monthly personal finance review
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.380]   on my Google spreadsheet.
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:04.020]   Let's say other routine stuff,
[00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:05.380]   maybe just high-level two other ones
[00:41:05.380 --> 00:41:07.180]   that people can copy that I found.
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:10.340]   I do a weekly review on Fridays, every single Friday.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:11.860]   That's been a game-changer,
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.260]   where I evaluate how did I show up as a leader,
[00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:15.900]   one through five, and why.
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.620]   How was my emotional consistency?
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:19.220]   I've noticed sometimes, like even yesterday,
[00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.300]   I was a little bully, I would say sometimes,
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.020]   and I was like, ooh, I don't like that.
[00:41:23.020 --> 00:41:24.540]   And then the last one on Fridays is,
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.500]   what are the three things you wanna do next week?
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.620]   And then every Sunday,
[00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:29.740]   I take the three things I wanna do next week
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:32.740]   and work with my chief of staff to really help schedule
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.180]   and color-code the things I'm working on
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.220]   in this upcoming week.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.060]   Morning routines, frankly,
[00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:38.040]   just don't drink too late at night,
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.220]   and then try to go to bed relatively early.
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:42.220]   That, you're gonna have a pretty damn great routine
[00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:43.060]   in the morning.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.620]   I've noticed I use the Oura Ring,
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.100]   and people have done a bunch of stuff,
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.060]   but ultimately, it really comes down to that.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:48.980]   Counterintuitively, by the way,
[00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:50.180]   I think there's gonna be a big trend
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:53.380]   that wives and husbands tend to sleep in separate rooms.
[00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:55.580]   'Cause I think when your partner gets you up,
[00:41:55.580 --> 00:41:56.900]   and you're like, oh man, I did not sleep as well.
[00:41:56.900 --> 00:41:59.100]   But I think there's just too much friction on that.
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:00.420]   - I did an episode on sleep,
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:02.820]   and I can't remember the interviewee,
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:03.980]   but a couple weeks ago,
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:05.820]   and I asked a question about sleeping with your partner,
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.340]   and she's like, I interviewed the world's expert
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.820]   on sleeping.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.060]   There's some book that this person wrote,
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:12.980]   and she interviewed it.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.220]   I'll put a link in the show notes,
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:17.740]   but it was all about how do you optimize your sleep
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.740]   when you're also trying to consider the fact
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.180]   that you have another human in the bed,
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:23.120]   and what's the right tactic here?
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.140]   I have not listened to the episode, full disclosure,
[00:42:25.140 --> 00:42:26.420]   so I can't endorse it.
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:28.180]   - I mean, I think the same thing for Million Dollar Weekend,
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:30.380]   the same thing about how I run AppSumo.com,
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.740]   and the same thing with these routines is experiment.
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:34.620]   That's all it comes down to,
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:36.820]   and experiments can fail, but experiments can work.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:39.660]   And so I've done 30 days of getting up at five.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.200]   I've done 30 days of no caffeine.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.880]   I've done meditation every day,
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:44.900]   and then noticing, 'cause everyone's different,
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:46.900]   noticing what's the formula.
[00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:49.180]   You're like, oh man, when I can go biking in the morning,
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.540]   great, or I can jump in the sauna, great,
[00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:53.940]   but when I have a morning meeting at 10, I'm pretty angry,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:55.020]   'cause I didn't create a business
[00:42:55.020 --> 00:42:56.540]   so that I have to do these kind of things,
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:42:58.020]   or I don't want to.
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:42:59.460]   And then just experiment around that
[00:42:59.460 --> 00:43:01.060]   and seeing how you can create, frankly,
[00:43:01.060 --> 00:43:03.220]   the life and week you wanna live.
[00:43:03.220 --> 00:43:05.700]   And Jake, who read the book,
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:07.660]   he said something to me that was really powerful,
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:09.580]   and I've been thinking about it every day
[00:43:09.580 --> 00:43:11.340]   since a few months ago.
[00:43:11.340 --> 00:43:14.060]   He said, "Have stuff in your calendar you look forward to.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:15.060]   "Put it in the calendar.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:16.140]   "Put a date night in the calendar.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.840]   "Put a workout in the calendar.
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   "And if you don't have anything in life
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.780]   "you're excited about, put it in the calendar."
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:22.060]   That really stuck with me.
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:23.900]   - I literally today just put a recurring,
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:25.640]   monthly date night on the calendar, so.
[00:43:25.640 --> 00:43:26.480]   - Hell yeah.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:27.820]   That was actually, that was a business
[00:43:27.820 --> 00:43:30.700]   from a buddy last week, Date Night Nannies,
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:32.660]   where they help you suggest either a date night
[00:43:32.660 --> 00:43:34.100]   in every month or weekly.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.700]   You can subscribe to different amounts.
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.500]   Have that as an opportunity.
[00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:38.980]   Well, yeah, it's kind of an interesting business.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:40.940]   - A big takeaway for me, reading the book,
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.540]   talking to you, is just there's this,
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.180]   especially in the Bay Area,
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:48.180]   but this belief that entrepreneurship
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:52.780]   is a career versus an option.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:53.620]   I don't know what the,
[00:43:53.620 --> 00:43:55.020]   the option's probably the wrong word,
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:56.220]   but you don't have to choose
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:58.580]   between entrepreneurship and employment.
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.300]   And if you do, you can punt on that decision.
[00:44:01.300 --> 00:44:02.980]   There's a thousand things you can do
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:06.020]   when you want to explore an idea,
[00:44:06.020 --> 00:44:07.620]   as you say, in a weekend,
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.820]   way before you have to decide quitting your job,
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:11.140]   way before you have to raise money,
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.980]   build a product, and all this stuff.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:16.940]   And I think so many people often get turned around.
[00:44:16.940 --> 00:44:18.840]   And if anyone out there,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.380]   just because I've taken this phone call like 10 times,
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.320]   so I started a company doing financial planning online,
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:27.860]   and we raised money, spent a few years,
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:30.580]   and realized that the reason why that business
[00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:35.180]   is so hard to build is solely that it is almost impossible
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:39.000]   to acquire customers at any fast cadence.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.620]   Because people all want to change their finances,
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.780]   they all want to improve their financial life,
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:46.900]   but they just don't want to do it right now.
[00:44:46.900 --> 00:44:50.700]   And so what we learned, in the worst way possible,
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.180]   but I'll come back and I'll give a lesson,
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.060]   is that we asked people,
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:55.980]   "Do you want to do this? Put $100 down."
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:58.060]   And we got all these people to put $100 down.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:45:00.340]   And so we were like, "Wow, there's real demand."
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.180]   The challenge is then we said,
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:03.020]   "All right, let's get started. Do you want to pay the rest?"
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.580]   And they're like, "No, not now."
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:06.220]   And we were like, "Oh, we'll give you your $100 back."
[00:45:06.220 --> 00:45:08.140]   And they said, "No, no, no, don't give us the $100 back.
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:10.260]   We want to do this. We just don't want to do it now."
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.900]   And converting people off that wait list
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.260]   was almost impossible.
[00:45:13.260 --> 00:45:14.900]   So a lot of these founders call me and they say,
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:16.020]   "Hey, I want to start a company.
[00:45:16.020 --> 00:45:17.980]   We want to do online financial planning."
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.180]   And I'm like, "Stop everything,
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.100]   and just find out if you can acquire people.
[00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:25.980]   Like, can you sell this in a way that you could repeat?
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.180]   And if not, don't go hire the engineering team.
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:29.500]   Don't go build the product."
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:31.580]   And it just got me thinking,
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.660]   especially reflecting on the last 24 hours
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:37.180]   of prepping for this conversation,
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:39.460]   if I had spent a weekend just validating
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:42.820]   whether there were ways to sell financial planning
[00:45:42.820 --> 00:45:45.940]   and close the client quickly, per se,
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:47.740]   I probably wouldn't have even needed to start the company
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.420]   because at the end of the day,
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.340]   the challenge is people aren't ready to start now.
[00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:54.340]   And if you just listen to the problem,
[00:45:54.340 --> 00:45:56.020]   the problem is, "Oh, I need to fix this.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.020]   I need to fix this."
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.020]   But if you don't actually take whether,
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:00.700]   I think it's step two in your process
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:02.940]   to actually validate that the thing you want to do
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:05.620]   will solve the problem and work,
[00:46:05.620 --> 00:46:07.060]   you kind of get lost.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:08.900]   - How many of your audience is in Silicon Valley?
[00:46:08.900 --> 00:46:11.660]   - Definitely the minority, but I'd say for sub 5%,
[00:46:11.660 --> 00:46:13.980]   but definitely my experience, at least.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:15.580]   - It's interesting as a lot of people have heard that advice,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:17.580]   you know, get going and, but then they don't.
[00:46:17.580 --> 00:46:18.780]   And then it's like, well, what's happening there?
[00:46:18.780 --> 00:46:19.980]   And they're afraid.
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.780]   And so how do we do it in small, fun ways,
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:23.700]   kind of almost games where it's like, okay,
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.540]   if you fail, fine,
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:27.260]   at least you're starting to feel more confident.
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.140]   Now I saw a Silicon Valley company called Artifacts,
[00:46:30.140 --> 00:46:31.300]   I think it's what it's called,
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.060]   raised three and a half million dollars
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:36.260]   and they'll film a video of your grandma or grandpa,
[00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.380]   papi.
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:39.820]   And I was like, I could have easily found out in a weekend
[00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.340]   that whole business, I didn't need to raise any money.
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.540]   I could literally,
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:45.580]   everyone's got a grandfather and grandmother or parent.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:47.900]   You can contact people in your network.
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.900]   Hey, can I film your grandfather or grandfather?
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.500]   I'll go to their house or Zoom 'em for half the price.
[00:46:52.500 --> 00:46:55.380]   And I could record and create a memory capsule for you.
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.660]   I could make more than $3 million in the next few years
[00:46:57.660 --> 00:47:00.660]   before I even have some complicated Silicon Valley website.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:02.740]   And it was just a cool reminder
[00:47:02.740 --> 00:47:05.260]   that this didn't really apply in a lot of different areas.
[00:47:05.260 --> 00:47:07.340]   And guess what, if no one wanted it, if I called up,
[00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.300]   I don't know, maybe I can call up Chris
[00:47:09.300 --> 00:47:11.140]   as someone in my network, like you have,
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:13.740]   probably you have parents, see if that's a problem,
[00:47:13.740 --> 00:47:15.260]   see if you even want to pay for it.
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.540]   And if you don't, great, I didn't go and raise money,
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:20.140]   build a pitch deck to build something that no one wants.
[00:47:20.140 --> 00:47:22.380]   - Also, there's a lot of companies that raise so much money
[00:47:22.380 --> 00:47:25.540]   that the business doesn't work at the scale.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:28.500]   So let's pretend that this company goes out of business,
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:30.460]   might not actually mean it's a bad idea.
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:32.220]   Someone listening to this podcast right now
[00:47:32.220 --> 00:47:34.380]   might be like, well, let's just start doing this.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.820]   It might not work at the speed and cadence
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:38.340]   investors would want it to be,
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:41.300]   which is why that company could or could not fail.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:42.540]   But that doesn't mean it's not a good business.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.660]   Financial planning is actually a great business.
[00:47:44.660 --> 00:47:46.380]   It's just not a great software business
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.020]   at the scale investors need.
[00:47:48.020 --> 00:47:51.260]   So I am happy that we haven't tried to raise money
[00:47:51.260 --> 00:47:55.100]   to turn this into a venture-backed podcast.
[00:47:55.100 --> 00:47:57.100]   - The reality, it doesn't always work.
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.340]   And people are so close to yeses
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:01.420]   if they just got some nos, right?
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:02.580]   Like if they just started asking,
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.580]   like, hey, I'm gonna try this business,
[00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:05.420]   didn't work, okay, great.
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.340]   But people are giving up way too soon.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.740]   They're all giving up way too soon.
[00:48:08.740 --> 00:48:10.180]   And if they could just wait till they,
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:11.940]   not even wait, keep going, keep going, keep going,
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:13.300]   eventually you will find that thing.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.980]   And I mean, it took me, I think, 20 different business ideas
[00:48:16.980 --> 00:48:18.900]   to finally get to AppSumo that finally worked.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.340]   And I was like, all right, great, it's working.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.660]   My favorite business is the one that works.
[00:48:21.660 --> 00:48:22.740]   I'm just gonna stick with this.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:25.420]   And I would say year after year showing up,
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.220]   it's now producing great dividends.
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:28.940]   And that's available worldwide.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:30.220]   - Well, so one of the skills you mentioned
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:31.820]   was just getting going, right?
[00:48:31.820 --> 00:48:33.980]   And I think in the book, you say now, not how.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.940]   Let's talk about that because I think that's a skill
[00:48:35.940 --> 00:48:38.900]   that applies whether you're starting a company
[00:48:38.900 --> 00:48:40.980]   or whether you're just working on anything.
[00:48:40.980 --> 00:48:42.220]   And it's a skill I'm pretty bad at.
[00:48:42.220 --> 00:48:45.300]   So that's why I'm gonna ask you
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:47.300]   to coach me and people listening.
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.620]   When you have the mind of, oh, great,
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:51.900]   I need to do this thing, take fitness.
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.540]   You're like, oh, I wanna start working out.
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:54.620]   Okay, well, let's go research
[00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:57.340]   what the best training program is.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.900]   Let's go ask 10 of my friends.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:00.220]   Is there maybe a coach I should hire?
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:03.820]   It's like, or just go lift some weights, go on a run.
[00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:06.060]   You seem like someone who also, you wrote a book,
[00:49:06.060 --> 00:49:07.140]   like to do some research,
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.700]   like to put thought behind things.
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:12.740]   How do you contrast that to just get going?
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.900]   - I wanna avoid getting going really fast
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:16.820]   in the wrong direction, right?
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:18.820]   So the whole concept is how do I get going,
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:19.660]   see if it works.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:21.900]   If it works, great, I'm gonna go fast in that direction.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.060]   So what do you think is the last thing you avoided
[00:49:24.060 --> 00:49:24.900]   or you took longer on
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.340]   than maybe you think you have to, needed to or wanted to?
[00:49:27.340 --> 00:49:28.340]   - I mean, I can think of a few things
[00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:29.700]   that I just haven't done yet.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:31.100]   - What are examples of that?
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.420]   - My wife and I talk a lot about,
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:33.740]   and I get lots of emails from people like,
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.100]   gosh, you have such great content.
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:36.860]   Like, why aren't you posting it anywhere else?
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:38.260]   I don't like podcasts.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:39.220]   You can put it in a newsletter.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:40.460]   We started doing that.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.180]   And then someone was like, LinkedIn might be great.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.260]   I'm like, okay, well, maybe I should go figure out
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:47.820]   what the best way to do LinkedIn is.
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:48.660]   I don't know.
[00:49:48.660 --> 00:49:51.260]   I'm using a little bit of an extreme, but also not.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:52.100]   - That's okay.
[00:49:52.100 --> 00:49:57.100]   - My default is like, go master the thing before doing it.
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:01.260]   And even though I know that that's the wrong path,
[00:50:01.260 --> 00:50:02.460]   the right path would be like,
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:03.700]   well, just write something and post it
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:05.020]   and see what people think.
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.460]   But sometimes I have to get out of my own head there.
[00:50:07.460 --> 00:50:10.020]   And so I'm curious if you have any thoughts
[00:50:10.020 --> 00:50:11.780]   on encouraging people who are like,
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.920]   well, I wanna start this thing.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.760]   I wanna think about it.
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:14.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.540]   You could just do it.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:16.900]   - Well, so a few things there,
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:19.060]   but let's just take this LinkedIn as a great example.
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:21.180]   What's held you back from posting it today?
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:25.220]   - Probably not sure what the right format is.
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:28.360]   Not sure what the right topic is.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.500]   Probably a little bit of,
[00:50:29.500 --> 00:50:31.660]   there are professional people there that know me
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.940]   and don't wanna look like an idiot
[00:50:32.940 --> 00:50:35.700]   posting something stupid in front of a professional group.
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.820]   But I don't know, those are a couple.
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:38.660]   - Those are great.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.140]   And that's super common, right?
[00:50:40.140 --> 00:50:40.980]   We're embarrassed.
[00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:42.740]   I remember posting on Facebook
[00:50:42.740 --> 00:50:44.260]   and then this person from high school,
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:47.100]   I knew they saw it and I really felt embarrassed.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:48.980]   Like, oh, what are they thinking of me?
[00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:50.760]   And that's part of what this is about, right?
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   It's finding confidence in ourself through action.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.780]   And so I guess I would also wonder,
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.340]   I think there's a bigger discussion about like,
[00:50:57.340 --> 00:51:00.140]   is LinkedIn really the most helpful in your business?
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.540]   I think that's a separate thing.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:03.500]   What would happen if you posted today?
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:04.740]   Do you post anywhere?
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:05.880]   Where do you post anything?
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:09.300]   - I'm not active on LinkedIn, Twitter,
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:11.500]   Facebook, Instagram, anywhere.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.260]   - Oh, and how do people even hear about this podcast then?
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:14.100]   - Interesting thing.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:16.540]   Most people find out about podcasts on podcasts.
[00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:21.140]   So word of mouth and being a guest on other shows,
[00:51:21.140 --> 00:51:23.700]   maybe some newsletter stuff,
[00:51:23.700 --> 00:51:26.580]   but it certainly wasn't Instagram or Twitter probably
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:28.460]   for most people, though I'm sure someone listening
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:30.540]   will write back that, no, no, no, it was for me.
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:32.260]   - And then maybe let's do a parallel.
[00:51:32.260 --> 00:51:34.460]   So when you finally put yourself out there on the podcast,
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.300]   how did it feel?
[00:51:35.300 --> 00:51:37.940]   - I don't know, it just felt natural.
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:39.620]   - I think you wrote something about this somewhere,
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:41.300]   but it's like, I'm not the kind of person
[00:51:41.300 --> 00:51:43.340]   who's like always taking pictures all the time
[00:51:43.340 --> 00:51:44.820]   and wanting to share them with the world.
[00:51:44.820 --> 00:51:47.540]   So like Instagram seems so unnatural.
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:48.740]   It's so forced.
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:50.700]   If someone's like, just post more photos on Instagram.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:52.740]   I'm like, I just don't wanna do that.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:53.620]   - It's not what I do.
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.900]   And I also think what I would, you know, in business
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:56.740]   and same with this stuff,
[00:51:56.740 --> 00:51:58.260]   and we can go back to now not how,
[00:51:58.260 --> 00:52:00.620]   it's how do you do more of what's working?
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:01.900]   And what's working for you is podcast.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.100]   So I would say, how do you do more of that in the now?
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:06.820]   Not necessarily like something you don't really wanna do.
[00:52:06.820 --> 00:52:08.700]   Like, yes, I could go post on those areas,
[00:52:08.700 --> 00:52:10.080]   but I don't like that either.
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:12.140]   Where I see the now not how concept
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:14.900]   is mostly for people who are not starting.
[00:52:14.900 --> 00:52:16.460]   They're just not getting started, right?
[00:52:16.460 --> 00:52:17.380]   And that's what's really holding back.
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.960]   You're already going.
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.580]   So going and starting something off in a direction
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:21.500]   isn't what makes sense.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:23.340]   Doubling down on what's working is what makes sense for you.
[00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:25.260]   And that's what we encourage later in the book,
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:26.500]   in the process.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:29.200]   I guess the two things I would say is,
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.860]   you can practice not a how in really stupid things.
[00:52:31.860 --> 00:52:32.880]   And I've found that really helpful.
[00:52:32.880 --> 00:52:35.260]   Like practice it when there's something on the ground.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.580]   'Cause you'll go to your closet tonight, Chris.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:37.420]   I don't know if you're organized,
[00:52:37.420 --> 00:52:38.780]   but sometimes maybe your clothes on the ground
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.360]   or you're in the garage and kids left
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.200]   something on the ground.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.000]   You're like, I'll get it tomorrow.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:44.960]   And I tell myself, now not how.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:45.920]   Ah, damn it.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.880]   And the idea with now not how is that we are,
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:49.440]   in general, thinking about,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.280]   well, if I wanna start a business,
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:51.100]   I gotta do all this stuff.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:51.940]   It's like, no, just get going.
[00:52:51.940 --> 00:52:52.780]   Try to find a customer.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:55.960]   And I've noticed there's a guy named Rico.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.120]   He just started posting online.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.000]   And he said, I made $4.70.
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:00.800]   He just started posting in his Facebook groups and stuff.
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.920]   And I was like, what are you doing?
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:03.040]   He's like, I don't know, just now.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:03.860]   I'm just doing it.
[00:53:03.860 --> 00:53:05.760]   I'm not worrying about if people really love it or not.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:08.320]   And you're doing it before fear catches up.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:10.360]   And I like doing it in kind of silly ways.
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:12.280]   I live and I do this stuff.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.640]   So I said, let me just do a now not how
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:14.520]   that anyone can copy.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:16.680]   So I texted my girlfriend.
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:20.040]   I said, what's one thing right now you can tell me
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.600]   that I can do to improve our relationship?
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.320]   And so she actually wrote a really great response.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.300]   I'm not gonna share it.
[00:53:26.300 --> 00:53:30.000]   But she said, baby, it's a difficult question, dot dot dot.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.200]   That was just 'cause right in the now,
[00:53:31.200 --> 00:53:33.280]   I asked for something versus,
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:34.720]   okay, now let me go to therapy
[00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:35.840]   or let me have a date night
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:37.080]   and then we're gonna have a sit down.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.720]   But just right now I asked for something
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.560]   and I got feedback.
[00:53:39.560 --> 00:53:40.520]   And you can do that in your job right now.
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:42.200]   You can do that in starting a business right now.
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.280]   You can do that in social media right now.
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:45.400]   And I think a lot of times people are like,
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:46.480]   well, how do I approach it?
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:47.800]   How do I, and don't worry about the how,
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:49.120]   just get going on the now.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.520]   How does that maybe relate to,
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.200]   what do you think is something that you think
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.420]   would actually benefit you in things going on
[00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:56.560]   that maybe you can consider as an experiment
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.680]   doing right now?
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.120]   - It's funny, in the last 24 hours, I did an experiment.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:03.400]   And so I'll share it because it was a success.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.520]   And I think it's a great story.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:08.000]   There are a handful of people that listeners have said,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.320]   you should have come on the show
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:11.680]   or I'd thought would be interesting.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.920]   And I wasn't quite sure
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:16.240]   what would be the perfect conversation.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:18.360]   And so I'll give one example of Dan Pink.
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:21.280]   So he's an author, he's been on the show in the past.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:23.200]   And I was like, we had a great conversation.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.480]   I like his reading, his writing.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:27.440]   I was like, I should just have him back on the show
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.640]   as soon as I figure out what the topic is.
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:32.320]   'Cause I don't know what the topic's gonna be.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.720]   And so last night I just,
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:36.040]   we spoke yesterday about this conversation.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:36.940]   I just sent him a note and I was like,
[00:54:36.940 --> 00:54:38.680]   hey, I would love to have you back on the show.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:40.120]   We had a great conversation.
[00:54:40.120 --> 00:54:41.200]   I'll figure out what it'll be about.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:42.840]   But if you're interested, here's a link.
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:44.280]   And then this morning, he just scheduled a link
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:45.680]   and we're gonna record an episode in a week
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:46.880]   or maybe two weeks.
[00:54:46.880 --> 00:54:49.840]   And so I know I'm gonna find a thing
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.800]   and I just needed that motivation to do it.
[00:54:51.800 --> 00:54:54.840]   So I would say, had we not talked,
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:56.760]   that would be a great example of something I wasn't doing.
[00:54:56.760 --> 00:54:58.480]   But because I've been thinking about this,
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.240]   I just tried to put in the action.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.040]   And I would say there's like three or four guests
[00:55:03.040 --> 00:55:05.800]   that are coming on the show in the next month
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.120]   that are all as a result of outreach in the last 24 hours
[00:55:09.120 --> 00:55:10.520]   that I was just like, you know what, let's just do it.
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.800]   Let's just, like, let's not wait for the perfect time.
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:13.800]   Maybe the hint is you just need
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.720]   to constantly remind yourself in practice.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:17.360]   It's a muscle you have to build.
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:21.240]   And even though I knew I was supposed to do it all along,
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:22.080]   it was just hard.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.280]   And now I just need to do it more and see the benefit.
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:25.120]   - That's great, man.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:25.960]   That was cool.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:28.280]   Yeah, the things are never as scary as we think
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:29.680]   and they're never as hard.
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:32.600]   And I would say that the book, what really is the book,
[00:55:32.600 --> 00:55:33.800]   yes, it's business and money
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:35.480]   and changing your life for 48 hours,
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:39.040]   but it's about learning who you can become through business.
[00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.520]   I would say it's like the Marie Kondo of business
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.280]   is what we aimed for, which is, yes, it has mindset,
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:46.440]   it has recipes, but it's really,
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:48.360]   how do we do things we didn't think we could do
[00:55:48.360 --> 00:55:50.240]   and we could live lives we didn't think we could live?
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:51.360]   Literally, the now, not how
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.960]   is the number one takeaway from the book.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.120]   There's definitely a lot of other things
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:55.320]   and tactics and all that other stuff,
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:58.000]   but we survey every beta reader and it was like,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.440]   oh my God, I just realized I'm distracting myself
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:01.400]   from things that actually matter
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:03.560]   and I can do it much quicker than I realized.
[00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:04.920]   And especially if you know, someone like yourself,
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:07.040]   'cause you've got a family, you're busy, all these things,
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.720]   but just getting in the now, just literally doing the now,
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:11.400]   you realize the results that can come for it.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:14.360]   So that was awesome to hear and inspired you in the now.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:15.200]   It takes a while, right?
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:17.520]   Like you gave plenty examples in the book.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.600]   You have the law of a hundred,
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:22.360]   like look at some of the most successful business people
[00:56:22.360 --> 00:56:24.640]   you talked about, like you need to start now
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:27.960]   because it can take years for things to work.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:29.560]   Well, the law of a hundred for people out there
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.320]   is just commit to a hundred of something, right?
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.960]   So a hundred podcasts or a hundred days or a hundred emails
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:37.160]   and it's about how to not quit too soon.
[00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.200]   And I gotta shout you out where the book starts
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.680]   about the power of starting in the upside of asking.
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.760]   And you also said, hey, no,
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:44.680]   what about me coming on your show?
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:47.880]   You have a lot of my content is about entrepreneurship.
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:49.520]   And I was like, I thought about it a lot last night.
[00:56:49.520 --> 00:56:51.200]   I was like, I like that he asked.
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:52.200]   'Cause you know, the upside of an ask,
[00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.240]   you get something that you want.
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:55.880]   The downside is maybe a moment of a rejection.
[00:56:55.880 --> 00:56:59.120]   And the more that people can practice that skill,
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:01.720]   they realize like there's a lot more out there for them.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.320]   And they're not just getting what they get,
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:04.320]   they're getting what they want.
[00:57:04.320 --> 00:57:06.440]   If you wanna go deeper, I did an episode,
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:09.040]   anyone listening with Aziz Ghazipura,
[00:57:09.040 --> 00:57:11.200]   we talked a lot about rejection therapy
[00:57:11.200 --> 00:57:13.000]   and like lots of different ways
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.440]   that you can practice getting rejected.
[00:57:15.440 --> 00:57:17.280]   You've got one where you ask people at a coffee shop
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.640]   to just give you 10% discount
[00:57:18.640 --> 00:57:19.880]   or friends to give you a dollar,
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.680]   which are both great tactics.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.480]   But for anyone who's like, let's double click there,
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:26.120]   we're not gonna spend 20 minutes on it.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:28.280]   But that episode went deep there.
[00:57:28.280 --> 00:57:30.480]   There's a lot of rejection out there.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:33.000]   I know, people don't realize how much rejection happens
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.680]   for people that are getting the things they want
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.920]   'cause they're only seeing the things they get, right?
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:38.440]   Like, oh, it must be good for her
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:39.480]   because she seems to have a great thing.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:40.840]   But it's like, yeah, you don't know all the other things
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:43.000]   that she tried to get to where she is.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.600]   And so I do think it's good in fun ways.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:46.440]   You know, in the book,
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:47.320]   we have a lot of these different little silly,
[00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:49.120]   yeah, as you called it, silly little challenges.
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:49.960]   And guess what?
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.200]   You kind of should be laughing.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:52.040]   And then throughout the book,
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:53.200]   you're kind of, it should be enjoyable.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.640]   It shouldn't be this big, scary thing
[00:57:54.640 --> 00:57:56.080]   that you have to overcome,
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:58.200]   but you just have to face yourself.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.040]   Everyone can do that.
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.760]   And that's what I'm out here cheerleading
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.800]   to encourage people to do that
[00:58:02.800 --> 00:58:05.160]   'cause I don't want people living what if.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:06.360]   And I have someone close to me
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.320]   where they feel like they don't have power
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:10.880]   to change their lives, and they do.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:13.200]   - So you talk a lot about making the ask.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   What about the follow-up?
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:17.520]   How do you feel about how often you should follow up?
[00:58:17.520 --> 00:58:20.560]   When you get a no, can you get a yes later?
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:22.400]   - I think that's when I'm named no.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.560]   My future kid, my girlfriend is pregnant.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:27.800]   We were gonna name him C, you know, C in Spanish for Sia.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.240]   But my girlfriend vetoed that name.
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:30.760]   Most people don't ever follow up.
[00:58:30.760 --> 00:58:32.160]   A lot of times in hiring,
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.200]   I'll just delete after the first email
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:35.400]   just to see who follows up.
[00:58:35.400 --> 00:58:37.600]   And very, very few ever follow up.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.400]   Now, just to share a story,
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:41.640]   you guys heard me talk about John Paul DeGioia earlier.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:42.480]   But what you didn't hear
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:44.840]   is that I saw him on the streets.
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:46.000]   I just went up to him.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.400]   I was bicycling, I was in spandex.
[00:58:47.400 --> 00:58:48.240]   And I was like, "Oh my God,
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.440]   "I've been dreaming of interviewing you.
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:51.000]   "I'd love to interview you."
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.160]   And he said, "Cool, here's my assistant."
[00:58:53.160 --> 00:58:54.000]   He doesn't have a computer.
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:55.640]   He said, "Here's my assistant's number, call her."
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:58:56.600]   So I call her that night.
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.120]   She's like, "Oh cool, he's not available."
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:58:59.960]   I was like, "What do you mean?"
[00:58:59.960 --> 00:59:02.000]   I met him on the street, he said, "Yes."
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:02.840]   (laughs)
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:04.560]   I was in spandex, don't you remember?
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:06.600]   And she's like, "Well, give me a call later.
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.360]   "And then here's my email."
[00:59:08.360 --> 00:59:11.000]   I followed up with her every week for a year.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.640]   And then one Friday, she called me.
[00:59:14.640 --> 00:59:16.840]   And she said, "Hey, he can meet you Monday at 8 a.m.
[00:59:16.840 --> 00:59:17.680]   "Can you be there?"
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:18.720]   And I was like, "Hell yeah, I'll be there."
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:19.640]   One, it was amazing to meet him,
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:23.200]   but it was a great interview of him sharing his story
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:25.040]   and really inspiring a lot of people in business journeys.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:27.920]   But you didn't know that I got rejected 50 weeks
[00:59:27.920 --> 00:59:28.760]   to get to that point.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:29.600]   And I asked her in person,
[00:59:29.600 --> 00:59:31.080]   I thought this was the most interesting part of that,
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:33.080]   where I recorded it.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:35.680]   And I said, "Wasn't I annoying?
[00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.760]   "Didn't it bother you, like this guy, excuse me?"
[00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:40.240]   She's like, "No, I respected you.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.840]   "I admired that you really wanted it
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.960]   "and you were willing to follow up with that.
[00:59:43.960 --> 00:59:45.560]   "You didn't bug me every day,
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:48.080]   "but every week she knows I'm gonna call her or email her."
[00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.080]   And there's something about that
[00:59:50.080 --> 00:59:53.120]   in whatever the things we actually want in life are.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:55.280]   And so if you can be clear on what you actually want,
[00:59:55.280 --> 00:59:57.840]   which is sometimes harder than we think,
[00:59:57.840 --> 00:59:59.040]   then it makes it much easier to then say,
[00:59:59.040 --> 01:00:01.120]   "All right, well, at least I need to make it easy
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:01.960]   "to follow up."
[01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:03.320]   'Cause that's how you're gonna get the things you want.
[01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.680]   My favorite quote is, "A squeaky wheel gets the grease."
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.680]   Which is still strange, but really it's just like,
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.680]   if you're making noise and you're kinda persisting,
[01:00:10.680 --> 01:00:13.920]   I do think eventually persistence beats resistance.
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.720]   Another one of my favorites.
[01:00:15.720 --> 01:00:17.760]   So yeah, most people are not following up.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.720]   - I think you could also probably call out things
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:20.920]   that you're afraid of.
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.360]   So if you're afraid that they're gonna be like,
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:24.640]   "This person's annoying," you could be like,
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.400]   "Hey, I'm just following up
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.680]   "'cause I know this interview is gonna be amazing.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:30.320]   "Don't feel like you need to reply.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.160]   "I'm gonna keep..."
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:34.120]   You could kind of couch out some of the things.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.720]   But if you get someone who thinks
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.120]   they have to reply to the email, it might be annoying.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.880]   But if they're okay just archiving it at the end,
[01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:41.800]   yeah, keep going.
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:42.720]   - Yeah, there's definitely a difference
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.680]   between no and not yet.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:47.160]   And what I've noticed with rejection
[01:00:47.160 --> 01:00:49.240]   or with asking in general,
[01:00:49.240 --> 01:00:51.160]   is that everyone's got things going on
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.160]   and it's hard to really know.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.720]   Like we make these stories up about others,
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.880]   like, "Oh, they rejected me, they hate me."
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.040]   And then I followed up with people that are like,
[01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:58.560]   "Hey, thanks for bringing it back to my attention.
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:00.040]   "I was really busy."
[01:01:00.040 --> 01:01:00.880]   Great.
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.080]   (laughs)
[01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:03.520]   And so there are tools, right?
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:06.040]   Like followup.cc, and there's Google S News,
[01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:06.880]   and there's your calendar,
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:08.880]   and there's frankly pen and paper.
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:12.000]   But just make sure you follow up on these things.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:14.560]   And at AppSumo, and personally,
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:16.640]   even with my own sales over the years,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.160]   I noticed about half of our sales,
[01:01:18.160 --> 01:01:20.800]   it's almost half come through the followup.
[01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:23.320]   And I think that's so insane of a data point,
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.400]   where that the first time almost no one's responding,
[01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.480]   but the second time I'm getting half of the sales.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480]   Maybe it's more likely for others
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:30.960]   to think about how they can follow up.
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:33.560]   - My sister worked in sales for a long time.
[01:01:33.560 --> 01:01:35.320]   She had these automated sequences,
[01:01:35.320 --> 01:01:39.080]   and like the fifth email was one about crocodiles.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.120]   I don't know if anyone listening
[01:01:40.120 --> 01:01:41.600]   or you have ever gotten this email.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:44.760]   And it was just like, "Sorry about the crocodiles."
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:48.280]   And the email said, you open the email and it's like,
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:50.480]   "Not sure what happened, haven't heard from you,
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:53.080]   "but maybe you got eaten by crocodiles.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:54.040]   "I'm not sure.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.240]   "If so, I hope everything's okay.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.680]   "Would still love to chat."
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:00.320]   And she was like, "That email killed it."
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:03.960]   It was like, after someone didn't respond five times,
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.800]   she would just send this like Hail Mary email
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:10.000]   that actually got people to respond and close deals.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:11.640]   - Well, I get these emails too,
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:14.440]   and I find them kinda, I don't know, kitschy a little bit.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:16.440]   But I think what's powerful for me to recognize,
[01:02:16.440 --> 01:02:18.840]   and I always think of the acronym WIFT,
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:19.960]   is what's in it for them.
[01:02:19.960 --> 01:02:21.280]   And I think when most people are sending stuff,
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.880]   it's like, what's in it for me?
[01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:25.520]   It's like, here's my thing.
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:28.160]   No one's ever really making it obvious
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.640]   why it's such a good thing for the other person.
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:31.800]   And what they do also is they do it in the same medium
[01:02:31.800 --> 01:02:33.280]   that everyone's doing it.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.560]   So if you're doing it on LinkedIn, it's gonna be hard.
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.920]   If you're doing it on Twitter, it might be a little easier.
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.480]   If you're doing it on email, it might be.
[01:02:39.480 --> 01:02:40.320]   And so again, I think it's like,
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:42.720]   what's the medium where they're not getting harassed?
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:43.920]   And then as you're communicating with them,
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.240]   how do you make sure that,
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.200]   hey, based on what you're doing,
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.360]   I know this is gonna be good for you.
[01:02:47.360 --> 01:02:49.280]   Like for instance, I do social media.
[01:02:49.280 --> 01:02:51.000]   You can check that out online.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:52.680]   People, I get literally, I'm not joking,
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:53.520]   30 messages a day.
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:56.080]   Hey, can I be your editor for your content?
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.560]   And one out of 1,000 will actually send me something.
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.520]   They'll show me, not tell me.
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:02.560]   And they're thinking about what's in it for me.
[01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.320]   They're like, well, I showed you what I can do.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:06.880]   And that guy got hired.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.040]   He gets a six-figure salary
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:10.040]   working for me on the YouTube channel.
[01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:12.600]   So I think there's just different other elements of,
[01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.280]   one, besides the follow-up, even the asking,
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.440]   by practicing it, you will get better at the ask.
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.240]   Yeah, I tell everyone I know who's trying to get on podcasts.
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:22.120]   I'm like, I get lots of pitches,
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:24.040]   and all of them are from people
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:26.800]   who have clearly never listened to the show ever.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.640]   And then one in 100 is someone like,
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:29.480]   hey, I listened to your show.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.600]   Here's an episode that might make sense.
[01:03:31.600 --> 01:03:33.280]   And I'm like, I'm excited.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:34.600]   It doesn't always work.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:36.000]   But I get all these emails that are like,
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.080]   would you like to have an interview
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:41.200]   with someone who built a career out of buying storage units?
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:44.800]   And I was like, no, I don't have an interview
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:46.320]   entrepreneurs about their story.
[01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:47.920]   I'm like, let's learn some tactics.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:51.520]   So it goes so far to do a little bit of homework
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:54.080]   to make an email actually relevant
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.200]   to the person reading it.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.040]   Anything.
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.240]   I mean, even, let me give you an example on day jobs,
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:58.360]   'cause you told me that a lot of your audience
[01:03:58.360 --> 01:03:59.320]   has day jobs.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:01.400]   There's two messages I hate most in the world,
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:03.600]   or there's one message, but it could go both ways,
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:05.360]   that I hate most in the world.
[01:04:05.360 --> 01:04:07.400]   And it was like, no, we have to talk.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:09.720]   And that's when I get it from someone who works with me.
[01:04:09.720 --> 01:04:11.760]   And I'm like, well, they're quitting today.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:14.000]   And I'm like, well, that's frustrating.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.120]   So I got that message two days ago from Kellen.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:18.760]   And it was like, we gotta talk.
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.160]   I'm like, okay.
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.080]   She put together a two-page document showing me,
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:24.120]   and I won't share her numbers,
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:25.960]   but showing me what she's done for AppSumo
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:26.800]   and all she's created.
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:29.400]   And she said, I know we're gonna come up on raises.
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:30.640]   I just wanna show you what I've done.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:33.240]   And based on also data from external raises,
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.200]   like, might make sense for you to give me a raise.
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:37.840]   She made it very easy.
[01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.840]   And normally, you get the opposite words of people quitting.
[01:04:40.840 --> 01:04:43.320]   When you're at a company, create more value for the company.
[01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:45.280]   It's very easy to get paid more at that company.
[01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.120]   And it was so cool.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.600]   She didn't just tell me about that.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.560]   She showed that to me.
[01:04:48.560 --> 01:04:49.760]   - I had an au pair once,
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.600]   the one au pair that didn't work out well.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:53.000]   And she was like, I want more money.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:53.840]   And we were like, why?
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.960]   And she's like, 'cause I want it.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:59.360]   And my wife was like, from a teaching standpoint,
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:01.680]   I wanna sit down and show you
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.720]   that you should have come and said,
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:04.320]   here's all the things I've been doing.
[01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:05.720]   Here's all this work.
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:07.160]   But it was like the most frustrating.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.280]   They were just like, 'cause I want it.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:09.120]   It didn't happen.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.600]   - But just good lessons out there for all of us.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.280]   And like, you know, what is it again?
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:13.640]   It's an ask, right?
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:14.520]   And it's a skill.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:16.080]   Like I knock on doors on these videos
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.920]   where I knock on houses and ask what they do for a living.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.240]   It's very uncomfortable, right?
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.560]   And I still get a lot of anxiety,
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.280]   but I don't ask them, hey, what do you do for a living?
[01:05:23.280 --> 01:05:24.880]   'Cause that's a weird ask.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.200]   But I go to the door and compliment them.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.040]   And that's something you can do
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.640]   for anyone you wanna ask something for.
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:32.440]   I go to houses I love and I say, I love your house.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:33.280]   Like, oh my God, really?
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:34.600]   Yeah, like, tell me about it.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.440]   Wow, what did you do to afford this kind of house?
[01:05:36.440 --> 01:05:37.280]   It's so cool.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.200]   And oh yeah, we're doing a documentary
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.840]   about houses in the neighborhood.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:42.320]   And I think we create narratives
[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:43.880]   about why people are gonna reject us
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.400]   and we stop before we ever start.
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:47.320]   And that's the same reason, like,
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.800]   I ask people on first class seats
[01:05:48.800 --> 01:05:51.280]   or ask to fly in someone's private jet.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.120]   And you'd be surprised at what can happen if you just ask.
[01:05:54.120 --> 01:05:56.280]   I feel like obliged to just make an ask then,
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.360]   just to demonstrate.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:59.640]   You did, what's your ask?
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:00.680]   You did, you asked to come on my show.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:02.280]   I know, but you already said yes,
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.760]   so now I gotta keep going.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.680]   Like, I'm gonna come to Austin, we'll record an episode,
[01:06:08.680 --> 01:06:10.700]   and then I'm gonna sit down and lay out my plan
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.120]   for what we're doing with the business
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.240]   and then get your feedback.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:14.320]   You up for that?
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:16.480]   Okay, now you're imposing, now you're imposing.
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:18.160]   Okay, hold on, slow your roll.
[01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.680]   One, I'm flying to Spain in two weeks,
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:21.220]   so you have to follow me out there.
[01:06:21.220 --> 01:06:22.400]   But again, I think with ask,
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.640]   people think it is an imposition, right?
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:27.080]   And they're like, but go back to what's in it for me.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:28.760]   Noah, I know you're trying to do this content.
[01:06:28.760 --> 01:06:30.400]   I saw that your most popular podcasts
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:31.840]   were on solopreneurship.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.040]   I've had a day job, I've started a podcast.
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:34.880]   Here's some of the things
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:36.280]   that can make it really appealing for you,
[01:06:36.280 --> 01:06:39.360]   or most people send generic templates.
[01:06:39.360 --> 01:06:40.540]   And so if you can think about what's in it
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:41.380]   for the other person,
[01:06:41.380 --> 01:06:43.100]   and you put a little bit of effort into it,
[01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:45.000]   like this guy Jay, I just hired this guy Jay,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.060]   17 years old, lives with his parents.
[01:06:47.060 --> 01:06:48.340]   He's coming to the book launch party
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.820]   for Million Dollar Weekend.
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:52.020]   I paid for a ticket for his dad to come with him,
[01:06:52.020 --> 01:06:52.860]   which is so cool.
[01:06:52.860 --> 01:06:54.220]   I was like, that's just cool.
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:56.180]   And Jay didn't ask me for a job.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:06:58.900]   He put together a 30-point Google Slides presentation
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:01.340]   about everything in my social media and email that sucked
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:03.040]   and what he's gonna do about it.
[01:07:03.040 --> 01:07:04.660]   And now Jay makes more than anyone else.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.660]   He probably makes, I don't know if he makes more
[01:07:05.660 --> 01:07:07.900]   than all of his teachers, but pretty soon he will.
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:10.840]   Just 'cause he, he didn't make an ask to come work,
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:12.280]   but he also put in the work to show me
[01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.600]   why it was such a no-brainer for him to get this job.
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:15.440]   - I love that.
[01:07:15.440 --> 01:07:18.440]   The only thing that I didn't hit on was,
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.120]   I know you've talked in the past about being cheap,
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.960]   and that you've been able to learn how to spend.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:26.520]   I was curious if you had any advice on that.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:28.320]   - I can still be practical.
[01:07:28.320 --> 01:07:30.200]   I think we shouldn't label ourselves as cheap.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.560]   - I was using your words.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:32.400]   You've said that.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.240]   (laughing)
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:35.720]   - I was pretty cheap, I would say,
[01:07:35.720 --> 01:07:38.360]   or practical up until COVID.
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:39.640]   And I think a lot of our society
[01:07:39.640 --> 01:07:40.600]   has thought about making money
[01:07:40.600 --> 01:07:43.180]   as no one ever talks about enjoying money.
[01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.840]   And I'll tell you, everyone should at least be rich,
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:46.680]   and then you can decide
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.400]   if you wanna go back to being poor.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:49.720]   And I grew up middle-class,
[01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:51.520]   and I think there's a middle-class mentality
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.600]   where you're trained to be stuck in that path
[01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.600]   and realizing you can actually get out of it.
[01:07:56.600 --> 01:07:58.920]   And spending money and enjoying money
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.840]   has been one of the best things the past three years.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:02.160]   I was telling someone two days ago,
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.280]   if my house burned down,
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:05.440]   the first thing I'm taking is my toilet.
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:08.240]   I've got this $6,000 Toto Japanese toilet
[01:08:08.240 --> 01:08:09.360]   that's just killer.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:11.080]   I don't like leaving my house 'cause of toilet.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.000]   My girlfriend now is like, "I understand."
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:13.920]   Dude, come over.
[01:08:13.920 --> 01:08:15.240]   When you come over, you'll try it.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.440]   - This is so funny.
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:19.760]   Our last au pair, fantastic, from Spain,
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.400]   we asked her, "What are you gonna miss most
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:23.480]   "when you leave America and go back to Barcelona?"
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:26.120]   Or she lives near Barcelona in a town called Tarragona.
[01:08:26.120 --> 01:08:28.280]   She's like, "That toilet."
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.840]   (laughing)
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.120]   - Oh, do you guys have a nice toilet?
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.440]   - Yeah, yeah, she's like,
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:34.600]   "I never wanna sit on a cold toilet again."
[01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:37.480]   Oh, the toilet, it's got water, it cleans itself.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.480]   But you know, in terms of being cheap,
[01:08:38.480 --> 01:08:41.080]   it's easy to not be cheap if you have money.
[01:08:41.080 --> 01:08:42.920]   But I've also interviewed Larry Janeski,
[01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:45.600]   whose company does $600 million a year in basements,
[01:08:45.600 --> 01:08:48.040]   who just recently, he's I think in his 50s,
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:50.400]   he just recently started flying first class.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:51.600]   He didn't share his number exactly.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.080]   I'm guessing it's at least worth $100 million, liquid.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:56.960]   He just got a flying economy.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:00.520]   Now, again, for me in COVID, I realized,
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:03.560]   okay, I'm not sure how long I'm gonna live here.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:06.040]   Let me try and experiment different things in my life
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.920]   and see how much of a difference it makes.
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:09.920]   'Cause I was always taught that materialism is bad,
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:11.400]   and if you get more, you're gonna be unhappy,
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:13.640]   and then you become a victim to it.
[01:09:13.640 --> 01:09:16.080]   And so I tried buying a fancy car.
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:17.000]   I hated it.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:19.120]   I sold it for a loss after a month.
[01:09:19.120 --> 01:09:20.520]   And then I tried renting fancy houses.
[01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:23.760]   I rented like this Malibu beach house, which was insane.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:24.600]   That was super cool.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.520]   'Cause during COVID, everything was like really cheap.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.960]   And then I rented a lake house in Austin.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:29.200]   Then I rented a nice RV.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:31.720]   And then I came back home to my 800 foot shack
[01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:33.880]   that literally just flooded last night,
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.400]   that has cockroaches and the floors are cracked
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.560]   and the walls are cracked.
[01:09:38.560 --> 01:09:39.600]   It has electricity and toilets.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:42.800]   So by the way, it's not horrible, but it's pretty bad.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.320]   And because I tried fancier things and nicer things,
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:48.160]   I was like, wow, I was much happier there.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:51.160]   And I would say my standard of happiness has been,
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:52.600]   the baseline is significantly higher
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.200]   since I moved into this house.
[01:09:54.200 --> 01:09:55.400]   - Yeah, I mean, I love this lesson.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.620]   Go try out the ways to spend money
[01:09:57.620 --> 01:10:00.280]   because you'll never know which ones make a difference.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:02.760]   - You know what a rich thing for me is, buying Fiji water.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:05.160]   I don't know why, I've actually blind taste tested them
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:06.620]   and I never choose Fiji.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:09.680]   So I clearly don't give a crap about the taste of it,
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.680]   but it makes me feel rich.
[01:10:10.680 --> 01:10:12.680]   And it's like, okay, cool, that mattered to me.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:14.080]   Let's do that, or bicycles.
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.480]   I think the easy way to spend money
[01:10:15.480 --> 01:10:16.600]   is where you spend your time.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:17.440]   I bike a lot.
[01:10:17.440 --> 01:10:19.880]   So I have two identical $15,000 bicycles
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:21.200]   in America and in Spain.
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.040]   Or your bed, you spend a lot of time there.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.560]   The thing that ultimately transformed it
[01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:27.280]   was one line in my yearly goals.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.560]   And it's a goal every year to donate at least 1%
[01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:34.640]   or spend the rest of my money on myself or others.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.280]   And that one goal, which I look at my goals often,
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:41.300]   transformed my own generosity to myself and others.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.800]   And now it's a lot easier.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:43.920]   Yesterday, I literally got an email.
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:46.240]   It's like, I was donating to this camp I went to as a kid,
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.900]   $180 a year.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:48.880]   And they sent me a receipt.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:51.480]   They're like, oh, you've been donating $180 a month.
[01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:53.960]   I was like, oh, okay.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.160]   Well, that's part of my 1%, that's fine.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:57.240]   And so whatever I make in the year,
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:00.020]   at least be open to investing in myself,
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:01.680]   spending in others, or donating.
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:03.480]   And that definitely has been powerful.
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:04.800]   - So you mentioned your goals.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:05.880]   How do you set goals?
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.400]   - I think with goal setting,
[01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:08.560]   I'd break it down really simply.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:10.560]   One, try to have goals that you stick to each year.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:12.760]   And each year, they just get a little bit more on the goal.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.240]   So my goals every year in the past, it would be like,
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.980]   okay, I did X, now let me go do Y.
[01:11:16.980 --> 01:11:19.160]   No, just do X plus 0.1.
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.480]   And then next year, do X plus 0.2.
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:23.240]   So that was definitely a transformation
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.080]   that helped me in my goals.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.160]   And then I like breaking my goals down in categories.
[01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:27.720]   And I look at my goals, I'll show you.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:29.040]   I have them everywhere.
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.440]   So on my phone, I have a thing called Daily that's pinned.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:33.360]   And it's just all the goals that I have for this year.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.000]   And so I'd recommend people have four categories,
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.240]   work, health, personal, and travel.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.960]   And then try to think about what are three things
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.760]   in each of these things that you'd really, really like.
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:43.480]   And the easy way that you could find this out,
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:45.440]   and this is what I like to do,
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.200]   I've done this on a few decades since working for me,
[01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:48.920]   is write your fantasy.
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.840]   So create a fantasy novel of the year.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.120]   Just go to your journal in the morning and be like,
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:54.640]   okay, if it's the end of December 31st, 2024,
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:57.920]   this year, 2020, whatever, what does my fantasy look like?
[01:11:57.920 --> 01:11:59.600]   All right, I was on Joe Rogan.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:02.960]   All right, all the hacks finally I posted on LinkedIn.
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.760]   I'm a LinkedIn influencer, which LinkedIn is pretty annoying.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.600]   Let's just be real, super annoying.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.720]   No, I took my wife on a baby moon to the Maldives,
[01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.920]   which seems like a far flight.
[01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:11.760]   So let's go somewhere else.
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:14.240]   Maybe, I don't know, Tenerife, who knows.
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.880]   I want to bike across the Alps.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:18.760]   Right, and you make this crazy story of yourself.
[01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:20.480]   And then sit with it for a little bit.
[01:12:20.480 --> 01:12:22.960]   And then think about, okay, what would be really cool?
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:25.600]   What are these, do I really, am I genuinely motivated?
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:29.000]   And then I try to have three per each of these categories.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.760]   And I like sharing mine with others.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.000]   I have an accountability partner,
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]   Adam Gilbert from mybodytutor.com.
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   And then I review them every single Sunday
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:37.680]   as part of that weekly review thing I do.
[01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:38.520]   - Love it.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:40.840]   All right, so we've gone through so much,
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:44.300]   and I want to inspire people to go and do something.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.640]   Doesn't have to be this weekend, but some weekend.
[01:12:46.640 --> 01:12:48.740]   I got a chance to read the book before it comes out,
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:50.520]   but I highly encourage people to check it out.
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:52.600]   Where do you want to send people to check out more
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.440]   of everything you're working on or the book?
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.880]   - Yeah, milliondollarweekend.com.
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:12:57.180]   Take the 48-hour challenge.
[01:12:57.180 --> 01:12:58.080]   It's the same thing with diets.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:00.080]   There's never a good time for a diet.
[01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.300]   (laughs)
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:04.000]   And it's easy to keep giving excuses
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.120]   about why it's not right.
[01:13:05.120 --> 01:13:07.200]   And I think if people even committed an hour
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:09.940]   this upcoming weekend, it would be surprising and amazing
[01:13:09.940 --> 01:13:12.240]   how far ahead they can be and what they can do
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:13.840]   in just a very short amount of time.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.660]   - I love it.
[01:13:14.660 --> 01:13:15.500]   Thanks for sharing it with me.
[01:13:15.500 --> 01:13:16.400]   Thanks for being here.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.720]   - I'll see you at my house.
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:19.160]   I guess you're coming over.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:20.000]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   We'll see.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.400]   Unannounced, knock knock.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.240]   I like your house.
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:24.080]   - Yeah.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:25.440]   (upbeat music)
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:26.440]   - That was so great.
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:27.500]   Noah is amazing.
[01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:30.520]   And I think I'm going to try to adopt his now not how mantra
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:32.400]   for my life and business.
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.280]   I hope you all enjoyed this episode.
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.320]   If you're one of the few people who haven't left a review
[01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:39.200]   on Apple Podcasts, now would be a great time to leave one
[01:13:39.200 --> 01:13:40.240]   for two reasons.
[01:13:40.240 --> 01:13:42.480]   One, it looks like we are right on the cusp
[01:13:42.480 --> 01:13:45.840]   of a 4.8 rating rounding up to 4.9.
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.400]   And two, we're about to launch a new website
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.520]   that's actually going to feature some of your reviews
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:13:51.600]   on the website.
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:53.560]   So thank you all in advance.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.780]   That's it for this week.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:56.080]   I will see you next week.
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:13:58.660]   (upbeat music)
[01:13:58.660 --> 01:14:02.040]   I want to tell you about another podcast I love
[01:14:02.040 --> 01:14:04.340]   that goes deep on all things money.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.000]   That means everything from money hacks
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.160]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:10.320]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:13.200]   And it's much more about building generational wealth
[01:14:13.200 --> 01:14:15.440]   and spending your money on the things you value
[01:14:15.440 --> 01:14:18.360]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:20.300]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:14:20.300 --> 01:14:22.520]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.160]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:27.640]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:31.480]   I know because I was a guest on the show in December, 2022,
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:33.520]   but recently I listened to an episode
[01:14:33.520 --> 01:14:37.040]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats that will blow your mind.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:40.700]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35% of millennials
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:43.800]   are not participating in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:47.480]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:50.120]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:52.820]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[01:14:52.820 --> 01:14:55.720]   to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.720]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:00.080]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.760]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:04.520]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
