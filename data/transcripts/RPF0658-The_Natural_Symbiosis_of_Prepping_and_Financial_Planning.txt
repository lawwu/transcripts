[00:22:30.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   The problem that we all face is how do we reconcile the uncertainty of a bad thing happening with the cost of being prepared for it?
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:00.560]   And that's where I think these things are a natural ally, meaning mainstream financial planning and prepping, because the cost of good preparation is not that high.

The best thing that you can do if you want to ensure your long-term survival is to build a resilient community. It's far better for you to be a part of a community and a culture that is resilient and strong and prepared than for you to be the lone wolf who is well-prepared yourself but surrounded by lack and by all your neighbors. That's really hard. But so the best thing that you can do is try
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:36:07.540]   and encourage other people to become debt-free encourage other people to plant gardens encourage other people to take control of their own energy needs for the house etc so you always want to encourage others and build communities of people who are resilient I'm gonna pivot now and just briefly discuss some personal experiences that I have had that has caused me to decide to intentionally change my mind about some of my past opinions see although I have always been interested in these topics I always thought they're interesting
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:37.000]   and I've always generally been a moderate I'm the kind of person that would be happy to give a preparation or a presentation at the local Red Cross meeting or you know something like that I'm not the kind of person that you would see on profiled on what's the doomsday preppers right I've never been an extremist and I've often really struggled with the people who are extremists and I've just thought you know I appreciate your your

[00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:35.160]   President Obama, I don't think because he wanted to spend less, but because there was a Congress controlled by Republicans in opposition to him, that spending decreased significantly under his administration.
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:45.580]   And so the best I could come up with would be a, in terms of a physical perspective, would be a Democratic president and a Republican Senate and a Republican Congress.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:46.320]   Now, will that happen?
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:49.280]   I don't see how it will happen, but maybe so.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:48:19.420]  , and then I look at the current debate and I say, is there any way that this thing changes?
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   Is there any way that what you see changes?
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It's dangerous.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   The way that people are speaking to one another at this point in time is dangerous. Just as last weekend, we of course had a number of devastating shootings in the United States.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It's dangerous.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It's dangerous.

[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It's dangerous.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It's dangerous.
[00:48:19.420 --> 00:48:19.420]   It's dangerous.
