[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.280]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now, while
[00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.960]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today on the show, we're going
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.760]   to talk about the natural symbiosis between financial planning and prepping, or preparedness,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.120]   or survivalism. Choose your word of choice. Because it's long been a theme and an opinion
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:59.880]   of mine that there is a perfect symbiosis between the mainstream approach of financial
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:10.640]   planning and the area of interest, the area of preparation, or the area of what's usually
[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.640]   called prepping.
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.140]   Now, let me define these terms quickly for you so that you can understand how these things
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.120]   fit together. When I talk about financial planning, I'm basically talking about the
[00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:27.920]   material that I covered when I took the Certified Financial Planner exam. Mainstream Certified
[00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.640]   Financial Planner type stuff, which involves understanding the basics of insurance, such
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.120]   as life insurance, disability income insurance, home insurance, long-term care insurance,
[00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.600]   health insurance, understanding the basic concepts of savings and budgeting, understanding
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.280]   investments, understanding basic estate planning and basic tax planning. These are all the
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.800]   topics that are covered under what most modern mainstream financial planners study and the
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.760]   areas that most modern mainstream financial planners work in.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:04.560]   Now, when I refer to the term prepping, I am specifically referring to preparing for
[00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.720]   potential future problems with an emphasis on the physical items needed for your safety,
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:18.960]   for your health and well-being, for your survival. That's usually the feeling of the use of
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:24.080]   that term prepping. It's preparing for potential future problems with an emphasis on physical
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.400]   items, physical preparedness, using strategies such as stockpiling, such as redundancy, etc.
[00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.800]   So these two things, in my opinion, are a perfect fit for one another, but yet they
[00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.680]   are often not talked about together. Long-time astute listeners of Radical Personal Finance
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.480]   will quickly understand and recognize that I refer to them both constantly. And I'm
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.720]   going to articulate in today's show just some of the specific reasons why, to help
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:00.920]   people who wonder about one versus the other. And I'm also going to articulate how even
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.000]   I've changed. I've changed a lot in the last weeks, and I'll describe that in a moment
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.560]   after I go through some of the more academic approach, more academic perspective.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.320]   Now, the term prepping, which I just simply use because it's the most common term used
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.680]   today in prepping circles, the term prepping doesn't necessarily have to refer to preparing
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.920]   for potential future problems with an emphasis on physical items. For example, why do we
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.520]   want our children to graduate from high school or to go to college? Well, we want to prepare
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:37.840]   them for the future. And so you could use the term prepping or preparing our children
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.560]   for success to talk about really anything you want to, including going to school, going
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.280]   to college. Or why do we buy car insurance? Well, we want to be prepared in case we have
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.920]   a car accident. So that would come in under the category of prepping. So the term itself
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.800]   could be applied very, very broadly, but it's usually applied to physical items. And yet
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.040]   most people have a bias in one way or another. In my experience, in my reading, in my kind
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.080]   of talking to people, what I have learned is that people either have a bias that everything
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.760]   is guaranteed to be a catastrophe. And so the only thing to do is to stock up on your
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:22.040]   beans, bullets, and band-aids, stack them in deep and ignore all of the mainstream common
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.480]   financial planning discussions. Or everything is going to be great, the future is going
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.880]   to be better than the past, things are going to be rosy, stocks are going to go up. Why
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.200]   would you waste money on things that are unproductive? Why would you buy gold when it just doesn't
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:39.360]   make a dividend and it's unproductive? And why would you do these other things? So these
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:49.200]   are the types of, I guess, extremes that are perhaps common. Now I think there's a wide
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:55.000]   swath of thoughtful people who wouldn't necessarily fall into either of those extremes. There
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.680]   are a lot of people who have all their investments in modern mainstream mutual funds who also
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.620]   carry a pair of jumper cables in the trunk of their car. And yet there are also a lot
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.960]   of people who, although they may believe that in the long term the US dollar is going to
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.480]   be worthless and worth nothing more than being used for toilet paper, they still have US
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.600]   dollars, they still have savings, they still earn their money in dollars, they still spend
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.760]   dollars, they still save dollars and still invest dollars. And so most people are going
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:28.680]   to be in the middle between these positions. And it seems like at different times in life
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.680]   people want to emphasize one over the other. There are times in life where you want to
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:40.200]   emphasize your positivism and there are times in life where catastrophism seems more palatable.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:45.360]   And we should all be careful to guard against our biases, we should all be careful to protect
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:53.160]   ourselves against extremism, unwarranted extremism, and try to imagine what if we are wrong. But
[00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:59.040]   these two things go perfectly together if you see how useful they can be. Now here is
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:11.800]   my working thesis. Disaster is possible. It's possible. And different kinds of disasters
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:21.600]   have varying levels of likelihood. Those levels of likelihood can change over time. For example,
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:28.520]   if you live in Florida, you know that hurricanes are possible. There's a hurricane season.
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:34.040]   But hurricane season, as it comes closer, increases the risk of disaster. You're much
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.080]   more likely to face disaster in the next six months if it's June than you are if it's January
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.520]   because hurricane season is of course from June and July onward. So you understand that
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.840]   hurricane season, hurricanes usually come towards the back end of summer. So you think
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.800]   more about hurricanes during that time of the year than you do during the middle of
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.720]   the winter. That's obvious. Now you can also look out and say, "Hey, if I start to see
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.840]   a couple of storms spinning up across the Atlantic, I can pay attention, but I'm not
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:04.840]   going to pay too much attention until they start to get closer, a couple thousand miles
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.320]   away, a thousand miles away, you start paying more attention." But you pay a whole lot of
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:14.080]   attention when the National Hurricane Center issues a hurricane watch and then a hurricane
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:21.480]   warning and you pay very, very careful attention during those times. That's the same thought
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.000]   process that could be applied to almost any kind of disaster. So for example, I've done
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:33.040]   a number of shows on things like the rising level of national debt, the massive deficit
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:38.800]   the United States is running. As I record this show, there was just an announcement
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:48.560]   from the US Treasury Department that the US national debt jumps today by $292 billion
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:55.680]   on the first day of the debt limit suspension. So now we've gone from a $22 trillion on budget
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:08:06.520]   national debt to a $22.022 trillion to $22.314 trillion. That's interesting. Now I have
[00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:10.640]   tried to be as farseeing as I could. I've tried to say, "I think this is a long-term
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:15.160]   problem." I've tried to say, "I don't see any real solutions to this other than default."
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.480]   Could be inflation, could be taxation, could be default. We should be prepared for all
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:23.960]   three of those things. But I'm not looking at this as any kind of short-term catastrophe.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.920]   As far as I'm concerned, we're sitting in Florida watching hurricanes spin up across
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:33.360]   the Atlantic saying, "Hey, we're in hurricane season now and so we should watch these hurricanes."
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.120]   But when I watch and say, "You know what? Is there a way out? Is there a way that I
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.560]   could see that this could be solved? Is it?" It's not easy. There are a lot of arguments,
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:47.120]   a lot of things to process. But at the end of the day, I still look and I say, "It's
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:50.960]   good to be prepared. It's good to be prepared for this kind of thing." You sleep better
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:58.280]   at night being prepared. And that's, in essence, what I think we should do with most things.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:03.720]   Now here is the basic functional difference between mainstream financial planning and
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:10.760]   prepping. It has to do with the use of money. Money is one of the best tools to prepare
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:17.080]   for catastrophes. If a hurricane is coming into your town and you have a car and you
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:22.280]   have money to put gas in the car, you can go to the gas station, put gas in the car,
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:27.800]   and you can leave. And you can go to a hotel, you can pay money for a place to stay, and
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.080]   you can stay there until the hurricane blows through, and then you can go back home. So
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:36.680]   money solves the problem. You can buy a plane ticket, you can get in the car, you can get
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:42.460]   a taxi or an Uber out of town. You can get out if you have money. Now similarly, money
[00:09:42.460 --> 00:09:47.760]   solves most problems that happen if, for example, the hurricane comes through and blows your
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.040]   roof off. If you have insurance, the insurance company will send you a payment for that insurance,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.920]   for that claim. And then you take that money and you hire a contractor to build a new roof
[00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:02.440]   and then eventually you move back into your house. Money solves the problem. Yes, you
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:08.600]   could stockpile supplies of 2x4s and plywood and new shingles and do the work yourself,
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:13.860]   but in general money solves the problem. And it would be very unwieldy to prepare for something
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:19.820]   like your roof blowing off with physical preparedness. Really, insurance is the best solution and
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:27.500]   money is the best way to get your roof repaired. But there's a line at which money stops
[00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:34.300]   working. And there could be various reasons why that line is crossed. For example, money
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.660]   could stop working simply because there's no time for money to work. I would guess that
[00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:46.260]   your heart, as is mine, might be heavy right now with just thinking about the shootings
[00:10:46.260 --> 00:10:52.820]   in the United States over the weekend. It's devastating to hear about dozens of people
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:11:00.060]   being killed for no reason whatsoever. Just the senselessness and stupidity of sin and
[00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:06.220]   murder. It just turns your stomach and all you want to do is sit down and cry and cry
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:12.260]   with the people who lost family. It's devastating. But it's a good example to show how money
[00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:19.340]   doesn't solve the problem of protecting yourself from somebody who's killing you in that instant.
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:25.820]   Now money solves the problem in the form of the traditional response of police, the fact
[00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:30.780]   that there's a whole system, a whole environment where police come and they interact with the
[00:11:30.780 --> 00:11:35.100]   shooter or they kill him or they arrest him, etc. And some incredible story of just the
[00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:41.820]   incredible efficacy of the police officers in the most recent round of killings. And
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:47.340]   yet for several dozen people, that wasn't enough. Thankfully for probably dozens if
[00:11:47.340 --> 00:11:53.340]   not hundreds of more people, that was. But that's a clumsy example to say that there
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:57.940]   are times at which you can't buy your way out of a situation like that. And so that's
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:04.860]   where we cross over into prepping. How do you prepare for something like that? And in
[00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:08.460]   almost any circumstance you could do it. So the first reason is, you could talk about
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:11.700]   this, so the first reason is money may not work simply because money can't work fast
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:21.300]   enough. Money may also not work because there is a complete destruction of an economy. So
[00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:46.860]   listen carefully. I want you to listen to something. I have just stacked eight bundles
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:56.300]   of cash on my desk right next to my microphone. If I stack all these up, we're looking
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:05.220]   at about, I guess about 18 inches of cash. Tightly wrapped banknotes, all wrapped up
[00:13:05.220 --> 00:13:11.300]   in tape, big thick bundles of banknotes. Now before you be too impressed with how rich
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:15.580]   I am and how I'm showing off and flaunting my wealth, you should of course know and you
[00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:21.060]   have likely guessed that these stacks of banknotes are not US dollars, they're not euros, they're
[00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:29.580]   not pounds, they're not francs. They are Venezuelan bolivars. Or to not butcher the Spanish quite
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.900]   so bad, they are bolivares as the Venezuelans would call them. And some of these numbers
[00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:40.140]   are pretty impressive. Here's one for, here's a big bundle of small ones of 10 bolivares.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:46.620]   Here's one for quinientos bolivares. Here's one for veintimil bolivares, 20,000 bolivares.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:52.420]   And here's one for five. Here's one for cinquenta, for 50. So some of these numbers are impressive.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:57.620]   Now what's interesting is this mixture is some of the cash comes from before the currency
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:02.220]   revaluation where a couple of zeros were lopped off and some of it comes from after. But at
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:11.300]   any rate, this 18 inch tall stack of cash on my desk is worth the equivalent of four
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:15.680]   US dollars in today's market. And of course by the time you're hearing it, it could be
[00:14:15.680 --> 00:14:21.420]   half that. Because in the last three weeks, the Venezuelan currency exchange rate has
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:28.220]   gone from about 8,000 bolivares to 12,000, 8,000 to one, 8,000 bolivares for the dollar
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:34.180]   to 12,000 bolivares for the dollar in three weeks. So for all I know, that could happen
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:40.420]   again in the next three weeks. That's what happens when the cash becomes worthless. And
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:45.940]   what you see if you study an economy like what's actually happening today in Venezuela
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:52.820]   is financial planning doesn't work anymore because there is no money that is functional.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.500]   I mean, I don't know if you understand. If you'd like to see a picture, by the way, go
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:58.900]   to my website, RadicalPersonalPlans.com, find the show notes for today's show. I'll put
[00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:06.500]   a picture with the show notes. Or go to twitter.com/JoshuaSheets and you'll see a photo of this stack of cash.
[00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:12.700]   But just consider a world in which, first of all, there's no counting of money. The
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:17.180]   way this stuff, the way this happens is you exchange bricks of money. The bills are all
[00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:22.380]   put together with similar colored bills, like bills, so that you can have a big stack of,
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:27.940]   hey, here's a big stack of 5,000 bolivars, or here's a big stack of 20,000 bolivars.
[00:15:27.940 --> 00:15:30.940]   And they're all, so they're all stacked to the same color. So you can see I've got a
[00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:36.220]   big thick sheaf of paper of all the same color. And then they're wrapped with packing tape.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:41.540]   And the way you exchange money is you turn over a certain number of bundles to make an
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:47.580]   exchange. And so it's almost impossible to exchange even a measly $20 in today's world
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:53.580]   in Venezuela, because you can't carry the money physically in even a large backpack
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:16:00.580]   if you're exchanging $20. Forget about changing 50 bucks or 100 bucks. You could do $5 at
[00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:06.700]   a time, $10 at a time, and you receive such an awkward basket of currency that it immediately
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:12.540]   targets you as a risk of theft and other problems as well.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:18.020]   That's a world in which prepping makes a lot of sense, because now all of a sudden those
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:26.540]   physical things that provide for you, now all of a sudden they have a much, much higher
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:34.580]   value. So that's another scenario in which financial planning doesn't hold up anymore,
[00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:39.780]   a situation like hyperinflation. Now, before you get too scared, I want to repeat, as I
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:48.580]   always do, the US dollar is not the Venezuelan bolivar. The Canadian dollar is not the Venezuelan
[00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:56.180]   bolivar. The euro is not the Venezuelan bolivar. But what I think people often fail to understand
[00:16:56.180 --> 00:17:04.220]   is Venezuela is not Zimbabwe. And what I mean is Venezuela is one of the richest, was, go
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:08.100]   back a decade, a decade and a half, was one of the richest countries in South America.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:15.580]   Very high standard of living, very high level of development, functional, flourishing economy.
[00:17:15.580 --> 00:17:19.540]   We're not talking here about the image that some people hold in their head that, oh, crazy
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.860]   hyperinflation only happens in some abandoned corner of the world where people ride goats
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:33.660]   around. That's not the world we're in. Venezuela is a very modern economy. And yet today, it's
[00:17:33.660 --> 00:17:39.420]   heartbreaking. It's heartbreaking. You look at lawyers scratching around in the dirt to
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:46.980]   try to grow something so that they can eat. Business people reduced to nothing. In many
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:50.700]   ways, the people who are the best off are the campesinos, the people out in the country
[00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:54.980]   who know, who are used to living at a low standard of living, who are used to making
[00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:59.900]   their living from the ground. It's all the big business and the high-flying society people
[00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:06.500]   who are hurting the most. In general, if things go as we all hope they go, there shouldn't
[00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:14.780]   be a lot of interface between physical preparedness, stockpiling, etc. and technical financial
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:21.320]   planning because hopefully the markets that we all live and work in, the money that we
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:26.700]   all use, etc. Hopefully these things will not collapse. Hopefully our societies will
[00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:36.900]   not collapse. That's the hope. But if they do, that's where the problem comes in. So
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:42.380]   now I want to talk about cost versus benefits and then financial independence. Cost versus
[00:18:42.380 --> 00:18:49.660]   benefits. The way that I personally approach many decisions, especially decisions that
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:57.140]   involve some ability to prognosticate the future, is with a cost versus benefit or impact
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:02.420]   of this happens or impact of this does not happen sort of analysis. I get really nervous
[00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:10.340]   being fairly conservative by nature. I get really nervous betting something significant
[00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:16.100]   on one certain outcome. Some people seem to thrive in that kind of environment. That's
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:22.260]   not me. I get nervous having to depend upon things going my way. So if my political candidate
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:28.040]   wins election, then I'm okay, but if not, I'm in a bad situation. Or if this company
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:32.300]   goes the way that I need it to go, but if not, I'm in a bad situation. I don't like
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:38.340]   that. I like to be prepared for any and all circumstances to the best of my ability. So
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.860]   I want to be prepared if my preferred political candidate wins or if my preferred political
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:46.780]   candidate loses. I want to be prepared if this particular investment goes up or if this
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:50.660]   particular investment goes down. I want to be prepared if this road is closed or if this
[00:19:50.660 --> 00:19:55.460]   road is open. I want to make sure that I have solutions in place for all of those things.
[00:19:55.460 --> 00:20:03.660]   So my tendency is to want to try to be in good shape for every eventuality. But of course
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:09.340]   that comes with a cost. There are costs to all of our actions. We have to weigh those
[00:20:09.340 --> 00:20:13.260]   costs. If I think that things are going to go in this direction, am I really willing
[00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:18.340]   to spend the money to go in that direction? So let's talk about something like prepping
[00:20:18.340 --> 00:20:24.260]   as compared to modern financial planning. I want you to pretend for a moment that you
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:33.700]   are absolutely convinced that on the first of next month there is going to be a global
[00:20:33.700 --> 00:20:40.460]   thermonuclear war. It will happen. You're going to have Russia and China and the United
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:46.580]   States all lobbing nukes at each other. Pretend that you were absolutely convinced that that
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:59.460]   were going to happen. What would you do? What would you do? Now, what you would do would
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:05.540]   of course depend on what you have done. But if you were convinced that that were going
[00:21:05.540 --> 00:21:13.420]   to happen, you would be very quickly turning all of your money, all of your resources,
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:18.420]   filling up all of your credit cards and turning all of that into physical preparations to
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:24.260]   help you and your family survive the nuclear holocaust. You would be building a bunker
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.640]   if you don't already have one. If you have one, you would be adding probably another
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:31.900]   layer of concrete just to make sure. You would be provisioning like crazy. You would be looking
[00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.140]   at plane tickets and saying, "Can I get to a place where there's not going to be nuclear
[00:21:35.140 --> 00:21:39.400]   bombs falling on my head?" You would be considering all your options and you would be doing everything
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:43.500]   you could to get out of the war zone or to be protected within the war zone. You would
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:47.100]   not be thinking about the value of the stock market at that moment. You would call your
[00:21:47.100 --> 00:21:50.900]   broker and say, "Sell all, turn everything to cash," and you would spend it all on your
[00:21:50.900 --> 00:21:57.480]   survival. But the problem is that there's no way that any of us could know on the first
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.380]   of next month global thermonuclear war is going to break out. So you are understandably
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:09.420]   concerned about taking all of your money, building a new bomb shelter in your backyard
[00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:14.660]   or better than that, under your house, building a new bomb shelter under your house, and then
[00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:20.380]   sitting there on the second of next month saying, "Oh, it didn't happen. I feel silly."
[00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.020]   And now your kids have no college fund and you have no retirement account, et cetera,
[00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:30.760]   because you bought giant stacks of food and you put more concrete on your bunker. So that's
[00:22:30.760 --> 00:22:36.900]   the problem that we all face is how do we reconcile the uncertainty of a bad thing happening
[00:22:36.900 --> 00:22:42.720]   with the cost of being prepared for it? And that's where I think these things are a natural
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:49.200]   ally, meaning mainstream financial planning and prepping, because the cost of good preparation
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:56.120]   is not that high. It's analogous to a mere insurance payment. And that applies for the
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:23:00.920]   vast majority of the things that most of us are concerned about to even the hardcore scenarios.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:07.200]   Let me give you an example. When I talk about hurricane preparedness or tornado preparedness
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:12.240]   or earthquake preparedness, et cetera, for a few thousand dollars, you can assure your
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:18.080]   families if not survival, you can assure that you can make things go in some level of comfort
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:23.400]   until help arrives from outside of the disaster zone. But even if we go up to the hardcore
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:30.960]   worst case zombie apocalypse scenarios, the price tag, in my opinion, is still not all
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:38.760]   that high. Let me give you an example. In my opinion, there are three really bad catastrophes
[00:23:38.760 --> 00:23:43.800]   that could happen that all have historical precedents, that are all realistic things
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:49.880]   that could happen, and yet they're pretty hardcore. And I like to use them as the most
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:58.080]   extreme case of something to plan for, something to prepare for. Number one, perhaps most likely,
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:06.160]   would be some sort of global pandemic. A flu pandemic or some sort of major sickness, a
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:12.480]   global pandemic. Here, of course, your best historical, most recent historical event would
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.360]   be the Spanish flu of the early 20th century, where you go back and study how many tens
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.600]   of millions of people died from the Spanish flu. Whether you look at it and you study
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:29.000]   something like Ebola to see some kind of modern mutation. There's a great Tom Clancy novel
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:35.240]   that dealt with an Ebola infection. But some kind of global flu pandemic is a very realistic
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.920]   thing. It has happened before. It will probably happen again. And it's one of the worst case
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:45.920]   scenarios that you could come up with. How do you prepare for a global outbreak of disease?
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:53.760]   A second hardcore scenario would be something like an actually successful widespread electromagnetic
[00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:59.800]   pulse attack, something that wipes out the electricity for a continent. That would be
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:08.600]   unbelievably devastating. And that's the kind of hardcore scenario that it's hard to imagine,
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:13.280]   yet devastating in terms of its impact. Or something like an outbreak, an actual outbreak
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:18.040]   of a hot nuclear war. It's pretty sobering when you study history and you realize how
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:27.000]   narrowly nuclear war has been evaded in the past. Very, very narrowly. Now we hope, of
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.280]   course, that it continues to be evaded and yet it's a very distinct possibility. A number
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.800]   of years ago I was thinking about some of these issues and I went and studied nuclear
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:39.680]   war. Read a couple of books on it, kind of worked through all the scenarios. I came to
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:45.400]   be convinced that nuclear war, even one of those hardcore scenarios, is eminently survivable.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:49.200]   Even if you live in the United States and Russia and China and the US start going at
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:54.840]   it, it's eminently survivable. And I also came to the conviction that it doesn't actually
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:00.880]   cost that much to prepare for. To be adequately prepared for nuclear war, depending on whether
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:06.640]   or not you need to move and change housing, etc. And depending on where you build your
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.760]   fallout shelter and how much, how grandiose your fallout shelter winds up being. I came
[00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:17.560]   to be convinced that for a budget of anywhere from a few tens of thousands of dollars on
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.920]   the low end to as much as a hundred thousand dollars to a couple hundred if you want a
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:29.560]   luxurious, luxuriant fallout shelter, you could be adequately prepared for a hot nuclear
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:33.720]   war for a few tens of thousands of dollars. Basically the price of a new car. You could
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.000]   be extremely well prepared for nuclear war. And that's the scenario that basically convinced
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.200]   me that prepping, even hardcore prepping, has a very low price tag when compared to
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:52.560]   the dollars that most of us spend. When compared to the situations that most of us are in.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:57.120]   Now if we back off the brink of nuclear war, which is of course pretty hardcore to talk
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:03.000]   about, and we go to something like making sure that you survive in case your town goes
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.680]   through a, has a tornado, things like that, and we go to the fairly mundane things like
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.680]   having extra food, the price tag is a mere few thousands of dollars. Today you can go
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:19.200]   to Costco.com, you can order up a pallet of long-term storage food that's supposed to
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:23.520]   have enough servings to last a family of four for a year for a couple thousand bucks. Put
[00:27:23.520 --> 00:27:27.520]   it on your credit card, have it delivered to your front door. Now, I don't know if that's
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.520]   the best way, it's certainly not the most frugal way, but it's better than nothing.
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.960]   And if that were all you did, was spend a couple thousand bucks and stack some food
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:39.760]   in your basement, you'd be pretty well ahead of most people. Make sure you've got some
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.040]   stockpile of water, make sure you've got some good water purification methodologies, but
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.880]   you'd be pretty well ahead. The price tag of this stuff is cheap. And so when you look
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:54.240]   at the cost of prepping, and you look at the cost of prepping for a dire scenario, all
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:01.760]   things considered is relatively low compared to the benefit of being prepared in a disaster
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:09.160]   scenario. Now, one of the things I've learned over the years is I have come to use the stockpiles
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:14.520]   and such that I've set aside far more than I ever thought I would. And there can be a
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:21.120]   variety of different reasons. I've used them when I've had bad months of income. I've used
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.840]   preparations to help people, give things away to people in need. I've used it when I needed
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:31.920]   to make major financial changes in my life. That what happens is when you can turn money
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:40.180]   from money into things, the things still have and maintain their value. Now, one more point
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:46.120]   on the natural symbiosis between prepping and financial planning. By definition, if
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:54.580]   one is prepared to live independent of systems of support, by definition, one is financially
[00:28:54.580 --> 00:29:02.520]   independent. So imagine this for a moment. Let's assume that you live on a nice homestead,
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.760]   little ways out of town. You've got maybe a few acres, two, three, four, five acres.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:13.380]   You've got a nice milk cow, some goats, some chickens, a couple of pigs. You've got some
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.880]   fish in your fish tanks. You've got a nice garden. You've got some fruit trees. You have
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:25.320]   a house that you don't owe any money on, completely debt-free house. You have some sort of home
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:30.080]   business that can bring in income into the home with things that you have and do out
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.420]   of the home. You're basically in a situation, may need some stockpiles. Say you have some
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:41.160]   stockpiles of shoes. You've calculated that you wear out a pair of shoes every five years
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.360]   and you've calculated that you have another 50 years of life expectancy. So you've laid
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:51.240]   in 10 extra pairs of shoes and things like that. You are basically in a position where
[00:29:51.240 --> 00:30:00.180]   you are now financially independent. You are financially independent if you are prepared
[00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:06.360]   to live independent of systems of support. You can stockpile the things that you need.
[00:30:06.360 --> 00:30:11.220]   Again, use my shoe example. You can do that for many things in your life. And then if
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:15.880]   you have the ability to feed yourself, to house yourself, clothing yourself from the
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:20.280]   land would be a pretty big job for most of us, but hey, clothes are cheap at Goodwill.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.080]   As long as you don't gain a lot of weight or lose a lot of weight, you can stockpile
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:28.360]   whatever clothes you need. You are financially independent. And that's one of the most powerful
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:35.280]   concepts behind prepping, is there's a natural symbiosis between financial planning for financial
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:40.040]   independence with the modern mainstream tools of investments and generating income from
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:45.960]   investments as well as the traditional tools of having a debt-free house, having a garden
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.280]   that provides some percentage of your needs, providing for your own meat, providing for
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:55.280]   your own energy, investing in solar panels, things like that. These things function really
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.840]   well together. And in fact, you can have far better results of one or the other if you
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:05.520]   have both of them. For example, let's say that you are that financially independent
[00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:15.400]   person who has a large portfolio of investments, who also has substantial physical preparations.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:21.160]   Now assume that your portfolio of investments declines dramatically due to a change in market
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:27.000]   conditions. Well now, by choosing to stop taking money from your portfolio of investments
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.400]   and to start taking money from your stockpiles, sorry, taking things from your stockpiles
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:36.760]   to provide for yourself, you can actually enhance your long-term wealth by not selling
[00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.920]   when investments are cheap. So you can wait out the decline in the markets and then when
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:47.600]   the investments recoup their value, then you go ahead and start selling again. On the flip
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:53.520]   side, if you are that person who has some physical preparations but also has substantial
[00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:58.040]   investments, if physical preparations start to increase in value, you can turn around
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:03.960]   and fairly quickly turn your investments into physical items. And you'll be far ahead of
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:11.280]   the person who has no investments, who has no money. One of the unique things about Venezuela
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:17.280]   that I've learned is simply that if you have a source of funds from outside of the country,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:23.280]   and especially if you have a source of funds that's not measured in Venezuelan bolivares,
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:30.240]   you can be far ahead of most people. Because this stack of currency that converts into
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:36.220]   $4 is still only worth $4. So if you have a paycheck of a couple thousand dollars from
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:42.340]   outside the country, you can live pretty decently. Because for the things that are available,
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:43.340]   you can get them.
[00:32:43.340 --> 00:32:47.780]   So now we get into the natural diversification that we talk about when we work in professional
[00:32:47.780 --> 00:32:50.740]   financial planning. How do we diversify an investment portfolio? How do we diversify
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:56.500]   across currency, risk, etc.? And if you did those things, you would be far ahead of one
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:33:01.620]   of your neighbors who did not have those things. And so they work together synchronistically.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:06.980]   They're perfect complements for one another.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:11.900]   So it's not that you should only engage in formal financial planning. It's not that you
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:18.300]   should only do prepping. It's that they work synergistically. They have their place. And
[00:33:18.300 --> 00:33:22.580]   if you're thoughtful and careful about how you approach it, you can set up what's best
[00:33:22.580 --> 00:33:30.180]   for you. Now there are costs for both things. For example, there's a cost to having too
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:37.180]   much stuff. If you have a whole lot of stuff stockpiled, that can make your life very unwieldy.
[00:33:37.180 --> 00:33:41.500]   It's hard to move. You need a big house, a big barn, etc. That can be hard. That could
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:43.260]   be a downside.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:51.220]   There can be a cost of focusing too heavily on investment assets. Realistically, I think
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.620]   that if you were to compare somebody who took their first $15,000, $20,000 of their working
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:00.900]   life and put it all into investments to start that compound interest rolling versus somebody
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:05.780]   who took that $15,000, $20,000 and put it thoughtfully towards physical preparations,
[00:34:05.780 --> 00:34:08.580]   I think in many ways I'd make an argument that the physical preparations are going to
[00:34:08.580 --> 00:34:15.540]   be far more useful. I imagine the stability of the person who buys an inexpensive trailer,
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:19.340]   single wide trailer or something like that to live in, owns a little piece of land debt
[00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:25.140]   free, $15,000, $20,000 could build an incredible infrastructure on a piece of property with
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:30.580]   trees and gardens and some animals, etc. And that person can still be working and making
[00:34:30.580 --> 00:34:35.820]   money and saving money. But yet by investing it into physical preparations, they're probably
[00:34:35.820 --> 00:34:40.700]   far ahead of the person who just puts the first $20,000 in their Roth IRA. I think most
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:45.540]   of us have enough money where we could do both effectively. But if you had to choose,
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:50.580]   I think the argument is pretty strong in favor of physical preparations. So they work together
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:52.380]   really, really well.
[00:34:52.380 --> 00:35:01.620]   Now I want to talk briefly about my own opinions on this subject. Thus far, nothing I have
[00:35:01.620 --> 00:35:08.200]   said is, I think, all that surprising to any long-term listeners of the show. I've never
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:12.740]   hidden these opinions. I don't understand why a lot of preppers are so secret about
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:17.700]   how I just don't talk about prepping. The best thing that you can do if you want to
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:22.660]   ensure your long-term survival is to build a resilient community. It's far better for
[00:35:22.660 --> 00:35:27.220]   you to be a part of a community and a culture that is resilient and strong and prepared
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:33.820]   than for you to be the lone wolf who is well-prepared yourself but surrounded by lack and by all
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:38.260]   your neighbors. That's really hard. So the best thing that you can do is try to encourage
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:42.700]   other people to become debt-free, encourage other people to plant gardens, encourage other
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:47.060]   people to take control of their own energy needs for their house, etc. So you always
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:52.420]   want to encourage others and build communities of people who are resilient.
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:56.020]   I'm going to pivot now and just briefly discuss some personal experiences that I've had that
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:36:03.460]   have caused me to decide to intentionally change my mind about some of my past opinions.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:07.140]   See, although I have always been interested in these topics, I've always thought they're
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:13.580]   interesting to discuss, I've always generally been a moderate. I'm the kind of person that
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:20.180]   would be happy to give a preparation or a presentation at the local Red Cross meeting
[00:36:20.180 --> 00:36:25.980]   or something like that. I'm not the kind of person that you would see profiled on the
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:33.460]   doomsday preppers. I've never been an extremist and I've often really struggled with the people
[00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:38.340]   who are extremists and I've just thought, "I appreciate your intensity but I think you're
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:48.140]   missing some level of what I would have said, would say, would be reality." For example,
[00:36:48.140 --> 00:36:52.660]   I pay a lot of attention to economics and I repeat the statement I said, "The dollar
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:57.540]   and the United States are not the same as Venezuela and the boulevard." There are a
[00:36:57.540 --> 00:37:01.460]   lot of ways that you could prove that case but they're just very, very different. So
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:06.980]   although in many ways the US dollar has the same basic problems as the boulevard does,
[00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:12.860]   its fiat currency, its worthless paper, its value comes from the exchangeability, its
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:17.660]   value comes from the size of the economy and those things are very different. So I've often
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:23.620]   been a moderate but a number of experiences have convinced me to move a tick or two farther
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:29.220]   off the scale of moderate towards, sounds bad to say the word extreme but just give
[00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:35.900]   you an idea of the scale, towards more hardcore. Let's use a word other than extreme. And they
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:43.340]   are these. Number one, Venezuela. I've tried to bring you on the show some input into the
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:50.260]   work that I'm involved in and many of you have given money to that. But I don't know
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:57.100]   how to articulate more other than just to tell the stories of how impactful it is to
[00:37:57.100 --> 00:38:04.740]   see collapse in real time and not collapse of the old variety but collapse of the right
[00:38:04.740 --> 00:38:10.740]   now variety. To see people who wear all the same brand names that you and I wear, who
[00:38:10.740 --> 00:38:15.780]   know all the same international pop culture icons that you and I might know and yet to
[00:38:15.780 --> 00:38:24.180]   see that culture and economy and country implode. I mean it's a countrywide, a nationwide collapse.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:30.720]   It's absolutely a collapse society. It's a level five collapse society and it's devastating.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:35.300]   And what it's caused me to do is to recognize that a lot of the things that I was dismissive
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:41.540]   of in the past, actually there's more thought to them than I want to give credit. I'll give
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:50.020]   you an example. In the prepper world there is an idea that having an older vehicle is
[00:38:50.020 --> 00:38:56.380]   better. An older vehicle, especially a non-computerized vehicle, because it can be fixed without the
[00:38:56.380 --> 00:39:02.100]   need for modern diagnostic equipment. And then there's also a sub-argument of this position
[00:39:02.100 --> 00:39:08.060]   that relates to the threat of the vehicle failing during an electromagnetic pulse event
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:12.660]   which can wreak havoc with any kind of electronic or computer equipment, especially in the car.
[00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:20.580]   It can cause a car to stop functioning. Now I concede the risk for equipment failure during
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:25.900]   electromagnetic pulse events but from the research, the test research that I've been
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:30.820]   able to find, I think that risk is usually overstated. I think people who seem to be
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.340]   knowledgeable would not say that every car that has a computer would stop functioning
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:37.860]   but that a percentage of the cars would stop functioning. But it's a difficult debate because
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.940]   a lot of the data a few years ago, a US government panel was commissioned that studied it. But
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:47.140]   their methodology, the test methodology was not real life in any way. It just wasn't good.
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:51.020]   So it's still an unknown question. Nobody has devoted the money and the time to actually
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:57.100]   blasting a bunch of modern cars with an actual up-to-date current strength electromagnetic
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:01.900]   pulse weapon to see what actually happens. It's all test data that's then extrapolated.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:06.380]   So I think the risk is lower. But I've always been a modern car guy. I mean, I don't know
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:09.460]   about you, but you think about starting a vehicle that has a carburetor, it's just a
[00:40:09.460 --> 00:40:13.020]   hassle. You have to pump the gas a bunch of times. It's much easier. Fuel injection is
[00:40:13.020 --> 00:40:17.340]   great. And I've always been to the conclusion that a modern car is so much better than the
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:22.660]   old cars in terms of reliability and efficiency. And I've generally thought of the position
[00:40:22.660 --> 00:40:26.820]   of saying, you know, yeah, a computer-controlled car might be a little harder to fix, might
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:31.260]   take some diagnostic equipment, but it's actually a lot more reliable than the old-fashioned
[00:40:31.260 --> 00:40:37.420]   car is. That's generally been where I have been on that particular debate in the past.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:42.620]   But Venezuela has changed me. Because what you see happening right now, as you see a
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:47.220]   collapsed society, is first, of course, you see massive shortages of fuel and whatnot,
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:53.300]   which is horrific in a country that has incredible fuel reserves and oil reserves. But you see
[00:40:53.300 --> 00:41:00.500]   that old cars have become much more valuable than new cars. And new cars have lost a huge
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:05.580]   portion of their value. Because if something breaks, the parts are not available. The spare
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.220]   parts, you can't get them. They're just not available. So if you, yeah, the computer told
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:14.460]   you that you only need this one part, but you cannot get it. And then the computer diagnostic
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:18.800]   equipment, etc. doesn't work. The power's on an hour a day, two hours a day, if that.
[00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:23.540]   It's just a nightmare. And so if you have a 1965 Volkswagen Beetle, you've got a gold
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:28.380]   mine because it's fuel efficient. It's all manual. There's no computers involved. You
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.360]   can fix it on the side of the road. You can pull the whole engine out and rebuild the
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:34.700]   engine on the thing practically if you've got the manual on the side of the road. And
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:39.780]   so seeing something like that, it made me say, "Huh, well, maybe I was wrong. Maybe
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:45.100]   the hardcore people were right, that there is actually something to this." And there
[00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:50.340]   have been many other experiences like that. Simple things of protecting from theft. You
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:54.780]   know, okay, put solar panels on my roof, but yet how do I protect those panels from being
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:02.300]   stolen? The physical violence in Venezuela right now is horrific. And it's things like
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:07.780]   communication, laying in the ability to communicate outside and to be off-grid and to have off-grid
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:12.180]   communications. If you have that right now, you have a lifeline. Now, there are still
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:16.500]   somewhat sometimes functional cell phone systems. So the modern cell phones still work. When
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:20.060]   the network is on, you can go buy a SIM card. You can get data out and that's still really
[00:42:20.060 --> 00:42:26.540]   good. You know, it's a lot easier for you to just wait 24 hours for WhatsApp to start
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:29.880]   working than it is for you to necessarily sit down and start tapping out messages in
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:39.020]   Morse code. But still, there's value in some of those things. And then being able to have
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:42.660]   food. Being able to have a way to feed your neighbors. And then being able to have stockpiles
[00:42:42.660 --> 00:42:47.700]   of food. Because you can have a garden that can provide for you, but then how do you figure
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:52.460]   out how to get your community fed? You need some outside support a lot of times. But yet
[00:42:52.460 --> 00:42:56.300]   if somebody would think ahead, it's not that hard to be prepared for some of those things
[00:42:56.300 --> 00:43:01.620]   in advance. So Venezuela has really impacted me deeply. And seeing a lot of what's happening
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:08.700]   there has caused me to say, "I'm not going to be just on the moderate perspective. I'm
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:14.020]   going to crank things up a little bit." Because that was an economic collapse. And what worries
[00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:19.740]   me and what concerns me is when I look at the United States, I look at it and say, "You
[00:43:19.740 --> 00:43:29.540]   know what? A lot of the positions being discussed by many modern politicians echo the same arguments
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:36.420]   that were discussed 15 years ago in Venezuela. And a lot of the things that in the Venezuelan
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:41.460]   society... It's easy, for example, it's easy to dismiss Latin America and Latin American
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:46.500]   politics as being somewhat dysfunctional. Because they are. They're just not stable.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.580]   The United States is far more stable than most of the countries in Latin America. Of
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.940]   course I want to concede many people say, "Well that's because of the US intervention
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:58.260]   in Latin America." Shelve that for another day. The point is, the US is far more stable
[00:43:58.260 --> 00:44:06.900]   than the events in Latin America. But you see the increasing levels of instability in
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:11.920]   the US-American society. You see the increasing fracturing of society. So instead of having
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:16.980]   a homogenous society with a common cultural understanding, you see increasing fracturing.
[00:44:16.980 --> 00:44:23.940]   You see increasing hyperbole. You see increasing distrust. And in a society with low trust,
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:29.420]   where it's hard to trust your neighbors, it leads to problems. That's pretty sobering
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:31.540]   to me.
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:36.580]   Another event is of course the increasing financial... worsening financial situation
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:44.580]   in the United States. I'm trying to be very diligent to not be given over to hyperbolic
[00:44:44.580 --> 00:44:50.060]   rhetoric, to be very cautious and thoughtful. But it doesn't inspire confidence as I continue
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:54.580]   to watch politicians. For example, this last week we had the second round of democratic
[00:44:54.580 --> 00:44:58.540]   debates. I covered this in a Q&A show, about 20 minutes of commentary in the first round.
[00:44:58.540 --> 00:45:03.940]   But in the second round, not a single mention of the federal deficit, not a single mention
[00:45:03.940 --> 00:45:10.320]   of the US federal debt, not a single mention of lowering expenses save Tulsi Gabbard made
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:15.240]   one comment about lowering expenses by ending the war in Afghanistan. Not a single mention
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:17.660]   of these things.
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:22.020]   And yet, as I have profiled extensively here on the show, as we look forward in the coming
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:28.300]   years, this year, next year, the next few years are really, really crucial. And I don't
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:35.060]   see a way, from my current perspective, I don't see a way where politically spending
[00:45:35.060 --> 00:45:41.860]   changes in the next few years. Now I can see a way where the rate of spending increases
[00:45:41.860 --> 00:45:47.680]   could change. And let me just briefly discuss this, the problem. Right now, the US government
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.140]   is running in excess of a trillion dollar deficit, possibly far in excess of a trillion
[00:45:51.140 --> 00:46:00.760]   dollar deficit. And that's at a time of relatively low unemployment, high employment, low unemployment.
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:06.700]   That's at a time of pretty strong economy on all sides. By many measures, a pretty strong
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:10.680]   economy. You could talk about the forward-looking indicator softening, maybe. You know, Dow
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:16.140]   just took a big dump today, but whatever, that happens a lot. So is it a long-term trend?
[00:46:16.140 --> 00:46:20.940]   You'll know in terms of what happens in the coming days. I don't know today. But you have
[00:46:20.940 --> 00:46:26.980]   a relatively strong economy and massive deficits. But yet, President Trump and the Republican
[00:46:26.980 --> 00:46:35.660]   congressmen and senators and all of the Republican political leaders, generally, I don't see
[00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:40.900]   any loud, vigorous protesting against the level of spending. Now on the flip side, I
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:46.360]   watched the Democratic debates and most of the Democratic candidates have large priorities
[00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:53.880]   for increased spending. Now, the best solution I could come up with would be to have a Democ-
[00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:57.580]   financially, just speaking fiscally, the best solution I could come up with would be to
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:05.080]   have a Democratic president be elected in the next presidential election and to have
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:10.180]   a Republican senate and a Republican congress. Because that was what President Obama faced,
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.380]   which actually turned President Obama into one of the biggest budget hawks of any recent
[00:47:14.380 --> 00:47:19.100]   president. It seems to be very dangerous for one political party to control the executive
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.960]   branch and the legislative branch, at least when it comes to spending. President Obama,
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:28.060]   I don't think because he wanted to spend less, but because there was a Congress controlled
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:34.380]   by Republicans in opposition to him, that spending decreased significantly under his
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:41.420]   administration. And so the best I could come up with would be a, in terms of a fiscal perspective,
[00:47:41.420 --> 00:47:45.700]   would be a Democratic president and a Republican senate and a Republican congress. Now, will
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:50.780]   that happen? I don't see how it will happen, but maybe so. But even that is not great because
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:55.140]   the built-in increases in spending are too high. So unless something were to change in
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:00.100]   the next year or two, where you start to hear a vigorous national debate on these subjects
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.340]   that actually matter, I don't know what happens. And then I look at the current debate and
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.380]   I say, is there any way that this thing changes? Is there any way that what you see changes?
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.600]   And it's just, it's dangerous. The way that people are speaking to one another at this
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:17.780]   point in time is dangerous. Just this last weekend, we of course had a number of devastating
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:23.140]   shootings in the United States. I try whenever I think and talk about these subjects to put
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:30.220]   them into historical context that with regard to their actual impact and their actual meaning,
[00:48:30.220 --> 00:48:35.980]   their actual impact and actual meaning is relatively low on a numerical basis. Mass
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:40.860]   shootings are not particularly common, but what they are is they're widely reported and
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:45.380]   they're widely discussed in a huge country like the United States. But they're not particularly
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:50.060]   common and the numbers are not particularly large. When you look on a global basis and
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:53.780]   you look at places where the news is less focused, when you don't have the massive amount
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:57.280]   of the English world and you're outside of the place that we are, where the whole world
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.940]   media is focused on the United States, stuff is just, bigger things are less reported.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:07.780]   For example, talking about Latin America, are you aware of what happened in Nicaragua
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:13.140]   in this past year and what's happening right now? Over about 300, I think 320, 325, something
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:19.900]   like that, over 325 people were killed by the government in Nicaragua in mass protests.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:23.380]   When you start to look at things like that, a tiny little country like Nicaragua, some
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:30.980]   few millions of people and 325 people killed, anti-government protesters killed by the government,
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:34.460]   it starts to put things into context a little bit when you talk about a few dozens of people
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:43.980]   who die in shootings. However, when you look at the actual impact, especially this weekend,
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:49.180]   what seems to be from early reports, one person coming from kind of a right-wing perspective,
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:54.340]   the other person perhaps coming from a left-wing perspective, I think what you see is an expression
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:50:02.940]   of a very mild, quiet form of civil war. And what worries me is the basic conditions that
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:08.020]   lead to these things happening. And it's a complex subject, very, very difficult, very
[00:50:08.020 --> 00:50:14.460]   hard to talk about because there's so many contributing influences, depending on which
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:19.060]   way you look at it. And when you survey data broadly, there's a lot of things that go into
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:25.040]   it. But what also concerns me more, however, is what happens after the effect. How do people
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:31.380]   talk to each other? And what I see, and I'm talking from mainstream perspectives, when
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:37.500]   I look at the editorials written and published in newspapers, when I look at the commentary
[00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:44.060]   that's being produced on TV, I don't see a lot of responsible adults, all of us being
[00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:49.220]   willing to humble ourselves and say, "We've got serious problems. Let's talk about what
[00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.840]   we could do and let's see if there's some things that can improve things." It's just,
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:58.700]   it's like you'd have a violent, horrific event, and then it just gets cranked up. And that
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:05.100]   causes both sides or all sides, because there's more than two, to become more and more entrenched.
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:12.260]   And all the fuel is there for more and more chaos, more and more violence to come. A couple
[00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:17.300]   of years ago, I personally moved the scale, the likelihood scale, the matrix that is in
[00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:24.860]   my head on civil war in the United States from implausible to plausible. Kind of a mild
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.920]   move, but there's a big meaning in that. A listener recommended it to me, and I listened
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:31.540]   to a podcast, I'll share it with you, you may be interested. There's a podcast that
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:37.780]   a man did called "It Could Happen Here." He did a podcast on basically civil war, one
[00:51:37.780 --> 00:51:43.100]   scenario of how civil war in the United States could happen, could break out. That term is
[00:51:43.100 --> 00:51:47.540]   very fraught to use, because when we think civil war, we think of Civil War I, or we
[00:51:47.540 --> 00:51:51.540]   think of this neat geographic division, these big armies, these kind of state-sponsored
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:51:55.880]   actors. I don't know of any modern military theorist or person who thinks about these
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.280]   things who would predict any of that kind of thing. I think what you see more would
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:05.660]   be basically what you saw this last weekend. So you might be interested in the podcast.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:10.700]   The guy's kind of a left-wing guy, so if you're a left-winger, you'll like it, if you're a
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:15.220]   right-winger, you won't. But I thought he did a really good job with kind of discussing
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:21.660]   the plausibility of the potential of civil war in the United States. Again, the podcast
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:27.320]   is called "It Could Happen Here." I have a number of significant disagreements with him,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:31.540]   but I appreciated his analysis, and you may enjoy that podcast if you're thinking about
[00:52:31.540 --> 00:52:33.260]   things like this.
[00:52:33.260 --> 00:52:37.580]   Now before I close the show, I should hasten to add that with most of these things, it's
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:43.840]   very hard to know how to give an appropriate context or level of weight to any particular
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:47.460]   event or the risk of any particular event. I'll give you an example from my experience
[00:52:47.460 --> 00:52:57.480]   in financial planning. When I sold life insurance and disability insurance, I developed a much
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:53:04.800]   greater appreciation for the value of life insurance or disability insurance than I did
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:09.580]   if I had not been involved in that market. If you go and talk to somebody who sold insurance
[00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:15.740]   for maybe a decade or more, they will probably have at least one death claim or at least
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:20.100]   one disability claim. You go and talk to an older insurance agent, somebody who's been
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:25.480]   in the business 30, 40, 50 years, they'll have a long history of stories. And when you
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:31.340]   start listening to the stories of real people, the lives of real people, it changes your
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:38.620]   perspective. For me, something as simple as having insurance on the lives of your children,
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:42.900]   the only death that I ever had when I sold insurance actively, I don't know if anybody
[00:53:42.900 --> 00:53:47.820]   has died on the policies that I sold after I left the business, but the only death that
[00:53:47.820 --> 00:53:53.260]   I had ever had on an insured was of a parent whose child got murdered. I think about a
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:58.580]   five or six year old child got murdered on the front lawn of a relative's house. It was
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:05.660]   the most incredible story, and yet it was so devastating that it caused me to lose my
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:12.820]   perspective and to have this deep emotional attachment to something like insurance for
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:21.100]   children. The same thing I think happens with considering events, whether it's your political
[00:54:21.100 --> 00:54:26.700]   discussions with people online, it's hard to reconcile the furor that you see online
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:31.940]   or on TV or whatever with your conversation with your neighbors. Just like it's hard to
[00:54:31.940 --> 00:54:37.420]   reconcile what you see in your community around, which is most likely peaceful and people just
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:42.340]   going about their lives, with thinking about what happens if there's mass inflation or
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:47.780]   hyperinflation. It's hard to see those things. And so then when you start exposing yourself
[00:54:47.780 --> 00:54:53.060]   to something, you wind up putting your brain into a form of selection bias. I can't get
[00:54:53.060 --> 00:54:59.500]   away from Venezuela. I can't get away from it. But yet I have to look and acknowledge
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:04.340]   that Venezuela is, relatively speaking, a small corner of the world, and there are still
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:08.820]   hundreds of other countries that are doing okay, and that even if you look at something
[00:55:08.820 --> 00:55:12.500]   like Venezuela, as devastating it is, there are millions of people just going on about
[00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:17.900]   their lives, trying to figure it out as best they can. And so it's easy to wind up with
[00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:24.500]   a warped sense of reality. I don't want to have that warped sense of reality myself.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:29.820]   That's why I always try to study whatever relevant data. That's why a few moments ago
[00:55:29.820 --> 00:55:33.740]   I was talking about shootings. I said, "They're pretty rare. School shootings are extremely
[00:55:33.740 --> 00:55:39.220]   rare. They're decreasing in popularity. There's not a big risk whatsoever when actually looked
[00:55:39.220 --> 00:55:44.640]   at the data." But that doesn't make the emotion of it any less significant. And so you can
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:50.080]   acknowledge with your mind that people are far, about, I don't know, what, 500 or thousands
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:54.260]   of times more likely to die from medical accidents, from medical errors, going to see the doctor
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:58.260]   and say, "Doctors are dangerous. You should stay out of doctor's offices." You can prove
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:03.420]   that with the data, but it doesn't feel that way when you're dealing with the distinct
[00:56:03.420 --> 00:56:12.460]   emotion of evil. So how do you deal with this stuff either in your own life or in public?
[00:56:12.460 --> 00:56:17.820]   I don't know. What you're hearing is me trying to figure out how do I communicate something
[00:56:17.820 --> 00:56:25.380]   that I believe is important, in some ways a warning tone that I believe is important.
[00:56:25.380 --> 00:56:32.140]   You heard me say that I've changed my own threat matrix. I've gone from, I can't remember
[00:56:32.140 --> 00:56:36.900]   how the DEFCON levels work. DEFCON 5 is higher, DEFCON 1. I've gone from, I don't know, DEFCON
[00:56:36.900 --> 00:56:42.380]   2 to DEFCON 3. I think DEFCON 5 is high. So I've gone from DEFCON 2 to DEFCON 3. And I'm
[00:56:42.380 --> 00:56:47.300]   trying to encourage you to do the same thing, but also to, at the same time, try to stay
[00:56:47.300 --> 00:56:54.060]   very grounded in reality, try to stay very firmly aware of my biases, firmly aware of
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:59.380]   the filters that I have, that we all have, and try to stay grounded in financial stability.
[00:56:59.380 --> 00:57:05.380]   Don't go into debt, don't borrow a bunch of money to make preparations, things like that.
[00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:11.660]   But I guess my closing appeal to you would be, if you are the kind of person who puts
[00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:20.100]   all your planning in the traditional financial planning matrix, I would ask you to reconsider
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:26.820]   that because there are many things that traditional financial planning cannot account for. And
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:33.260]   the cost of buying some insurance is not much compared to the potential benefit of that
[00:57:33.260 --> 00:57:43.980]   insurance if you ever need it. I want to also finally broach one more subject which is difficult,
[00:57:43.980 --> 00:57:50.460]   but I think important as you consider how to put this into a common financial context.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:54.380]   Over the years, since I left the financial advice industry, I've thought about a lot
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.620]   of the opinions that I once held, I've thought about the things I once advised, and I've
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:05.100]   tried to assess, especially with the perhaps perspective of time, I've tried to assess
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:11.820]   my own actions and if I was satisfied with the things I said, the things I did, my motivations,
[00:58:11.820 --> 00:58:20.140]   etc. And for the most part, I'm fairly happy with my involvement in that industry. I got
[00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:27.580]   some things wrong, I made some mistakes, some of them were just due to errors of inexperience,
[00:58:27.580 --> 00:58:31.660]   things I wouldn't say or do today, but for the most part, I'm fairly satisfied with my
[00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:41.300]   career in that business. But I've reflected a lot on the bias that is easy to have depending
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:49.500]   on your exposure to an industry. There's a saying that goes something like, "It's very
[00:58:49.500 --> 00:58:54.620]   hard to convince a man of something if his entire paycheck rests on his not recognizing
[00:58:54.620 --> 00:58:58.660]   it or not conceding the point." Something like that. And there's a real truth to that
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:04.420]   that I think is worth considering. That it's very hard to convince somebody of something
[00:59:04.420 --> 00:59:13.140]   if their paycheck depends upon them not conceding the point. Because none of us are immune to
[00:59:13.140 --> 00:59:19.540]   the pressures of our paychecks, none of us are immune to those outside influences and
[00:59:19.540 --> 00:59:24.140]   outside forces. We can try very hard to insulate ourselves, but at the end of the day, none
[00:59:24.140 --> 00:59:31.180]   of us are immune. I hate doing shows, in a sense, like this. Because it seems like, even
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:36.100]   though I don't think today's show is particularly divisive, any time I do a show that is hot
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:41.180]   or a little bit divisive or features some of my less popular opinions, I recognize the
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:47.020]   fact that it results in a lower paycheck. And that is hard to take. And so the point
[00:59:47.020 --> 00:59:51.660]   is none of us are immune from these things. But in the financial industry, I think I would
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:57.700]   divide a lot of times financial advisors and financial pundits largely into two camps.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:07.340]   There are the mainstream financial advisors and financial pundits, and they largely necessarily
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:16.860]   thrive on and preach optimism in all regards. And then there's the other side of the financial
[01:00:16.860 --> 01:00:23.940]   advice industry that largely makes its living on fear, doomsday predictions, and largely
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:30.300]   thrives on catastrophism. And it seems to me that we should acknowledge and recognize
[01:00:30.300 --> 01:00:35.980]   that both of these segments in the modern financial advice industry depend on their
[01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:41.620]   particular viewpoint being right in order to generate their paycheck. For example, when
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:47.580]   I sold investments, one of the things I had to do to get people to invest money was to
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:55.060]   convince them of the long-term value of investing their money with me. Because why would anybody
[01:00:55.060 --> 01:00:59.700]   take their hard-earned money out of the bank or out of whatever it's invested in and invest
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:03.900]   it in what you're suggesting to them if they didn't believe that they were going to get
[01:01:03.900 --> 01:01:08.220]   a better return, if they didn't believe that they were going to get a better outcome? They
[01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:12.140]   have to believe that their situation is going to be improved in some way, and they have
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:17.300]   to believe that improvement is going to come financially. And so you talk about all the
[01:01:17.300 --> 01:01:23.540]   good things that highlight your perspective, your opinion. You talk about the glowing returns,
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:27.580]   you talk about the stability and the safety of your investments, you try to diffuse the
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:31.460]   objections and the concerns that the client has and find a way to make them comfortable.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:36.100]   And that's fine, that's right. Hopefully you as an advisor have studied your issues and
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:39.900]   then you've come to your opinion and you're trying to share that with somebody. But it's
[01:01:39.900 --> 01:01:44.980]   not in your best interest if you are a person who's making their living on selling stocks,
[01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:50.420]   etc. It's just not in your financial best interest or even your psychological best interest
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:56.980]   to all of a sudden become a catastrophist. If your personal opinion is that the dollar
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:01:59.740]   is going to become worthless and the price of gold is going to shoot through the roof,
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:05.820]   it's a little hard then to, in good conscience, recommend to somebody that they buy your mutual
[01:02:05.820 --> 01:02:12.320]   fund. And so what tends to happen in that sphere of the business is you tend to feed
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:18.660]   your confirmation bias. You tend to fill your mind and your psyche with positive articles
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:23.860]   talking about why the catastrophists and the doomsdayers are wrong, talk about the long-term
[01:02:23.860 --> 01:02:27.700]   stability, talk about the case for optimism, talk about the incredible size and resiliency
[01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.940]   of the American economy, blah blah blah. You fill your mind with this. And if you're intelligent,
[01:02:31.940 --> 01:02:40.140]   you probably do it intentionally. I did. Because I needed to be, myself, psychologically strengthened
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:46.300]   in that position so that I could share that strength with other people. There's an old
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:54.180]   saying about selling that is, there is an old saying about selling which says that sales
[01:02:54.180 --> 01:02:59.820]   is the transfer of emotion or the transfer of enthusiasm. And so when you're selling
[01:02:59.820 --> 01:03:07.260]   something you are trying to transfer the enthusiasm that you have for something into another person.
[01:03:07.260 --> 01:03:13.820]   And so for you to be able to do that successfully, effectively, repeatedly, you need to have
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:20.700]   a high level of enthusiasm for what you are doing. So it's very hard for most of us who
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:24.700]   try to, and most financial advisors, try to come from a place of ethical integrity where
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:27.380]   they believe what they say. It's very hard to do that if you don't believe what you're
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:33.340]   saying. You can't do it and keep things going. So the mainstream financial advisor depends
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:42.700]   upon, for his livelihood, depends upon a presuppositional commitment to positivism, towards the positive
[01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:48.620]   story to help paint you into your retirement, to help you see yourself walking down the
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:54.060]   beach, etc. Now on the flip side, there's a whole market filled with catastrophists.
[01:03:54.060 --> 01:04:00.380]   And they usually sell products like investment newsletters, they sell books, they sell gold
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:07.020]   coins or they sell preparedness food or bunkers or things like that. And from the catastrophist
[01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:14.620]   perspective, the catastrophist has an intense investment into disaster, has an intense investment
[01:04:14.620 --> 01:04:19.740]   into everything going wrong. Because when you're trying to talk about all the problems
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.580]   and all the things that go wrong and you're trying to get somebody to get off their couch
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:28.860]   and write a check and buy a gold coin or write a check and buy a pallet full of preparedness
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:35.540]   food, you got to really believe what you see so that you can get that person to make that
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:44.260]   move. And so the catastrophist basically depends upon things, everything going bad. And so
[01:04:44.260 --> 01:04:48.180]   they can hardly admit when things don't always go bad or they can hardly admit when
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:53.460]   they've been wrong. And they can hardly admit when there's a case for optimism or
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.940]   reasons to believe that things could get better or reason to believe that things couldn't
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:05:04.620]   get worse than they were before. And I don't know how you untangle those two camps. I don't
[01:05:04.620 --> 01:05:11.700]   know how. Because there's so much invested in them. So here's what I would say to you.
[01:05:11.700 --> 01:05:18.300]   The only person ultimately that's going to matter is you. And I'll do my very best
[01:05:18.300 --> 01:05:23.540]   to try and tell you what I think and to be, if there's a link between the optimist and
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:28.060]   the catastrophist, maybe the realist. Right? Because the realist acknowledges that just
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.740]   because everything has gone well in the past doesn't mean that everything is going to
[01:05:31.740 --> 01:05:35.020]   go great in the future. And the realist should also acknowledge that just because we can't
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:38.660]   see a way out of this problem right now, that doesn't mean that we can't find a way
[01:05:38.660 --> 01:05:43.300]   out a year from now or two years from now, etc. Things are probably going to be a mixture.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:46.060]   They're probably not going to be as bad as I think they could be. And they're probably
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:51.780]   not going to be as good as I hope they are. But if you come back and try to maintain your
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:56.220]   own realist perspective, and then you come back and start counting the cost. Okay, if
[01:05:56.220 --> 01:06:01.100]   this, then what? If this, then what? If things go well, then what happens? If things go poorly,
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:06.340]   then what happened? And then bring that down to your individual decisions, you can start
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:12.900]   to, in my opinion, make some intelligent decisions and put in place some plans, etc. That's
[01:06:12.900 --> 01:06:16.460]   what I try to do. That's what I try to teach you. I think it's sound. If you see any
[01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:22.100]   errors in my thinking or any flaws in my analysis, feel free to email me and let me know. Joshua@radicalpersonalfinance.com.
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:26.420]   I'd be happy to hear from you and consider where I may be getting something wrong. But
[01:06:26.420 --> 01:06:31.500]   you're the best judge of where you are. And you're the best judge of what makes sense
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:36.940]   for you. You know, I guess as I close, I'll just mark it. I have a whole course on how
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:40.640]   to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis. I wrote it because I was concerned
[01:06:40.640 --> 01:06:43.420]   about the stuff. I started doing a lot of the stuff that I'm doing now because I've
[01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:47.540]   been concerned about these things. And I wrote the course to try to give you my best thinking
[01:06:47.540 --> 01:06:52.600]   on the subject. But let me give you just a simple example. As I looked at it, I said,
[01:06:52.600 --> 01:06:59.740]   you know, one valid solution to planning for catastrophe is move to a cabin in the woods.
[01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:04.860]   Right? That's a valid solution. But I don't want to live in the cabin of the woods in
[01:07:04.860 --> 01:07:10.180]   the middle of nowhere. And I would feel really dumb if I moved to a cabin in the middle of
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:15.340]   the woods in the middle of nowhere and live there for 20 years and then find out that
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.180]   things are more or less how they are today and that the catastrophe didn't happen. Now,
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:22.260]   if I were certain that there were thermonuclear war coming on the first of next month, the
[01:07:22.260 --> 01:07:25.100]   cabin in the woods would now take on a lot more appeal. But since I can't be certain
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:29.740]   about that, I have to weigh the cost of the cabin in the woods as compared to the risk
[01:07:29.740 --> 01:07:35.140]   of being wrong. And so that's why I've started, worked hard to try to come up with other solutions.
[01:07:35.140 --> 01:07:39.740]   Now, I don't think the cabin in the woods is a bad idea. I think it's a great idea,
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:47.260]   but not as a primary plan for me, at least. Maybe for you it will be. And so the solution
[01:07:47.260 --> 01:07:52.620]   that you come to has to be a solution that you're happy with if you're right in your
[01:07:52.620 --> 01:08:01.820]   analysis or if you're dead wrong in your analysis. And I think that if you get that way, if you
[01:08:01.820 --> 01:08:05.900]   can make that happen and you can build plans and solutions that you're happy with either
[01:08:05.900 --> 01:08:12.420]   way, then you have a really stable platform to build from. I know this was a fairly long
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:16.860]   show. I hope that I struck the right tone with you. I hope this was helpful to you.
[01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:22.480]   I hope that I'm succeeding in conveying how my concern is increasing and I think there's
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:29.060]   good reason behind that increasing concern, but yet not conveying, trying to sell fear
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:35.820]   or not conveying any sense of panic, et cetera, which those motions are unproductive and unhelpful,
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.640]   but just simply to try to convey a little bit of concern to get you to think about things
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.740]   that the mainstream financial planning industry doesn't usually think about. If you think
[01:08:43.740 --> 01:08:50.180]   that any of my ideas on solutions could be helpful for you, feel free to go to radicalpersonalfinance.com/store.

[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.220]   that. But if you do, you can get a refund. But I think what you'll find is if any of
