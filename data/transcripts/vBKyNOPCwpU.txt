[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:13.280]   Tony, a pastor, writes in to ask this. "Pastor John, I have heard you use Philippians 1 as a text showing evidence for Christian hedonism,
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.640]   but in reading it recently, I felt I could see a reason for denying Christian hedonism in it as well.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:26.840]   In verse 23, Paul says, "It is far better to be with Christ in death, and yet He remains in the flesh to minister to the
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.560]   Philippians because it is more necessary on your account," he writes.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.440]   Wouldn't it seem here that if Paul chooses a lesser joy, staying on earth, to love others,
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:47.040]   it would deny that the path of loving others is also the pursuit of our highest joy in God?
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040]   What do you say to Tony?
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.560]   That's a really sharp question.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:01:00.800]   Let me read the text to make sure we can see. It's a good question, and it caused me to think hard,
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.460]   and I thank Tony for it.
[00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.320]   Philippians 1 21, following, "For me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
[00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:17.320]   If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me." So the contrast is between my gain and
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.520]   fruitful labor.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.000]   "Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard-pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ,
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.440]   for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account."
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.440]   So the contrast is between
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:44.160]   far better right now for Paul in heaven versus more needed for the Philippians faith.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.880]   Verse 25, "Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.920]   for your progress and joy in the faith, so that in me
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.280]   you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus because of my coming to you again."
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.680]   Now Tony asks,
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.480]   "Wouldn't it seem here that Paul chooses a lesser
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.720]   joy, staying on the earth, in order to love others,
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.680]   which would deny then, if he did that, would deny that the path of loving others is
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.960]   a pursuit of his highest joy in God?
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:31.600]   And if that's true, then he's saying Christian hedonism principles don't hold. So that's very, very good, good question.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.680]   Here's my answer.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.880]   Paul did not say
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.920]   staying on earth is a lesser joy in the long run.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.960]   And if you asked him, "Do you think that staying on earth and
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.480]   serving the faith and the joy of the Philippians
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.960]   would bring you even greater joy with Christ in the age to come?"
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.840]   I think he would say, "Yes," because he says in verse 26
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.560]   that he's laboring for their faith so that in me
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.560]   you may have ample cause to glory in Christ. In other words, he shares in that
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.440]   glory because of working for them.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:19.000]   His work for them is
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   self-denial in one sense, but it is a
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.760]   participation in another sense. So that's why I think he says in Philippians 2 17,
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.080]   "Even if I am poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith,
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.000]   I am
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.280]   glad and rejoice with you all."
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:49.320]   So in Paul's mind, his staying on the earth and serving the joy and faith of the Philippians is a
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.280]   compounding of his joy in Christ in the long run.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.480]   So then the question remains,
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:05.800]   well, was he not talking then like a Christian hedonist when he said in verse 21 that death would be gained?
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:12.760]   And in verse 23 that he desires to depart and be with Christ.
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.880]   If staying here and serving the church is
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.160]   compounding his long-term joy, is he then choosing a
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.200]   lesser joy in wanting to go to heaven? And I think the answer is that Paul was not
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.160]   measuring
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.320]   his
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.480]   presence with Christ now
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.080]   against presence with him
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:47.440]   later after more years of ministry. Rather, he was measuring his presence with Christ now
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:54.520]   against sitting in jail in Rome. And he's saying that would be far better
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.320]   than sitting here in jail in Rome. He wasn't thinking in terms of contrasting.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:09.560]   Well, what I'm really choosing between is I'd rather go to heaven now and be with Christ than to have in
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.680]   ten years from now
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.800]   multiple joys in heaven with Christ because of all these people that are going to be built up in their faith.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.920]   I don't think he was he was thinking that way. So two
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.600]   different possibilities were in his mind. Going to be with Christ is best right now,
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.240]   measured against long-term
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:31.560]   responsibilities.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:36.680]   Staying to advance the faith of the Philippians is best for them.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.240]   That's how I, at the present anyway, work out the issue and think Paul is
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.840]   acting like a consistent Christian hedonist.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.720]   Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you, Pastor Tony, for the great question. Please keep sending us those kinds of questions. Those are great.
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.960]   So what is this thing we call Christian hedonism?
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:01.000]   We have a little four-minute video to explain it.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.960]   You can go to DesiringGod.org and click on the tab at the top of the page that says "About" and
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:13.280]   there you'll find a little video to explain Christian hedonism, which explains what we're all about at Desiring God.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.760]   I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you tomorrow.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   you
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.060]   you
[00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:22.120]   you
