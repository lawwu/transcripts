[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440]   I would like to call your attention this evening to a phrase that is to be found in Paul's
[00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:13.160]   epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 6, and reading verses 18, 19, and 20.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.520]   "Praying always and with all prayer and supplication in the spirit, and watching thereunto with
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:26.480]   all perseverance and supplication for all saints, and for me, that utterance may be
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.840]   given unto me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel, for
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:45.560]   which I am an ambassador in bonds, that therein I may speak boldly as I ought to speak."
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:53.320]   In other words, I'm going to call your attention again tonight to the mystery of the gospel.
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.880]   We've been doing this on previous Sunday nights in this month of November, and we've been
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:06.440]   even doing that as a part of a larger purpose, which is to consider what is the message of
[00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.200]   the Christian gospel.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.800]   I must repeat my reason for doing this, and yet in a way it's almost unnecessary that
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.800]   I should do so.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.440]   I am driven to consider with you what the gospel is and what its message is because
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.440]   of the appalling confusion amongst men and women with regard to that very subject.
[00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.560]   It's almost incredible, but it's nevertheless true, that ideas in people's minds as to what
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:41.880]   the gospel is and as to what a Christian is are almost something which is as completely
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.960]   removed from what you find in the New Testament itself as one could possibly imagine.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.520]   And therefore it is more necessary than ever that we should consider together the nature
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.560]   of this gospel and its message.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.680]   The reason for that, of course, is this, that there is no other hope in the world tonight
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.960]   apart from it.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.160]   I needn't waste your time in proving that.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.040]   The world itself shows that.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:12.520]   As I said last Sunday night, I would repeat again, the introduction to any gospel preaching
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.000]   today is the daily newspaper, and the more popular the paper, the better introduction
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.840]   it is, with all the lurid details of the courts and the things that are happening.
[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.680]   That in an age, in a century, which bursts of its knowledge and its learning, its education
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.320]   and its advancement, everything else has failed.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.600]   This is not even being considered, leave alone tried, because it's misunderstood, as I am
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.560]   saying, and therefore regarded as being outmoded and irrelevant.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.840]   Very well, nothing is more urgently important than that we should consider what the New
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.760]   Testament itself has to say to us with regard to the nature and the character of this gospel
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.760]   and its message.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.200]   And we've been looking at various descriptions which the New Testament itself gives of the
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   gospel, and we came to this particular designation, the mystery of the gospel.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.640]   And it's most important that we should understand this.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:20.120]   I've tried to show you that the gospel, by its very nature, is of necessity a mystery
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.200]   to men as he is by nature.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.600]   Now what we mean by mystery is this.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.800]   Something which is hidden and secret from men, and which can only be known as God reveals
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.360]   it.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.200]   And when the New Testament talks about the mystery of the gospel, what it means is, this
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.080]   thing which in and of itself is secret, but which God, in his infinite kindness and mercy
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:52.400]   and compassion, has chosen to make known to us, the children of men.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.260]   The mystery of the gospel.
[00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.440]   But remember, that includes this, that it is something we cannot grasp by our own aided
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.160]   minds and understandings.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.240]   It's beyond us, it deludes us.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.200]   Now I tried to show you that, how that is inherent in the very nature of the gospel.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.440]   I then tried to show it to you in terms of the whole mystery of God's relationship to
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   this world.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.720]   And it is obviously a mystery to people.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.200]   The very questions they put, "Why does God allow war?"
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.200]   "If God is God, why does this happen?"
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.120]   All these questions just show that the whole thing's a mystery to people.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:34.560]   But it's not a mystery to the Bible, there is an explanation here, and we've considered
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:35.800]   it.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.960]   And then last Sunday night we came on, oh, to what is of course the central mystery of
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.640]   it all.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:49.600]   The mystery of the person of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.080]   Here is the mystery of mysteries.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.840]   God manifest in the flesh.
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:02.160]   You remember Charles Wesley's eloquent way of putting it, "Veiled in flesh, the Godhead
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:08.200]   of heaven, see, pale incarnate deity."
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:09.200]   That's mystery.
[00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.360]   There's no mind that can understand that.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.840]   Your greatest brain is childish when it comes to this.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:23.000]   There is no understanding of this by the natural mind, the thing is ridiculous.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.720]   But that is the mystery, and we tried last Sunday night to look at the mystery of the
[00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.200]   person of our blessed Lord, two natures in one person, God and man, yet one person.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.520]   That's the mystery.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.560]   And we considered together the various ways in which the mystery and marvel of his person
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.560]   are held before us and displayed to us in the pages of the New Testament, and how what
[00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:55.920]   the Bible itself says is the only way to understand it.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.120]   And if we preach to any purpose last Sunday night, and if the Holy Spirit of God was really
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.200]   dealing with that message and your minds at the same time, well then you are all ready
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:10.480]   to say at the very beginning tonight what we ended with last Sunday night.
[00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:15.000]   Great is the mystery of Godliness.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.840]   God was manifest in the flesh, justified of the Spirit, preached to the nations, believed
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.960]   on in the world, received up into glory.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.480]   Very well.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:36.080]   But now last Sunday night in dealing with that, I said that we would have to come tonight,
[00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.960]   God willing, to consider another aspect of this great mystery of the gospel, and that
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.160]   is the mystery of the death of our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:56.000]   It's a part, of course, of this great mystery of his person, but it is a particularly difficult
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:03.560]   part of the mystery to the natural, unaided mind and intellect and understanding.
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:08.440]   At the same time, it is a very central part of the message of the gospel in the New Testament
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:09.760]   itself.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:16.160]   So we are bound to consider it and to look at it and to examine it together.
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:20.040]   It is one of the focal points of this mystery.
[00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:24.400]   I mean this, that even when you begin to get a glimmering of an understanding of the person
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:30.720]   himself, when you see him nailed to that tree, you are in difficulties again.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.720]   It is a mystery.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.680]   The New Testament itself says so.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:39.080]   It is one of the focal points of this great mystery of Godliness, the mystery of the person
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.880]   of our blessed Lord and Savior.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.400]   But you see, it is absolutely essential to the gospel message.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.400]   The apostle Paul reminds the members of the church at Corinth that when he was amongst
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:57.400]   them he determined not to know anything amongst them, said, "Jesus Christ and him crucified."
[00:07:57.400 --> 00:08:04.120]   He tells the Galatians that he placarded this crucified Christ before them.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.520]   He was like a man holding a placard in front of him, and on the placard was this cross
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.840]   with this person dying upon it, visibly set forth, placarded, he says, amongst you.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.760]   It is indeed, as anybody who has ever read the New Testament will know, the great theme
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.560]   of the whole of the New Testament.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:29.320]   Very well, that is why we have got to deal with it.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:35.080]   But there is a yet further reason for dealing with it, and it is this.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:41.400]   Because it is so crucial, because it is so vital, it again has been one of the points
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:47.680]   at which the devil and all that is opposed to the Christian faith have generally concentrated
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:49.240]   their attack.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:54.600]   I was reminding you last Sunday night how in the first centuries the great major heresies
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:09:00.920]   were nearly all concerned with the person of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.560]   Some which said that he was man only, others said that he was God only, who took on a kind
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.680]   of covering of flesh, put on a kind of cloak of flesh, but that the incarnation was not
[00:09:10.680 --> 00:09:12.520]   real, and so on.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:14.720]   All the heresies were about the person of our Lord.
[00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:18.920]   They came up immediately in the first few centuries, and the great councils of the Church
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:23.000]   had to meet in order to deal with them and to define the doctrine.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.440]   No doubt the Gospels themselves were written very largely to that end and for that purpose.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:34.200]   But it is exactly the same with this matter of the death of our Lord.
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.400]   The attack of the enemy has been particularly vicious here.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:44.000]   And again some of the leading heresies in the long history of the Church have turned
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.160]   upon this question of the meaning of the death of our Lord and Savior.
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.320]   The devil will do anything he can to get people wrong at this crucial point, because it is
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:10:01.240]   one of the things that is absolutely essential to salvation.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:05.200]   Now there are other aspects of truth that are not essential to salvation.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:08.760]   There are many things in the teaching of the New Testament about which many of us have
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   disagreed.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.200]   They are not essential to salvation.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.040]   There are differences of opinion about many things, like baptism and about the second
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.720]   coming and many things like that, with regard to the details, I mean.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.840]   But about this, there is no disagreement to be at all.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:28.280]   The teaching is plain and is clear.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.280]   It is vital.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.280]   It is essential.
[00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:37.400]   There is no salvation except one believes in Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:38.440]   Very well.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.440]   We must look at this.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.560]   It is a part of this great mystery of the Gospel.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.800]   Now let me show you that.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:51.320]   Let me first of all remind you of some of the ways in which men and women today try
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.640]   to get rid of the mystery.
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.640]   They do not like it.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.780]   They do not like the cross.
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:05.120]   They dislike still more any talk or preaching about the blood of Christ.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.120]   I believe I once told you of an incident in my own experience.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:15.320]   I was on holiday on one occasion and trying to read something quietly, when a man staying
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:18.400]   at the same place as I was came to me and disturbed me and said, "Come."
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:19.800]   He said, "Look here, we want your help here.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:23.680]   I have got involved in an argument with a man about the Gospel."
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:28.280]   So I went with him and there I found this friend of mine, a businessman, having an argument
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:33.880]   with a very clever and able solicitor who was an unbeliever and who did not like the
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:35.800]   Gospel.
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:37.920]   We began to talk and to discuss.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:42.200]   The solicitor said to me after a while, "Of course, you know, the trouble about our friend
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   here is this.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.720]   There are many things about this Gospel that I like very much, but you know, he will bring
[00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:50.000]   in this blood and thunder business.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   There is blood."
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.520]   So he waxed eloquent and blasphemous about the blood of Christ.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.280]   I have often heard men do that in discussions.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.480]   I remember a man many years ago talking to me about, "You Christian people wallowing
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.160]   in the blood of Christ.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:16.560]   Nothing produces such sarcasm, such scorn, such division as the mentioning of the blood
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:20.320]   of Christ, the preaching of the blood of Christ."
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:27.520]   And so it is today you will find that all these supposed new theologies, new statements
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   of Christianity, the new way of presenting the message of the New Testament to the modern
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:40.400]   1964 men, these great men, these sophisticated individuals, these men of the atomic age,
[00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:45.160]   these scientific men, these men who are altogether different from everybody who has ever lived
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:52.800]   before, you read them and you will find that they all get rid of the mystery of the cross,
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:54.520]   the mystery of the death of our Lord.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.800]   How do they do it?
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:58.200]   Well, they have got quite a number of ways.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.960]   Once more, there is nothing new about it.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:06.720]   That is what really does weary me about all these supposed new ideas in up-to-date books.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:09.280]   They are as old as the hymns.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.720]   There is not a single new idea.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:13.920]   They put it in new jargon, of course.
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:16.840]   Certain pseudo-scientific terminology comes in.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:21.160]   But it is the old heresies that have troubled the Church from the very beginning.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:24.560]   Nothing new at all, as old as the hymns.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.560]   What are they?
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.480]   Well, some of them say, you see, that the death of our Lord upon the cross was just
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.480]   a tragedy.
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:34.520]   But they say you get that in the world.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:39.000]   Great men are very rarely appreciated by the world.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.880]   One is forever on the scaffold, one forever on the throne.
[00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.880]   That is life, they say.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.560]   Socrates had to suffer in the same way.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.560]   Most great men are ahead of their times.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:54.640]   They are only appreciated when they have long been dead.
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   And here was one, obviously ahead of his times, a great religious and political genius.
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.280]   The people could not follow him and they could not understand him.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.280]   So they got rid of him.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.280]   But it is a tragedy.
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:09.600]   That is the tragedy of the world, that it does not recognize its own great men.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.160]   And here is one of the great examples of that very thing.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.280]   Nothing remarkable, do not talk about a mystery.
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:20.040]   It is simple, it is quite plain, it is elementary to a man who knows anything about the psychology
[00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.680]   of the mob and of the mass.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.680]   They are always doing this sort of thing.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.680]   That is one way.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.720]   And others put it in a similar manner, but they put it like this, they say, that this
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.440]   is the death of a very honest teacher.
[00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:40.880]   He had taught certain things, the Jewish authorities did not like it, they were jealous of him,
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:44.440]   they wanted him to withdraw and recant, but he would not do it, he was just an honest
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:45.440]   man.
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.400]   And rather than go back on his own teaching and principles, he preferred to be put to
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.400]   death.
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:53.120]   And there are people like that again, they say.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.120]   And there it is.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.560]   Some take it a stage further than that, and they say, well, this man, he had come to obey
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.600]   God and he believed he was preaching the word of God, and so when they told him to stop,
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   he would not.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.320]   He said, I obey God rather than men.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.960]   That would mean death, all right, he said, put me to death.
[00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:16.240]   It is nothing mysterious, nothing unusual about this, it simply fits into a pattern.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:20.320]   And then there are many others today, and this is quite popular with so many of them,
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:27.840]   who just regard it as the death of the supreme pacifist, passive resistance.
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:32.240]   Not striking back, not hitting back, just allowing the world to do anything it likes
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   to do.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:39.480]   It is the basic argument, they say, for pacifism, and Jesus Christ, Jesus they generally call
[00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:46.240]   him, incidentally, these friends, is the supreme example of a pacifist.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.960]   But coming higher up the scale yet, there are many who say, oh no, there is more than
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.160]   that in it.
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.280]   They say it is a part of the gospel, a very vital part, it is not an accident, it is not
[00:15:58.280 --> 00:16:01.120]   a tragedy, it is a vital part of the gospel.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.760]   Well, what is it, you ask them?
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:08.000]   Well, they say, this is its real meaning.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.600]   The cross took place in order that we might get to know the love of God.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:18.360]   Now this often passes as the evangelical doctrine of the cross.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:23.800]   I have known men within the last fifteen years who have preached this and have been regarded
[00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:24.800]   as evangelical.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:29.800]   This is how they have put it, that what is happening on the cross is simply that God
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:37.440]   is telling the world, though you do this to my son, I still love you, I still forgive
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.440]   you.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:40.800]   That is the same meaning.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:46.240]   And that the Son is saying the same thing, that he dies willingly and tells us, though
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.680]   you are killing me, I still love you.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:52.000]   Nothing can separate you from my love.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And that is the teaching.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:58.320]   It is a kind of universalist teaching which says that God is telling everybody, whether
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:04.000]   they realize it or not, that though they have even killed his only son, he still loves them.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.440]   There is no more than that in it.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:08.520]   It is mainly the world's action.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.760]   And all God is doing is to say that though you have done this to my son, still I love
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:16.360]   you, still I forgive you.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:21.160]   It does not matter what you do, I love you, I forgive you, I love you all, and all of
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.160]   you are going to be saved.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.960]   I am telling you that in the death of my son, why do not you believe it?
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   Very well.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   All I want you to see, my dear friends, is this, that all these teachings just take the
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:36.240]   mystery out of the cross.
[00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:43.840]   There is no sense of wonder left, there is no amazement left, if that is all that is
[00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:46.200]   meant by the death of our Lord upon the cross.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   Well, then, I do not see why Isaac Watts should ever have written his greatest hymn, "Will
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:18:00.960]   I survey the wondrous cross on which the Prince of Glory died, my richest gain I count but
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.400]   loss and poor contempt on all my pride."
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.920]   It does not explain it.
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:10.880]   The wonder, the amazement, the marvel, the mystery have been taken away.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:15.240]   It has been reduced to the level of something that we can fully understand.
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.440]   There is no difficulty about understanding it.
[00:18:17.440 --> 00:18:19.720]   It comes within our realm of understanding.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.120]   It fits in with our notions and categories.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.280]   But you see, that is not what we are told in the New Testament.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:33.440]   We are told here that this is a vital central part of the mystery of the Gospel, and those
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:36.600]   are the terms in which it is presented to us everywhere.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:41.400]   Let me therefore in the second place give you some illustrations and examples to prove
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.360]   to you what I am trying to say.
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:54.000]   According to this teaching, the death of our Lord was always something extraordinary, unusual,
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.840]   unexpected, and mysterious.
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:19:04.840]   And no set of people found the death of our Lord more mysterious than our Lord's own
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.840]   disciples.
[00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:14.280]   Let me give you one example to show you what I mean, and it is a very, very striking one.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:20.480]   Most people are agreed that one of the most striking figures in the apostles was the apostle
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:21.480]   Peter.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:28.360]   Quick, energetic, and a man who was always ready to volunteer and to do things.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:32.720]   And you remember how on one famous occasion when our Lord at Caesarea Philippi had put
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.560]   the question, "Whom do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?"
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:40.560]   They said, "Some say thou art John the Baptist, some Elias, others Jeremiah, or one of the
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:41.560]   prophets."
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:43.920]   And he said unto them, "But whom say ye that I am?"
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:51.480]   Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:57.040]   Jesus answered and said unto him, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:01.560]   hath not revealed this unto thee, but my Father which is in heaven.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:06.200]   And I also say unto thee that thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church,
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:09.880]   and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.600]   And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven," and so on.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:19.600]   And then listen, "From that time forth Jesus began to show unto his disciples how that
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.800]   he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:30.600]   scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day."
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:34.880]   Now the popular teachings nearly all give you the impression that our Lord never expected
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880]   his death.
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:37.200]   He never anticipated it.
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.720]   It came upon him unawares.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.760]   It was this tragedy, the blindness of men, and he was just an innocent victim who was
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.760]   surprised.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.280]   I remember a man once, and he thought he was preaching the gospel, taking those great words,
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:55.960]   "It is finished," and ending a sermon with what he thought was a climax by interpreting
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:02.480]   those two words, "It is finished," in these words, "It's all up.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.320]   It's all up.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:08.560]   They're so blind that they don't understand my teaching.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.880]   It's all up."
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.560]   So they represent our Lord as disappointed, but that in spite of his disappointment, as
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:21.320]   I say, that God's love is still there and telling us that though you've done even this,
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:22.320]   all is well.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.400]   Well now then listen, "From that time forth Jesus began to show unto his disciples how
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.600]   that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:35.560]   and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day.
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:43.880]   Then Peter took him and began to rebuke him, saying, 'Be it far from thee, Lord; this
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:47.640]   shall not be unto thee.'
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:52.480]   But he turned and said unto Peter, 'Get thee behind me, Satan, thou art an offense unto
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:58.120]   me for thou savourest not the things that be of God, but those that be of men.'
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:02.320]   Now you see, Peter stumbled, and so did all the others.
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:08.240]   There was only the spokesman, and they kept on being amazed and astonished in this way.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:13.560]   Our Lord keeps on making these statements about his death, and they fumble and they
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.160]   stumble and they don't understand.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:18.160]   Let me give you just one other illustration.
[00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.040]   The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying unto him, 'Get thee out and depart
[00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:27.240]   hence, for Herod will kill thee.'
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:32.000]   And he said unto them, 'Go ye and tell that fox, behold, I cast out devils and I do cure
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.840]   us today and tomorrow, and the third day shall be perfected.'
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:43.720]   Then another time later on, when the mother of the sons of Zebedee asks Our Lord that
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:48.080]   her children, her sons, shall be one on the right hand and one on the left, Our Lord makes
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:52.120]   His great statement about coming to give His life a ransom for many, and we are told they
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.800]   were amazed.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.920]   They just couldn't understand Him, and they were always arguing with Him.
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.120]   There is a statement in the eleventh chapter of John's Gospel which helps to bring this
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:10.800]   out, Thomas, and this time being the spokesman.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:16.360]   He says to the others, 'Let's go with him, that we may die with him.'
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:22.120]   Then said Thomas, which is called Didymus, unto his fellow disciples, 'Let us also go,
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:25.640]   that we may die with him.'
[00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:29.160]   They were always, I say, in this kind of trouble.
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.720]   They couldn't follow this.
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.880]   It was an offence to them.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:38.080]   And so we are told that when he makes his teaching still more explicit, they were very
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.600]   troubled and cast down, and he keeps on telling them that he is going to leave them, and they
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.400]   are so cast down that he turns to them and says, 'Let not your heart be troubled,
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:52.060]   ye believe in God, believe also in me.'
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.880]   They were completely dejected and cast down when he tells them about his going.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:02.400]   Thus, you see, I think I've said enough to demonstrate to you that all his own chosen
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:07.240]   disciples, those in the innermost circle, found his death to be a mystery to them, every
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   time he mentions it.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:15.360]   And when at the end he is arrested, this is the laconic remark with which the evangelists
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.940]   tell us what happened, 'They all forsook him and fled.
[00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.400]   They left him alone.
[00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:25.400]   He trod the winepress alone.'
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:29.160]   Very well, now there it is, you see, even in his own chosen disciples.
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:30.720]   They cannot understand this.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.200]   They are not the only ones.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:40.720]   That clever man Caiaphas, who was the high priest at that time, he misunderstood it also.
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   Listen to him.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.920]   'Then gathered the chief priests and the Pharisees, the council, and said, 'What
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:47.820]   do we for this man doeth many miracles?
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:51.400]   If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him, and the Romans shall come and take
[00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:53.840]   away both our place and nation.'
[00:24:53.840 --> 00:24:58.440]   And one of them, named Caiaphas, being the high priest that same year, said unto them,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:03.400]   'You know nothing at all, nor consider that it is expedient for us that one man should
[00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:08.000]   die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.'
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.320]   This spake he not of himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:15.760]   should die for that nation.'
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.520]   But you see, the clever politician, he completely misunderstands it.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.040]   He says, 'Look here, don't make a fuss about this.
[00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.240]   It's a good thing that they should kill him, because that will probably satisfy the
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:28.160]   Roman authorities, and when they've got rid of him, they'll probably leave us alone.'
[00:25:28.160 --> 00:25:32.960]   That was his view, purely a political question, and something, therefore, which can be used
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:37.240]   to the advantage of the Jewish nation.
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.160]   I could give you many other examples.
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:40.600]   I needn't do so.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   Read your Gospels.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:46.680]   You will find that everybody misunderstood the death of our Lord.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.640]   Go on to your epistles, and you'll find that the same thing continues.
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:56.080]   The Apostle Paul, writing to the Corinthians, reminds them that the preaching of Christ
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:05.440]   crucified is to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks it is foolishness.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   They ridiculed it.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.000]   They ridiculed the Apostle Paul.
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.200]   They said, 'Who is this man who's always talking about some man who's been nailed
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:17.480]   on a tree, died on a gibbet, Jesus Christ and him crucified?'
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.040]   The Jews said, 'This is nonsense.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.360]   Our Messiah, when he comes, is going to be a great, mighty military deliverer.
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.200]   He's not going to be crucified in weakness.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:28.560]   He's going to conquer the whole world and put the Jews up over all the nations, and
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.240]   you're telling us that this carpenter who died on a tree is our Messiah?
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.080]   It's a stumbling block.'
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:36.400]   And they stumbled at it and rejected it.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:42.440]   And to the Greeks, with their wisdom and their philosophy and their knowledge and understanding,
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:48.440]   the thing was just monstrous, that some unknown carpenter from Galilee, by dying upon a tree,
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:53.000]   should be the solution to the world's problems, should be the revealer of God and ultimate
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.200]   truth and reality.
[00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:56.720]   The thing was sheer madness.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.280]   The only man who can give the solution is a man who belongs to the Academy of the Ports,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:07.360]   who lives in Athens and who teaches as a philosopher, not some unknown ignorant barbarian like this,
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.480]   and especially dying upon the cross.
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.480]   The thing is nonsensical.
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   It's foolishness, they say.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:17.600]   And Paul reminds them of that, but he puts it still more strongly.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:23.240]   He says, 'We speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom which God
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:30.040]   ordained before the world and to our glory, which none of the princes of this world knew.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:38.880]   For had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.'
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.240]   They crucified the Lord of glory.
[00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.520]   They didn't know what they were doing.
[00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:43.800]   They didn't understand him.
[00:27:43.800 --> 00:27:46.560]   They understood his death still less.
[00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:52.000]   So you see, the New Testament tells us right away through that the death of our Lord has
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.080]   been a standing mystery.
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.080]   It was a mystery at the time to everybody.
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   What is this?
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:27:59.080]   What's the meaning of it?
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:03.920]   Well, let me put to you a third proposition which will help us to come in the direction
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.600]   of a solution.
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.000]   Why is it such a mystery?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:11.360]   Well, the answer is obvious from the Gospels.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:17.000]   It is, of course, because of this apparent contradiction in him.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.440]   He stands as an enigma.
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:20.840]   You think you've got him classified.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:24.720]   He does something and you have to start all over again.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:26.720]   And there are these apparent contradictions.
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:33.060]   On the one hand, we see him as one of great power, great strength, great authority.
[00:28:33.060 --> 00:28:35.600]   We see him working miracles.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:41.760]   Here is one who can turn to a raging wind and say, "Peace, be still."
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:42.960]   And there was a great calm.
[00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:47.760]   He can stop the raging of the billows, the rolling of the billows.
[00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:48.760]   "Peace, be still."
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:51.840]   And there was a great calm.
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:54.840]   He is master of creation.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:29:01.400]   He can give sight to the blind, make the deaf hear, make the lame walk.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.040]   He can raise the dead.
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.960]   He did so.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   This is a part of the mystery.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.320]   I was showing it to you last Sunday night.
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:09.320]   Miracles.
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:11.680]   I have no Gospel unless our Lord worked miracles.
[00:29:11.680 --> 00:29:16.840]   These are the signs of his person, of his godhead, of his authority, of his messiahship.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:17.840]   He worked miracles.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:22.880]   He raised the dead more than once.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:29.400]   There he is, you see, on one side, filled with power, filled with strength, filled with
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   ability.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:37.960]   And he says that if he wanted to escape death, he could do so quite easily.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:43.360]   He said, "Know you not that I can commend twelve legions of angels and can easily be
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.960]   carried into heaven?"
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:45.960]   No difficulty.
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:50.720]   He is a master, I say, of all creation.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:55.120]   And indeed we read that when the soldiers came to arrest him in the garden, when he
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.640]   stood before them, they fell back.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:03.760]   They saw something of the authority and the majesty of his blessed person.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.720]   And yet, while you see all that on one side, and the claims that he makes for himself,
[00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.600]   he says, "I am come into the world."
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:18.400]   He says, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:21.280]   He says, "I and the Father are one."
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:26.400]   There is one side, but there is another side.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:34.320]   He is arrested in apparent, utter weakness and helplessness.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:40.480]   The one who can commend the elements and even control the sea and the wind, heal people
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:46.520]   who are diseased, give life to the dead, he cannot resist just a handful of people who
[00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:47.520]   come to arrest him.
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:57.280]   He is arrested in apparent helplessness and complete hopelessness, nailed to a tree, and
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.640]   then dies in utter weakness.
[00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:05.600]   And what we are told, this is the most significant thing, that he died very quickly.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.200]   We are told that when the soldiers came and found that he was already dead, they were
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:11.200]   quite astonished.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.000]   You know, death by crucifixion was a very slow death.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.440]   That is what made it so horrible, that is what made it so painful, that is what made
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:21.560]   it such a cruel thing to do.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:27.520]   You just nailed a man to a tree, and there it took generally about two days and sometimes
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:34.440]   more for him gradually to lose his energy and his life and to die.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:40.840]   But when they came to look at him and the two thieves, one on each side, they were astonished
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.720]   to find that he was already dead.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:49.560]   When they struck a spear into his side, out came blood, clot and serum, which is called
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:51.360]   in the scriptures blood and water.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.680]   He had already been dead for some time.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.560]   Now this is an amazing thing, that he not only dies without any power of resistance,
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:00.840]   he dies so quickly.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.960]   Now there, you see, is the essence of the mystery.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:10.080]   This abnormal strength on the one hand, this utter abject weakness on the other hand.
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.880]   Now this is the thing that has baffled people.
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:16.080]   You see, it was the thing that baffled those people who were there round about him at the
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.960]   foot of the cross.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:25.720]   That crowd, you remember, that we heard crying out and saying to him, "He saved others,
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:28.120]   himself he cannot save."
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.320]   And the very clever ones who said, "Ah, thou who savest others, come down from the
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:34.320]   cross, save thyself."
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:38.920]   The rulers of the people said that, and all the common herd, the common crowd, they jeer
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.280]   at him, and that's the very point they make.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.960]   You they say who have worked miracles, you who say that you are the Messiah, you who
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:52.920]   claim to have the power of a God, if you are, come down, give us proof of it.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:57.160]   And he seems to fail ignominiously at the challenge.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:00.680]   What's the point of saying that you are God as well as men?
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:03.800]   What's the point of saying that you are filled with the Spirit and that you have all authority
[00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   and power, if you can't save yourself from your enemies?
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:11.360]   Come down, they say.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:18.920]   But he died in utter weakness and in complete helplessness.
[00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:22.320]   Oh, there is the essence of the mystery.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:24.920]   Shall we allow Charles Wesley to put it for us again?
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:27.760]   He's put it in an immortal verse.
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:38.320]   "'Tis mystery all, listen, the immortal dies.
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:43.280]   Who can explore his strange design?
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:49.920]   In vain the firstborn seraph tries to sound the depth of love divine.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:59.440]   'Tis mercy all, let earth adore, let angel minds inquire no more.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:03.500]   My friend, you boast of your brain, well now then, here's my problem for you.
[00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:04.920]   This is what you've got to explain.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:11.280]   'Tis mystery all, the immortal, he's immortal, he's God the Son, he's come from heaven, he
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.560]   is the Word, in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:15.560]   God.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   He's immortal.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:20.200]   He always was, he has simply come into the world.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:25.060]   The immortal dies.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:30.400]   Or as Peter puts it in a sermon at Jerusalem, just after he'd healed the men at the beautiful
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:35.480]   gate of the temple, he said, "You put to death the Prince of Life."
[00:34:35.480 --> 00:34:38.840]   Here's your paradox, here's your problem, here's your mystery.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   The immortal dies, the Prince, the author of life, dies, expires, ceases to be.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:48.280]   How do you explain it?
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.680]   Here's the mystery of the death of Christ.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.240]   These apparent, irreconcilable things.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:00.080]   My friend, all I'm anxious to do tonight is this, to let you see that you're face to face
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:03.040]   here with a great mystery.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:07.560]   Don't talk to me about your Socrates, don't talk to me about your political martyrs, don't
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:10.080]   talk to me about any man who's died for a principle.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.480]   I'm not deriding them, I'm not derogating from their greatness or the wonder of what
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:18.360]   they did, all I'm here to say is that you can't put him into this category.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:23.320]   There is a mystery here at the very center which cannot be explained along these naturalistic
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:27.480]   terms.
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:31.840]   Very well then, what is the explanation?
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:37.040]   Now I told you at the beginning that a mystery is something which in and of itself is hidden
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.480]   and secret, but which God has chosen to reveal and to make plain and clear to us.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.480]   That's the very thing that the preaching of the gospel is designed to do.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:51.360]   Pray for me, says Paul to those Ephesians, pray for me that utterance may be given unto
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:56.800]   me, that with all boldness I may declare the mystery of the gospel and the mystery especially
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.440]   of Jesus Christ and him crucified.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:01.440]   Why?
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:07.760]   Well, because other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:09.640]   Christ.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:16.280]   This was the preaching of the apostle Oliver, Jesus Christ and especially him crucified,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.500]   the dying savior, the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:20.500]   What is it?
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:21.500]   What's the explanation of the mystery?
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:27.800]   Well, now you know the trouble with a matter like this is, my dear friends, this whole
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:32.320]   question of time, isn't it?
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:38.280]   I'm almost a lunatic to attempt it, and yet I want you to see the key to this amazing
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:39.280]   mystery.
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.440]   Our Lord himself leads us into it.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.960]   You know, very early in his teaching he said something like this, "As Moses lifted up
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:57.320]   the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, that whosoever
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:04.600]   believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:11.880]   For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
[00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:16.160]   in him should not perish, but have everlasting life."
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:19.080]   Here he is, you see.
[00:37:19.080 --> 00:37:21.960]   He's beginning to tell us about it.
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:26.360]   He says, you remember in the Old Testament how when the people were bitten with serpents
[00:37:26.360 --> 00:37:30.600]   and they were dying in large numbers, God told Moses, "Make a serpent out of brass,
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.240]   put it on a pole, hold it up, tell people to look at it.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.640]   Anybody who looks at that will be healed."
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:35.640]   And they were.
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:39.200]   Our Lord says, "I am something like that."
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:46.360]   Even as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so—listen—must, must
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:52.160]   the Son of Man be lifted up on a tree on a cross, that whosoever believeth in him should
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:55.760]   not perish, but have everlasting life.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:57.360]   Would you like it still more plainly?
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.160]   We'll listen to it here from the tenth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:04.240]   Let me read first of all to you verse fifteen.
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:14.000]   "As the Father knoweth me, even so know I my Father; and I lay down my life for the
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   sheep."
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.000]   Listen.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:21.600]   "Therefore doth my Father love me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   No man taketh it from me, but I lay it down of myself."
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:33.720]   I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:39.480]   This commandment have I received of my Father.
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.440]   Are you beginning to understand the mystery?
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.880]   No man taketh it from me?
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:44.880]   No, no.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:50.680]   Don't you say any more that the sole explanation of the death of Christ and the cross is that
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:54.000]   this ignorant, foolish mob didn't know him and put him to death?
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:58.320]   He says, "No man taketh my life from me.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.400]   I lay it down of myself."
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:05.440]   I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:06.840]   This is his own teaching.
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:12.320]   But listen to him again in the twelfth chapter of John's Gospel, where it is again as plain
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.800]   and as explicit as it can possibly be.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.480]   "Jesus answered them, saying, 'The hour is come that the Son of Man should be glorified.
[00:39:22.480 --> 00:39:29.600]   Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.920]   abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.880]   He that loveth his life shall lose it; he that hateth his life in this world shall keep
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:41.000]   it unto life eternal.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.800]   If any man serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there shall also my servant be.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:52.360]   Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say?
[00:39:52.360 --> 00:39:57.640]   Shall I say, 'Father, save me from this hour?'
[00:39:57.640 --> 00:40:01.920]   But for this cause came I unto this hour.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:06.120]   Father, glorify thy name.'
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.760]   Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, 'I have both glorified it and will glorify
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:10.760]   it again.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:13.240]   And the people, therefore, that stood by and heard it, said, 'It thundered.'
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:15.640]   Of course they did; they never do understand.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.200]   Others said, 'An angel has spoken to him.'
[00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:22.920]   Jesus answered and said, 'This voice came not because of me, but for your sakes.
[00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:27.040]   Now is the judgment of this world.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.320]   Now shall the prince of this world be cast out.
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:38.240]   And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.'
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:45.680]   This he said, signifying what manner of death he should die.
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:47.280]   There it is, you see.
[00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:52.280]   And let me remind you again how after the great confession of Peter at Caesarea Philippi,
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:55.680]   our Lord begins to tell them that he is going to be taken of men, and he is going to be
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:57.720]   crucified, and he is going to die.
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:40:59.040]   And they did not understand it.
[00:40:59.040 --> 00:41:04.600]   How he says again in Luke 13 that no prophet shall die out of Jerusalem, that it is the
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:06.640]   appointed place where they die.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:10.040]   They came to him and said, 'Get thee hence; depart, for Herod will kill thee.'
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:14.480]   He said unto them, 'Go ye and tell that fox, "Behold, I cast out devils, and I do
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:19.400]   cures today and tomorrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:25.240]   Nevertheless, I must walk today and tomorrow, and the day following, for it cannot be but
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:31.960]   that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem."'
[00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:37.400]   And then towering above all the statements is this.
[00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:42.200]   When these foolish disciples of his were arguing which of them was going to be greatest, he
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.360]   said, 'Don't you understand?
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:48.280]   Have you been with me for three years, and are you still blind and deaf and impervious
[00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   to the truth?
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:52.360]   Don't you see that my kingdom is not like the kingdoms of this world?
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.000]   In the kingdoms of this world, the great men of honor pay to them.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.320]   It is not like that in my kingdom.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:07.640]   The Son of Man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister and to give his life
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:11.520]   a ransom for many.'
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:15.720]   There it is, explicit and plain and as clear as it can possibly be.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.960]   That's his teaching.
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:21.120]   He keeps on telling them that he's come to die, that his whole purpose in coming into
[00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:26.320]   the world is that he may die, like the serpent raised up, and all these other illustrations.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.520]   'I came into this world.
[00:42:28.520 --> 00:42:30.320]   I'm not going to ask God to take me away.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.200]   I've come for this.
[00:42:32.200 --> 00:42:33.200]   Can't you see it?'
[00:42:33.200 --> 00:42:34.840]   Well then, watch his actions.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:40.120]   That's his teaching, but watch it in his actions.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:49.320]   One day he invited Peter and James and John to go up with him unto the top of a high mountain.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.240]   And suddenly when they were there, he was transfigured before them, and his face began
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.080]   to shine like the sun, and his clothing began to shine above the brightest shining that
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:02.000]   can ever be produced by a fuller.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.280]   And a cloud came over them all.
[00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:12.040]   And suddenly Peter and James and John saw our transfigured Lord talking to Moses and
[00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:15.440]   Elias on top of this mount of transfiguration.
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.440]   What did they talk about?
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:19.480]   Well, we are told what they talked about.
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:26.160]   We are told that Moses and Elias talked with him about the exodus that he was about to
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:28.600]   accomplish at Jerusalem.
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:32.560]   That means his death upon the cross.
[00:43:32.560 --> 00:43:34.760]   That was the subject of conversation.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:40.920]   The great lawgiver Moses, the first of the great prophetic line, Elias, Elijah, they
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:42.200]   both come to him.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:44.600]   They say, 'You are the fulfillment of the law.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:48.360]   You're the fulfillment of the prophets, the death you're about to accomplish, the
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:51.800]   exodus that he was about to accomplish.'
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:56.680]   Not put to death by ignorant men, not the death of a political martyr or a philosophic
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.680]   martyr.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:44:02.840]   No, no, this is something known throughout the centuries, prefigured in the Old Testament,
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:09.520]   the fulfillment of law and prophets, Moses and Elias.
[00:44:09.520 --> 00:44:11.080]   You see the mystery?
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.560]   You see it increasing?
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.960]   But come, let me hold you before another aspect of this extraordinary mystery.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.880]   Do you know the shortest verse in the Bible?
[00:44:20.880 --> 00:44:23.120]   Only two words.
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:26.040]   Jesus wept.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.240]   Jesus wept.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.240]   Why did he cry?
[00:44:29.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   Why did he weep?
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.040]   Well, they say, what a silly question to ask.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:38.360]   He wept, of course, at the grave of Lazarus because Lazarus was his dear friend and because
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.520]   he felt so sorry for Mary and Martha who'd lost their brother.
[00:44:42.520 --> 00:44:44.800]   Quite simple, natural human sympathy.
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:47.560]   Any decent man would have wept in exactly the same way.
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:53.080]   My dear friend, before you answer like that, read the scriptures.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:54.080]   That wasn't why he wept.
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:55.080]   How do I know?
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:56.480]   Well, I know in this way.
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:44:59.240]   He went there in order to raise Lazarus.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.760]   He says so.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:01.760]   He says so.
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:04.240]   He deliberately didn't go there to save the life of Lazarus.
[00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.520]   He allowed him to die.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.640]   And then he said, 'We are going now that God may be glorified.'
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:12.000]   He went there to raise Lazarus from the grave.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.920]   What's the point of weeping then because he's in it?
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:17.720]   No, no, that's not the reason.
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:20.200]   That's not the explanation.
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:22.360]   There's only one explanation of Jesus' wept.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.360]   It's this.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:28.000]   It is the mystery of the death of Christ upon the cross.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   What is it?
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Oh, I'll tell you.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   It's this.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:38.280]   There at the grave of his friend Lazarus, he thinks like this.
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:41.480]   Death, what's brought it into the world?
[00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:44.400]   Oh, it's the sin of men.
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.240]   Man wasn't made to die.
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:52.160]   Man died because he rebelled against my Father, because he broke the law, because he listened
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:53.160]   to the devil.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.520]   Death is the consequence of sin.
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:45:59.320]   And it's such a terrible thing that before I can deal with it, I've got to die.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.440]   I've got to be separated from my Father.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:02.440]   And he wept.
[00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:06.560]   He groaned in the Spirit, we are told.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:08.280]   That's why he groaned in the Spirit.
[00:46:08.280 --> 00:46:09.440]   That's why he wept.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:13.040]   He knew he was going to raise Lazarus, as he did.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:18.520]   Jesus' wept leads us to the very heart and center of the paradox, the mystery of the
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:22.520]   meaning of the death of our Lord upon the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:28.040]   Then, listen, we are told after that he set his face steadfastly to go to Jerusalem.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:31.400]   Everybody told him that it was a mistake, that his enemies would capture him, that they
[00:46:31.400 --> 00:46:33.760]   were all waiting for him, Herod and the Romans.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:38.360]   Anyway, he set his face steadfastly, like a flint, to go to Jerusalem.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   Nothing could stop him.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:48.880]   And, oh, come with me for a moment to the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:55.440]   You remember again he calls these three men, and he says, "Come apart with me for a while."
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.600]   He says, "I'm going over there to pray.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:02.800]   I want you to remain here and pray for me, and to strengthen me, and to help me."
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   Do you remember what happened?
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   They kept on sleeping.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:10.720]   But he prayed three times, and this was his prayer, "Father, if it be possible, let this
[00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.320]   cup pass by.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:15.720]   Nevertheless, not my will, but thine, be done."
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.720]   What's it mean?
[00:47:16.720 --> 00:47:19.280]   Oh, it's quite simple.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:22.480]   He was just afraid to die, naturally shrinking from death.
[00:47:22.480 --> 00:47:24.080]   But my dear friend, you mustn't say that.
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:26.040]   That makes him less than the martyrs.
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:32.360]   That makes him less than many a political hero, many a political victim of men's cruelty.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:37.160]   Many men have died without whimpering and crying and being frightened like that.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:41.320]   You're making him less than his own followers and many a great martyr in the history of
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:42.320]   the human race.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:44.680]   No, no, it isn't that.
[00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:47.480]   There's again only one explanation of the agony in the garden.
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.880]   And remember, he not only prayed there and offered that prayer, he was in such an agony,
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.440]   we are told, that he was sweating great drops of blood.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:58.440]   Do you see them falling onto the grass, onto the ground?
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:48:02.600]   Drops of blood, not this sweat that I'm sweating as I'm trying to tell you about him and the
[00:48:02.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   mystery of his coming and his dying, but drops of blood and agony in the depth of his soul.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:12.600]   What's the meaning of it?
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.720]   There's only one meaning of it.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:21.800]   It is that he knows, as I've said in expanding Jesus' wept, that in order to save mankind,
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:26.560]   it means that he's got to be temporarily separated from his father.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:27.680]   This is the mystery.
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.800]   He makes it plain in his own teaching.
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:34.880]   You remember he invited them to what is called the Last Supper.
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:39.880]   When the hour was come, he sat down with the twelve apostles with him and he said unto
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:44.600]   them, "With desire I have desire to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.
[00:48:44.600 --> 00:48:48.480]   For I say unto you, I will not any more eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.480]   of God."
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:54.520]   And he took the cup and gave thanks and said, "Take this, divide it among yourselves.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.440]   For I say unto you, I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until the kingdom of God
[00:48:59.440 --> 00:49:00.440]   shall come."
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:06.200]   And he took bread and he gave thanks and he break it and gave unto them, saying, "This
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:11.480]   is my body which is given for you, this do in remembrance of me."
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:17.960]   Likewise also the cup after the supper, saying, "This cup is the new testament in my blood
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.800]   which is shed for you."
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:26.800]   Now, my dear friends, this is the explanation of the mystery coming from his own mouth and
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:30.160]   from his own words.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:36.440]   After he had died and he had risen again, he began addressing two men, two crestfallen
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:40.840]   followers of his who were travelling from Jerusalem to a little place called Emmaus
[00:49:40.840 --> 00:49:46.320]   and were absolutely cast down because of his death and couldn't understand why he died.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:52.280]   They said, "We had hoped that it was he who would have redeemed Israel."
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.760]   We had hoped that it had been he that would have redeemed Israel.
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:50:01.320]   He comes to them and he says, "Oh, fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   have spoken.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:08.200]   Ought not the Christ to have died and to have suffered these things and to enter into his
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:09.280]   glory?"
[00:50:09.280 --> 00:50:13.640]   And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded unto them in all the scriptures.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:18.920]   Then he had to do it again with all the disciples assembled together in a room in Jerusalem.
[00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:23.400]   He said, "These are the words which I spake unto you while I was yet with you, that all
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:27.600]   things must be fulfilled which are written in the law of Moses unto the prophets of the
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:29.440]   Psalms concerning me."
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.800]   Then opened he their understanding that they might understand the scriptures.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:38.760]   And he said unto them, "Thus it is written and thus it behoved Christ to suffer and to
[00:50:38.760 --> 00:50:45.200]   rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be
[00:50:45.200 --> 00:50:50.720]   preached in his name among all nations beginning at Jerusalem."
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:58.080]   Now then, there is your explanation.
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:04.520]   And what you get in the rest of the New Testament is just a repetition of that.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.200]   All these men are saying the same thing.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.440]   Listen to the Apostle Paul.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:09.440]   This is what they are saying.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:13.880]   They said that death of Christ is something that had been planned by God before the foundation
[00:51:13.880 --> 00:51:14.880]   of the world.
[00:51:14.880 --> 00:51:16.360]   The punishment of sin is death.
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:18.680]   The wages of sin is death.
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:20.160]   And God demands this.
[00:51:20.160 --> 00:51:23.760]   Without shedding of blood there is no remission of sins.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:26.240]   Even God can't say, "I forgive you, all is well."
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:27.240]   No, no.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.560]   God is a just and a holy and a righteous God.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:30.880]   And he must punish sin.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:33.720]   Well, how can he punish sin and anybody be saved?
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:34.720]   That's the problem.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.640]   And here's the answer.
[00:51:36.640 --> 00:51:41.160]   He sent his Son into the world to save us from our sins.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.160]   How does he do it?
[00:51:42.160 --> 00:51:47.120]   "Well," says John the Baptist, pointing to him, "behold the Lamb of God that taketh away
[00:51:47.120 --> 00:51:48.120]   the sin of the world."
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:49.120]   What does he mean?
[00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:50.640]   Well, he means this.
[00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:55.600]   In the Old Testament, God had taught the children of Israel that if their sins were to be covered,
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:59.760]   they must take a lamb, put their hands upon him, metaphorically transferring their sins
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   to him.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.000]   The lamb was to be killed, the blood was to be offered.
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   That's a picture.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.680]   "Here is the Lamb of God that taketh away the sin of the world."
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:15.400]   This is God's way of providing us with forgiveness.
[00:52:15.400 --> 00:52:19.120]   God cannot forgive us unless he is righteous and just.
[00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:24.520]   And his righteousness and his justice demand the punishment of sin.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.680]   And this is the mystery of the cross.
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.320]   This is why he said, "For this hour came I into this world."
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:38.680]   He came that he might bear our sins and our guilt and our punishment.
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:41.640]   And the apostles lie with one another in saying it.
[00:52:41.640 --> 00:52:42.640]   Listen to Paul.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:46.600]   "God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:52.520]   He hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   of God in him."
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:53:01.000]   Yes, says Peter, "who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:07.440]   being dead to sins should live unto righteousness, by whose stripes we are healed."
[00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:08.440]   Listen to Peter again.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:13.880]   "Forasmuch as he know that he were not redeemed with corruptible things like silver and gold
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:21.200]   from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:26.240]   of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot."
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.880]   Do you see the mystery?
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:35.000]   He says John is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.960]   the sins of the whole world.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:39.960]   Listen to Paul again.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:47.640]   "Whom God hath set forth as a propitiation for us through faith in his blood to declare
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:52.160]   his righteousness for the remission of sins that are passed through the forbearance of
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:53.160]   God."
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:54:02.880]   To declare, I say at this time, his righteousness, that God might be just and the justifier of
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.360]   him that believeth in Jesus.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:08.800]   Listen to me, says the author of the epistle to the Hebrews.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:16.360]   We see Jesus, who was made a little love and the angels for the suffering of death, crowned
[00:54:16.360 --> 00:54:24.480]   with glory and honor, that he by the grace of God might taste death for every man.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:28.760]   Can't you see that they are all saying exactly the same thing?
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:32.000]   The revelation of the mystery had taken place.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.400]   Christ himself had expounded his own death to them after the resurrection, and he did
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:42.160]   it afterwards, even by the Holy Spirit to people like the apostle Paul and others.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:46.080]   And so in the very last book of the Bible this is what you read.
[00:54:46.080 --> 00:54:52.120]   "John, to the seven churches which are in Asia, grace be unto you and peace.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:58.440]   From him which is and which was and which is to come, and from the seven spirits which
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:04.840]   are before his throne, and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness and the first
[00:55:04.840 --> 00:55:10.080]   begotten from the dead and the prince of the kings of the earth, unto him that loved us
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.640]   and washed us from our sins in his own blood, and hath made us kings and priests unto God
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:18.040]   and his Father.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:24.320]   To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever."
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:27.720]   Amen.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:35.680]   Now my friends, that's the mystery of the death of Christ.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:44.440]   God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.440]   That's the mystery.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.960]   This is God's way of forgiveness.
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:56:02.280]   He punishes our sins in the person of his own dearly beloved only begotten Son.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:07.840]   It is God who sent his Son to the cross on Calvary's hill.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.760]   That's why he set his face steadfastly.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.120]   That's why nobody could hinder him.
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:12.500]   He came to die.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.720]   He came to taste death for every man.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:22.920]   He came to be the Lamb of God.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:30.280]   Do you now see the wonder and the amazing character of it all?
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:38.120]   Do you now understand why Isaac Watts talks about the wondrous cross?
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:45.080]   Do you understand why he now says, "Where the whole realm of nature mine, that where
[00:56:45.080 --> 00:57:00.240]   an offering far too small, love so amazing, so divine, demands my soul, my life, my all
[00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:01.240]   life"?
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:10.880]   Have you seen it, the mystery of the gospel, the mystery of God's way of making forgiveness
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:15.200]   through putting our sins on his Son and punishing them in him?
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:19.400]   Have you seen it?
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:25.120]   If you are, you'll be ready to join me in saying something like this.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:33.080]   On that cross of Jesus, mine eyes at times can see the very dying form of one who suffered
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:35.000]   there for me.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:41.200]   And from my smitten heart with tears, two wonders I confess.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:55.120]   The wonder of his glorious love and my own worthlessness, my dear friend.
[00:57:55.120 --> 00:57:58.800]   Have you understood the mystery of the death of Christ?
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.640]   Have you seen the meaning of the cross?
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:04.560]   Do you see the wonder of it all?
[00:58:04.560 --> 00:58:17.080]   God so loving the world that he gave even to that his only begotten Son, that whosoever
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:28.120]   believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:31.960]   Amen.
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:35.880]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
