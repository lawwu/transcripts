[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.180]   I know before kids and the pandemic,
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.740]   you did a lot of traveling
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.820]   and a lot of the conversations we have are about travel.
[00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.500]   And I know a lot of our listeners are just now
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.820]   having built up a lot of big balance of points
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.620]   and getting past the pandemic, thinking about where to go.
[00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.080]   I'm curious if you have any suggestions
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.860]   from all the travels you've done
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.020]   of where people might wanna take a trip to
[00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.720]   or check out something that maybe is not the obvious place.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.020]   (laughs)
[00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.300]   Oh man, my favorite place is Malaysia
[00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.420]   because I also grew up there
[00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.180]   in my middle school teenage years.
[00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.820]   And that was like exciting.
[00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.060]   The food is the best, top three in the world.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:44.580]   It's very inexpensive.
[00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.700]   I love Angkor Wat, Cambodia.
[00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.480]   It's so hot, it's like 95 degrees and humid,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.260]   but the temples are unbelievable.
[00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.700]   I love Southeast Asia.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.980]   Southeast Asia is a great, great region.
[00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.180]   Friendly people, people speak English.
[00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.560]   Food is amazing.
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.180]   And the cost of living is low.
[00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.780]   So I love that.
[00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.780]   I went to Europe, probably 20 different countries in Europe.
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.940]   I love it as well.
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.180]   I love the lifestyle, the attitude of living not for work,
[00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.600]   but living for living sake.
[00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.980]   It's just that one of those things where
[00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.140]   after you see like five Gothic churches,
[00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.260]   they all start looking the same.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:23.940]   So I enjoyed Mallorca, Spain.
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.820]   Mallorca was amazing.
[00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.060]   The Spanish culture, you eat tapas at 10 p.m.
[00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.540]   You enjoy life, the water, the beaches.
[00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.060]   So, and then Amsterdam.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.580]   Amsterdam is kind of like the San Francisco of Europe,
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.060]   where people are pretty chill.
[00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.940]   You know, weed is available everywhere
[00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.780]   and there's really diverse culture.
[00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.660]   And I love Amsterdam as well.
[00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.140]   - I haven't been to Mallorca.
[00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.040]   Amsterdam's amazing.
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.700]   I want to come back to Malaysia
[00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.260]   because I think it's a country, having been there,
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.440]   I don't often hear a lot of other people go there
[00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.740]   that don't have some family there
[00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.480]   or some business reason to be there.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.080]   So if someone's thinking right now,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.240]   listening to this saying, "Oh, Malaysia,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.280]   I've never really thought about going there."
[00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.600]   What would you tell them to think about as a trip?
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.120]   Not, you don't need to plan a whole week or two itinerary,
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.240]   but what are a few highlights of something they should do
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.600]   other than my favorite is just eat all the roti canai
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:16.640]   you can find on the street.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.880]   That would be like my path.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.360]   But what would you tell someone to think about
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.120]   as they plan a trip?
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.560]   - Well, Malaysia, it's a peninsula
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.120]   surrounded by water on three sides.
[00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.680]   And the beauty is the food is amazing, right?
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.060]   The mamak stalls, the roti canai,
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.880]   the milk fish, the chicken, fish, all that stuff.
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.600]   The kangkuk belacan, gotta check that out.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.360]   You can go to Kuala Lumpur for sure.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.000]   See the palace, see the Batu Caves,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.760]   go on these excursions, but go to the Pulau,
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.040]   which are the islands on the east and west,
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.800]   or go to Penang and see the turquoise water
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   and go scuba diving 70 feet down and still see the water
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.000]   and have nobody around you.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.560]   My favorite trip was to this resort
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.320]   called the Tara's Resort.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.760]   It's an island and there's an island on the east side.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.800]   And we just had, it was kind of like,
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.040]   you know, the movie "The Beach."
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.180]   I think it was "The Beach" with Leonardo DiCaprio.
[00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.240]   It was kind of like that.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.080]   You would take a dinghy out, you'd go scuba diving,
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.360]   you'd come to this cove,
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.520]   there'd be some little sharks around, turquoise water.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.560]   And it was just unbelievable.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.840]   So it's the Tara's Resort.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.240]   I would check that out.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:32.060]   - Awesome.
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.440]   Yeah, I don't feel like I gave Malaysia
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.080]   its justice on our trip.
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.520]   It was part of our eight month backpacking trip
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.600]   around the world, but it was awesome.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.500]   The only thing, I don't know if this is still the case,
[00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.880]   but the one thing I remember very specifically,
[00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.880]   because it was a big problem,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.220]   was that the ATMs in Malaysia would not accept
[00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.720]   any of my two or three American bank cards.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.720]   And so we showed up in Malaysia with probably $7 in cash
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.760]   and went to the ATM and it didn't work
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.960]   and we could not get cash.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.440]   - So how'd you get the cash?
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.320]   - So I ended up going online
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.800]   and finding some local community in the tech community.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.660]   So there was these events called Bar Camp,
[00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.180]   which are like unconferences that I'd gotten to know.
[00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:20.460]   And I just went like Kuala Lumpur Bar Camp,
[00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:22.780]   emailed the list serve and was like,
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.280]   "Can anyone here meet me in Kuala Lumpur
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.240]   and I can PayPal you money and you can bring me cash?"
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.240]   - And someone did.
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.160]   - But my new plan is never go to a country
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.620]   without at least like maybe $100 of cash.
[00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.960]   We literally probably had like $7,
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.560]   which could get you a lot farther in Malaysia
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:41.940]   than I imagined, but-
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.880]   - But not too far.
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.320]   - But not too far.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.760]   - Wow, okay.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.580]   - Well, yeah, so yeah, bring cash.
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.500]   And again, the Terrace Beach and Spa was on Redang Island.
[00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.540]   Redang Island, so.
