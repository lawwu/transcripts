[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.080]   - Welcome to a new week of episodes with John Piper
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.880]   on the Ask Pastor John podcast.
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.240]   Today we talk about energy drinks.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.960]   And Jose writes in to ask this,
[00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.100]   "Pastor John, energy drinks are controversial
[00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.040]   "in our youth group and as someone who likes them,
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:18.940]   "I was wondering if there are any negative effects
[00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:20.920]   "or reasons to not drink them.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.820]   "They help me focus and to have energy during work.
[00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.580]   "I only drink one every two or three days,
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.400]   "but I would like to have some spiritual insight
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.720]   "in order that I might run this race
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.400]   "without being slowed down."
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.640]   And he ends with a smiley emoticon.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.640]   (laughing)
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.720]   Pastor John, how should we think about energy drinks?
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.040]   - Well, it might be helpful to take our starting point
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.400]   from Paul's words in 1 Corinthians
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.400]   about how he navigates the whole area of appetites,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.040]   whether food or energy drinks or sex,
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.480]   and what foods mean to Paul,
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.920]   what he takes into his body.
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.960]   So here's the pivotal text for me.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.760]   It's 1 Corinthians 6, 12 to what, 15 maybe.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.520]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.920]   "but not all things are helpful.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.780]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.800]   "but I will not be dominated," I would say,
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.920]   or mastered or ruled or enslaved by anything.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.640]   "Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.600]   "and God will destroy both the one and the other."
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.480]   Now, let me pause there and say
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.840]   there's a lot of controversy around
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.800]   what in Paul's chapter here are slogans
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.120]   from his adversaries in Corinth
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.000]   and what are his own words?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.320]   So it might be a slogan,
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.600]   "Food's meant for the stomach and the stomach for food,"
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.360]   and so they're justifying all kinds of things.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.760]   But whatever the case is on that point,
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.280]   Paul's point becomes clear in what follows.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.500]   Here's what follows.
[00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.720]   "The body is not meant for sexual immorality,
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:08.900]   "but for the Lord and the Lord for the body.
[00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:13.900]   "And God raised the Lord and will raise us up by his power.
[00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.240]   "Do you not know your bodies are members of Christ?"
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:22.440]   So clearly the upshot of those last couple of lines
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.920]   are the Lord is for the body,
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.240]   the body is for the Lord,
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.360]   the Lord will raise the body,
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.640]   and we are members of Christ even in our bodies.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.520]   In other words, the body really matters.
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.800]   So the body matters to God morally,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.280]   and in particular, foods matter and sex matters,
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.520]   and so the guidelines he gives matter.
[00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.600]   And what he says is, "All things are lawful for me,
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.520]   "but not all things are helpful.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.280]   "All things are lawful for me,
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.240]   "but I don't wanna be dominated by anything."
[00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.000]   And then he adds, what, 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.920]   "All things are lawful, but not all things build up."
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.140]   So here's my paraphrase for Jose.
[00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.120]   Number one, "Energy drinks are lawful for me,
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.200]   "but are they helpful to my real advantage?"
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.880]   And I'll come back to that.
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.680]   Second, "Energy drinks are lawful for me,
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.840]   "but do they dominate or master or enslave me?"
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.800]   I'll come back to that one.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.960]   Number three, "Energy drinks are lawful for me,
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.420]   "but does my drinking of them build up?
[00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:40.920]   "Does it build up my faith?"
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.200]   And particularly, "Does it build up the faith of others?"
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.620]   So let me just give a thought about each of those questions
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:51.900]   that might help him navigate
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.680]   whether he uses them and how frequently he uses them.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.280]   Number one, "All things are lawful, but are they helpful?
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.440]   "That is to my real deep advantage."
[00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:05.840]   That's the meaning of the Greek word, to my advantage.
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.000]   This is really part of a much bigger issue, isn't it,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.920]   of the proper use of not just caffeine,
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.200]   but other stimulants, medications,
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.480]   Ritalin, Adderall, antidepressants, and so on.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.540]   So let me just give one crucial guideline
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:27.180]   that I think is implied in Paul's wording,
[00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.540]   "Are they truly helpful?
[00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.260]   "Do they help me go after my deepest advantage?"
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.520]   And that would be this.
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.300]   This is my guideline.
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.380]   Are energy drinks or whatever I'm taking,
[00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:44.860]   are they masking deeper problems
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.040]   that I'm not dealing with because I'm masking them,
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:52.980]   or are they helping me really address
[00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.580]   and be freed from the deeper problems that I may have?
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.700]   I think that's the crucial question
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.420]   when it comes to the kinds of medications
[00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.500]   or stimulants that we take.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.440]   Are we hiding from our hearts?
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.760]   Are we hiding from sins?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.100]   Are we hiding things that ought to be dealt with?
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.620]   And this is just a superficial overlay.
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.140]   If Jose or any of us is masking deeper problems
[00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:19.560]   with stimulants, then they're not being used
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.060]   as a gift from God for our good.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.980]   They're being used as a flight from truth
[00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.260]   and from the good that God wants to do deeper down.
[00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:31.940]   So that's my note on the first paraphrase.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.060]   Here's the second one.
[00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.100]   Do they master me?
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.940]   Do they enslave me?
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.580]   What would, why would that matter to Paul?
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.780]   Why does he say that?
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.380]   Why should it matter to us?
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:47.140]   Well, it should matter because we have one master
[00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.500]   who bought us at the price of his blood.
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.460]   We do not belong to ourselves, but to him.
[00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:00.340]   He calls us to live as free people, not enslaved people.
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.580]   So it says in 1 Corinthians 6.19,
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.740]   "Do you not know that your body is the temple
[00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.820]   "of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God?
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.820]   "You are not your own, for you were bought with a price."
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.260]   So glorify God in your body.
[00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:20.260]   So anyone who uses coffee or soda or energy drinks
[00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.580]   or other kinds of stimulants or medication should ask,
[00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.460]   am I dominated by this?
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.060]   Am I mastered by this?
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.400]   Am I controlled by this?
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:35.780]   Am I living consciously as Christ's freedman?
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.100]   Am I magnifying the price that he paid
[00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:42.340]   to set me free for him?
[00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.740]   It says in 2 Corinthians 5, "He died for all
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.320]   "that those who live might no longer live for themselves,
[00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:52.820]   "but for him who for their sakes died and was raised."
[00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:57.780]   Are we magnifying his mastery over us
[00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:00.740]   or living under another master?
[00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:03.340]   That's the second issue that I think
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.860]   he should take into consideration.
[00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.300]   Here's the last one.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.020]   Do energy drinks build up?
[00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:14.460]   All things are lawful for me, but not all things build up.
[00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:17.280]   Why does Paul shift our focus?
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.660]   This is a really profound ethical question
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.500]   in the New Testament.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   Why does Paul shift our focus from what is lawful,
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:29.540]   so he says all things are lawful, to what builds up?
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.580]   Now this is huge.
[00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.100]   In Christ, we have died to the law.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:38.340]   Romans 7, 4, you have died to the law
[00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.900]   through the body of Christ.
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.700]   And we are released from the law, verse six,
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:45.100]   having died to that which held us captive
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.100]   so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:51.700]   and not the old way of the written code.
[00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.620]   And the problem then with deciding what's right
[00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:59.620]   and wrong about energy drinks is that you could obey a law
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.060]   without love, without giving a hoot
[00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.940]   about whether you're building anybody's faith.
[00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.940]   And so it's just not adequate to have an external rule
[00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:11.380]   solve this problem.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.940]   Paul wants to go deeper.
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:17.020]   The reason Christians are set free from the law
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.960]   is not that we might become lawless,
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.820]   but that love would hold sway.
[00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.140]   First Corinthians 9, 21, "To those outside the law,
[00:08:27.140 --> 00:08:29.220]   "I became as one outside the law,
[00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:32.200]   "not being outside the law of God,
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.140]   "but under the law of Christ."
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.500]   So his freedom with regard to the law
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.180]   was being governed by another law,
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.460]   which he called the law of Christ.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:42.780]   And what's that?
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:45.500]   Galatians 6, 2, "Bear one another's burdens
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.580]   "and so fulfill the law of Christ."
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.900]   Or Galatians 5, 14, "For the whole law
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.160]   "is fulfilled in one word.
[00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:56.040]   "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:01.040]   So when Paul says to Hosea, or me, or you, or anybody else,
[00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:06.340]   energy drinks are lawful, but do they build up?
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:10.580]   He means be sure that your heart
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.340]   is set on the good of others,
[00:09:14.340 --> 00:09:17.860]   and that your example to them and your choices
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.220]   are aiming to build people up in faith.
[00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:24.140]   That is helping them trust Jesus and treasure Jesus
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.020]   and honor Jesus above all things.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.800]   So here's my summary three guidelines for Hosea and me.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.780]   Are they truly helpful?
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.980]   Are energy drinks truly helpful?
[00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:38.100]   That is, are they masking problems that I need to deal with
[00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.860]   or helping me deal with them?
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.100]   Number two, are they dominating me,
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:48.100]   mastering me, and obscuring that Jesus is my real master?
[00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:53.220]   And number three, am I using them in love?
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.900]   Am I building others up?
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.980]   Am I seeking to build my own faith and the faith of others?
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:02.240]   - Amen, but here's the question that everybody's now asking.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.120]   Do you, Pastor John, use energy drinks?
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:07.680]   - I have a box of energy drinks.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.880]   - I knew it. - In my office.
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.760]   Probably don't use them quite as often as Hosea.
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.360]   He said, what, every two or three days.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.360]   And what I do is that if I've got a pressing task
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.040]   and I cannot stay awake, yes, I'll go there.
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.400]   But that box that I buy at Aldi's,
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.720]   get 'em at Aldi's, real cheap, lasts a long time.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:33.720]   But I mean, a question like this helps me
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:38.400]   keep my finger on the pulse of whether I'm defaulting
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:41.840]   to an artificial stimulant because I'm so proud
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:43.580]   I won't get enough sleep.
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.120]   See, in other words, that's what I mean by masking.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.500]   If my real problem is that John Piper
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:52.900]   doesn't have the discipline to go to bed at night
[00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:55.460]   and therefore gets six hours instead of eight hours of sleep
[00:10:55.460 --> 00:10:57.900]   and therefore he's always falling asleep at his task
[00:10:57.900 --> 00:11:00.420]   and thus he resorts to an artificial stimulant,
[00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.100]   that's masking, that's hiding,
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:05.780]   that's running away from God and pride.
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.940]   - Bingo, that's really helpful, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:09.980]   And thank you, Hosea, for the question.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.480]   Tomorrow we return to talk about problematic marriages.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:16.000]   In particular, Pastor John will attempt to offer hope
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.640]   for one very hard marriage.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.580]   For everything related to this podcast,
[00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.700]   go to desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:27.020]   I'm your host Tony Reinke, I'll see you tomorrow.

[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.180]   (upbeat music)
