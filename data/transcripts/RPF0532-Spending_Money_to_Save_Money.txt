[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:56.900]   11 and, Hmm I'm ty;í…Œ ××
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:08.420]   How much money would you be willing to spend now if it would help you to spend less overall?
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:16.260]   How much money would you be willing to spend to curb your desires to spend more money?
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.900]   Have you ever thought about that? And no, here I'm not talking about the value of buying
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.960]   things on sale. My parents, when I was growing up, used to have a funny joke about the fact that,
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   I don't know, they were always saying, "You're not going to be able to buy anything on sale."
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.020]   But now, they're saying, "You're not going to be able to buy anything on sale."
[00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.020]   So, I'm not talking about the value of buying things on sale. My parents, when I was growing up, used to have a funny joke about the fact that,

[00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:53.260]   I'm not talking about the value of buying things on sale. My mom would come home from the store and be thrilled about the fact that she saved a dollar to buy a $2 item that she didn't really need.
[00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.320]   My dad would always laugh because my dad was the kind of person who would pay $3 to buy a $2 item that he actually did need.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.080]   My mom would run into a good sale and say, "Look how much money I saved." My wife and I like to joke about that as well. If you find a good sale, "Look how much money I saved." No, he didn't really say that.
[00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:25.100]   So, I'm not talking about the value of buying things on sale. My dad would always laugh because my mom would always laugh.
