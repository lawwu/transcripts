[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.720]   Pastor John, here's a question about Bible reading and interpretation. It seems
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.700]   that the miracles of Jesus can be so situational that it can be hard to know
[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.480]   what the takeaways are from the stories as we read them in the Gospels. How do
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.480]   you process the miracles of Jesus in your own personal devotions? I was
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.080]   reading, I think day before yesterday, in my trek through the Bible with
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:36.560]   McShane's Bible reading plan, Matthew 16, and Jesus says to the disciples, "Beware
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:42.440]   of the leaven of the Pharisees." So clearly he's using a metaphor. I say
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.440]   clearly, it wasn't so clear to the disciples. They start squabbling with each
[00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.400]   other about, "Oh, we didn't bring any bread, we didn't bring any bread, and Jesus is
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.320]   concerned or upset with us that we don't have any bread with us." And Jesus hears
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.560]   them, and he says to them, "Hey, don't you remember the 5,000 and the 12 loaves
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.920]   left over, and the 7,000 and the seven loaves left over? How is it that you
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.520]   don't understand that I did not speak about bread?" Now, when I read that in my
[00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.840]   devotions, I just stopped and said, "What is Jesus saying?" That if they had
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:29.520]   really understood his miracle, those two miracles where he fed thousands with a
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.880]   little bit of bread, if they had understood that, they would have
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.360]   perceived the meaning of his metaphor. And what might take away, I haven't
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   thought through to the bottom of this yet, but Jesus said, "Beware of the leaven
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.200]   the Pharisees." They totally misunderstood him, missed the metaphorical meaning, and
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.160]   went straight to the literal meaning. And Jesus says, "That was stupid, because if
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.160]   you'd understood my miracles, you wouldn't have made that mistake." Which
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:00.120]   means that there are mistakes we make in the language of Scripture, in
[00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.440]   understanding the language of Scripture, because you don't grasp the power of
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.920]   Jesus, or certain things about the miraculous working of Jesus. And so the
[00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.360]   principle that I came away with was, "Oh God, let me know you. Let me know Jesus in
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.160]   all his works. Let me discern what the point of the feeding of the five
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.600]   thousand was, so that when he says something oblique or metaphorical over
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.080]   here, I won't make the same mistake that the disciples did of just totally missing
[00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.360]   that he's talking about the teaching of the Pharisees and not bread. That has
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.160]   held my attention for the last two days, trying to figure out what the
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.600]   hermeneutical implications of missing out on the power of Jesus in one of his
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:56.520]   miracles. And clearly, they didn't get his miracle, and that had a bad
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.680]   interpretational effect on how they understood his other language. One of the
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:09.600]   takeaways is, slow down. Slow down in your reading. And when you finish a
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:15.160]   miracle, opening the eyes of the blind, or causing the lame man to stand up, or
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.400]   causing people to be fed, five thousand people be fed, slow down, pause, and stop
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:29.360]   and say, "Jesus, show me what this is saying about you." Fall down and worship
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.480]   him, and let it have its humbling effect, let it have its strengthening effect. I
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:41.760]   have a friend, and I have a Christ, who not only feeds five thousand, but
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.880]   gives twelve loaves, or twelve baskets, to the twelve men who were distributing it.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.160]   That's just huge. In other words, I will take care of all your needs. I think,
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.080]   frankly, that's the essence of what they missed. The point of the feeding of the
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.440]   five thousand for the disciples was the twelve baskets of bowls left over, which
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.680]   means if you go ahead and give away what you don't have, and think you don't have,
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.280]   you're going to get everything you need. So now when we come later, and he says,
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.240]   "Watch out for the leavening of the Pharisees," their first thought's not going to be,
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.400]   "Oh, shoot, we don't have any bread." Their first thought's going to be something about,
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.360]   "Okay, what is it about the Pharisees that are going to undermine our faith?"
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.680]   Then they'll start to see. So, the takeaway is, slow down and meditate.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:31.480]   Nothing that I have said here demands any scholarly training. You don't need to know
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:36.680]   Greek here, you don't need to go to seminary here, you just need to slow down and pray,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.280]   and think, and worship over the miracles of Jesus.
