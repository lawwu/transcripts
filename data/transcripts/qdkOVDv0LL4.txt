[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Today's question comes from an international listener named Weiganjo Camotho.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   "Hello Pastor John, my question is over a few lines from your daily devotional dated August 21st, 2016.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   It all made perfect sense to me until I got to this line where you write this,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   'All the works of God culminate in the praise of His redeemed people.'"
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   And this was even more confusing when you wrote,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   "The climax of God's happiness is the delight He takes in the echoes of His excellence in the praises of His saints."
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Maybe it's due to the length of the sentence, I don't know, but please elaborate what you mean.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   The rest I understand.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Well, I'm happy, happy, happy, happy to elaborate on that sentence because it is one of my favorites.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Let's take the second sentence, the one that Weiganjo, I'm not sure how to pronounce his name.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   Weiganjo.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   The one that Weiganjo says is "even more confusing," and break it down to see if I can help make it clearer.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I think this is worth doing because this sentence is one of those incredibly important expressions of what the heart of Christian hedonism is,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and I think what the heart of biblical truth is.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Let me say this sentence again. "The climax of God's happiness is the delight He takes in the echoes of His excellence in the praises of the saints."
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   It's true that when you read a sentence like that, if you're not familiar with the thinking and concepts behind it,
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   you will need to slow down and take it phrase by phrase and seriously think about the relationships between those phrases.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   So I would really encourage you not to give up too quickly when you read a perplexing sentence
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   if there are reasons to believe that the author might have genuine insight and not just be confused himself.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   There are confusing sentences that are owing not to the complexity of reality, but to the confusion of the author.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yes, there really are. And whether I am that, maybe you'll know by the end of this podcast.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   So let me try to deliver myself and my sentence from confusion by looking at, what, three, four of the phrases.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Number one, let's start at the end of the sentence. "The praises of the saints."
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And I've argued in many places that the goal of history, all of creation, all divine activity,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   is to bring the saints, Christians, believers from every tribe, tongue, and nation,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   into white-hot, heartfelt, joyful praises of God's infinite value and beauty.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   The whole panorama of His excellencies. Praising, praising God and His excellencies.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   That's what this phrase signifies. The praises of the saints. That's the great goal of history.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   And I'm picturing the consummation of the ages in the whole assembly of the redeemed from all the centuries
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and all the ethnicities and all the cultures, praising God with white-hot joy in the excellence of God.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Joy in God and His excellence.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Now, number two, the phrase just before that, "The echoes of His excellence in the praises of the saints."
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   So I'm saying that because our praises are the praises of God's excellence,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   when one hears those praises, he hears echoes of God's excellence.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   In other words, the praises of God are a reflection or a highlighting or a speaking forth of God's excellence.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I call that the echo. It's an echo of God's excellence.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   When you hear an echo in a canyon, you are hearing a sound that is not identical to the original sound,
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   but a kind of reflection of the sound or a passing along of the sound.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   In the same way, the praises of God's excellence are not identical with the excellence itself,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   but they're caused by the excellence of God, like a shout causes an echo.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   They are responses to the excellence of God, and as they are verbalized,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   these praises give some expression of the excellence of God.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   And in that sense, I see them as echoes of God's very excellence.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   So those are the last two phrases.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Here's the third, the one just before. Third phrase to look at.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   God delights in the echoes of his excellence in the praises of the saints.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So I add, God delights in those echoes.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And what I'm getting at here is that God is not an idolater.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   That is, he has no God, small g, that he values above the true God, namely himself.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   In other words, for God to be righteous and holy, he must value supremely what is supremely valuable.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He must admire fully what is fully admirable.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   He must delight in most intensely what is most intensely delightful.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And God himself is the one who is supremely valuable and fully admirable and most intensely delightful.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   The reason God created man and destined him for white-hot, joyful praises of God
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   is so that we might share in the very joy that God has in himself, in the fellowship of the Trinity,
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   in God's contemplation of all the glorious perfections that he is.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So when God hears the echoes of his own excellence in the joyful praises of his people,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   he delights in it.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   He would be unrighteous not to delight in the echoes of what is most infinitely delightful.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Finally, I say at the front of that sentence that this delight or this joy that God has
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   in the echo of his excellence in the praises of his people, this delight is the climax of God's happiness.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   In other words, there is no higher or greater happiness that God is looking forward to
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   beyond the delight that he takes in the echoes of his excellence in the supremely happy praises of the saints.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   And this, I think, is the heart of the biblical message,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   that God's purpose in creation and through the redeeming work of Jesus Christ,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   God's purpose is to bring his redeemed people to full and lasting happiness in himself,
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   which is also God's happiness in God, because our happiness in him is an echo of his excellence.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   So I'll say the sentence one more time and hope it's not as confusing as it was at first.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   The climax of God's happiness is the delight he takes in the echoes of his excellence in the praises,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   the white-hot, joyful praises of the saints.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Well, it doesn't get more foundational or more glorious than that. Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Well, if we're going to put our Bibles together and make sense of the whole story from Genesis to Revelation,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   we have to be clear on covenants. Covenants are the skeletal structure of redemptive history,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   and we're going to do that very thing when we return on Friday.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. We'll see you then.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   [End]
