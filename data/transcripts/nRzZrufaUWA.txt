[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.260]   So how does one measure optimal versus accelerated aging?
[00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:16.100]   And why would it be that some stress is better than no stress when it comes to aging ideally?
[00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.080]   So having no stress means we're not really living, like we're not engaging in the gifts
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.780]   of life, which are inevitably have some challenge and risk.
[00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.680]   And let me give you an example.
[00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.480]   One study took elderly people who have retired and they, you know, society kind of labels
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:46.300]   them as you're kind of done with your meaningful work in life and you are pretty much not able
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.300]   to contribute to society.
[00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.680]   I mean, there's so many negative stereotypes that people then kind of embody and then live.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.840]   And this program brought them to work in schools and tutor young at-risk students.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:05.140]   And what happened to them is they went from feeling maybe safe and under-stressed to feeling
[00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.960]   challenged, but generative.
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.920]   They were feeling more purpose.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.760]   They were feeling like they were growing and they were feeling like their day had more
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.760]   meaning.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.080]   They had more relationships.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.000]   They had these caring relationships with the students.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.760]   The students had all sorts of issues and troubles, drugs and maybe not having lunch, poverty.
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.560]   And so they felt the stress of that, but they also saw how much they could help with their
[00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.520]   support and their tutoring.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.240]   And in this study, they took images of the hippocampus and those who engaged in the program,
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.200]   particularly the men, actually had growth of their hippocampus during this program.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.780]   So at any stage in life, we can be growing and challenging ourselves even in our much
[00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.680]   later years and growing our brain.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.920]   And you know more than anyone, what does that hippocampal growth mean for their wellbeing
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.400]   and their cognitive function?
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.360]   It's interesting that hippocampus, of course, a brain area involved in formation and recall
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.560]   of memories, mostly formation of memories, is super interesting because it's so plastic.
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.280]   It's so amenable to the addition of new memories.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.720]   I think the most striking study to me is the one, and I should point out that most of the
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.000]   data say that the addition of new neurons is not the main reason for improvements in
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.900]   memory, but it is one of them.
[00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.560]   But Rusty Gage down at the Salk Institute did a study in the, I think the early 2000s
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.520]   where they took terminally ill people and these people agreed to have their bodies injected
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.120]   with a dye that would label new neurons.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.160]   And then after they died, their brains were processed and they didn't die from the dye
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.920]   injection by the way, folks, they died from other causes, they were terminally ill.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:00.320]   And what they discovered was that even in terminally ill and some of these people were
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.980]   quite old, those people were still generating new neurons, especially in the context of
[00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.840]   still trying to learn and acquire new information.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.080]   So of course they're dead so they can't apply that information after that, but of course
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.080]   none of us can, right?
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   None of the information that...
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.080]   But why not?
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   Up to when you die, right?
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   Absolutely.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   Absolutely.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.620]   So one other example of this, my colleague Dave Almeida, he measures daily stressful
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.660]   events in huge national populations and a small percentage of people report no stressors.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.520]   And so you wonder like what's happening?
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.720]   Are they not engaging in life?
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.880]   Are they really not having stressors?
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.800]   It looks like they are, it's not just that they're not getting stressed by things, they're
[00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.720]   not really going out and doing much.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.640]   And what he found is that their level of kind of memory and cognition, their cognitive health
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.920]   was significantly lower.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.480]   So you can imagine the hippocampal, you know, the lack of those neuroprogenitor cells, they're
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.240]   just not being stimulated.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.240]   It's super interesting.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.240]   I wasn't aware of that result.
[00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.480]   So I appreciate you sharing it.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.800]   I almost have to wonder if it's like exercise where, you know, so many people, I think now
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.480]   everybody hopefully understands that exercise is going to lower blood pressure, reduce resting
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.660]   heart rate, improve musculoskeletal function and bone density, all that stuff.
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.680]   But that if you took a snapshot of the bodily response during exercise, blood pressure is
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   way, way up.
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.080]   Heart rate is way, way up.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.520]   Stress hormones are way up.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.040]   Cortisol is through the roof during a hard workout and immediately afterwards.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.240]   And yet that sets in motion a series of adaptations that brings you to a better place most of
[00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.240]   the time.
[00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.600]   So I wonder if stress is the same.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.840]   Is there any evidence that short bouts of stress provided that they're managed well,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.880]   meaning that we don't spend the next 24 or 48 hours ruminating on the stressor, but that
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.480]   we're able to move through the stressor and resolve it in some way, that that's actually
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.400]   beneficial for us because of the mobilization of energy stores and maybe even changing our
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:02.360]   threshold for reacting to stressors in the future?
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.560]   That's a great question.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.720]   And it's one that I have been chewing on for a while because we know as you said that physical
[00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.880]   stressors, when they're short and repeated, like high intensity interval training, they
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.640]   are promoting not just aerobic fitness, but stress fitness.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.940]   People feel less rumination, less depression, less anxiety.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.760]   So they're kind of tuning up the nervous system.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:28.240]   What about psychological stressors?
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   And we know two things.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:37.040]   So one is I do think that there is a level of engagement with moderate stressors that
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:43.320]   when we are used to them, we get fit and our stress resilience builds, meaning we're less
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.560]   threatened by them.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.920]   So let me go deep into that.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:55.040]   Two people can approach the exact same stressor and one person is having a pretty overreactive
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.520]   stress response where they basically are feeling their survival is threatened.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   So it's high cortisol, high vasoconstriction, and blood pressure goes up equally in both.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.200]   But the person who's feeling super threatened, either their survival or their social survival
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.360]   of their ego, their blood pressure went up because of the vasoconstriction.
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:20.920]   The other person who is viewing the same stressor as I can do this, this is a great challenge
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.160]   and opportunity, I have what it takes.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:29.320]   Those types of thoughts generate a different hemodynamic response, which is actually more
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.160]   cardiac output, so blood pressure is going up, but in this healthier way, more oxygenation
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.960]   to the brain, better problem solving, they're able to maintain this positive outlook.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.820]   So we've measured the threat challenge response in many lab studies and we know lots of things.
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.840]   So if you're having more of the challenge response, at the end of it, you're less inflamed.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.120]   So just in the lab within an hour or two, we see that they didn't trigger all that pro-inflammatory
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:59.120]   response and their telomeres tend to be longer, which is a measure we can talk more about.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:06.360]   But basically, it looks like they have a slower speed of aging.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.360]   That is super interesting.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.240]   You call this a stress challenge response?
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:18.360]   So we could call this kind of a two, to be really simplistic, two types of psychological
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:24.360]   stress response, feeling threatened, like you're going to fail, you're embarrassed.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.400]   That social pain response, we know well, that feels terrible, but also that huge stress
[00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:34.880]   response when we feel it in our stomach, our heart is pounding.
[00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:37.500]   It's just an over-exaggerated response.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:42.440]   That response biologically is different and the thoughts that go with it are different
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.240]   and we recover a lot slower.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:52.080]   And then there's the challenge response, which is more of that kind of activated, excited
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.520]   response.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:59.480]   And the beauty is that there are lots of studies out there done by emotions and social psychologists
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:02.620]   that tilt people toward the challenge response.
[00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.240]   We can actually promote that challenge response.
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:10.080]   And so when you asked about like, is it good to have a repeated stress response?
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:16.880]   Yes, if it's manageable, then we're kind of building the muscle of stress resilience.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:23.560]   What are the sorts of things that people I can do in order, including me, I should say,
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:28.360]   can do in order to wage that challenge response?
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:30.440]   Is this purely based on mindset?
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.040]   Like instead of saying, why me?
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   Why this?
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.040]   Why now?
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.040]   I can't believe this is happening.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.720]   Is it a mental pivot to, okay, this is a great opportunity for growth.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.280]   I don't know how I'm going to manage this, but I'll manage this.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   You want to stop me.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.640]   You got to kill me type of mindset.
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:52.840]   Is that the switch that then the body follows?
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:59.280]   Because this is an interesting instance where most all the stress mitigation work that my
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.840]   lab does is focused on using the body to control the mind.
[00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:05.840]   But here we're talking about the mind controlling the body first and then the body following
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:09.080]   suit, which I find equally fascinating.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:15.960]   So are there some specific mental scripts that people follow and are we all able to
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:17.520]   follow those scripts?
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.520]   Yes.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.200]   To some extent, we control the script.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:26.760]   We can use that script to prepare ourselves going into a stressful situation and we can
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:28.840]   use it at any point during the stressor.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:33.040]   So some of us are just wired to have a big threat response period.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.360]   Maybe it's epigenetics we've inherited.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.800]   Maybe it's early trauma that has shaped us to have this exaggerated emotional response
[00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.880]   and yes, we and others have found that.
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:49.460]   Trauma sensitizes our emotional stress response so that we are feeling more threatened.
[00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:53.280]   But that's okay because that's the part we can't control and we just have to have a lot
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:58.920]   of self-compassion and awareness that okay, this is what I do.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:03.200]   My body reacts like this, but what happens next?
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:09.600]   That's when we can start to use those statements, self-comforting, self-compassion, distancing.
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:15.360]   There's all sorts of statements that allow us to then recover more quickly.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:22.080]   So when we want to shift from a threatened response to a kind of challenge response,
[00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:30.320]   or I should say, are there any data that dictate whether or not we should keep those statements
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:33.240]   in our head, write them down, say them out loud?
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.800]   I guess what I'm trying to do here is trying to get to a little bit more of the meat of
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.320]   the actionable since a lot of our listeners I think will be, as I am, very excited about
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:48.360]   the idea that a mere shift in our mentality about stress can give us the opposite outcome.
[00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:54.160]   I mean, before you were talking about vasoconstriction and inflammation and all these bad things,
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:11:01.240]   to put it lightly, and then in the challenge response to stress, getting the exact opposite,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.280]   more vasodilation, more resources used, and more positive effects on the brain and body.
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:12.680]   So if you can recall from the papers, if not, that's fine, but I'm just curious what those
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.920]   specific tools might be.
[00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:17.640]   Every statement you said, Andrew, is good.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.640]   It's a good one.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:24.920]   The whole trick here is that people need to find the strength statements, the stress shields,
[00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:28.880]   I call them, that fit them, that feels right, and that they believe.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:35.440]   And so I list a bunch of options in chapter three, which is called be the lion instead
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:36.480]   of the gazelle.
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:41.200]   So the lion and gazelle are both high blood pressure, high stress, and the lion's chasing
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.120]   the gazelle, but the gazelle's having this total threat vasoconstriction response because
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.520]   she might die, lion might get dinner, right?
[00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.800]   So it's needing to mount the stress response because it's so excited to get the tasty dinner
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:57.680]   for the next few days.
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:00.880]   And so the lion is having that challenge response.
[00:12:00.880 --> 00:12:04.240]   And so we can remind ourselves, be the lion.
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:06.120]   It's not that we're always lion or gazelle.
[00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.240]   We get to shape that.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:13.360]   And so some of those statements are, well, let's say right when we're going into it,
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:14.360]   list your resources.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:17.720]   Why have you ever dealt with any situation like this?
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.960]   Remind yourself of past successes.
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:24.920]   Remind yourself of someone you can call or text or feel supported by.
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:29.720]   Remind yourself that this outcome is not going to affect your life in 10 years or five years.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.520]   That's a distancing kind of perspective taking.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:37.720]   So there's all these strategies, and you got to use what works for you.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.840]   Telling yourself, I got this.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.840]   I can do it.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.840]   I can get through it.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.200]   I have what it takes.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:44.560]   Those are all good shields.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.140]   And another set is some of us feel really stressed out by stress.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:56.320]   Like once we feel our heart racing, that leads to, oh no, this is bad for me.
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.320]   And so rather than getting stressed by stress, we actually want to remind ourselves that
[00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:05.240]   this stress response is empowering.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.920]   This is going to help me cope.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.920]   My body is excited.
[00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:13.520]   My body is doing just what it should right now.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:19.640]   So that reframing in studies by Wendy Mendez and others, my colleagues who do this reappraisal
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:24.480]   research, they have basically trained people to view stress as positive.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.840]   During the stressful situations in the lab, people do better.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.840]   They perform better.
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:31.520]   They feel more positive emotion.
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:33.140]   They problem solve better.
[00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:34.800]   They recover more quickly.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:44.680]   So pretty powerful stuff.
