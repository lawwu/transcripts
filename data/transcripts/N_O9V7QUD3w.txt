[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.320]   Are IVF babies knit together by God, too?
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.240]   It's a question from Carly.
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.560]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.300]   How can a Christian explain to non-Christians that every child is a gift from God when some
[00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:21.160]   children are conceived medically through IVF and other fertility treatments?
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.560]   I'm at a loss and I really want to be able to answer this question.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.320]   I believe all children are from God, but how do I answer this question?
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.880]   I recently saw a story about a lesbian couple who conceived of a child through IVF.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.660]   The child was fertilized by donor sperm and implanted in one woman and then harvested
[00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.240]   and implanted in the other woman to carry to term.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.200]   It's so unnatural, but I know that this child is meant to be here.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.000]   So, Pastor John, how would you help Carly answer this dilemma?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.520]   Before I answer that question specifically and directly, let me just say a word about
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:04.320]   the larger issue of in vitro fertilization and third-party assisted reproduction, surrogacy,
[00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.240]   renting a womb, as it's sometimes called, egg donation, sperm donation, and so on.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.860]   There is an entire global industry of baby making, which is shot through with unanswered
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.080]   ethical and medical questions.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.120]   I think any Christian couple should be very careful, thoughtful, hesitant, I would say
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:34.800]   hesitant, to walk very far outside the natural processes God has put in place for making
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.800]   babies.
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:44.520]   Now, I know we've gotten ourselves into a real dilemma with thousands of frozen embryos,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.440]   for example, waiting, as it were, for adoption.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.720]   I'm not opposed to that.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.320]   There are people in our church that have done that, adopted an embryo, put it in mom, raised
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.320]   a baby.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.760]   But I don't think we should make decisions that contribute to that problem.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.440]   We got ourselves with these thousands of frozen little babies because of all kinds of technological
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.400]   things that we didn't foresee would create all these issues.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.520]   Now, if all that sounds fuzzy to you, like, "What is he talking about?"
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.480]   Which it does to me still.
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.600]   I want to recommend a website and an institution called Center for Bioethics and Culture.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.680]   It's led by Jennifer Lall.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.480]   I've met Jennifer.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.940]   I think she is a faithful and wise, helpful guide in these matters.
[00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.120]   They have some very illuminating videos about these things.
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.760]   She's done a lot of good work, it seems to me, to bring clarity, wisdom to the issue
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.440]   of third-party assisted reproduction, making us aware of the significant health and psychological
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.680]   risks that often go untold as if you can just do anything you want.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.240]   Not to mention the ethical issues, not the least of which is the looming issue of eugenics,
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:16.720]   that is, making designer babies by making sure you have a sperm and an egg from people
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.840]   with just the right traits that you want.
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.440]   But Carly's question is, "How can a Christian explain to a non-Christian that every child
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.080]   is a gift from God when some children are conceived medically through IBF and other
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.960]   fertility treatments?"
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.240]   The answer comes, I think, in two steps.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.400]   First, this is, "What do you say to an unbeliever?"
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:55.640]   First, you gather biblical texts which show that creating human babies is decisively God's
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.840]   work, not man's.
[00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.260]   No baby decides if he or she is human.
[00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.100]   No parent decides if their baby is human.
[00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:13.720]   No sperm donor, no egg donor, no womb donor decides if the baby is human.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.840]   No doctor who's putting all the pieces together decides if this baby is human.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.080]   Well, who does?
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.160]   That's step one.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.480]   God does.
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.080]   Step two in answering, after you show them these texts, which I'll point to in a minute,
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:38.840]   step two is to show the biblical principle that God often in the Bible uses foolishness
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.400]   and evil, even evil, to bring beauty into being.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:49.800]   So here's a few texts that you could use in helping an unbeliever at least know why you
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:56.200]   think that God is the decisive baby maker, human baby maker.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.960]   Psalm 139.13, "You formed my inner parts.
[00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.720]   You knitted me together in my mother's womb.
[00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.960]   I praise you for I am fearfully and wonderfully made."
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:10.120]   That is made by God.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:18.680]   Job 10.8-12, Job says to God, "You clothed me with skin and flesh and knit me together
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.440]   with bones and sinews.
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:26.600]   You have granted life and steadfast love."
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.240]   So not just skin, not just flesh and bones and sinews, but life that can be experienced
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.680]   in relational love.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.280]   God created that.
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:45.600]   Job 31.13-15, Job says to God about why he has treated his servants well.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.040]   Job has treated his servants fairly.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.480]   He says, "If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant when they
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:59.280]   brought a complaint against me, what then shall I do when God rises up?
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him?
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.760]   Did not he who made me in the womb make him?
[00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.560]   And did not one fashion us both in the womb?"
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.600]   In other words, every human, whatever class, made by God in the womb.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:28.160]   Psalm 71.6, "Upon you I have leaned, upon you God I have leaned from before my birth.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:32.200]   You are he who took me from my mother's womb.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.220]   My praise is continually of you."
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:41.640]   Before the psalmist was born, he was already leaning, depending on God in the womb.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:50.520]   Ecclesiastes 11.5, "As you do not know the way the spirit comes to the bones in the womb
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:57.840]   of a woman with child, so you do not know the work of God who makes everything."
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:09.000]   We don't know how the spirit, the life, the soul of the human nature comes into this union
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.520]   of egg and sperm.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:15.800]   It's one of those works of God like so many we do not understand, but there it is.
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.240]   He does it.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.120]   One more, Jeremiah 1.5, "Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.480]   And before you were born, I consecrated you.
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:27.600]   I appointed you a prophet to the nation."
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:34.800]   So God was already dealing with Jeremiah as a person before he was born.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:44.920]   So I conclude from these passages and others that humans don't bring humans into being.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.480]   God does.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:53.440]   Humans contribute genetic material, but God makes the union of egg and sperm, the living
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.080]   eternal human soul.
[00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:57.080]   Amazing.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.800]   That's the first thing you try to share with your non-Christian friend.
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:15.080]   The second step is to show the biblical principle that God often uses foolishness and even evil
[00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:18.040]   to bring beauty into being.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:27.920]   Now, you can say in general to your unbelieving friend, "If God really creates a human soul
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:36.600]   that once did not exist and now exists forever as a person, then doing this God-like thing
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:43.760]   through natural or unnatural or good or bad, sinful or unsinful ways of uniting egg and
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.040]   sperm is a piece of cake.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.280]   It's relatively easy.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.240]   I mean, creating a human being is the great glory and mystery.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:09:00.840]   The how is relatively unimportant when it comes to whether God can do it or not."
[00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.920]   But I'll close with this.
[00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:08.720]   I just try to think, "Now, what would be the most evangelistically, personally caring
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.360]   way to get across the principle you're trying to to the unbeliever?"
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:24.640]   And I think the answer is to go to the most amazing text of all, Acts 4, 27 to 28, to
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:35.720]   show how God used four Christ-haters to accomplish Christ's saving will, to bring about the most
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:42.120]   beautiful, glorious, wonderful act of salvation in the history of the world.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   So here's what it says, "Truly in this city, there were gathered together against
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:54.320]   your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles,"
[00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:58.560]   that's the Roman soldiers who drove the nails in, "and the peoples of Israel who cried,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.160]   'Crucify him, crucify him,' to do," what were they gathered together to do?
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:10.880]   "To do whatever your hand and your plan predestined to take place."
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:11.880]   Whoa.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:19.280]   I mean, I can imagine an unbeliever maybe hearing that and saying, "Whoa."
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:21.840]   I never heard anything like that before.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:29.680]   If God can orchestrate Herod, Pilate, brutal Roman soldiers, unbelieving Jews to bring
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:37.720]   about the greatest life-giving event that ever was, the death and resurrection of Jesus,
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:43.600]   then making a human baby with sinful humans is not a problem.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:48.320]   That is a fascinating take on the miracle of life, the origin of human life.
[00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.240]   Thank you, Pastor John.
