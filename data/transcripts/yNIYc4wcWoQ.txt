[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   Today's sobering question comes from a mother of a teenager who asks this
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.280]   Hello, Pastor John. What would you do if your 14 year old says she no longer
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:15.320]   wants to pray because she is no longer a Christian she doubts the existence of God and
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.580]   Doubts that Christianity is any better than any other religion
[00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.920]   She considers the Bible to be true just for Christians considers church not essential
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:30.340]   But she has to attend and attends politely because being part of a family that values God and the things of God
[00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.740]   That's what we do
[00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.220]   Pastor John as parents. How do we proceed wisely?
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:44.620]   Maybe the most helpful thing I could do is recommend a book that meant a great deal to me
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:50.540]   At one point in my own parenting when one of my children was in exactly this situation
[00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.060]   and the book
[00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.300]   Is called come back Barbara by John Miller and his daughter
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.580]   Barbara Giuliani
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:08.260]   I think his daughter was 18 when she ran away moved out got involved with a guy and
[00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.820]   Wanted nothing to do with the family's faith and the book
[00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.540]   Describes what her parents felt and did and then Barbara who subsequently has returned
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.620]   wrote
[00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.880]   Responses to each of those chapters which gives the book an unusual realism
[00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.420]   for how parental efforts were coming across and
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:38.740]   Maybe the second best thing I could do is to point this mother to an article my son wrote
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.300]   after that period of wandering
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.100]   And he wrote it and we published it at
[00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.220]   DG it's still there. I checked it today called 12 ways to love your wayward child
[00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.300]   so the things that he felt were
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.980]   significant while he was on his
[00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.980]   Departure
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.380]   But here are my front-burner thoughts for right now one
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.900]   Realize that this is something you utterly and totally have no control over
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:13.820]   Faith is a gift of God. I
[00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.020]   Perhaps a better way to say it would be that the eyes of her heart
[00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.420]   Not just the eyes of her head
[00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.460]   must see Jesus as true and beautiful and desirable in order to be a Christian and
[00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.820]   Only God can open those eyes
[00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.700]   That's the point of Ephesians 1 18 to Corinthians 4 6 1 Corinthians 2 13 and 14 Ephesians 2 8
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:45.820]   God does use parents and pastors and teachers and friends to point children to Christ
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.780]   But none of that pointing is decisive
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.500]   God God is decisive
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.380]   It is utterly crucial that that you as a burdened parent
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.160]   Not bear more than you should or can that's number one number two
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.860]   Therefore since only God can do this prayer is
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.660]   Absolutely essential indispensable and I would suggest even building into your lives
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:17.180]   periodic times of fasting
[00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:23.060]   For your daughter and perhaps ask some of your friends to join you in that fast and prayer
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.860]   I still do this to this very day. I still do this for critical
[00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.380]   relationships in my own family
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.340]   three
[00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.740]   one of the most essential things to pray for is
[00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.860]   the seemingly impossible balance between
[00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.780]   Broken-hearted concern for your daughter and
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.180]   Indomitable joy in the face of
[00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.220]   This suffering joy in grace and power and goodness of God
[00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:00.860]   I I know this sounds impossible because it is humanly impossible
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:04.140]   But nothing is impossible with God your daughter
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.260]   Indeed your own conscience
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.300]   Need to see
[00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.620]   That she does not have the power to nullify
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.620]   The hope and joy that you feel in Christ
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.420]   She does not
[00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:27.020]   Need to feel that she has that power. That would be that would be a
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:36.220]   Extremely false if she felt that she needs to feel that she matters and that you are deeply sad
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:44.740]   At her spiritual condition, but she also needs to see the reality of what she's missing
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.340]   namely your
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.100]   Indomitable enjoyment of the grace of God the peace of God that passes
[00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:58.900]   Understanding and the goodness of God and the power of God in your life. That's what she needs and she needs to see it
[00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.780]   That's a miracle and only God can help you do that
[00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.100]   For it is perfectly right and good
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:13.620]   That while she's under your roof and under your authority, she would live according to your the rules of your house
[00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:19.260]   You you can expect that of her. She should give it but you must labor
[00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.860]   to make sure that
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.680]   This compliance on her part is not
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:30.460]   emphatically not the essence of what you are longing for
[00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.420]   Many children think that being obedient and being compliant is what the parents really want of them
[00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:43.100]   So the parents won't be embarrassed at church or among their friends
[00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:49.820]   So they perform she needs to realize that is not the main thing you care about
[00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:57.580]   What you care about is the gospel of grace you you you don't want to communicate to her that her
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.020]   behavior is the main issue the main issue is
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:10.220]   Seeing Christ as supremely valuable and enjoying his forgiveness of sins and the hope of everlasting life
[00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.260]   So make the gospel
[00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:19.620]   Central always communicate that there is hope for her future in Christ
[00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.060]   five don't turn every evening into a
[00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.140]   grilling
[00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.140]   about her faith and
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.020]   beware of
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:32.020]   outbursts in some
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:40.140]   Hostile moment when emotions are so raw. It's a terrible time to talk about anything rational about Christ instead
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:47.460]   Make periodic lunch dates with her on a Saturday and ask her ahead of time
[00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:55.660]   For permission to talk about spiritual things. She she'll probably give you permission. She'll say there's no point in it, but ask her
[00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.620]   These are like state-of-the-soul
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.980]   lunches when you listen to her heart
[00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:06.900]   Ask the Lord to help you know what things to ask about what things to say
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:13.300]   Especially ask about her heart her emotions her struggles at school and in relationships
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:17.880]   Dig in to the core where deep decisions are being made
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.420]   number six feed your own soul with the food of biblical truth and
[00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:25.300]   especially
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.660]   stories biblical stories about how
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.300]   present sorrow and
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.300]   Seeming hopelessness is a prelude to joy
[00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:39.900]   There are so many of them. I'm thinking of Abraham and Sarah too old to have children
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.660]   hopeless
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:50.420]   Suddenly Isaac I'm thinking of Job lost everything and yet he saw God and God restored his family
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:57.820]   Joseph languishing in in hopelessness in Egypt for years and years and years and suddenly
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.940]   He's the Savior of Israel
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:01.860]   Ruth
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:04.420]   widow poverty stricken picking
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:11.980]   Leftovers in the barley field not knowing tomorrow. There's a husband and a child thinking all was lost
[00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:20.740]   Esther ready to be destroyed with the Jewish people suddenly Haman and her arch enemies hanging on the gallows meant from Mordecai
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:28.500]   Or Jesus most of all right most of all Good Friday looked like an absolutely lost cost like your daughter
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:32.660]   And within days exalted to the king of the universe
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:40.180]   I mean, yes, that's the point of the Bible that that the situation you're in now isn't the last word
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:47.160]   So number seven go ahead and have family devotions as you always have but in general don't put her on the spot
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:49.660]   Everybody knows this is not
[00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:54.140]   Reality, she's she's not a full participant. That's the agreement
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:09:00.020]   But she needs to see her parents loving Jesus in the word
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.500]   Let those times be times in which you exalt in Christ and the gospel
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:11.780]   Let her see your faith and your concern for larger issues in the world besides your family pray about
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:18.140]   Syria pray about the unreached peoples in the Middle East pray about Ebola pray about AIDS
[00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.260]   Pray about the government let her see that Christianity is
[00:09:22.260 --> 00:09:27.980]   Large and ennobling and the last thing I would say number eight don't despair
[00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.820]   God loves to hear your prayers
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:38.740]   He puts your tears in a bottle and he pours it out with his grace in due time
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:46.620]   That's some really wise gospel advice and hope-filled words as well, thank you pastor John for speaking from your own
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.100]   Brokenness on this topic and we thank you for listening to the podcast

[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.660]   forward slash ask pastor John
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.420]   Well coming up on Friday this week here in the States. We inaugurate our 45th president
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:08.060]   Donald Trump and politics aside
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:12.700]   inaugurations are moments for us to step back and be struck by the power of the office and
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.020]   Of the weightiness of the presidency of this country
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:21.220]   So we are gonna return on Friday to talk about a theology of the kingdom in scripture
[00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:26.840]   It seems to be a fitting moment in time for us to step back and look at what it means that Christ himself is a
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:34.340]   King and that he reigns over a kingdom. We'll talk about that on Friday inauguration day. I'm your host Tony Ranke
[00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.540]   Thanks for listening to the ask pastor John podcast
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:46.540]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
