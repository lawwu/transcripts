[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.440]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.400]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.400]   My name is Josh Ruchites.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.400]   I am your host.
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.440]   And today we're going to talk about the unbelievable impact of just a little bit of tax.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.000]   This is a redo of a show that I released earlier this week where I made a serious math mistake
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   in that show.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.680]   If you haven't already listened to that show, go ahead and listen to this one.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.360]   You'll hear me correct the math mistake in just a moment.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.920]   But in the United States, we're just getting into what we usually consider to be tax season,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.920]   right?
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.920]   April 15th, the well-known day that your taxes are due.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.280]   And as we come into this last month here before taxes are due, I want to share with you a
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.240]   series kind of a mini series of tax planning shows where we'll go over some specific ideas
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.920]   to help you save on tax.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.760]   And some of these ideas are going to be new ideas that I haven't really talked about in
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.000]   the history of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.360]   Throughout the annals of Radical Personal Finance, you'll find lots and lots of shows
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.920]   on tax planning.
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.400]   We've done year-end tax planning.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.800]   We've done big picture tax planning.
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.820]   We've talked about tax advantage accounts.
[00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.480]   We've talked about businesses and business deductions.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.200]   But I want to present to you a couple of ideas that I haven't really discussed in detail
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.440]   throughout the history of Radical Personal Finance in this series.
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.000]   But today we begin not with a specific tax saving idea.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.360]   Today I want to simply share with you the incredible importance of actually saving money
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.760]   on taxes.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   Because a lot of people I think are too ambivalent when it comes to saving money on taxes.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.760]   Too many people look around and say, "Well, it's just a little bit of tax.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.760]   It's only 15%.
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:11.180]   It's only 20%.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.780]   It's not that big of a deal.
[00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.600]   After all, taxes are the price we pay for living in a civilized society.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.760]   And I want to live in a civilized society, so I'm going to continue and pay my taxes."
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.200]   But I want to demonstrate to you the importance of tax savings and show you why I think that
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:34.840]   if you care about wealth, you should be very interested in or even semi-obsessed with the
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.200]   topic of tax savings.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.400]   I want to show you why this is so important so that you will go ahead and be interested
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.440]   in making good tax planning decisions.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.360]   I want to begin today by talking about the story of the magic penny.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.640]   You remember the story of the magic penny.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.760]   A friend comes to you and says, "Hey, listen, I'll give you two offers.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.640]   Offer number one is I'll give you a million dollars of cash today.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.680]   Offer number two is I'll give you a magic penny that will double in value every single
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.260]   day for a month.
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.260]   Which one do you want?"
[00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.840]   Now, of course, those who understand the power of compound interest on their investments
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040]   know that although we might not know the exact figure, we know we should choose the magic
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.600]   penny because we know that with compounding, the magic penny will increase substantially
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   in value.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.920]   So let's go over the numbers here and remind you of how much it increases.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.960]   On day one, the magic penny is worth one cent.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:31.680]   And then of course on day two, it doubles from one cent to be two cents.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.920]   Day three, it doubles from two cents to four cents, then to eight cents, 16 cents, 32 cents,
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:37.960]   and 64 cents.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.600]   So after one week, your magic penny has doubled to be worth 64 cents.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.560]   Well, it continues though, and then it starts to get more fun.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.880]   After two weeks, it's $81.92, but it's still doubling every day.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:53.320]   Three weeks in, you're at $10,485.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:04:00.840]   Four weeks in, you cross over that magic million dollar number, and you're at $1,342,000.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.840]   Then it gets really fun because in those last four days, it goes from 1.3 million to 2.6
[00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.520]   million, from 2.6 million to 5.3 million.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:20.040]   And on day 31, you wind up with $10,737,418.24 in your account.
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.160]   So if you choose the magic penny, you wind up being far better off than your friend who
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.520]   chose the million dollars because of the power of compound interest.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.760]   Now we know that.
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.880]   We know that that's powerful.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.040]   And obviously the magic penny is a far better investment than we're going to find anywhere
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.160]   else in the world.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.320]   I have no idea what you could possibly invest in that could double every single day for
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.320]   a month.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.800]   But what I want to show you is the impact of just a little bit of tax on your long-term
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.760]   investment values, even if you have such a stunningly amazing investment, such as the
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.200]   magic penny.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.960]   It's really, really substantial.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.120]   Now let's talk for a moment about the actual amount of taxes that most of us pay.
[00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:10.120]   The reality is that I think most people probably pay in excess of 50% of their income in taxes.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:11.360]   Now that's a number.
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.080]   I can't prove that to you.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.200]   And the number actually changes depending on what level someone's earnings are.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.240]   So for example, if you're a very high income earner, if you earn millions of dollars of
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:29.000]   wages per year in the United States, your overall tax rate will probably be something
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.200]   like 40 or up to 50 and possibly in excess of 50%, depending on what state you live in.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:39.080]   You have a maximum marginal tax bracket of currently 37%.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.780]   You have some employment taxes, although when you have a high income, your employment taxes
[00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.680]   are not a big factor in your overall taxation.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.920]   You have a little bit of miscellaneous Medicare tax.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.840]   You might have some state and local taxes, and then you have all the other taxes as well.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.280]   So you might be at 40 or 50% of your income in total income tax burden.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:03.360]   If you have a lower income, if you're lower on the income scale, then you're not going
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:07.800]   to pay as high of a rate of federal income taxes or state income taxes.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.640]   But I still think there's a good chance that perhaps even 40 or 50% of your income is going
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:13.800]   to taxes.
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:21.440]   If you have somebody who makes say $100,000 a year, you'll have your 7.65% employee contribution
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.600]   of your employment taxes.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.760]   If you're self-employed, it'll be 15.3% of your income.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:32.000]   Then you'll have your federal income taxes on $100,000 income for a single individual
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.560]   that might be 7, 10, $15,000, depending on deductions, retirement plan contributions,
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.560]   et cetera.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.400]   So then you have your state and local taxes if applicable.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.920]   But then now your other taxes are a higher percentage of your income.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:56.400]   Things like property taxes, sales taxes, miscellaneous use taxes, gas taxes, sin taxes, the taxes
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:58.760]   on alcohol, tobacco, et cetera.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.600]   All of these taxes factor in.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:06.520]   And so when you look at the totality of the taxes that you pay, it's a very high expense.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:08.800]   It's a very high percentage of our income.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:14.440]   Now today, I just want to look at the impact of income taxes on this magic doubling penny
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.560]   because it shows you how important it is for you to save on income taxes on your wages
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.320]   and also on your investments.
[00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.760]   So let's look at the numbers.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:26.560]   Let's assume that we start with a very modest tax rate of 20%.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:31.120]   In the United States currently, you have capital gains tax rates, long-term capital gains tax
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.080]   rates that are usually 15%.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.720]   They might be zero if your income is low, or they might be as high as 20% if your income
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:40.580]   is high, but 15%.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.360]   So I'm using a 20% number for a good round number.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:46.540]   Now before we go through the numbers, I want you to predict to yourself.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:52.840]   Let's assume that every day as this magic penny doubles, you pay a 20% tax rate on the
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.080]   increase.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.200]   How much would you have at the end of 31 days?
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:59.340]   Well, let's do the math.
[00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:05.100]   After seven days, of course, we wind up with not 64 cents, but we have 35 cents.
[00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:10.120]   After 14 days, we wind up not with $81, but $23.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:18.340]   If we continue on after three weeks, we don't have $10,485, we have $1,571.
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.120]   Now remember day 28 was the exciting day previously where we had $1.3 million.
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:27.560]   Now we're down to $103,000.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:33.220]   Then on day 30, we wind up with $188,000.
[00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:45.560]   On day 30, we have $343,000, and on day 31, we wind up with a grand total of $625,000
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:49.000]   instead of the $10.7 million that we had previously.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:57.400]   We're down to $625,000, which is obviously a massive, massive change from what we had
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.760]   previously.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.280]   You've lost due to simply a 20% tax rate.
[00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:12.860]   You've gone from $10.7 million to only $625,000 by having your magic penny taxed only 20%.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.820]   Now let me tell you about the mistake that I made previously.
[00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:21.140]   In the previous version of this show, I foolishly sat down about 15 minutes before I had friends
[00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:23.580]   coming over to my house, and I said, "I'm going to get this show done.
[00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:24.740]   It's just going to be a 10-minute show.
[00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.140]   I know exactly what I want to say."
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:29.260]   I sat down and I did it really fast, but I messed up the math.
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:37.020]   What I did in that show was instead of taxing only the gain, I taxed the entire portfolio
[00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:44.660]   value, which is obviously not the way that taxes work currently.
[00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.780]   Why do I say currently?
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:50.940]   What I did would in some ways be analogous to a wealth tax.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:57.620]   What I basically modeled in that previous error-filled show was what would you do if
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:02.460]   you had an investment that doubled, and then at the end of the year, or in our case, at
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:09.100]   the end of the day, the entire portfolio value was taxed at 10% or 20% or 35%.
[00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.020]   That was obviously devastating.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:14.220]   When I went back and corrected the math, and thank you to the many listeners who pointed
[00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:18.300]   out my error to me, it was just a dumb error, but they pointed out and showed me what I
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   had done wrong.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:22.620]   When I went back and updated the spreadsheet and corrected the math, what's remarkable
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.100]   is although the numbers are significantly higher than they were previously, the impact
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.100]   is still overwhelming.
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.780]   I mean, just look at that.
[00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:38.340]   With a 20% tax rate, you go from $10,737,000 to only $625,000.
[00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:40.460]   Now what if we play with these numbers a little bit?
[00:10:40.460 --> 00:10:45.840]   What if instead of a 20% tax rate, we just increase that to a 35% tax rate?
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.700]   What if you do something like is being proposed in many countries around the world where instead
[00:10:49.700 --> 00:10:55.380]   of capital gains taxes being taxed at preferential rates, what if capital gains taxes and income
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:03.260]   taxes are unified and now you're paying 35% of your income on the gain?
[00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:12.860]   Well now instead of $10,737,000, you wind up with a grand total of $94,000.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:20.140]   Your portfolio is completely and utterly devastated at 35% rates.
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:24.180]   Now perhaps you say, "Well, Joshua, I don't live in a high tax country.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:30.300]   I live in a place where they have a fair flat tax, a measly 10%.
[00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:33.860]   What does a 10% tax do on your daily doubling?"
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.780]   Well remember previously, you had $10.7 million.
[00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:43.420]   If you pay a 10% tax on that daily gain at the end of 31 days, you wind up with only
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   $2,487,054.68.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:51.580]   Now here's what I want you to pay attention to.
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:12:02.460]   I want you to recognize how big the differences are with very slight changes in the rate.
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:08.460]   The difference from 10% to 20% was millions of dollars.
[00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:15.940]   The difference between 20% to 35% was virtually all of your gains.
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.240]   So just a little bit of tax savings is a big, big deal.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:25.300]   Now let me be quick to point out obviously where this example may be falling short.
[00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:31.020]   It may be falling short by simply demonstrating the fact that you're being taxed every year,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:33.220]   or in our case, every day.
[00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:38.300]   Your taxes would be much less if your magic penny was not taxed until you sold it.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:43.780]   And clearly that's how capital gains taxes work currently, at least in the United States.
[00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:45.860]   You could have this magic penny.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:50.820]   You could leave it alone and it could double every single day until day 31.
[00:12:50.820 --> 00:12:54.900]   And if at day 31, then you wanted to go out and sell the magic penny and go spend all
[00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:58.580]   the money, that's when you would pay your taxes.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.580]   So you can do the numbers.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:05.620]   At a 35% tax rate, if you have $10.7 million, you would still clear six or $7 million.
[00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.260]   So I'm not ignorant of that impact.
[00:13:08.260 --> 00:13:10.940]   I'm not ignorant of the fact that you can do that with capital gains taxes.
[00:13:10.940 --> 00:13:13.460]   In fact, that's going to be one of the shows that we're going to do in this series.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:18.100]   I'm going to show you how to live tax-free with capital gains assets.
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:25.180]   But what I want you to see is how when you're paying tax on a regular basis, you are devastating
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.700]   your wealth.
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:33.500]   Now you can avoid taxes on a lot of capital gains assets for a significant amount of time,
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.360]   at least in a place like the United States.
[00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:41.380]   What you can't avoid taxes on every year is your wages.
[00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:46.740]   And yet these same numbers are devastating the impact of your wages.
[00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.100]   You can run your own spreadsheets.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.540]   Let's say you make $100,000 and you make it tax-free.
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.860]   Or you make $100,000 and you pay 20 or 30% of your income between employment taxes, income
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:01.900]   taxes, and income taxes on the federal, state, and local level.
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:04.540]   And then add your property taxes, etc.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.980]   Now how much money do you have to save and invest?
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:08.120]   A lot less.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:12.260]   And that dramatically impacts your overall investment returns.
[00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:13.940]   So that's the lesson.
[00:14:13.940 --> 00:14:17.080]   Think about this lesson whenever you think about tax savings.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.080]   Think about it.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:22.760]   If you're going to build wealth, you need to decrease your expenses so that you can
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.720]   increase the amount of money that you have to save and invest.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.320]   Expenses need to go down so that you can have more money to save and invest.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:35.560]   Because early on in your wealth building career, the single most important factor that drives
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.400]   how wealthy you become is the amount of money that you invest.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:42.360]   That changes when you have a large portfolio.
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:47.500]   When you have a big portfolio, then the single most important factor is your rate of return
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.920]   on those investments.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   But early in your life, the single biggest factor that drives how much wealth you build
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:57.860]   is how much money you can save and invest every single year.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:03.340]   The guy who can save $100,000 a year is going to get far wealthier far faster than the guy
[00:15:03.340 --> 00:15:06.560]   that can only save $20,000 per year.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:08.000]   So how do you do that?
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.920]   Well, you increase your income.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.320]   We talk about that extensively here at Radical Personal Finance.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:18.800]   The single best thing that you can do to improve your financial position is increase your income.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.200]   Because with a higher income, you can spend more money and enjoy the higher lifestyle
[00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:28.400]   now while also being able to save more money and build more wealth long term.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:30.200]   So you focus on your income.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.800]   So as your income gets high, you need to decrease your expenses.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.880]   When you look at decreasing your expenses, don't be a fool and go to the little daily
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   stuff.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.040]   It's fine if you want to drink fewer lattes, that's fine.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:45.400]   It's fine if you want to cut back on your cable bill, if you want to cut back on your
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:46.520]   Netflix bill, etc.
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:47.520]   That's fine.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:54.440]   But $14.95 a month of saving is not going to make that big of a difference if over here
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:16:00.360]   you're paying $10,000, $15,000, $30,000, $500,000 a year of taxes.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.600]   So when you look at cutting your expenses, my advice is always go to the biggest factors.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:11.120]   Cut the big things first so that then you can have lots of money left over to save and
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:12.120]   invest.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:15.920]   And the biggest thing for most of us is taxes.
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:17.840]   I get really tired of tax planning.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.840]   I really do.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.380]   I find it overwhelming, the number of taxes they want to impose.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.940]   And I find a lot of the planning really overwhelming because there's so many things that you can
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.780]   do and that you have to do.
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:31.820]   But I want to encourage you that if you care about building wealth, there is no way to
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:33.560]   escape this formula.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.780]   There is simply no way to escape this formula.
[00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:42.720]   You need to get your expenses low and you need to get that compound interest curve working
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:43.800]   on your side.
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:45.900]   So stay tuned for the rest of this series.
[00:16:45.900 --> 00:16:51.700]   As we close, I want to just simply remind you that the first thing is simply that I'm
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:53.180]   running a sale right now.
