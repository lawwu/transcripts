[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.560]   What does a life of worship look like when we're at work or at school or when
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.960]   we're engaged in the daily tasks that make up the bulk of our lives? The
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.240]   following excerpt is from John Piper's sermon "What is the Will of God and How
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.280]   Do We Know It?" which he preached on August 22nd, 2004.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:30.840]   The aim of Romans 12 1 and 2 is that all of bodily life, everything you do with
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.680]   your bodies, all of life be worship. Present your bodies as living sacrifice,
[00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.960]   holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. The goal of these two
[00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:55.520]   verses is that you find the way of life at work and at home that makes Christ
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.160]   look as valuable as he really is. That's what worship is. Worship is an
[00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:11.800]   expressing, a display of the worth of all that God is for us in Christ. So when
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.000]   your bodily life, what you do with your hands, your feet, your arms, your tongue,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.360]   your eyes, your ears, when all of that becomes worship, it becomes a way of
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.640]   displaying the value, the worth of Christ. So that's the point of these verses. Paul
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:35.080]   wants to build on 11 chapters of theology and turn your life into doxology.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:42.600]   So it sounds like doxology, it looks like doxology, smells like doxology, and if you
[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.760]   don't know how to do that at work, if your work feels like the kind of work
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.800]   where that is an absolutely inconceivable idea, two possible problems. One is you
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.000]   have the wrong job, but that's probably not the case. It's probably that verse 2
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.080]   isn't happening to the degree that it should. Verse 2 is the means by which
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.840]   verse 1 comes about. Your life becomes a worship to God, it becomes a
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.600]   manifestation of the worth and value of Jesus when you're not conformed to the
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.360]   world and all their values, but you're transformed by the renewal of your mind
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   so that the will of God becomes precious to you and a joy to you and you find
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.200]   yourself living a lifestyle of love and sacrifice and Christ-exalting standards
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.440]   that cause the world to recognize his reality and his beauty and his value. So
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.360]   it's probably not that you're in the wrong job, it's just that we have a lot
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.920]   to do in order to pursue what it means to be renewed in our minds. When it says
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.960]   "be transformed" verse 2, "by the renewal of your mind," Christians know it means
[00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.640]   "I'm already new." 2nd Corinthians 5 17, "if anyone is in Christ, he is a new
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:12.800]   creation." Period. He is a new creation. And then we also know that the Bible builds
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.840]   on that rock-solid reality of our identity in Christ and says, "now
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:24.880]   become what you are." For example, 1st Corinthians 5 7, "cleanse out the old
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.000]   leaven," picturing leaven is sin, "that you may become a new lump," picturing the lump
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.360]   of dough is your life, "as you really are unleavened." Isn't that amazing? Clear. "Become
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:46.360]   what you are." You are unleavened, sinless, perfect, accepted, love, home in Christ.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.920]   Now, become that in your practical bodily behavior so that people will see the
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.200]   worth of Jesus Christ to you. Or Colossians 3 10 says it this way, "you have
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.520]   put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after its creator."
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.960]   You have put on the new self, you're there, you're home, you're new, you're in
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:16.720]   Christ, you're accepted, you're loved, you're justified, acquitted, vindicated,
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:24.560]   verdict not guilty, it is finished. Now, be renewed according to who you are in
[00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.600]   Christ. Amen. That sermon excerpt was from John Piper's sermon, "What is the Will of
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.400]   God and How Do We Know It?" delivered on August 22nd, 2004. We have over 1,200
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.560]   other sermons of his in the DesiringGod.org archive, but none of them
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.320]   are more popular than this one. Well, a podcast listener writes in to ask, "What
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:47.800]   does it mean that we are to kill sin by the Spirit in Romans 8 13?" Tomorrow,
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.920]   Pastor John will explain. I'm your host Tony Reinke. Thanks for listening to the
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.040]   Ask Pastor John podcast.
