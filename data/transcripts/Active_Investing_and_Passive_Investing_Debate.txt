[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   Hello, everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.160]   And in this episode, I want to talk about active versus passive investing, because I
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.540]   got a pretty good comment from my post on how I'd invest a million dollars today.
[00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.360]   And the comment asked from Rijigo, "The financial advice media and literature affirm over and
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.040]   over that we should not try and time and outguess the market.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.800]   They say that even experts and fund managers often underperform it.
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.080]   This opinion is so common, it sounds like a consensus.
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.480]   But we also have blog posts such as this one, which advocate the opposite.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.960]   And they are received as just as sound advice as the other type.
[00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.120]   So what is the resolution of this apparent contradiction?"
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.860]   This is a very good point.
[00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:55.240]   And I've written before that passive index investing will outperform active fund managers
[00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.840]   for both equity and fixed income over time.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.120]   It's very clear in the data, which is also why I recommend the majority, the large majority
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:13.000]   of your investable assets go into passive index funds or ETFs.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.320]   This is for your public equity investments.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.640]   But why don't I have 100% of my public equity investments or public bond investments in
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.240]   these index funds or ETFs?
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.900]   It's a conundrum, isn't it?
[00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.320]   So my response to this commenter was, "Well, that's why this post is not investment advice
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.320]   for you.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.200]   It is how I'd invest a million dollars today and how I have invested a million dollars
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.200]   in the past.
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.240]   I'm a writer, not a wealth manager or financial advisor."
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   Right?
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   Let's make this clear.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.020]   I write on Financial Samurai, my own site, to share my thoughts and my experiences.
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.400]   This is not investment advice to you because we're all different.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:01.760]   We all have different risk tolerances, abilities to make money, different stages of our lives,
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.820]   different goals.
[00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.760]   So I told Rodrigo, the commenter, "If you want tailored financial advice for your household,
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:15.760]   I would just hire a fee-only advisor so he or she can look through your specific financial
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.700]   situation, look at your specific asset allocation and goals, and come up with a plan."
[00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.060]   This is the right way, I believe.
[00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.580]   And if you don't want to hire a fee-only advisor, talk to a trusted confidant, your friend or
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:35.540]   family member, and lay all your finances bare and your dreams and your goals bare so they
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.580]   can offer some objective, as objective as possible, feedback.
[00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.420]   Because when it comes to risk assets, there are no guarantees at all.
[00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.580]   2020, a wild year.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.020]   Tanking market in one month and then just rebounded quite quickly thereafter.
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.580]   2021, a super bull market.
[00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.300]   2022, a bear market.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.140]   And 2023, a rebound.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.180]   It's hard to figure out the short term, but over the long term, if you have a proper asset
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.340]   allocation and you have a consistent plan to keep saving and keep investing, I think
[00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.340]   you're going to be okay.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.900]   I think we're going to be okay.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.140]   So I thought my response was clear and good enough.
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.740]   However, Rodrigo responded, "Hi, Sam.
[00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.000]   I'm not sure I understand your reply.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.700]   My point was not about my own investments or wishing to get financial advice from you.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.080]   I was just pointing out an apparent contradiction that I note in the investment literature online,
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.180]   the constant affirmation that passive investment is better, but also the constant act of investing.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.460]   Thank you for the link to your other post.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.140]   It indicates that the apparent contradiction even in yourself, because you also say the
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.500]   passive is better, but are actively investing.
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.460]   To be fair, in that post, you do provide reasons for actively investing.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.340]   One hope, two marketing, three pedigree.
[00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.420]   You also say we all like to dream, but aren't these kind of weak reasons?
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:08.300]   I'm trying to understand why you invest actively, not as a provocative or insulting question
[00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.660]   to you, whom I appreciate and very much respect.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.900]   But just out of curiosity, why do you invest actively?
[00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.420]   Is it just a kind of fun?
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.100]   Isn't that kind of expensive entertainment though?"
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:28.200]   So this response is one of the reasons why I have to be careful responding to comments,
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.060]   because it can often go down a rabbit hole where I don't respond as thoroughly as possible,
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.740]   so it might be critiqued even more, and I've got to spend more time responding.
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.320]   And so it just goes on and on.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:45.220]   And I'm trying to be really protective over my time, because we have so little of it.
[00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.860]   So as a result, what other people do in my situation is actually don't respond to comments
[00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.940]   at all, or remove comments.
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.260]   But I like the interaction.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.700]   I like the challenge.
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.900]   And please feel free to criticize me as much as possible.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.680]   And if I see something that is warrant of a response, I will.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.060]   So my reasoning for why I still invest actively, a minority percentage of my investments, is
[00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.060]   due to the chance that I could outperform.
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:21.140]   When I was 22 years old, I turned $3,000 into $155,000 within six months.
[00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:26.620]   It was a company called Vertical Integration Systems, ticker symbol VCSY.
[00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.300]   And it was during the 2000.com boom while I was sitting at the trading desk at Goldman
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:32.540]   Sachs.
[00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:37.340]   It was a nascent Chinese internet company with a dial pad on the homepage.
[00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.700]   And I thought to myself, given I was sitting on the international equities desk, "Hey,
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.060]   the internet, China, sounds like a no-brainer.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.860]   Let's buy $3,000 worth."
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.660]   I told my friends on the trading desk they bought.
[00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.460]   They talked to their friends on other trading desks at other major Wall Street homes.
[00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.620]   And then they bought.
[00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.860]   And then the stock just went up, up, up, and up.
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:03.000]   So at one point, the $3,000 position went to about $175,000, maybe $180,000.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.700]   And then it started dropping.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.100]   So I got out with $155,000 gain.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:16.460]   I then parlayed that money into a down payment on a condo in 2003 that cost $580,000 in San
[00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.960]   Francisco.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:25.100]   So these investments helped enable me to quit the rat race in 2012 at the age of 34.
[00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.820]   Because if I had just invested in index funds, I wouldn't have been able to.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:30.820]   Why?
[00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.740]   Because the stock market was a lost decade from about 2000 to 2010.
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:36.140]   It just went nowhere.
[00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.920]   And I left in 2012.
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.780]   So my experience making active investments, stock picking, buying real estate, have been
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:46.100]   generally positive.
[00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:50.820]   I've definitely lost a lot of money as well trying to pick stocks like this one company
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:54.420]   called Gas Star that I think lost me like $50,000.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:59.340]   I've had definite landmine blowups, shrapnel in my face.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.500]   But because of these two specific investments, investing in San Francisco real estate in
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:12.980]   2003 and investing in VCSY in late 2019 for four or five months, I'm going to continue
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:20.480]   to try to actively invest because I have this belief that I might strike gold twice or three
[00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:22.080]   times or four times.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:28.740]   I know for a fact that I cannot outperform the masses who invest in index funds or index
[00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:30.080]   ETFs.
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:35.760]   And my clear goal is to outperform because if everybody is making a million dollars a
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:41.000]   year and has a 20% return every single year, and that's what you make and that's what you
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:47.160]   return, well, you're not improving your financial situation and potentially your lifestyle relative
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:50.640]   to others because in finance, everything is relative.
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:58.920]   So I'm willing to risk losing money by actively picking investments on some of my capital
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:01.000]   for the opportunity to outperform.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.920]   And if I don't outperform, well, I only have myself to blame.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:10.280]   I only have my poor decisions, my lack of due diligence, bad luck.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.880]   Well, bad luck is blaming something else.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:14.840]   So no, bad luck doesn't count.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:21.480]   Other ways I could outperform and so can you is to increase your rate of saving, increase
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:27.360]   your investments in real estate, leverage up, invest in alternative assets, speculative
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.360]   assets.
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.960]   There are all sorts of risk assets out there to invest in.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:37.120]   I mean, just in first quarter of 2023, you could have said, well, maybe regional banks
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:41.880]   have been unfairly punished and I'm going to try to step in there with some capital
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.620]   and buy, I don't know, PacWest Bank.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.520]   If you did, you could have probably made a lot of money very quickly or you could have
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.440]   lost if you bought and sold at the wrong time.
[00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:57.160]   These are the risks we take as investors and we understand these risks and we don't invest
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:02.400]   more than what we can afford to lose and what we can afford to stomach losing.
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:07.320]   And I do want to draw your attention to one post I wrote and I recently updated and it's
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:13.000]   called the two levels of rich, one of which doesn't rely on index funds.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   Now that I'm 45 years old, I know a lot more rich people than I did when I was in my 20s,
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   right?
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.120]   Because my friends have had over 20 years post-college to invest, to grind and to take
[00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:27.280]   calculated risks.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:32.800]   And all of my friends who are very wealthy, we're talking 10 million plus, 20 million,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:39.960]   50 million, 100 million, 500 million, a billion, none of them got rich investing in index funds
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.900]   over their past 20 to 25 years post high school or college.
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.620]   They all got rich investing in their business, starting a business, right?
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:55.660]   Business equity or they were angel investors in other businesses that boomed.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:10:02.120]   And so they basically use their capital to make active decisions and concentrated decisions
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.220]   in companies they believed in.
[00:10:04.220 --> 00:10:10.260]   Now a lot of their investments went to zero or lost them a lot of money, but that was
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:12.400]   the risk that we were willing to take.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:18.580]   And I see this time and time again, folks, just go running in the most wealthy neighborhood
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:24.580]   during the day and check out the mansions and then go find out who owns these mansions.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:30.900]   More than likely, they got rich through building a business or investing in amazing businesses,
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.820]   not investing in index funds.
[00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:39.780]   Index funds to me are almost like a safer, relatively safer way to preserve capital with
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:44.180]   a chance of beating inflation by 2 or 3% a year.
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:46.740]   That's how I view index funds right now.
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:53.980]   And remember, I'm 45 years old with two kids who is focused on capital preservation for
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:55.740]   the majority of my capital now.
[00:10:55.740 --> 00:11:00.300]   I don't really want to go back to work, although I am itching to go back to work for more of
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:04.300]   the camaraderie and social aspects to be a part of a team.
[00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:09.980]   I appreciate Rodrigo and other commenters' interest in how I invest my money.
[00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:11.980]   I'm sure it's interesting.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.860]   But also remember, it may not be relevant to your situation unless you are very similar
[00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   to me in age, in goals, in ability to generate income.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:31.100]   What's way more important is yourself, looking at your own portfolio, your own objectives,
[00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.340]   your own asset allocation.
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.660]   You can look at mine, you can get some ideas of how I'm thinking because I do want to share
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:42.660]   my thoughts because this is real money for me.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:49.000]   This is how I can't make huge mistakes now because I depend on my investments to live
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.660]   more than the average person who is focused on generating income from their day jobs.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:00.620]   I also don't have some type of active investing course for you to buy for $9.99 or $2,000
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.500]   or whatever it is you see online to make extra money.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:09.900]   That's just not me because I don't believe most people will be able to make or outperform
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.420]   actively investing.
[00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:17.780]   So in conclusion, please don't lose sight of the reason why you read Financial Samurai
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.980]   or listen to this podcast.
[00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:26.100]   The purpose, the main purpose should be to better your own financial situation and live
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.540]   a better life.
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:34.420]   I do appreciate when readers and listeners are interested and concerned about how I'm
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.700]   investing my money and what I'm doing.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:41.540]   And if you see something egregiously wrong, please let me know in the comment section.
[00:12:41.540 --> 00:12:43.100]   It'll be really helpful.
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:48.820]   The more cogent and thoughtful your argument is as to why you think I shouldn't do something
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:54.580]   is very helpful because I always have blind spots and I'm always looking to learn from
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:12:55.580]   other perspectives.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:57.000]   I really appreciate it.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:03.780]   The great thing about investing is that it's pretty accessible to a lot of people.
[00:13:03.780 --> 00:13:08.620]   You either are satisfied with your investment results or you're not because the numbers
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:09.620]   don't lie.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:11.220]   The returns don't lie.
[00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:16.840]   And in terms of money overall, you're either satisfied with the money you have at the age
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:20.540]   you are at right now or you're not.
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:25.620]   And if you're not satisfied, you're going to do things to increase your chances of being
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:26.620]   satisfied.
[00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:27.620]   Thanks so much everyone.
