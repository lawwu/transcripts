[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   The words to which I should like to call your attention this morning
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:09.840]   are to be found in Paul's epistle to the Ephesians in chapter 5 and verse 19,
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.120]   the 19th verse in the fifth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:24.480]   Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:33.680]   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord. Now obviously that is a part of a
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.400]   greater statement so we'd better start reading again at verse 18.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:46.480]   And be not drunk with wine wherein is excess, but be filled with the Spirit,
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.560]   speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.680]   singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, giving thanks always for all things
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.080]   unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.600]   Now we continue our study of this section of Paul's epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:24.800]   And this morning obviously we are moving on to an application of what we've been
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:32.640]   considering together in verse 18. The apostle now is beginning to illustrate
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:41.440]   how the fact that people are filled with the Spirit shows itself in actual practice.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.280]   This section of the epistles I've been reminding you is an essentially practical one.
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.760]   The apostle is now working out the doctrine that he's been laying down
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.320]   in the first three chapters. And here in this immediate connection
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.880]   he again has been reminding us of a fundamental doctrine, namely that as Christian people
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:13.200]   we should go on being filled with the Spirit. We should be controlled in every part of our being
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:21.920]   by the Holy Spirit. That is how the Christian should stand out in marked differentiation
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.840]   from one who is not a Christian. The Christian is one who can be filled with the Spirit of God.
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.840]   That can't happen to anybody except a Christian. Well now then he's concerned to show how that
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.520]   manifests itself in daily life and living. But what he starts with is the way in which
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:53.920]   that shows itself when Christian people are met and assembled together in the church.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.640]   Now you may ask the question very rightly, "Why did he start with this?"
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.880]   And it seems to me that the answer is fairly obvious.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:14.240]   In putting his doctrine about being filled with the Spirit in the form of a contrast to being
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:21.920]   drunk or filled or soaked with wine, he very naturally was thinking about this aspect of
[00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.120]   the Christian life, that it's a life of joy, a life of happiness. So he immediately thinks
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:38.720]   of one way in which that happiness and that joy manifest themselves. So he takes it up here
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.600]   in the realm of the church. In other words, I'm suggesting that he still has the same contrast
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.960]   in his mind. He is, as it were, saying to these people, "You remember what you used to do? You
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:58.320]   used to gather together with your friends, and there you'd say, 'Well now we'll meet together
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:04.080]   on such and such an evening to have a happy time together.' And there would be the drink, the wine,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:10.400]   and you'd start drinking your wine, and that would loosen your tongues, and some would talk a lot,
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.240]   others would tell stories, and others would begin to sing. They'd sing their ribald and their
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:22.320]   bacchanalian songs. And you thought you were having a marvelous time, that you were tremendously
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.400]   happy, and you were all enjoying yourselves apparently to your heart's content. That's how
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:36.000]   you used to do it. That was what you used to think was happiness and enjoyment and conviviality.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.680]   Now then, says Paul, I've already reminded you that the Christian is another man who's filled
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:51.200]   with wine but with the Holy Spirit. And therefore it follows of necessity that his way
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:59.680]   of spending a happy evening with his fellow Christians is going to be something that is far
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.400]   removed indeed from the way that you used to do it. Far indeed removed from the way
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.320]   in which the world still does it. I will now remind you, he says, of the way in which you
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:21.360]   as Christians, filled with the Spirit of God, express your happiness, your joy, how you have
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:29.920]   this convivial time together, and how all of you are filled with a spirit of praise and of rejoicing
[00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:37.920]   and of thanksgiving. Now that is the setting for this statement. And I'm emphasizing it because
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.760]   there are some people who seem to think that the apostle here is laying down and prescribing
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:50.480]   church order once and forever, which must never be deviated from. They would regard this as
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:58.560]   almost a legal enactment prescribing the order of church worship. Well, I think it's quite obvious
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.000]   from the context that it isn't. But there's a further reason for saying that. That the apostle
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:09.920]   here is obviously only dealing with one aspect of what happens in the church. Doesn't say a word
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:17.600]   here about preaching, doesn't say a word about prophesying, doesn't say a word about teaching,
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:26.080]   or many other things which he details in other parts of this epistle and in other places in
[00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:32.240]   other epistles altogether. Now to start by approaching this with a kind of legalistic
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.920]   outlook, as if the apostle here, as I say, were laying down once and forever exactly how
[00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:45.440]   public praise is to be conducted in the church, is to miss the whole context, the whole atmosphere
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:52.720]   of what the apostle is saying in this great section. He's concerned about the way in which
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:59.040]   men and women filled with the spirit show that they're filled with the spirit when they're met
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:08.880]   together in their communal services in the church, having fellowship together. Now this is to me a
[00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:14.480]   very important and a very interesting and fascinating subject. Unfortunately, as I'm
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:22.640]   saying, it has often become a matter of controversy. And in the controversy about singing psalms in
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:31.040]   particular, the great point of this passage has been entirely missed. So that we must approach
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:36.560]   it with a certain element of care. Very good people have gone wrong about this in the past,
[00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:42.400]   people whom one greatly respects and admires, and there are still such people. And therefore,
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:47.760]   I think it behoves us to try to understand what the apostle's exact teaching is here.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.120]   So we take first of all the actual phrases that he uses. "Speaking to yourselves,"
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.080]   says this authorized translation that I have here. Well now, clearly we mustn't be misled
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:07.040]   by this word "speaking." The word used by the apostle does not refer only to speech.
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:16.320]   It really means "using the voice." And you use the voice in singing as much as in speaking.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:25.920]   It was a word that was used about the sounds made by animals. It was even a word used for the sound
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.480]   made by a musical instrument. So that this translation "speaking unto one another" is
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.440]   rather misleading. As if he were saying here at the beginning, "This is how you must speak to one
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:43.280]   another, and then later singing and making melody in your hearts." That refers to singing. No, no,
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:52.960]   no, the whole thing has reference to singing, primarily. And then of course this expression,
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:59.200]   "speaking to yourselves," is obviously a wrong translation. It really means "speaking among
[00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:08.320]   yourselves," which means speaking to each other, to one another. The idea is, in other words,
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:18.000]   that he says now you must give expression among yourselves to your joyous, happy emotions.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:27.600]   That is the idea that he is conveying. Now the authorities have been much exercised here as to
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:34.640]   whether he is referring to a particular form of singing, what is called antiphonal singing,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:42.160]   in which first of all something is sung by the minister or leader, and then the next is
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:51.120]   sung by the congregation. Antiphonal or responsive singing. Some have detected that here. Well,
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.760]   you can't say that it isn't here, and yet you are not fully entitled to say that it is here.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:10:01.280]   There is evidence to show that there was something like that in the early church,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.280]   as it has continued to be practiced in many sections and branches of the church.
[00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:12.080]   That's not the important thing. As I said, the apostle was not laying down
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:18.640]   minute particular legal regulations with regard to these matters. What he is concerned about is this,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:27.520]   that there should be a combined singing, expression of their joy and their happiness
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:33.040]   together in the Lord, filled with the Spirit. They are now going to give expression to it
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:38.800]   in this particular way and manner. And, of course, it is well known that singing
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:45.680]   was from the very beginning a very definite part of Christian worship.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.360]   There had been considerable singing, as you know, under the Old Testament dispensation.
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.640]   You get that in the Psalms with the instructions given to the musician and so on, and the used
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:02.880]   various instruments. Singing was a very vital part of the worship of Israel, of the Jews.
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:09.200]   And the church began, after all, amongst the Jews. And so this tendency to sing persisted
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:15.920]   in the Christian church. Now, it wasn't something purely Jewish. It is characteristic of most people
[00:11:15.920 --> 00:11:19.280]   when they are full of joy and of happiness that they have a desire to sing.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:29.200]   And so, from the very beginning, I say, singing has taken quite a part in Christian worship.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:36.640]   But now then we come to this particular statement, speaking among yourselves,
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:41.280]   giving expression in this way among yourselves and all together, all of you,
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:51.760]   in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. Now, here I say the matter has often become
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:57.200]   a matter of controversy. And admittedly, it is a very difficult matter.
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:05.040]   There are those who say that psalms and hymns and spiritual songs mean exactly the same thing,
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.120]   and that the apostle is in a sense just repeating himself for the sake of emphasis.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:21.040]   Or they may say, and do say, that you often find psalms referred to as hymns.
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:27.440]   We read about our Lord in the upper room with the disciples when they had sung a hymn.
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:35.280]   That's undoubtedly a reference to a certain psalm. There were certain psalms which were called hymns
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.400]   and others were called songs. So there are those who have argued always that psalms and hymns and
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:49.920]   spiritual songs is just a generic term to cover psalms. Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs,
[00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:54.080]   they say, there's the whole of your book of psalms. Some of them are called psalms, some of
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:59.200]   them are called hymns, some of them are called songs. So he's really saying to them to sing
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:05.680]   psalms, sing from the book of psalms, and that really he was prescribing that nothing should
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:14.160]   ever be used for singing in the church save the psalms, and perhaps in addition certain
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:23.840]   scriptural phrases or paraphrases. Now that is a point of view that has been held by many in the
[00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:32.000]   church throughout the centuries and is still held in a few places in the Christian church today.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.760]   But it is generally agreed by most of the commentators and most of the well-known
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:46.400]   commentators, especially in Ephesians, such as Charles Hodge and Edy and people like that,
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:55.840]   and indeed practically all the great commentators during the last 200 years, that that is not right,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:05.360]   and that there is a difference between psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, and that the apostle
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:13.200]   mentioned the three terms quite deliberately in order to give a general description of the scope
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:21.600]   and the ambit of the way in which people filled with a spirit like this would give expression
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:28.000]   to their joy and to their happiness. These distinctions mustn't be pressed too far,
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:35.280]   and yet there is a distinction. For instance, a psalm. What does a psalm mean? Well, it is a term
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:42.720]   that is generally used for a sacred poem. That is what you have in the book of psalms, for instance.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:51.680]   They are all psalms. They are sacred poems. Indeed, the authorities are generally agreed
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:15:02.240]   in saying this, that a psalm means a sacred song designed to be sung with the accompaniment of a
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:11.200]   musical instrument. That was clearly what they did with the psalms, with the harp or the lute,
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:18.400]   or something like that. They plucked the strings as they sang. And the original derivation of this
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:25.680]   word suggests that very strongly. The real origin of the word just means plucking the strings
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:34.960]   of a harp or a lute in that way. And so it came to be used for this particular form of sacred poem,
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.040]   because that type of sacred poem was almost invariably sung to the accompaniment of this
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:46.880]   instrumental music. Now, that's an interesting thing in and of itself. That is the general
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.000]   notion covered by psalm. Then what is a hymn? Well, a hymn is essentially and primarily
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:06.240]   a song of praise to God, a divine song. It is a sacred, poetical composition.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:13.520]   Now, the great Saint Augustine gave a definition of what a hymn must be. He put it like this.
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:23.200]   He said, "A hymn must be praise, it must be the praise of God, and it must be sung."
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.560]   And that is what has always been, of course, the generally accepted connotation of the meaning of
[00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:40.320]   the word "hymn." A song of praise unto God, which is sung. That's it. Now, there are many who say
[00:16:40.320 --> 00:16:50.800]   that you get indications of such hymns even in the New Testament, for instance. They're very fond of
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:57.440]   saying this, and I have no doubt that they are right, that there were certain compositions of
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:03.120]   this character which were taught to the first Christians. It's very difficult for us to realize
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.800]   this because we are accustomed to having books, but they haven't got these books, and so many
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:16.800]   couldn't read. So they were taught certain hymns. It is said that one, Timothy 3, 16,
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:23.520]   was probably a fragment of a hymn. "And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness.
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:30.560]   God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the angels,
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:36.800]   believed on in the world, received up into glory." And it's not at all difficult to imagine that
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:43.200]   one section of the church sang, "God was manifest in the flesh," then that section, "justified in
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:49.120]   the spirit," this section, "seen of angels," this section, "preached unto the Gentiles," this section,
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:52.640]   "believed on in the world," then all together, "received up into glory."
[00:17:52.640 --> 00:18:02.560]   It may well be a fragment of a hymn. What is clear is that in the early church they certainly did
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:11.760]   have such hymns, and they did sing them. Now, that's the general idea covered by this term,
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:19.200]   "hymn." And that brings me to the next term, "songs," spiritual songs. What is a song?
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:30.160]   Well, a song is an ode. It is a lyric. And this is an interesting point. You notice the apostle says
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:37.840]   "spiritual songs." Why? Well, because you can have a song which is not sacred. He doesn't need to say
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:47.760]   "spiritual songs." A song, by definition, is a sacred song, a sacred poem. He doesn't say "spiritual
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:53.920]   hymns," because, as Augustine reminded us, it not only must be praise, it must be praise to God.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:19:02.400]   And we still, of course, use the same kind of terminology. When you talk about a hymn,
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:07.520]   there's no need to add that it should be spiritual or sacred. That's taken for granted.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:12.560]   And likewise with song. But when you come to a song, you can have all sorts of songs.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:21.040]   A song may be secular, as well as religious. You can have a karmic song. So the apostle,
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:25.600]   you see, has to qualify this by saying, "Oh no, you must sing spiritual songs."
[00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:30.400]   No need to qualify the other two, but a very definite need to qualify this.
[00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:38.480]   What does he mean by "spiritual song"? Well, clearly he means this. He's talking about people
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:45.200]   who are filled with the Spirit. So he says it must be the sort of song that is inspired by the Spirit.
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:53.120]   It must be the work, the composition of a spiritual man, and it must be about spiritual matters.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:59.600]   You can write odes and lyrics about all sorts of things, but no, says Paul, here, of course,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.400]   you will have no kind of ode or lyric except that which is about some spiritual theme.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:12.000]   It'll be so unlike what you used to do before in your songs. Now it'll be spiritual songs.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:18.080]   That's his emphasis, because the whole context is this being filled with the Spirit.
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:23.040]   What is a song, then? Well, a spiritual song is the expression,
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:31.440]   or the natural outburst of a heart that has been moved. There are many examples of this in the
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:42.960]   Bible. Take, for instance, the song of Hannah. You remember her song. At the birth of her child,
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:50.640]   she broke forth into song. How natural that is. It has always been something that people have
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:57.520]   tended to do. Indeed, when you come to the New Testament, you find that Mary, the mother of our
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:05.360]   Lord, did the same thing. She broke forth into song, the Magnificat, as we call it. Indeed,
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:12.160]   the same thing happened to Zachariah, the father of John the Baptist. When the child was born and
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:18.000]   he realized all that had been happening, he again burst forth into song. It was a spiritual song.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:26.080]   It was an expression of a heart that was filled with praise and thanksgiving and rejoicing.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:31.760]   There's nothing more natural. And when one is filled with the Spirit, this is the kind of thing
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:38.080]   that one expects. And, of course, we are told in the book of Revelation, the last book in the Bible,
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:42.480]   that the same thing will happen in heaven. There's a great deal of singing in heaven,
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:50.480]   according to the scriptures. And so we find them giving themselves to this great singing.
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:56.960]   Listen to Revelation 5, 9. "And they sung a new song, saying, Thou,"
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:04.160]   they're talking about the Lamb of God, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the victorious, glorified
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:10.000]   Christ. "They sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book and to open the seals
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:17.680]   thereof. For thou wast slain and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:24.160]   and people and nation." Here is this massed choir of the redeemed bursting forth into song
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:30.720]   as they contemplate their glorious Redeemer and what he has done for them. Let me just give you
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:36.160]   another example or two out of this same book. You get it in the 14th chapter in the third verse.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:43.120]   "And they sung as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders."
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:48.720]   New song again, you see. And there are always new songs there. The theme is eternal,
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.440]   and they're always seeing a fresh aspect. And there's a new song and another new one. This
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:59.360]   inspiration, this being filled with the Spirit. "They sung as it were a new song before the throne
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:05.600]   and before the four beasts and the elders. And no man could learn that song, but the hundred and
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:11.280]   forty and four thousand which were redeemed from the earth." The hundred and forty-four thousand
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:17.680]   is not to be taken literally. It's a symbolic number of completion. Twelve by twelve. Hundred
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:24.000]   and forty-four, then thousand. Ten multiplied by ten, multiplied by ten. It's perfection. It's all
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.320]   the redeemed joining together to sing this song. Well now then, what the apostle is saying is this,
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:38.480]   you see. That is how we will be doing it in glory. But even here we start doing it. Spiritual songs.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:46.800]   Very well then, doesn't it seem obvious that what the apostle is saying is something like this.
[00:23:46.800 --> 00:23:55.200]   When you meet together and we are all filled with the Spirit, there's a great joy within you because
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:24:00.320]   you're Christian people filled with the Spirit. We emphasized that, you remember, three or four
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:05.600]   Sundays ago. How are you going to express it? Well, he said express it like this.
[00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:13.440]   Psalms. Perhaps he was actually referring to the book of Psalms, not of necessity.
[00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:19.600]   Men filled with the Spirit can write and compose psalms.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:27.440]   They can write a sacred poem on the style of a psalm. He may have been referring to the book
[00:24:27.440 --> 00:24:31.840]   of Psalms. I don't know. It's possible that he was. It's possible that he wasn't.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:39.760]   All he is saying is that this type of, denerate of sacred poem was to be sung. Recited, if you like,
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:50.000]   intoned and sung. That's one form. And then he says these hymns. These hymns of praise.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:59.680]   And particularly to the Lord, which means the Lord Jesus Christ. And then these songs.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.520]   Now there are those who teach, and I'm inclined to agree with them, that he may very well have
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.200]   been saying something like this. Sing some of the old psalms of Israel, if you know them.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:17.440]   In addition, some of you may, under the influence and inspiration of the Spirit,
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:27.600]   may compose hymns. Hymns of praise unto God and to the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:34.160]   Well, bring them with you. And sing them, and get the other people to join with you in singing.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:39.920]   And songs. There is a suggestion here of something more spontaneous,
[00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:47.920]   something more extemporaneous. As I say, we've got these instances of godly people
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:53.040]   suddenly having an awareness of what is happening and of the truth, and they burst forth into song,
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:26:02.720]   song, some extemporaneous utterance, spiritual songs. Well now, there it seems to me is a
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:12.080]   definition of the words that the apostle actually uses. But we can't quite leave it just at that.
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:16.720]   Because, as I say, there have been good people in the church
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:22.800]   who have held the view that the apostle is saying here that you should sing nothing but song.
[00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:28.800]   And there are some who would even go so far as to suggest that it is sinful to sing anything else.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.120]   I don't know whether all of you are aware of that, but there are such people still.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:39.680]   They not only don't sing anything but psalms, they regard it as sinful to do so.
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:44.640]   Now, that seems to me to be a very tragic condition to be in.
[00:26:44.640 --> 00:26:48.880]   And I therefore want to look into this position with you for a moment.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:57.120]   It is because I feel that that so militates against the whole spirit and context and
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:02.320]   atmosphere of this statement that I am thus turning aside to it.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:09.280]   Now then, let us look at it in this way. There are certain good reasons, it seems to me,
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:17.200]   why that view, which would confine the praise of the church only to the psalms,
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:25.840]   is erroneous. Here are some of them. This epistle, after all, was written to a gentile church.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:34.640]   And therefore, the likelihood is, it is presumptive, and it is indeed more than that,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:43.280]   it is stronger. The likelihood is that the vast majority of these people would not know the
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:48.640]   book of psalms and its contents in detail. Now, the Jews would, and there were possibly some
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:54.320]   Jewish members of this church. No doubt they were. That is why I am leaving open the possibility
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:28:00.240]   that this may include singing psalms out of the book of psalms. A Jew, a man who had been brought
[00:28:00.240 --> 00:28:05.280]   up in the Jewish faith and religion, he would know certain psalms very well. Well, now then,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:10.640]   it is possible that he sang them. But that's a very different thing from saying that all must
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:16.560]   sing them and sing nothing but them. We must remember that we are dealing with a gentile
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:22.480]   church, and that, as I say, they hadn't books as we now have them. So they couldn't open their
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:27.600]   books and sing the psalms out of the book. They hadn't got it. That surely is something that is
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.400]   worth bearing in mind. Then another very important thing, it seems to me, is this.
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:40.800]   One of the first historians in the Christian church was a man called Eusebius, or Eusebius,
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:52.880]   whichever you prefer. And he says this, that beside the psalms, other compositions were sung
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:29:00.800]   in the early churches. That's a very important statement. Here is the first real church
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.040]   historian, and that is what he says. Then there's another interesting point.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:13.040]   There was a great man in the early church called Tertullian, born somewhere around about 150 AD,
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:21.280]   and went on living till about 220 or 230 AD. He gives a description of what was called a Christian
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:28.080]   love feast. The Christians used to meet together and have what they called a love feast. There are
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:32.640]   references to them in various parts of the scripture. Those who are familiar with the
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:38.240]   history of the evangelical awakening of 200 years ago will know that the whole idea of the love
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:46.880]   feast was revived by the early Methodists. It was a typical Christian gathering where they met
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   together, sometimes to partake of the Lord's supper and to remember his death, but to rejoice
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.640]   and to praise together a love feast. Now Tertullian tells us that in the love feast this
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:06.560]   happened. He says that after water for the hens and lights have been brought in,
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:15.680]   each is invited to sing to God in the presence of the others, from what he knows of the holy
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:24.160]   scriptures or from his own heart. Now that's the important point. At a given stage in the love
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:28.880]   feast, the water was brought in for the hens to be washed, the lights were also brought in.
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:36.720]   And then he says at that point, each is invited to sing to God in the presence of the others,
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:46.320]   from what he knows of the holy scriptures or from his own heart. That is, I feel, the thing
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:52.000]   that we are dealing with in this 19th verse of this 5th chapter. From his own heart, this
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:58.480]   extemporaneous composition, which he composed either a term as a hymn or this song with which
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:05.360]   he bursts forth under the inspiration of the Spirit at the moment. And indeed there are other
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:12.080]   historians. For instance, there was a man who wrote a report to the Emperor Trajan,
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:20.720]   who was the Emperor of Rome from 98 to 117 AD. He said that the Christians of Bithynia met on a
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:30.240]   fixed day before dawn and recited an antiphonal hymn to Christ as God. Now that's a sure fact of
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:36.080]   history again, a piece of history, to establish the point that in the early church there is no
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:45.040]   question at all but that these other compositions were made use of and were sung in addition to the
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:52.560]   book of Psalms and portions of scripture. Then my third reason would be this, that the
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.520]   Apostle says, "Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs," and then he goes
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:03.600]   on to define it further, "singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord." And everybody
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:12.080]   has agreed that that is a reference to the Lord Jesus Christ. And there were new songs composed
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:22.000]   to him and in his praise to the Lord. Put emphasis on that. But then as my fourth reason, I want to
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.520]   take you back to that section of scripture that we have read together at the beginning,
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:34.320]   which is extremely important. Take for instance the 26th verse in that 14th chapter
[00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:43.840]   of the first epistle to the Corinthians. "How is it then, brethren, when you come together,
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:50.960]   every one of you hath a psalm, a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation?
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:59.920]   Let all things be done unto edifying." Now here is a fuller description
[00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:05.760]   of what used to happen in the early church when the Christian people met together.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:14.320]   Now you notice that the whole context again is that of people speaking under the inspiration of
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:21.680]   the Spirit. That is why Paul had to write to them. There were certain excesses in the church at
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.040]   Corinth. There was a certain amount of disorder. Two or three of them would be speaking at the
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:31.760]   same time in tongues, or two or three would be prophesying, two or three would be singing. Now
[00:33:31.760 --> 00:33:36.000]   Paul says if a stranger came into you and heard all that sort of thing going on, he'd come to
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.840]   the conclusion that you're all mad. So he writes to them in order to instruct them as to how to
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:47.520]   control this and how to order this. Now why was that necessary? Oh, it was necessary because
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:55.600]   these people were filled with the Spirit. There was an element of ecstasy there. So the apostle
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:00.960]   has to write them these instructions. Now then, you notice the things he puts together. "One of
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:06.480]   you," he says, "one has a psalm, another has a doctrine, another has a tongue, another has a
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:17.840]   revelation, another has an interpretation." Now what does he mean there by psalm? Well, again,
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:23.600]   he may mean that some of them were familiar with the books, with the book of Psalms, and that
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:32.560]   therefore they were able to sing a psalm. But it seems to me, and not only to me, Charles Hubs,
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:39.040]   for instance, and others take this view, that almost certainly here the psalm is not a reference
[00:34:39.040 --> 00:34:46.320]   to a psalm out of the book of Psalms at all. It is a reference to a psalm that has been written
[00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:52.160]   or composed by a man under the inspiration of the Spirit, because that is the whole context.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:35:02.000]   One of them has a psalm, the other has a doctrine, another has a tongue, another has a revelation,
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:09.760]   and another has an interpretation. These are all given to them by the Spirit, either at the time
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:16.800]   or just immediately before. So that it seems really rather remote to assume that he is just
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:21.840]   saying here that while some of them speak in tongues and some certainly have an aspect of
[00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:26.720]   truth revealed to them, and another has an interpretation and so on, that there is one
[00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:34.480]   man who does nothing but recite one of the psalms out of the book of Psalms in the Old Testament.
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.200]   It is to take it out of the setting and out of the context. And there is just one other bit
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:44.320]   of evidence which I must put before you. Look at what he says in verse 15 of that chapter.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:50.000]   What is it then, he says? "I will pray with the Spirit and I will pray with the understanding
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.960]   also." "I will sing with the Spirit and I will sing with the understanding also."
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.680]   What do you think the apostle sang?
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:07.760]   What was he singing, do you think, when he says he sang with the Spirit?
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:15.120]   Well, he is referring to being in this state of ecstasy, when under the inspiration and
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:21.280]   impulse and movement and guidance of the Spirit, he is giving utterance to things that he had never
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:28.160]   contemplated before. As men spoke in tongues, so they sang like this in the Spirit. He is not
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:34.720]   talking about singing psalms, one of the psalms of the Old Testament. You don't do that with the
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:40.560]   Spirit, you do that with the understanding. But here is this kind of spiritual ecstatic singing.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:47.920]   And that is the context of the entire 14th chapter of that first epistle to the Corinthians.
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:54.000]   That certainly cannot be a reference to singing of psalms out of the book of Psalms in the Old
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Testament. But come, let me say something which is more relevant perhaps to our immediate position.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:07.600]   All this to me is of great significance because I am hoping, God willing, to go on with this next
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:13.120]   Sunday morning and to suggest to you that it is because we have so far departed from the kind of
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:19.440]   thing Paul is speaking about here, that the church speaking generally is as she is at the present
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:27.200]   time. Let me therefore put it like this to you. What is this setting? Well, here I say is a
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:34.560]   typical picture of a meeting of the early church with men and women filled with the Spirit.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.640]   You know, the apostle is not giving an account of what should happen in a formal service such
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:46.400]   as this or such as you may have in a cathedral. You are in an entirely different realm.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:52.080]   I see very little in common between what the apostle describes here
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:56.960]   and what we are so familiar with. No, no, the whole thing is different.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:06.560]   Let us remember that the contrast in his mind is that old type of jollification under the influence
[00:38:06.560 --> 00:38:13.360]   of drink. Now I say that the kind of service, the kind of meeting Paul is describing is something
[00:38:13.360 --> 00:38:18.800]   which has got at any rate something of that element in it. There is joy, there is freedom,
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:25.440]   there is happiness, there is inspiration. And we must not shut that out.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:30.720]   Surely what the apostle is describing is something like this.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:38.720]   I have no difficulty personally in understanding the thing for this good reason.
[00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:48.240]   There was a type of meeting that was once very popular in Wales.
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:56.880]   It was called a happy evening or a happy night. What happened there? Well, this is what happened.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:03.280]   A number of people would meet together in a farmhouse. There would be an enormous kitchen
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:09.040]   with a fire on the floor, looking up into a great chimney. And the friends and neighbours
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:12.800]   would all come together. They were coming together to have a happy evening together.
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:15.120]   And how did they spend it? Well, they spent it like this.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:20.560]   They would start by talking. Then somebody would tell a story he had heard.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:28.320]   But there was always a man there who had a harp. And after a while they would say to him,
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:34.400]   "Why don't you sing to us?" And he would sing. He may have composed a little poem especially
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:38.800]   for the occasion. He would sing it accompanying himself with the harp. Or perhaps he would come
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:45.040]   without preparing and say, "Well, think of something now." And of course I am describing
[00:39:45.040 --> 00:39:49.200]   not something Christian, something that was non-Christian, secular. And they would be
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:54.560]   drinking as they did all this. And there these men in this semi-drunken condition would improvise.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:01.440]   Then another man would recite a poem that he had composed. Or he would, again at the moment,
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:06.080]   he would work out a poem and he would recite it to them. And there would be great cheering
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.920]   and hand-clapping. And so everybody made some sort of a contribution to the evening. That was
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.160]   the great characteristic of the evening. Nobody was a silent member, just sitting looking on.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.880]   Everybody took part. One did this, one did that, and there they were, all of them in this free
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:28.240]   atmosphere, perhaps worked up, I say, partly by the drink and the excitement of it all.
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.120]   And there they were, having a happy evening together.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:36.320]   They did that in the ancient pagan world.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:43.920]   Most nations have had something or other corresponding to that kind of thing.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:50.000]   There are people, I gather, who still meet together in public houses and other places
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:56.560]   to have what they call a sing-song. It's the same idea, only that there was more spontaneity,
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:02.720]   more individual contributions. Well, now then, that is the sort of thing that you
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:06.320]   and I have got to bear in mind as we try to understand this particular statement.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:13.120]   Here is a gathering of men and women who are filled with the Spirit of God.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:18.640]   And each one of them has got something, one a psalm,
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.960]   one a doctrine, one a revelation, one an interpretation, one a tongue.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:29.680]   And here they are, all were full with this, as it were, and wanting to say it. And as each one
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:35.120]   gave his contribution, the others rejoiced, and they praised God together. And they were all
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.240]   in a state of great joy and glory and of happiness.
[00:41:38.240 --> 00:41:44.640]   Perhaps the best way I can put it is this. Have you ever read the accounts of some of
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:50.560]   the great revivals in the Church? Well, I think that will give you the nearest idea you'll ever
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:55.280]   get to what Paul is talking about here. The only difference is this, that in a revival there is an
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:59.440]   outpouring of the Spirit. Over and above their being filled with the Spirit, there is something
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:06.560]   further. And you get this greater element of ecstasy. And so you will read that in revivals
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:11.200]   you sometimes get a scene like this. A number of people are doing something or other at the same
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:16.080]   time. Three or four praying together, another singing, another groaning in agony, crying out
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:25.680]   for salvation. And it seems to be pandemonium and disorder, but it isn't. It is a kind of divine
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.880]   disorder, as someone once put it. That's the extraordinary thing about a revival. You seem
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:35.920]   to get disorder, and yet there is an order running through it all. And everybody is edified, and
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:41.520]   everybody is filled with a spirit of rejoicing. Now that's the sort of thing the Apostle is
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:48.720]   speaking about. Where a man suddenly under the inspiration of the Spirit and seeing some aspect
[00:42:48.720 --> 00:42:57.840]   of truth, bursts forth into a song. Or a man, having had some revelation of God at home,
[00:42:57.840 --> 00:43:04.000]   has written a hymn of praise to the Lord Jesus Christ. And he brings it to the meeting, and he
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:08.400]   speaks it, or he sings it, and the others are astounded and are moved, and they say, "Let us
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:13.120]   learn this," and they all begin to sing it together. That's the kind of picture we are dealing with.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:16.480]   Indeed, let me put it like this to you.
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:23.920]   Obviously, from what we read here, and still more, in 1 Corinthians 14,
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:31.600]   there was always a liability, not to say even a tendency, to disorder in these meetings.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:37.120]   Why? Well, because they were all so anxious to express what they felt, and what they'd experienced,
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:42.000]   and what they knew. And Paul says, "Now you've got to do it one at a time. If you are speaking,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   and you see another man's got something, well, you sit down, let him speak. You read that 1
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:52.160]   Corinthians 14 again." But this is the thing that's of interest. The early church, you see,
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:58.080]   was so filled with the Spirit that Paul had to write like what he writes in 1 Corinthians 14.
[00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:04.960]   He wouldn't have to write it to us, would he? He wouldn't have to write it for a cathedral service.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:11.120]   No, no, my friends. You see, we are tending to judge the New Testament meetings by what we are
[00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:17.200]   familiar with in our deadness. It's got nothing to do with it. If you think this is an instruction
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:24.480]   to people to have a drab, solemn, dull service, when nothing is sung but psalms, I say, "You've
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:30.800]   misunderstood what the apostle is saying. It's the very opposite of that. Here is joy. Here is
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:38.080]   inspiration. Here is revelation. Here is something that is given by the power and the working of the
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:42.480]   Spirit." And the apostle says, "Now you've got to control this. Let everything be done decently,
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:49.280]   and in order. You really must control yourselves." And so on. That seems to me to be the setting
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:54.960]   of what we are dealing with here. Indeed, I go further and say in the sixth place that the
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:01.840]   argument that nothing is worthy to be sung in God's praise save the psalms leads to this position.
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:10.960]   If it is wrong to sing a hymn composed by a man to God, well, then I say extemporary prayer is wrong.
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:17.120]   And any praise and worship and adoration and thanksgiving which a man may give under the
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:23.200]   inspiration of the Spirit in prayer is wrong, but the thing is monstrous. It cannot be wrong.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:30.560]   It is inspired by the Spirit. We must be careful that we don't limit the Holy Spirit and that we
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:39.440]   don't become guilty of quenching the Spirit in a legalistic manner. The Holy Spirit not only
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:44.800]   enabled these men who wrote the Scriptures to write this inspired, authoritative, inerrant
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:52.240]   word of God. Thank God the same Spirit can enable a little preacher to preach.
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:46:00.000]   The same Spirit can enable a man to compose a hymn. The same Spirit can enable a man to paint
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   a picture in representation of the glory of God. Haven't you read the story of Handel composing his
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:12.640]   famous Messiah? That extraordinary masterpiece composed in a few weeks? What's the reason?
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.280]   What's the explanation? Handel gives it himself. He said, "I did feel as if all heaven were
[00:46:17.280 --> 00:46:22.560]   open before me." That was the inspiration of the Spirit. There is no question about it.
[00:46:22.560 --> 00:46:30.000]   Our hymns are not Scripture, but that doesn't mean that they're not inspired. Of course they can be
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:37.360]   inspired. And so many of these hymns are obviously gloriously inspired by the Spirit of God whose
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:47.600]   concern is to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ. I understand my good friends who sing nothing but
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:52.160]   psalms and who say, "Look at some of the hymns that are sung. Look at the doggerel. Look at the
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:57.520]   things that are almost blasphemous." I agree with them 100%. I try never to give out such hymns
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:03.440]   or such choruses. But you know the opposite of what is bad is not nothing, it's good.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:09.920]   And this is where the whole error comes in. There were excesses in the church of Corinth.
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.360]   What does Paul say to them? Does he say, "Never speak with tongues again. Never prophesy again.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:19.280]   Never give vent to these feelings that you have within you." He doesn't say anything of the sort.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:26.400]   He says, "Go on doing it, but do it decently and in order." The opposite to excess is not silence,
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:32.960]   it is control. And that is a ruling which is of universal application.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:41.760]   And I end with this. The history of the church shows us this so clearly, that whenever you have
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:50.640]   a genuine revival, whenever the Spirit of God really does come down and the church is filled
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:57.680]   with the Spirit, it always leads to the appearance of numbers of hymns. Martin Luther composed a
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:04.160]   number of hymns when he thus saw the truth and was filled with the Spirit. Look at the 18th century.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:10.720]   Look at them. Charles Wesley, Seneca, Philip Doddridge, William Williams in Wales, and all
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:18.000]   these mighty composers of our glorious hymns. These hymns were born in revival, of course.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.960]   When people are filled with the Spirit, they want to praise God and to praise the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:31.360]   and this is how they do it. Revivals always lead to hymns and spiritual songs.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:40.640]   But you know, I can even say this. Sometimes the order is reversed,
[00:48:42.880 --> 00:48:51.760]   and hymns lead to revival. I am thinking of one particular and notable instance in 1763.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:59.600]   William Williams, the man who wrote the hymn translated, "O'er the gloomy hills of darkness."
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:10.000]   In 1763, after a period of drought and of death spiritually, in the church in Wales at that time,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:17.200]   William Williams published a volume of his hymns and spiritual songs. Then the people began to sing
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:22.640]   them, and it led immediately and directly to another outpouring of the Spirit of God.
[00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:28.080]   My dear friends, let us ever remember
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:34.640]   that the opposite and the antithesis
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:49.520]   of disorder is control. Let us be careful lest in our dislike of doggerel and poor hymns
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:58.240]   and sloppy sentimental singing, we in turn do not become guilty of quenching the Spirit
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:09.360]   and putting a limit upon what the Holy Spirit can do with a Christian man who has become filled
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:17.600]   with the Spirit. Oh, the whole atmosphere here was charged with the Spirit,
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:28.640]   and so they expressed it in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. If you could prove to me
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:36.080]   that churches that sing nothing but psalms are filled with the Spirit and rejoicing and praise
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:40.960]   and have endless conversions and additions to their body, I should be more ready to listen.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:53.520]   Let us avoid all excesses. Let everything be done decently and in order, but above all,
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:51:05.920]   quench not the Spirit. Rather, be filled with Him and give evidence of the fact that you are. Amen.
[00:51:05.920 --> 00:51:15.120]   We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
