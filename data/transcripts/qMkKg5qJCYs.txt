[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.340]   Now, after we've sung our next hymn, the Reverend Peter Lewis of Nottingham is going
[00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.960]   to bring us a word from the Lord.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.880]   Our next hymn is "My Gracious Lord, I own thy right to every service I can pay, and
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.840]   call it my supreme delight to hear thy dictates and obey."
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:42.840]   [MUSIC - "MY GRACIOUS LORD, I OWN THY RIGHT TO EVERY SERVICE I CAN PAY, AND CALL IT
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:01:02.840]   MY SUPREME DELIGHT TO HEAR THY DICTATES AND OBEY"]
