[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   What do you think makes a trip to France so much different than other places in the world?
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:12.920]   What I think is even astounding to me, as someone who's lived here for 16 years, is how each region really feels so different.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.040]   So yes, you're in the same country.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.040]   There's a semblance of shared values, of course, across the country.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   But beyond that, geographically, gastronomically, in so many other ways, culturally, each region really feels like it could be almost its own country.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.400]   But the great thing is that it is so easy to get around here.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.480]   Most of everything you want to see and do can be accessed either by train or by a quick flight.
