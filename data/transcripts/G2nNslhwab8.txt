[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   This week I opened Twitter to see this Washington Post headline, "Deciding whether to have
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.360]   kids has never been more complex.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.280]   Enter Parenthood Indecision Therapists."
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.880]   Now, I'm not sure the question is more complex than it was 100 years ago when the infant
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.160]   mortality rate in this country was about 24%.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.280]   Nevertheless, having children is always a life-altering decision for sure, and it comes
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.640]   with some really complex implications, especially when you factor in this profound reality that
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.000]   every child we bring into this world is an eternal being who will live forever.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.400]   This reality leads to a question like this one from Claire.
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.200]   "Pastor John, thank you so much for this podcast.
[00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.680]   It's been so extremely helpful in answering many of the exact questions I wrestle with
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.680]   myself.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.320]   Something I have been recently wrestling with as a mom of two little children is why do
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.560]   we as believers continue to have children when we know that verses like Romans 9, 18
[00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.680]   are true?
[00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.680]   It sounds like the natalism/anti-natalism debate a little, but it's really driven by
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.680]   the doctrine of election.
[00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:16.920]   Knowing that our children could be the ones God chooses to harden, is it worth the risk
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.320]   of having children at all?"
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.920]   Yes, it is worth the risk, and I'll give you four observations.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.440]   I hope they're biblical to support my answer.
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:36.840]   Number one, obedience is always worth the risk.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.360]   Now why do I put it that way?
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:46.560]   Because when God said to Adam in the beginning, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth,"
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.320]   Genesis 128, He knew exactly where the world was going.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.960]   He knew all the horrors of history.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:05.440]   He knew what the fall would mean for perishing and suffering, misery, relational horror and
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   catastrophe.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.760]   Oh my.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.120]   Nothing took God off guard.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.680]   He knew all that when He said, "Fill up the earth."
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.600]   It's not like He was talking to unfallen man, and as soon as man fell, He said, "Whoops,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.640]   whoops, I gave them bad advice."
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.920]   God never, never, never gives bad advice because He knows everything that's coming.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.640]   He takes everything into account when He gives His counsel.
[00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.880]   So He knew everything that was coming, and yet He said, "Fill this earth with human
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.600]   beings.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.840]   These are the offspring that are going to experience either destruction or redemption."
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.200]   In other words, it isn't we who have discovered the doctrine of election and wonder whether
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.360]   it means we should have children.
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.120]   God created the doctrine of election and commanded us to have children.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.080]   That's why I say it's worth the risk because obedience is always worth the risk.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.720]   God knew the 21st century.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.800]   He knew the first century.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.360]   He knew every century and everything it would bring.
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.640]   He never rescinded the command, "Fill it up, fill it up."
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:26.960]   Number two, when we think about the fact that people are lost and people are saved, we must
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.060]   always remember that God is infinitely wise and good.
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:37.560]   He has purposes for this fact that some are lost and some are saved.
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.560]   He has purposes.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.720]   They are wise.
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:40.820]   They are good.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.000]   He knows what He's doing.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:50.840]   He has good reasons for why one person is shown mercy and another is passed over in
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.940]   their rebellion and unbelief.
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:02.800]   We must be very, very careful lest we think in a way about children that implies that
[00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:08.240]   God's ways are foolish or unwise or cruel.
[00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:16.200]   Number three, it is a high and holy calling, not just for a woman to physically give birth
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:25.840]   to a child, but more for parents to agonize in spiritual labor pains until Christ be formed
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.560]   in their children.
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:34.120]   Paul said in Galatians 4.19 to the immature Christians that he loved, he was not entirely
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.200]   certain they were saved.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:44.640]   He said, "My little children, for whom I am again in anguish of childbirth until Christ
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.880]   be formed in you."
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:56.480]   We don't choose to be parents because parenting is easy or because the outcome is sure.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.360]   It's not easy and it isn't sure.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:10.000]   We become parents because it's a high, holy, divine calling and all the risks and all the
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.200]   sorrows that it brings are part of a high and holy, precious and honorable calling and
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.060]   purpose of God.
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.600]   Number four, one last observation.
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.920]   Think with me for a moment about the fact that the Lord has delayed the second coming
[00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.160]   now for 2,000 years.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:37.080]   He didn't decide to do that year by year.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.720]   We know from the Gospels that the day was set in the mind of the Father from the beginning.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:50.680]   Now what does that mean for the question that Claire is asking about the wisdom of having
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.520]   children?
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   Some people had expressed skepticism that the Lord would ever return because it's been
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.880]   so long in their viewpoint in 2 Peter.
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:07.080]   And so Peter answers like this, "Do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.840]   one day is as 1,000 years and 1,000 years is as one day.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:17.000]   The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:27.720]   you, you, not wishing that any of you should perish, but that all should reach repentance."
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:36.040]   In other words, God delays the coming of Christ so that all of the elect will repent and be
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:43.720]   saved and have the experience of eternal joy in the presence of God.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:50.040]   And God made that choice, the choice to appoint the day far out.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:58.440]   He made that choice knowing that thousands, indeed millions of others will be born during
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:04.440]   that delay of Christ who will not believe but will perish.
[00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.840]   And here's the implication for the question we're dealing with.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:18.080]   We should value the eternal joy and praise and glory to God that every redeemed child
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:19.080]   gives to God.
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:29.360]   We should value that joy and that praise more than we fear the misery if some are lost,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:30.360]   because God does.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.280]   There's no other way to understand this delay.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:42.880]   God has planned history and the timing of the second coming the way he has because of
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.160]   the massive priority he puts upon the repentance and the salvation and the eternal joy of his
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:55.320]   elect who will be born and brought into the kingdom.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:08:02.520]   He does not let the fact that many will become rebellious and reject his love, he doesn't
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:09.080]   let that fact compel him to withhold from his elect their eternal joy.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:15.760]   Now, I think we should share God's mindset when we think about our children.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:25.800]   We will pray and work and agonize and weep, and if we can, die so that Christ would be
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:28.080]   formed in them.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:36.320]   But we will not let the possible misery of some prevent us from pursuing and hoping for
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:39.200]   the eternal joy of all.
[00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.200]   Amen.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.460]   Excellent, Pastor John.
