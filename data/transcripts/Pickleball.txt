[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai wishing you happy holidays. I'm
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.260]   actually sitting in the car right now recording this episode because both my
[00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.280]   daughter and son rebuffed me. I took them out to the playground and I wanted to
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.800]   play with them but my daughter didn't want to play see-saw and my son didn't
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.120]   want to ride a bike and so I told them okay if you don't want to play I'm gonna
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.200]   go record a podcast and make some lemonade and you guys can go play with
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.440]   mommy. So in a very big way recording these episodes and writing on Financial
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.600]   Samurai has been a savior for me as I try to be a good stay-at-home father.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.840]   It's been over five and a half years now and it's been very tough because both my
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.120]   wife and I stay at home and when you have two stay-at-home parents there's
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.640]   not much of an outlet so you need to create an outlet. So Financial Samurai
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.000]   has been my outlet from fatherhood and I've discovered a new outlet from
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Financial Samurai because Financial Samurai can often take a lot of work,
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.120]   there's often a lot of criticism and sometimes there's just general lack of
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:14.000]   support. As a writer and as a podcaster now you just want to be heard, you just
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.240]   want to have some positive banter and to feel appreciated and sometimes that road
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.200]   is tough and so that outlet I've discovered from Financial Samurai and
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.000]   also parenthood is Pickleball. Now obviously Pickleball is not really
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.520]   personal finance related but it is life related and a lot of my episodes and a
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.600]   lot of my writing talks about how to lead a happier more purposeful better
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.120]   life with the money we have. During the pandemic my outlet was tennis you know
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.880]   find some friends and we'd go to any public park we could find that was
[00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.080]   unlocked and that didn't have reservations and we'd play and we'd feel
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.280]   better mentally and physically. However I overdid it I played over 29 official USTA
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.680]   tennis league matches in 2022 and as a result my right shoulder I think has a
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.760]   torn labrum or something it hurts I hurts a lot every time I serve and I
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.780]   hit high topspin forehands and then my hips my hips are popping a little bit
[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.000]   and then my knees they've been they've been giving me issues for over a decade
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.160]   now but I've played through it and I haven't had all these physical problems
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.480]   in a while because I hadn't been playing so much but since 2022 when things
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.440]   started opening up and everybody became more social I started to play more
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.040]   tennis almost like a catch-up like a catch-up from not playing as much in
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.960]   2020 and 2021 and it's kind of like the travel boom in 2022 everybody's catching
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.920]   up to travel like crazy because they didn't travel as often in the past two
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:55.720]   years. So with my injuries I needed to find some other outlet and that outlet
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.280]   is pickleball because pickleball is about 20 to 30 percent of the impact
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.520]   tennis has on my body and I think most people's body so you can play two to
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.320]   three times longer to start before you start feeling those aches and pains or
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.880]   you can play the same amount of time as you play tennis if you play tennis and
[00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:21.280]   you'll feel 70 to 80 percent less aches and pains. Another great reason why you
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.880]   should play pickleball is if you're looking for an activity to do with your
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.920]   partner, your friend, your loved one because my wife and I you know we love
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.560]   to do things together but we have different interests. She's musically
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.200]   talented I'm not really I play some guitar I play a lot of sports she
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.640]   doesn't you know we can go on hikes which is one of our favorite activities
[00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.640]   but we wanted to find new activities to do as we get older and with pickleball
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.880]   there is a low low hurdle to overcome to start playing. You can start hitting the
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.640]   ball back and forth within five ten minutes and then within 30 minutes to an
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.840]   hour two hours tops you can get good enough to play regular games. However
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.440]   with tennis it's a much higher hurdle sport to overcome so if you have
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.360]   dissimilar levels it's not gonna be that fun for both parties. And then when my
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.760]   father and mother finally visited for the first time in three years well I did
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.600]   see them a year ago because I flew to Hawaii to see them but I hadn't seen him
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:29.160]   in a year and I realized hmm at 77 years old and 75 years old they could sure use
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.960]   some more physical activity light impact low impact physical activity and they
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.720]   could sure use some more community and once I started playing pickleball I
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.880]   realized wow the game is so much better for your body on your body and the
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.600]   community aspect was wonderful wonderful wonderful there were plenty majority of
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.680]   people were over 60 years old and everybody was nice everybody was nice
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.760]   and the games were quick you just put your paddle down on a on a court and at
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.760]   most you wait 15 minutes and usually you wait under 10 minutes to start playing.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.640]   When we get older we get more lonely you heard about that in a previous episode
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:14.000]   and you read about that in a previous post and one day one day we might not
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   have anybody as people die out or people have different lives to lead so that
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.440]   community aspect if you want to feel less lonely I think pickleball is it's
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   been the most welcoming sports community I have ever been a part of and I've done
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:35.600]   tennis I've done soccer and I've done softball pickleball is by far the most
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:42.280]   welcoming sport I gotta be frank I think my fear of loneliness is getting to me
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:47.720]   which is why I've recorded this podcast previous podcast and written a post
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:53.720]   about loneliness I see my parents aging one day they won't have each other and I
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:58.120]   know it's gonna be the same thing for us and I know that our kids will want to
[00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.320]   play with their friends I mean already they don't want to play with me so I'm
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.200]   trying to find an outlet elsewhere and so you know holiday season can be really
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.400]   good or it can feel really lonely as this is the time where you really know
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.080]   who your friends and family are and if they're not around relative to other
[00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:23.800]   people sharing their family stories and travels and trips you're probably gonna
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.640]   feel a little bit down so I just wanted to share this episode to tell you how
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.400]   much pickleball has helped me get through the tough times the down moments
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:37.840]   I do believe there's a an important mental to physical connection to
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.040]   everything we do we just can't you know type on our computers for eight to ten
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:46.280]   hours a day I think we need balance and part of that balance is having physical
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.360]   exercise feeling the Sun on your face laughing with friends meeting new people
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.760]   exercising getting out there that has always made me feel happier and I know
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.480]   it'll make you feel happier as well one of the most important things any
[00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.360]   financial samurai should do is plan for the future pre-mortem planning plan 5 10
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:15.520]   15 years out planning is free and as a 45 year old I know my life is half over
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:20.560]   now but I'm trying to plan for the future where I'll get slower I'll get
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:25.120]   more injured maybe I'll have different interests and maybe some people will
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.000]   come and go in my life so I'm trying to lock down that one stable thing that I
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.800]   could do that could bring me joy and that's pickleball planning ahead is
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:40.560]   something in 1999 I did to plan ahead to try to retire by 40 and starting
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   financial samurai was planning ahead so I had something purposeful and meaningful
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:50.600]   to do after I retired from finance because I read everything I could about
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.480]   early retirement and I knew there were a lot of downsides including loneliness
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:02.160]   boredom lack of purpose and also a lack of identity all of us want to build more
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.760]   wealth we want to generate enough passive income so we can do what we want
[00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:10.880]   but even if we get to a level where we are absolutely free life is just not
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.860]   that fun if we don't have purpose if we don't have a goal we don't have meaning
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.840]   you know with pickleball it might sound silly everybody should find their own
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.160]   pickleball if pickleball is not for you but for me it gives me a purpose to stay
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.760]   in shape so I can be more competitive on the court I want to learn all about the
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.240]   strategies so fun learning about double strategies and single strategies I want
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.280]   to test out new equipment you know paddles are $60 to $250 I'm gonna work
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:42.480]   my way up and you know try them out it's gonna be so fun what I realize is that
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:47.360]   we should all try new things something awesome to do starting from the
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.000]   beginning is the most fun because you experience the most amount of progress
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.440]   you're the most passionate about something I remember playing golf when I
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:00.640]   was like a 25 handicapper going to a 10 handicapper was exhilarating but trying
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:06.120]   to break 10 handicap consistently was no fun anymore you know I had to get on the
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:11.200]   green and regulation to putt you know to try to get par and hit some occasional
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.600]   birdies and that was really really challenging and not as fun so go out
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.240]   there find something new to do that challenges you that makes you happy that
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:24.120]   gets you outside if it's not pickleball hopefully you can find something else
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:29.920]   because life is so much better when you have this great fun activity to look
