[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   I'm Kyle Newport and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.680]   episode 204.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.580]   I'm here at my Deep Work HQ joined by my
[00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.440]   producer, Jesse.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.440]   Jesse, in between the last episode we
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.060]   recorded and this one, I drove my family
[00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.240]   down to Knoxville, Tennessee for a family
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.720]   reunion.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.420]   I will tell you, if you look up Deep Work
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.600]   in the dictionary, you know, they have
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.200]   antonyms, like, okay, what is the exact
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.520]   opposite of this word?
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.260]   Next to that, it says driving eight hours
[00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.940]   with three kids under the age of 10.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.980]   That is the opposite of Deep Work.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.120]   That is the state that is the
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:46.160]   opposite of Deep Work.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.340]   I was right.
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.120]   How many stops?
[00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520]   Uh, quite a few.
[00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.020]   Uh, but there's one we made, it reminded
[00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.860]   me a little bit of the show.
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.040]   So there's a stop we made.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.500]   We're doing some tourist trap type stuff.
[00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:58.300]   It was fun.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.600]   So we stopped in a natural bridge,
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.920]   Virginia, which is where natural bridges,
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.220]   natural bridges, uh, geological formations,
[00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.720]   like a giant stone bridge.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.600]   It's actually a cave that collapsed, but
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.460]   George Washington went by there supposedly
[00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.900]   when he was surveying Virginia, Thomas
[00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.600]   Jefferson owned that land for a while,
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.620]   built a cabin there, maybe a Deep Work
[00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.160]   cabin next to this state park, historical,
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.380]   whatever is nonsense.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.760]   All sorts of nonsense, uh, because
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.740]   it's a, it's a tourist stop.
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.180]   So we went to this one place
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.440]   called Dinosaur Kingdom 2.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.620]   And it was actually kind of interesting,
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.780]   right?
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.040]   So this was a place, uh, a tourist
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.500]   attraction created by Mark Klein, who
[00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.180]   is an expert, maybe the world's expert
[00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.900]   in making large novelty statuettes
[00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.320]   or figures out of fiberglass.
[00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:51.600]   Right.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.820]   So, so, uh, I looked them up as I do
[00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.280]   and read some profiles and I'm now a
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.260]   pseudo Mark Klein expert, but he's the
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.420]   guy you go to if you're on route 66.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.300]   And they call these muffler men, but
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.440]   the giant fiberglass figures by the
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.500]   old timey gas stations, he's the guy
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.020]   you go to, to fix yours or to build
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.300]   yours.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.660]   He did the fiberglass figures for this
[00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.820]   wizard of, uh, wizard of Oz themed park.
[00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.240]   That's over, uh, off the Beltway
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.180]   called Watkins park.
[00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.400]   So anyways, he built this attraction
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.440]   where the, the, the main part of it is
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.600]   you walk through the woods and he's
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.700]   built all these giant fiberglass
[00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.040]   dinosaurs, it's a little bit weird
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.740]   because the premise of the park is that
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.420]   the dinosaurs are involved in the civil
[00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.820]   war.
[00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.840]   So it's these dinosaurs that are
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.300]   attacking and, or being ridden by
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.980]   fiberglass mannequins of civil war
[00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.820]   fighters.
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.900]   So we're not talking about a, uh, a,
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.900]   uh, enlightening scientifically,
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.560]   historically accurate experience.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.480]   I mean, at some point there's a
[00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.000]   hadrosaur with a saddle and two
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.860]   Gatling guns on it, but anyways, it's
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.000]   this weird labor of love, all these
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.900]   figures, fantastical figures.
[00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.180]   There's a water gun fight with big foot
[00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.880]   every hour where you get super soakers,
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.660]   but you get to the end.
[00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.120]   This is what made me think about the
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.480]   show.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.380]   You get to the end of this park.
[00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.260]   And the final thing is there's an
[00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.580]   outhouse and you open the door and you
[00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.700]   press a button and the back wall of the
[00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.820]   outhouse, it's like, there's a hole in
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.300]   the wall and it's screen and you press a
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.300]   button and a giant Tyrannosaur head
[00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.980]   comes down like animatronically and
[00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.880]   starts like, you know, growling like
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.380]   right there, like this big, this big
[00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:28.140]   head that comes down.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.940]   And I took a picture of this, but
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.020]   there's a sign in that final attraction.
[00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:33.820]   So let's see here.
[00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:36.380]   All right here, I'll show you Jesse.
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.580]   All right.
[00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:40.420]   What's the, what's the sign read is the
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:41.980]   final attraction of this weird park.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:44.180]   I done all this while you was at your
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.740]   computer.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:45.620]   Yeah.
[00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.880]   I was like, that's pretty, that's
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:48.820]   pretty appropriate.
[00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.480]   It's kind of like a deep work or a deep
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:52.900]   life, I should say case study.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.420]   There's a guy who built an for sure
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.500]   remarkable life in the sense is remarkable
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.660]   love.
[00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.420]   He builds his random fantastical whimsies.
[00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.740]   That's his job.
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.180]   He actually has a workshop there in
[00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.700]   Virginia called the enchanted castle.
[00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.020]   That's just full of all these figures
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.500]   he's working on.
[00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.580]   So I liked that epithet.
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.860]   I built this all whilst you were on your
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:11.340]   computer.
[00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.260]   It reminds me of the final scene of the
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.940]   movie, the wizard.
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:15.140]   Remember that movie way back in the day,
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.380]   the video game player with Fred Savage.
[00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.980]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.860]   What's the final scene of the wizard.
[00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.980]   I know that they were, he was like
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.820]   running away and there was like that big
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.020]   dinosaur or something like that.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.380]   Oh, I thought you were going to say the
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.580]   final scene of the wizard was about like
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.540]   not using your computer.
[00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.820]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.580]   No, the dinosaurs and stuff.
[00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.140]   I'll have to go back and watch it.
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.860]   I've considered that's interesting.
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.300]   Movie super Mario three.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   They debuted that it was a big tie-in.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.620]   They debuted super Mario brother three in
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.260]   the movie because they knew the game was
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.820]   coming out.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.780]   Yeah.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.500]   I should watch that again.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:45.540]   Anyways.
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.140]   I like that.
[00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.100]   So while we're all on our computer doing
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.460]   email and checking social media, Mark
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.180]   Klein was putting Gatling guns on Hadrosaurs.
[00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.020]   All right.
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.100]   So we got a good show.
[00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.580]   We got some written questions.
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:01.820]   We got some calls.
[00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:05.740]   We'll do a books I read in June summary
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.740]   coming up since our first episode of the
[00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.500]   new month.
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.500]   But before we get into all of that, I
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.540]   want to do a quick deep life, slow
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.260]   productivity themed reaction.
[00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.060]   And in particular, the, the article I want
[00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.260]   to react to here is my own.
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.380]   So I published this just on my, my
[00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.740]   newsletter yesterday, July 5th, the day
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.620]   before we were recording this episode.
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.460]   And this is based off of a article that
[00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:35.820]   many different readers sent to my
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.260]   interesting@calnewport.com email address.
[00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:39.540]   All right.
[00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.220]   So the title of this, of this article,
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.220]   which I wrote for my newsletter, and if
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.420]   you don't subscribe to that newsletter,
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:46.220]   calnewport.com, you should, it's once a
[00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.980]   week, I've been doing it since 2007.
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:49.300]   All right.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.940]   So the title I had for the article was
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.500]   the three hour fields, metal, little
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.940]   Tim Ferriss nod, colon, a slow
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.460]   productivity case study.
[00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.940]   But really what I'm doing here is
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:01.580]   reacting to this article.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:03.300]   And again, if you're listening, I'm
[00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.660]   showing this on the screen.
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.060]   So if you watch the episode at
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:09.140]   youtube.com/calnewportmedia, you'll,
[00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:10.300]   you'll see what I'm talking about,
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.060]   but I'll walk you through it.
[00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:13.780]   This essay was in reaction to this
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:18.060]   profile from quantum magazine about June.
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:19.260]   Huh.
[00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.180]   H U H.
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.780]   June is a 39 year old Princeton professor.
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.380]   Why we care about him is that yesterday
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.100]   he was awarded the 2022 fields metal.
[00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.220]   This is often referred to as the
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.980]   Nobel prize of mathematics.
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:36.900]   It's given out once every four years, I
[00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.180]   believe, and it's given out to the
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.940]   mathematical professional 40 or younger,
[00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.300]   whose work done to date and promise for
[00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.940]   future work is the, let's say most
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.740]   impressive among all working mathematicians.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.260]   So it's really one of the highest honors
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.700]   you can win, uh, in mathematics.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.300]   And he won it for work he's doing
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.700]   on geometric combinatorics.
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.060]   All right.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.340]   So this profile, which was quite long,
[00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.260]   quantum magazine is great.
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:06.220]   Uh, this profile is quite long, had
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:07.700]   some interesting points in it.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.940]   So for example, if you look at June's
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:13.660]   trajectory, he did not get serious
[00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.620]   about mathematics until late in his
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:18.260]   undergraduate career, he went to college
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:20.100]   university in South Korea, where
[00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:21.100]   it's a six year system.
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:23.220]   It wasn't until his sixth year that he
[00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:24.700]   even got serious about mathematics.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:26.980]   And that's because he took a class from
[00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:30.780]   a well-known eccentric fields prize
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:31.900]   winning fields, metal winning
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.780]   mathematician, Japanese mathematician,
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:37.620]   Hayasuke Hironaka, who was teaching a
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.500]   class where it wasn't well-established
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.940]   results, he was actually teaching
[00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:43.060]   stuff he was working on.
[00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:45.300]   June falls under his sway,
[00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.700]   uh, applies to graduate school.
[00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:49.620]   He's applying to graduate school, having
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.420]   only been serious about math for one year.
[00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.340]   So he applies to around a dozen schools.
[00:07:53.340 --> 00:07:54.980]   Everyone rejects them except for one.
[00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:56.580]   Urbana-Champaign lets him in.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:58.820]   They're glad they did because within a
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.900]   year or two, he solved Reed's conjecture.
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:05.580]   So he immediately solves a 40 year, 40
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:11.020]   year, uh, open problem for the nerds out
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:13.940]   there, uh, you can, you can bound the
[00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:16.260]   chromatic number of graphs with certain
[00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.820]   characteristic polynomials, the chromatic
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.900]   number of a, of a undirected graph being
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.980]   the minimum number of colors by which
[00:08:22.980 --> 00:08:24.460]   you can color the vertices such that no
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:26.140]   two adjacent vertices have the same color.
[00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.940]   All of my, hopefully all my algorithms
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:30.340]   and discrete mathematics students know
[00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.300]   what I'm talking about here.
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.820]   You can bound the chromatic
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.260]   number with a polynomial.
[00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.780]   The polynomial has coefficients.
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:37.580]   The coefficients of these characteristic
[00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:39.420]   polynomials have certain properties
[00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.260]   that had long been observed, such
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.860]   as their log concavity, but it had
[00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.220]   never been proved that that was.
[00:08:45.220 --> 00:08:46.820]   Unavoidable.
[00:08:46.820 --> 00:08:50.260]   Reed's conjecture said it was June proved it.
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:51.940]   All right.
[00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:52.340]   So there you go.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.380]   There's a summary of the first thing he
[00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:55.860]   proved, uh, he then went on to generalize
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:57.300]   those results to something called
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.820]   matroids, blah, blah, blah, long story short.
[00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.220]   Uh, it was, it's a very innovative
[00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.820]   approach that showed that, I mean, again,
[00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.380]   I don't know how to summarize this too
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:10.700]   succinctly, but, but essentially a
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.940]   technique that before people thought
[00:09:14.940 --> 00:09:17.540]   only applied to problems where there
[00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:19.820]   was a geometric grounding, like the
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.540]   chromatic number of a graph, he showed
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.500]   you could apply this technique to a much
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.380]   broader class of objects called matroids.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.580]   Let's just, let's just leave it at that.
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:31.100]   Anyways, it won him a Fields Medal.
[00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.020]   It was a really good result.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:34.820]   Um, I also found that interesting that
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:36.660]   after he solved Reed's conjecture, the
[00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:39.300]   schools who had rejected him came back
[00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:41.020]   and courted him, U Michigan actually
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.660]   convinced him to transfer from Urbana
[00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:44.020]   Champaign to Michigan after he
[00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:44.940]   solved Reed's conjecture.
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.300]   So they, they sort of realized they
[00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:47.260]   made a mistake on that one.
[00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:51.420]   Anyways, the reason why I wanted to talk
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.420]   about this profile of this young professor
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:58.020]   was the following quote that came from
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:01.540]   the profile, "On any given day, Poe does
[00:10:01.540 --> 00:10:04.300]   about three hours of focused work."
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:06.500]   You might think about a math problem
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.380]   or prepare to lecture a classroom of
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:09.660]   students or schedule a doctor's
[00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.820]   appointment for his two sons.
[00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.340]   Then I'm exhausted.
[00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:13.380]   He says, doing something that's
[00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.980]   valuable, meaningful, creative, or a
[00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:17.340]   task that he doesn't particularly want
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.540]   to do like scheduling those appointments
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:21.180]   takes away a lot of your energy.
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:24.020]   This guy's doing productive work
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:26.420]   about three hours a day, not even just
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.020]   three hours of deep work on math.
[00:10:28.020 --> 00:10:28.740]   And then I do the rest of
[00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:29.500]   the stuff later in the day.
[00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.420]   He spends about three hours a day
[00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.940]   actually exhausting energy from his mind.
[00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.340]   Now I thought that was really telling
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.060]   because it provides an extreme example
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.780]   of one of these principles that is a
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:47.580]   part of my emerging philosophy of slow
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.380]   productivity and that principle is that
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.340]   busyness and exhaustion, that sense of
[00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.780]   overload and frenetic movement is often
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:11:00.220]   quite unrelated to producing valuable work.
[00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.940]   These are two unrelated things.
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.660]   The, the, the pace and effort
[00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.860]   required to do things of note, to prove
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:11.180]   things about matroids or to
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.380]   solve Reed's conjecture.
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.660]   Those efforts do not require and have
[00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.340]   very little to do with I am overloaded.
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:19.100]   I'm burnt out.
[00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:20.780]   I'm burning the midnight oil.
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:22.820]   I am working all day long.
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:23.500]   I'm frantic.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.180]   I'm frenetic.
[00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:28.460]   Two unrelated, two unrelated states.
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:31.460]   A little bit of intense work.
[00:11:32.460 --> 00:11:34.860]   Done at a natural pace, given the
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:36.580]   breathing room to aggregate over time
[00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.380]   can lead to really big results.
[00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:42.660]   So that got me thinking, why are we then
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:44.460]   in so many roles, especially even
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:46.380]   specialized knowledge worker roles,
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:48.460]   where producing complex things out of
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:49.940]   our minds is ultimately what moves the
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.260]   needle, why in so many of these roles,
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.020]   are we so busy and why are we so overloaded?
[00:11:54.020 --> 00:11:55.380]   And I think there's two
[00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:56.540]   different things going on here.
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.260]   One is I talk about a lot on the show
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:02.060]   and in my writing, the way we organize
[00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:03.340]   work, especially knowledge work
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:05.460]   today is haphazard.
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:07.540]   Anyone can grab anyone's
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.820]   attention at any time.
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.420]   We have no sort of systematic
[00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:11.660]   thinking about workload.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.700]   We have no systematic thinking about
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.700]   collaboration or communication,
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.100]   how this should actually unfold.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:19.220]   It is a free for all of obligation
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.540]   hot potato where everyone's just
[00:12:20.540 --> 00:12:22.020]   shooting things off to everyone else.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.820]   You put something on my plate, I send
[00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.940]   you a clarifying question so I don't
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.540]   have to worry about it for a couple hours.
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.140]   Something pops up.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.380]   I say, why don't you handle this?
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.540]   It's a world without specialization.
[00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:32.980]   Where we say, why can't everyone just
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:34.660]   handle all of the various administrative
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:36.140]   logistical tasks that are relevant to
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:36.860]   them because then we don't have
[00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:37.660]   to hire support staff.
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.260]   It's a chaotic haphazard world.
[00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.100]   And that creates overload.
[00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.060]   That creates busyness.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   The second reason why we feel that is,
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:46.380]   uh, we don't have a good
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:47.860]   definition of productivity.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.980]   So we, we, we create this new world of work.
[00:12:51.980 --> 00:12:54.620]   Create this new world of work in which
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:55.740]   you're using your mind instead of
[00:12:55.740 --> 00:12:57.900]   building things with your hands.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:12:59.140]   So we have to think what
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:00.540]   does productivity mean?
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:02.500]   And I'm talking now mid 20th century.
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:04.460]   What does productivity mean if we're
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.260]   not counting the time required
[00:13:07.260 --> 00:13:08.820]   to produce a Model T?
[00:13:08.820 --> 00:13:10.260]   What does it mean?
[00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.140]   Well, we leaned into industrial metaphors.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:13.460]   Why?
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.860]   Well, where were the first big offices?
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:18.940]   Where were the first big collections of
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.620]   hundreds or thousands of people in the
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:21.980]   same place doing work with their
[00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.980]   mind and not their hands?
[00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:24.740]   It was the front offices of
[00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.060]   large industrial corporations.
[00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.180]   The early 20th century, you get the
[00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:31.220]   rise of the mega corporation, you get
[00:13:31.220 --> 00:13:34.700]   the efficiencies of scale of acquiring
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:35.860]   competitors and building
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:37.220]   up very large companies.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:39.140]   This, this, this idea of the very large
[00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.940]   company emerges in the early 20th century.
[00:13:41.940 --> 00:13:44.220]   We, we, we see it, uh, with the, the
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.860]   robber barons, the late 19th century,
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:47.860]   early 20th century, by the 1940s, you
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.660]   have, you know, General Motors as this
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:51.820]   massive consolidated company that has
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.940]   all these different verticals.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.820]   Well, that requires a huge amount
[00:13:54.820 --> 00:13:56.060]   of administrative support.
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.540]   They were all put into the same big
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.180]   buildings there you have the first
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:01.300]   big knowledge worker setting.
[00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:04.020]   So of course, when the same CEO that is
[00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.860]   overlooking 700 clerical workers,
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.260]   administrative workers and managers is
[00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:12.220]   also overlooking industrial assembly
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.780]   lines, we're going to adopt by default
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:19.380]   industrial productivity metrics, effort,
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:22.380]   time spent working, uh, minimizing
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:23.700]   idleness, the things you would care
[00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.300]   about with an assembly line.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.580]   So we have adopted sort of by default,
[00:14:28.580 --> 00:14:29.820]   these industrial metrics.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:31.580]   And then as we begin to get some
[00:14:31.580 --> 00:14:33.820]   separation, we get the rise of knowledge
[00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:36.420]   work that's completely disconnected
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:37.580]   from industrial production.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.300]   We do have a chance to try to evolve
[00:14:39.300 --> 00:14:41.100]   our understanding of productivity, but
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.900]   then we get the computer revolution and
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.860]   it completely shakes up the whole
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.940]   proverbial snow globe.
[00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:48.540]   Suddenly we have networks and email and
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:50.020]   everything gets thrown up into the air.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.420]   Again, all these revolutions sort
[00:14:51.420 --> 00:14:52.860]   of get in the way the disruption gets
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:54.820]   in the way of maturity and stabilization
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:55.740]   of work philosophy.
[00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.540]   So we end up where we are today with
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:14:59.420]   this weird mix of industrial notions
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:00.900]   of productivity that's based around.
[00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:03.060]   You're a worker on an assembly line.
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:04.780]   And, uh, if you're idle,
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:05.700]   that's wasted money.
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.540]   I want you to be here for set hours
[00:15:07.540 --> 00:15:08.300]   and doing those hours.
[00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:10.180]   I want to see activity that mixed
[00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:11.980]   in with the haphazard freneticism
[00:15:11.980 --> 00:15:14.220]   of uncontrolled digital communication.
[00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:15.860]   And we get this weird world we have today.
[00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.660]   So we have these notions of
[00:15:17.660 --> 00:15:19.740]   productivity around, I can't see you're
[00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:21.740]   working, you're not productive.
[00:15:21.740 --> 00:15:23.220]   Maybe you're, you know, something's going
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:25.060]   on, you're screwing me, you know, idleness.
[00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:27.060]   And so we want you to be
[00:15:27.060 --> 00:15:27.980]   working for these hours.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:29.220]   We want to see that you're working.
[00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.860]   If you're not going to be in the office,
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:31.620]   then we want to see that you're
[00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:33.300]   responding to Slack and email because
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.460]   activity is value inactivity is wasted
[00:15:36.460 --> 00:15:37.660]   value, very old notion.
[00:15:37.660 --> 00:15:40.300]   So we need new notions of how do you
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.660]   productively create value in a skilled
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:43.740]   cognitive environment.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:44.980]   And that's where something like slow
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:46.700]   productivity is trying to fill a void.
[00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.180]   Let us evolve our notion of productivity
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.540]   away from what you would want with
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:53.020]   factory workers and towards something
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:54.260]   that actually makes sense.
[00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.620]   For people trying to add value to
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.140]   information using their mind.
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:00.820]   So it's an extreme example, three hours
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:04.340]   a day, and you have a Fields Medal by 39.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.860]   But the extremes are often great for
[00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:08.740]   highlighting the underlying realities.
[00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:13.500]   Busyness and overload is unrelated to
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.940]   producing things that actually matter.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.740]   Three hour Fields Medal.
[00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.700]   I saw something, Jesse.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:23.020]   Now I forgot who it was.
[00:16:23.020 --> 00:16:24.140]   I think a reader sent it to me.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:28.620]   Uh, it was a writer who has simplified
[00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.140]   their writing down to one day a week.
[00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:31.300]   Really?
[00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:31.540]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:32.940]   And they're a pretty productive writer.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:35.060]   It's a nonfiction.
[00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:37.180]   I forgot exactly what space he's in,
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.020]   but just one day a week he writes.
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:39.900]   I think it's Thursdays.
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:42.500]   And over time he's built up this like
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:44.140]   really nice collection of books that
[00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:44.700]   he's written.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:48.020]   I mean, again, overload, busyness, that
[00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:49.620]   sense of like, I don't have enough time.
[00:16:49.620 --> 00:16:52.660]   If anything gets in the way of producing
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.620]   stuff that matters, not the recipe for it.
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.860]   You like writing every day though, don't you?
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:57.740]   I do.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:58.660]   I've been writing in the morning.
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.620]   We, we finally have all the different
[00:17:01.620 --> 00:17:04.780]   workmen out of our study and my desk
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:06.460]   isn't there yet, but there's a table in there.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.940]   And so I go in there each morning and
[00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:09.660]   that's where I've been writing.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.980]   So like two hours a day?
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:12.020]   I'm trying to, yeah.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:12.660]   Two to three.
[00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:13.460]   Yeah.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:16.020]   I mean, I'm making progress on, here's
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:17.300]   my quick writing update.
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:19.380]   If you're interested, I'm working now in
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:21.660]   my slow productivity book that I'm writing
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:25.100]   on the, the principle about doing fewer
[00:17:25.100 --> 00:17:27.260]   things, looking like this is going to come
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:33.140]   in at a 15, 15 to 20 K word sections.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:34.620]   There's these three big sections, one's
[00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.780]   for each of the principles and they're
[00:17:35.780 --> 00:17:36.860]   going to be pretty big, maybe about
[00:17:36.860 --> 00:17:37.900]   15,000 words each.
[00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.940]   And I'm, I'd been stuck for a little
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:44.220]   while on this particular section.
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:46.260]   And I feel like I have some traction going.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:48.100]   And so that's what I've been working on.
[00:17:48.100 --> 00:17:50.260]   Uh, when I was on my trip, I was getting
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:54.060]   unstuck, which means figuring out what
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:56.300]   is my path through this particular section?
[00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:57.220]   What are the examples?
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.500]   How do I want to streamline this?
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.220]   I did not, I was trying to force what I
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.180]   had before to work and I had cognitive
[00:18:02.180 --> 00:18:04.340]   friction, I knew it wasn't working.
[00:18:04.340 --> 00:18:06.700]   The examples I wanted to use when I dive
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:08.180]   deeper into the source material, weren't
[00:18:08.180 --> 00:18:08.780]   what I wanted.
[00:18:08.780 --> 00:18:10.340]   Didn't seem like it's what I needed.
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.780]   Uh, and over this trip to Tennessee, I,
[00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:15.980]   I reworked it, I streamlined and now it's
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.300]   rolling, now it's rolling.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.140]   So I'm not far into the section I'm
[00:18:19.140 --> 00:18:21.540]   writing, but I have forward momentum.
[00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.540]   So, so hopefully I'll finish that up this week.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:25.540]   When you do your weekly plan, do you
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:27.940]   map out like what you're going to write
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:28.980]   about each day?
[00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:29.940]   Like for instance, cause you have your
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:31.540]   New Yorker stuff, you have your books, you
[00:18:31.540 --> 00:18:33.060]   have, yeah, I have to figure that out.
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:33.380]   Yeah.
[00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:34.380]   I have to, I mean, that's, that's what
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:34.940]   happened.
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:37.540]   I'm in a confusing writing landscape right
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:39.420]   now because I was, I had been working on
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.220]   this big principle of the book.
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.940]   Then I shifted over, uh, to a magazine
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.620]   piece, New Yorker piece that was going to
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:52.380]   serve double duty as a piece for the New
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:54.940]   Yorker, but also for a chapter earlier in
[00:18:54.940 --> 00:18:55.340]   the book.
[00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:59.580]   Then, uh, something else came along and it
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.260]   was sort of more of a topical article.
[00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:02.900]   I said, yeah, I want to short, let me
[00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:03.580]   write that.
[00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:05.580]   So like all of that got put on pause.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.580]   So I could, I wanted to write a shorter
[00:19:07.580 --> 00:19:08.540]   sort of topical piece.
[00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:11.620]   Um, and that was the week before my trip.
[00:19:11.620 --> 00:19:13.500]   So everything got put on pause for that,
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.860]   finished that, that's an editing.
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.940]   And then when I came back, now I'm close
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.820]   enough to finishing this principle that
[00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.060]   I'm, I'm going to do that and then turn
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:26.100]   back to finishing the original piece.
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:27.700]   I'm working on the details here.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:29.220]   Not that important.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:32.540]   The bigger point being, uh, Jesse's right
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:33.180]   to ask about that.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.220]   It's, it's a complicated picture of sort
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.060]   of concurrent writing things and moving
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:38.580]   around.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.580]   What am I going to work on now?
[00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.540]   Put this on side, put this on hold now.
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:42.260]   So I write this.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.380]   It's not always an obvious formula, how
[00:19:44.380 --> 00:19:45.620]   you make those decisions.
[00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.220]   And it's something that requires some
[00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:48.340]   thought, like right now, the way I'm
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:49.580]   thinking about it is because I'm in
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:50.900]   editing with this one.
[00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.940]   Uh, magazine piece.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:54.620]   I don't want to work on another magazine
[00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:56.700]   piece while I'm editing a current one.
[00:19:56.700 --> 00:19:58.380]   It's too close to home.
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.340]   We're going to cross the circuit.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.140]   So that's why I, while I'm editing this
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:02.980]   piece, I want to write, it's essentially
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.540]   more of an advice-y type section of my
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.580]   book, which is quite different.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.500]   So these are the type of chess
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:07.380]   pieces you move around.
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:09.100]   Um, yeah, but at the weekly planning
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:11.060]   stage, I'm thinking, what am I writing
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:11.500]   this week?
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:12.420]   Where am I going to try to get?
[00:20:12.420 --> 00:20:15.420]   And then, and what I like to, I like to
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.580]   get to the point where I can see a
[00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:19.300]   milestone coming up because then you can
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:20.980]   go after it like, oh, I want to get there
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:21.500]   by this weekend.
[00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:22.220]   And then you'll add extra
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.540]   hours and really push.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:24.820]   And when you're in the stages where
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:26.220]   you're planning and trying to make
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:27.660]   something work, you can feel like days
[00:20:27.660 --> 00:20:29.940]   are going by and not much progress is
[00:20:29.940 --> 00:20:31.500]   happening, but then when you start to see.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:33.220]   You have 5,000 words away from
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:34.340]   wrapping this whole thing up.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:36.380]   You see that finish line, then
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:37.420]   you can really lock in.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.100]   And it can be pretty, you get these
[00:20:39.100 --> 00:20:41.580]   really productive locked in sessions.
[00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.460]   But anyways, that's all just to give
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:45.340]   the impression of the writing life can
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:46.060]   be more complicated.
[00:20:46.060 --> 00:20:47.100]   It seems simple, but it can be
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:49.780]   complicated figuring out what I should
[00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.740]   be writing now is not always obvious.
[00:20:52.740 --> 00:20:55.620]   All right.
[00:20:55.620 --> 00:20:58.580]   Well, what is obvious is we should take
[00:20:58.580 --> 00:21:00.100]   a moment to thank a couple of sponsors
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.060]   that make this show possible and allow
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.100]   me to sit around and do nonsense
[00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:05.940]   like writing all day.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.700]   I want to start by talking
[00:21:07.700 --> 00:21:10.340]   about policy genius.
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:13.420]   Now, you know, you need life insurance.
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.300]   You need it to protect those who rely
[00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:21.300]   on you financially in the hopefully
[00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.780]   unlikely event that something happens to
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.060]   you, everyone knows they need life insurance.
[00:21:26.060 --> 00:21:29.700]   The issue seems to be logistics.
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:31.420]   You're someone my age, you say,
[00:21:31.420 --> 00:21:32.180]   I need life insurance.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.380]   You know, I have some kids, you know,
[00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:34.740]   whatever, and you say, but how do I,
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.380]   where do I do this?
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:36.220]   How do I do this?
[00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:37.620]   Where do I go to do this?
[00:21:37.620 --> 00:21:40.260]   Do I have to find that insurance agent?
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.620]   Do I call someone?
[00:21:41.620 --> 00:21:43.740]   That is usually the roadblock that stops
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.740]   people from doing what they know they need.
[00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.580]   This is where a company like policy
[00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.500]   genius enters the scene and makes it easy.
[00:21:52.500 --> 00:21:54.740]   Policy genius is an insurance
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.620]   comparison website that makes it easy
[00:21:56.620 --> 00:21:58.020]   to compare quotes from top companies
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:01.340]   like AIG and Prudential in one place
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:03.340]   to find your lowest price.
[00:22:03.340 --> 00:22:06.940]   You could save 50% or more on life
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:07.940]   insurance by comparing
[00:22:07.940 --> 00:22:09.860]   quotes with policy genius.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:13.180]   All you do is go to policy genius
[00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:16.540]   dot com and you will get personalized
[00:22:16.540 --> 00:22:18.940]   quotes in minutes to find the
[00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:21.260]   right policy for your needs.
[00:22:21.260 --> 00:22:23.300]   Now, keep in mind that licensed agents
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:24.700]   and policy genius work for you,
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:25.900]   not the insurance company.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:27.140]   So they're on hand throughout the
[00:22:27.140 --> 00:22:28.540]   entire process to help you understand
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:30.260]   your options and make decisions with.
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:31.700]   Confidence.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.580]   All right.
[00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:33.340]   So you need life insurance.
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:34.620]   Go to policygenius.com.
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.180]   You enter in your basic information
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.260]   and they show you a bunch of quotes
[00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:38.060]   from a bunch of companies.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:40.260]   I like this one the best boom.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.300]   You do it to the site you're set.
[00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:43.940]   So it gets rid of that obstacle of,
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:46.220]   I don't know where to start and helps
[00:22:46.220 --> 00:22:47.140]   you get that life insurance
[00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:48.620]   that you know you need.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:51.940]   Since 2014, more than 30 million people
[00:22:51.940 --> 00:22:53.780]   have shopped for insurance through
[00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.460]   policygenius.com so they
[00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:56.140]   know what they're doing.
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.380]   So head to policygenius.com to get
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:22:59.780]   your free life insurance quotes and
[00:22:59.780 --> 00:23:02.420]   see how much you could save.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:04.020]   All right.
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:06.460]   We also have a new sponsor to the show.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:07.340]   Happy to have them.
[00:23:07.340 --> 00:23:11.100]   And that is Miracle.
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:14.300]   We are in those summer months.
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:16.460]   That means it is hotter.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:18.340]   That means there is humidity.
[00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:20.340]   We've talked about this on the show
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:23.700]   before those hot sleepers among us.
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:25.820]   Worry about trying to get
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:27.420]   sleep when it is warmer.
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.180]   You don't want to be all sweaty.
[00:23:28.180 --> 00:23:29.340]   You don't want to be all sticky.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:31.700]   This is where Miracle Brands
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:36.340]   self-cooling bed sheets enter the picture.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:39.540]   These are sheets that have self-cooling
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:40.740]   properties built into them.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:42.620]   They use silver infused fabrics
[00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.700]   originally developed by NASA.
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:46.060]   Miracle Brand sheets are
[00:23:46.060 --> 00:23:47.740]   thermoregulating and designed to
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:48.700]   keep you at the perfect
[00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.380]   temperature all night long.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.020]   So you will get better sleep every night.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.660]   Now that natural silver that is infused
[00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.180]   in there also prevents 99.9% of
[00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.300]   bacterial growth, leaving them cleaner
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:04.220]   and fresher more than three times
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:06.100]   longer than standard sheets.
[00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:08.100]   They are premium sheets.
[00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.260]   We're talking 500 thread count
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:12.540]   sateen weave all made with
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:15.260]   USA grown Sapima cotton.
[00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:18.540]   So these are these sheets for summer.
[00:24:18.540 --> 00:24:19.620]   They're comfortable.
[00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:21.660]   They're self-regulating the temperature.
[00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:26.580]   They are resistant to bacterial growth.
[00:24:26.580 --> 00:24:29.140]   They last longer before you need to wash them.
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.060]   Makes sense to me.
[00:24:31.060 --> 00:24:38.820]   So go to trymiracle.com/cal to try it today.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.860]   And we've got a special offer

[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:15.940]   All right, we have to add to our
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:18.700]   our tongue twister ad read, Jesse.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:21.140]   I think free three piece towel set.
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:23.980]   We can add that on to Zocdoc.com.
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.060]   I like that.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.780]   Yeah, you can get your free three piece
[00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:30.820]   towel set on the way to Zocdoc.com.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:31.940]   So there we go.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:33.860]   All professional reads here.
[00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:36.900]   All right, enough of that nonsense.
[00:25:36.900 --> 00:25:37.900]   Let's do some questions.
[00:25:37.900 --> 00:25:41.420]   Question number one comes from Micah.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:44.460]   Micah says, what do you think about
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:47.340]   planning two weeks instead of one?
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:49.860]   A single week seems like a
[00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.620]   very short time span for me.
[00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:53.460]   Maybe it's because my planning sessions
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:55.060]   take too long for them to happen weekly.
[00:25:55.060 --> 00:25:56.180]   Do you think it's plausible to
[00:25:56.180 --> 00:25:58.860]   plan two weeks instead of one?
[00:25:58.860 --> 00:26:01.260]   Well, Micah, it's plausible, but it's
[00:26:01.260 --> 00:26:03.140]   not necessarily my recommendation.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.540]   The reason planning one week is
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.180]   taking so long is because it's difficult.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.060]   Planning is difficult to try to get
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:12.660]   your arms around the rhythms and
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:14.380]   patterns of obligations that are
[00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:15.860]   happening in the week ahead to look
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:17.620]   at that calendar and see which days
[00:26:17.620 --> 00:26:19.300]   are more busy than others to work
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:20.540]   at your quarterly plan and get a
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:22.300]   sense of where you are in your
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.740]   bigger picture initiatives.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:26.020]   Which of these initiatives you
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:27.300]   have the right room to make
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.860]   progress on, which ones you don't.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.860]   This takes a while because it's complicated.
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:33.260]   You expand that scope to two weeks.
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.420]   It becomes even more complicated.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.660]   That's a, that's a bigger challenge.
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:39.380]   If you're having a hard time scheduling
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:41.180]   one, you might have a really
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:44.060]   hard time scheduling two.
[00:26:44.060 --> 00:26:46.540]   So what you might focus on instead,
[00:26:46.540 --> 00:26:48.660]   Micah, is reducing the footprint of
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.940]   the planning you're doing to make
[00:26:49.940 --> 00:26:52.260]   it seem more reasonable as opposed
[00:26:52.260 --> 00:26:53.500]   to planning less often, but making
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   that planning even harder.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.700]   There's a few things you can do to
[00:26:57.700 --> 00:26:59.980]   reduce the footprint of weekly planning.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:02.340]   One, less detail.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.740]   Perhaps your weekly plans are too fiddly.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:08.140]   So in particular, if you find yourself
[00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.620]   getting pretty specific about
[00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:13.180]   particular times on particular days
[00:27:13.180 --> 00:27:14.700]   that you're going to do particular work
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.100]   during the weekly plan process, that
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:18.820]   is, if you were implicitly time-block
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:20.820]   planning your entire week, your level
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:22.180]   of detail is too fine grained.
[00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:24.540]   You want to pull back from that.
[00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.060]   Have some faith that the future you
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.940]   doing daily time-block planning on
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:32.620]   future days this week will be able
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.500]   to figure out what to work on
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:35.260]   and what to make sense.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.180]   You want less detail.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:37.580]   You might say, "This is a week I
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:39.380]   want to make progress on this chapter.
[00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:40.780]   We're focusing on this report."
[00:27:40.780 --> 00:27:42.420]   Or you might point out a particular
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.500]   day, "Thursday is light.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:44.420]   Let's keep it light.
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:45.740]   That'll be the day that I want to
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.060]   try to finish up the Johnson memo."
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.340]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:27:49.340 --> 00:27:51.140]   But if you're saying, "Okay, 10 to
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:54.940]   1130 on Wednesday, that's when I am
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:57.100]   going to work on 700 words from this
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:58.540]   project," you're getting too fiddly,
[00:27:58.540 --> 00:27:59.660]   and that's going to take up too much
[00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:00.940]   time, so less detail.
[00:28:00.940 --> 00:28:02.340]   The second thing you can do to
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:06.060]   reduce the footprint, separate inbox
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.660]   cleaning from the weekly planning.
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:10.780]   So a lot of people do this and it
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:12.700]   makes sense to get you ready for the
[00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.980]   week, you go through and you clean
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:16.300]   out all your inboxes so that you're
[00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:17.860]   starting from a blank slate.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:20.340]   It's not a bad idea, but it takes a long
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:22.020]   time, but not only takes a long time,
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.660]   it's cognitively draining because you
[00:28:24.660 --> 00:28:26.860]   have to context shift back and forth,
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:28.380]   back and forth, like a screen door in
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:29.820]   the breeze when you're cleaning through
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.500]   an inbox, there are so many different
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:33.540]   messages and they represent so many
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.100]   different unrelated obligations.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.660]   It's an incredibly draining experience.
[00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:37.820]   It was time consuming and
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:38.900]   cognitively draining.
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.660]   If you attach that to the weekly
[00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.060]   planning where you're literally writing
[00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:44.620]   your weekly plan for the week, the whole
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.060]   thing becomes a long drawn out, exhausting
[00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:50.340]   exercise, so separate the inbox cleaning.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.340]   Do your weekly planning separately.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.260]   The inbox cleaning, you can then spread
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:55.940]   out in various sessions early throughout
[00:28:55.940 --> 00:28:58.060]   your week, or you can do your weekly
[00:28:58.060 --> 00:29:01.460]   planning on Friday at the end of the day
[00:29:01.460 --> 00:29:02.940]   and maybe start Monday with the inbox
[00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:04.980]   cleaning, but separate those two things.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:06.540]   And that last suggestion is my third
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:08.820]   suggestion, do the weekly plan at the
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:10.380]   end of your day, Friday, as opposed to
[00:29:10.380 --> 00:29:13.580]   the beginning of your day, Monday, and
[00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.420]   it will feel less like it is getting in
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.460]   the way of you getting started and more
[00:29:20.460 --> 00:29:23.260]   like you're wrapping up a long and
[00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:25.140]   productive week and in your final hours
[00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:26.780]   or Friday, you're, you're tying up loose
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.020]   ends and getting things ready for the
[00:29:28.020 --> 00:29:30.980]   week ahead, Friday planning for the week
[00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:32.900]   ahead also gives you the advantage of a
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:36.180]   lower anxiety weekend because you, you
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:37.660]   know, you're locked in for what's going
[00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:38.020]   to happen.
[00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.260]   You know, you have a plan.
[00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.460]   It gives you some clarity, allows
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.500]   you to actually step back and relax
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.380]   more during the weekend.
[00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.020]   So it's a psychological trick.
[00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.500]   I mean, the time is the time, but a 30
[00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   minutes spent weekly planning Friday at
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:55.260]   three does not feel like it's getting in
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:58.540]   the way 30 minutes spent Monday at nine 30
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:30:00.500]   feels like, okay, I have all these things
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:01.660]   to do and not getting into any of them
[00:30:01.660 --> 00:30:03.140]   because of the planning same time,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.700]   different impact depending on when you
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:06.100]   spend it.
[00:30:06.100 --> 00:30:08.780]   Do you put personal reading
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:10.860]   blocks in your weekly plan?
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:13.500]   That'd be like daily time blocking.
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:16.860]   If I'm going to do reading during the
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:18.300]   workday, which I think is a good thing to
[00:30:18.300 --> 00:30:19.180]   do, it's a great break.
[00:30:19.180 --> 00:30:19.980]   I'll time block it.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:22.980]   Uh, if it's after work, I don't time
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.620]   block after work.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:24.820]   It's just a kind of a default.
[00:30:25.060 --> 00:30:26.020]   You kind of just know you're going to
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:26.780]   read every day anyway.
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:27.460]   Just like reading.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.620]   Like the fine time to read.
[00:30:28.620 --> 00:30:29.500]   I was reading this morning.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.780]   I'm reading a great Ben Franklin biography.
[00:30:32.780 --> 00:30:34.020]   I always read something about the family
[00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:36.340]   fathers starting the first week in
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:37.660]   July because of July 4th.
[00:30:37.660 --> 00:30:38.900]   I've been watching some of that
[00:30:38.900 --> 00:30:40.460]   PBS episode on Franklin.
[00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:40.980]   Yeah.
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:43.060]   Well, so one of the main books that's,
[00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:45.900]   that's based on is, is a HW Brands,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:48.780]   Lincoln biogra or a Franklin biography,
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.420]   which was a finalist for the Pulitzer.
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.260]   Like that's the book, that book opens in
[00:30:52.260 --> 00:30:55.180]   the cockpit, just like the Ken Burns
[00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:56.060]   opens in the cockpit.
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.700]   I didn't realize he spent so much time in
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:59.420]   London.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.540]   Yeah.
[00:31:00.540 --> 00:31:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:31:01.380 --> 00:31:02.620]   Once he's there for a long time, he's
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:03.460]   thinking about moving there.
[00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:04.660]   He's there forever.
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.620]   That's the thing about Franklin.
[00:31:06.620 --> 00:31:07.940]   It's same with like John Adams.
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.180]   If you watch like the John Adams mini
[00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:12.260]   series, it gets up the declaration
[00:31:12.260 --> 00:31:13.980]   independence, like, all right, here we go.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:15.100]   Revolutionary war.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.580]   And he's in London with Franklin actually.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.620]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.260]   So I'm in the cool part of the book, like
[00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:21.740]   the interesting part of Franklin's life,
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:26.100]   where he, he stops work 43 years old.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.220]   He's like, I've made enough money.
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.220]   My partner, David Hall is going to run
[00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:30.260]   the printing business.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:32.020]   I get half the, half the revenue.
[00:31:32.020 --> 00:31:34.420]   Uh, I now have, and I have the quote,
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:36.300]   I have it in my bag.
[00:31:36.300 --> 00:31:37.540]   I bookmarked it.
[00:31:37.540 --> 00:31:39.820]   It was like, I now have control of my time.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.260]   And he goes and it says, I'm
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.180]   going to work on science.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.780]   And that's when he figures out the
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:47.580]   properties of electricity and the
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:49.220]   lightning rod and becomes world famous
[00:31:49.220 --> 00:31:49.860]   for doing science.
[00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:52.700]   So at 43 years old or 42 years old, he
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:54.380]   retires from the world of work so he can
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:57.580]   focus on, uh, higher value productions.
[00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.900]   And, you know, he breaks through the study
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:04.740]   of electricity and helps create the Republic.
[00:32:04.740 --> 00:32:05.220]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.020]   So it's cool.
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:07.460]   But then he goes to London, spends a lot
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:07.820]   of time there.
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:09.020]   I know that it's a cool guy.
[00:32:09.020 --> 00:32:10.180]   He's interesting guy.
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.340]   It's an interesting documentary.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:13.980]   He did a lot of metric tracking when he was
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:14.340]   younger.
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.020 --> 00:32:18.340]   Metric, one of the earliest American sort
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.260]   of advice thinkers.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.300]   I mean, there's a lot that's interesting
[00:32:20.300 --> 00:32:21.820]   in it and it's a really well-written book.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.820]   Uh, and I've been, I've been enjoying it.
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:24.940]   But anyways, my point being is like this
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:27.340]   morning, I was up a little early.
[00:32:27.340 --> 00:32:28.940]   It's like, I'm going to read some Franklin.
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.780]   You know, it's just, it becomes a
[00:32:30.780 --> 00:32:32.140]   default, default activity.
[00:32:32.140 --> 00:32:34.340]   All right.
[00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:38.740]   Question number two, Soronolio, see
[00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:41.740]   if I'm saying that right, asks, how can I
[00:32:41.740 --> 00:32:44.820]   brainwash my little brother to make him
[00:32:44.820 --> 00:32:46.180]   not follow his passion?
[00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:50.060]   My little brother is currently 17 and in
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.780]   some months he will be choosing a college
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.060]   degree.
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:54.100]   My concern is that he falls in the follow
[00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:56.900]   your passion trap and chooses a worthless
[00:32:56.900 --> 00:32:58.740]   degree that puts him in the way to be a
[00:32:58.740 --> 00:32:59.700]   basement dweller.
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.700]   10 years ago when I was his age, I fell in
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.700]   that passion trap and I lost two years of my
[00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:06.740]   life in useless classes and activities.
[00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:08.100]   How can I make a compelling argument to
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.860]   him so that he doesn't fall for this fairy
[00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.180]   tale?
[00:33:12.180 --> 00:33:15.940]   And for those who are new to the show, uh,
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:18.180]   Soronolio has asked me this question
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:19.660]   because of my book, So Good They Can't
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.700]   Ignore You, which takes on the idea that
[00:33:22.700 --> 00:33:24.380]   follow your passion is good advice and
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:26.140]   offers alternatives instead.
[00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:27.180]   So this is something I've thought and
[00:33:27.180 --> 00:33:28.620]   written quite a lot about.
[00:33:28.620 --> 00:33:29.340]   All right.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:30.500]   So I got some thoughts for you.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:34.060]   Uh, first I would say, this is just
[00:33:34.060 --> 00:33:39.100]   foundationally, uh, you need your brother
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.220]   in the end to choose what he studies for
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.340]   his own reasons.
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.420]   There's a, there's a motivational
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:47.220]   psychology explanation for this, but,
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:50.340]   but essentially the affliction I saw again
[00:33:50.340 --> 00:33:53.660]   and again, back when I was advising students
[00:33:53.660 --> 00:33:55.660]   much more often back when I was writing
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.420]   books for students and therefore got
[00:33:57.420 --> 00:33:59.380]   hundreds of emails a week from students
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.820]   and did direct one-on-one counseling.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:02.660]   And affliction I saw again and again is
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:04.940]   what I dubbed deep procrastination.
[00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:07.540]   This is when students essentially lost the
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:10.300]   motivational ability to do schoolwork, even
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:12.220]   if they were going to fail out of the
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.260]   classes, even if they had to take
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:17.300]   administrative or academic leave, they
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.500]   just couldn't do schoolwork anymore.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:22.500]   I call this deep procrastination was
[00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:25.460]   differentiated from depression because
[00:34:25.460 --> 00:34:27.580]   they were not a hedonic, they still
[00:34:27.580 --> 00:34:29.740]   enjoyed other parts of their lives and
[00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:31.700]   could foresee a future in which they
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:32.580]   were doing things they enjoy.
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:33.740]   They just couldn't do schoolwork.
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:37.140]   One of the big predicting factors of
[00:34:37.140 --> 00:34:39.180]   deep procrastination was a sense of
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.340]   extrinsic pressure on what they were studying.
[00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:44.100]   So when you combine the extrinsic
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:47.540]   pressure, my, my parents, my brother,
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.620]   whatever, pushed me into something to
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.140]   study, when you combine that with that
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:53.140]   actually being difficult, the actual
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:55.620]   cognitive difficulty of doing high-level
[00:34:55.620 --> 00:34:58.740]   schoolwork, those two things could fry
[00:34:58.740 --> 00:34:59.780]   your motivational circuits and
[00:34:59.780 --> 00:35:00.980]   create deep procrastination.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:02.820]   The way out of that is to have
[00:35:02.820 --> 00:35:04.580]   intrinsic motivation behind the
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:05.860]   choice of what you study.
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:08.140]   So I chose it for my reasons.
[00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:09.660]   You sidestep a lot of these
[00:35:09.660 --> 00:35:11.260]   motivational challenges.
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.220]   And even if you're not going to get
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.660]   full deep procrastination, it really
[00:35:13.660 --> 00:35:16.740]   can make, uh, the same factors can
[00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:17.780]   make academic life a chore.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:18.860]   So you want to avoid those.
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:21.020]   So what you need to do is focus on
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.420]   process and philosophy and
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:23.140]   talking with your brother.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:24.700]   Hey, brother, you're going to
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:26.060]   decide what you want to do, but let
[00:35:26.060 --> 00:35:27.820]   me talk to you about process and
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:31.060]   philosophy you might apply in
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.140]   making this decision.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:34.980]   So there's three things I want
[00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:35.700]   you to cover with them.
[00:35:35.700 --> 00:35:38.620]   One is lifestyle centric career planning.
[00:35:38.620 --> 00:35:40.820]   So you want to get away from this weird
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.420]   notion of you're wired for a particular.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:48.220]   Field of study and finding that is
[00:35:48.220 --> 00:35:49.740]   going to make you happy and missing.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:50.980]   That's going to make you unhappy.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.340]   You got to get away from that weird,
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:53.740]   completely artificial binary
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.380]   formulation and get towards something
[00:35:56.380 --> 00:35:57.820]   that's much more tractable and
[00:35:57.820 --> 00:35:59.020]   lifestyle centric career planning is
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:00.220]   a better way of thinking about it.
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:02.100]   What do you want your life to be like
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.820]   after college for the first five years?
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:06.420]   10 years out, 15 years out.
[00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:08.540]   What are the elements of your lifestyle?
[00:36:08.540 --> 00:36:09.980]   And again, intellectual curiosity,
[00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:11.980]   that could be a part of it being
[00:36:11.980 --> 00:36:14.300]   exposed or literate or things that
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.340]   might be attracting him now to particular.
[00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:19.340]   Uh, say non-pragmatic degrees is fine.
[00:36:19.340 --> 00:36:20.580]   That could be part of it, but picture
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:22.420]   the lifestyle where you live, who you're
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.780]   around, what the environment's like,
[00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:24.780]   what's your days like, what's
[00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:25.940]   your intellectual life like, what's
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.700]   your philosophical life like all these
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:29.940]   things, you have it all pictured out.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.100]   And then you look back and say, okay,
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:34.700]   college is just a springboard towards.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.780]   A lifestyle.
[00:36:35.780 --> 00:36:37.300]   And it's an important distinction.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:39.460]   If you come at someone and say, no,
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:40.740]   no, no college is a springboard.
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.060]   It's just about, uh, particular
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:45.620]   jobs and money, stable employment.
[00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:48.100]   This does not resonate with 17 year olds.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:49.700]   You got to talk about the whole lifestyle
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.940]   that has the pragmatic and the romantic.
[00:36:51.940 --> 00:36:55.140]   That has the paycheck, but
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:36:56.460]   also the philosophical.
[00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.940]   So you want the picture of lifestyle
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:00.860]   that's very, that resonates.
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.580]   Thinking about benefits and how big
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:05.060]   your paycheck is doesn't resonate.
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.060]   So it's not gonna be as motivational.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.060]   So you want the full lifestyle.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:08.460]   So when you're thinking about what
[00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:09.860]   you're telling your brother is, you're
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.900]   thinking about your field of study.
[00:37:10.900 --> 00:37:12.100]   You want to think about what this might
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:14.060]   open up and how it could move you, the
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:15.660]   options it might give you, and you want
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:16.780]   multiple options of moving
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:18.140]   towards this ideal lifestyle.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.180]   Right.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.780]   Number two, hand in hand with lifestyle
[00:37:20.780 --> 00:37:23.220]   centered career planning is career.
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:24.740]   Capital theory.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:27.100]   The main theoretical framework
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:28.100]   that's laid out in my book.
[00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:28.420]   So good.
[00:37:28.420 --> 00:37:29.460]   They can't ignore you.
[00:37:29.460 --> 00:37:32.540]   This is the theory that says the stuff
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:35.420]   that makes good work good is rare and
[00:37:35.420 --> 00:37:36.540]   valuable, so you need something rare
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.980]   and valuable to offer in return.
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:40.060]   And that's going to be your skills.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:42.660]   The universe doesn't care what
[00:37:42.660 --> 00:37:43.340]   you're interested in.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:44.620]   It doesn't care what your passion is.
[00:37:44.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   It doesn't care about your
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:48.020]   image of an ideal lifestyle.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:49.380]   It doesn't owe that to you.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:51.340]   You need things to leverage.
[00:37:51.340 --> 00:37:53.580]   You need things to trade in return for
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.180]   getting these things you highly desire.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:55.740]   And that's going to be
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:56.820]   rare and valuable skills.
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.300]   And we call this, we used the metaphor
[00:37:58.300 --> 00:38:00.140]   in the book of career capital.
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.820]   It's an important mindset shift.
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.180]   So now when you're in college, you're
[00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:05.660]   thinking about laying the foundation
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:07.300]   for career capital acquisition, which
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:11.460]   you will then use to obtain these ideal
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:13.060]   lifestyles that you have pictured.
[00:38:13.060 --> 00:38:15.540]   Now, again, it sounds similar
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:16.980]   to the standard cynical.
[00:38:16.980 --> 00:38:20.460]   College is the route to making money
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:22.300]   and having stability, but it's different.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:24.580]   Because if you tell a 17 year old, what
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:25.660]   you're trying to do with college is to
[00:38:25.660 --> 00:38:27.580]   get started on a good, reasonable career
[00:38:27.580 --> 00:38:29.020]   with high upsides, so you can make a lot
[00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.620]   of money that doesn't resonate.
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:31.580]   But if you say, what you're trying to do
[00:38:31.580 --> 00:38:33.060]   here is put your head down and build skills.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:34.300]   You can trade those skills to get this
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:36.100]   ideal lifestyle, which might be exotic,
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:38.220]   which might be romantic, that does resonate.
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.540]   Then finally, I'm going to say point your
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:44.020]   brother towards some of my early writings.
[00:38:44.020 --> 00:38:46.740]   I can have three particular topics
[00:38:46.740 --> 00:38:47.700]   you should point them towards.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:51.180]   So on my, my blog, calnewport.com/blog,
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:52.460]   go back to the archives.
[00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:56.260]   I'm talking '08, '09, and look up the
[00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.260]   articles on the Zen valedictorian.
[00:38:58.260 --> 00:39:01.420]   This will present a philosophy to him
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:06.220]   about excelling academically without falling
[00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:09.260]   into the trap of overload while in the
[00:39:09.260 --> 00:39:11.060]   archives also look for the articles on the
[00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:14.500]   romantic scholar, which is all about how to
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:17.900]   build up a collegiate life in which you feel.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:20.220]   Intellectually engaged and curious and
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.020]   motivated and really into the work you're
[00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:23.500]   doing, it doesn't seem like a chore, but
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.060]   part of your development as a human.
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:28.420]   That's where you go to talks and, and read
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:31.220]   Heidegger over Hefeweizen at a bar and, and
[00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:32.740]   all these different ideas about how you
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.500]   actually integrate academic life into
[00:39:34.500 --> 00:39:36.380]   your self identity and not see it as a
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:38.740]   chore and then finally have them look at
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:40.420]   my book, how to become a straight A student.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:44.460]   Most young people are terrible at studying.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:46.220]   If you're not terrible by comparison,
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:47.380]   you'll seem like a genius.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:50.300]   That book has the main ideas about how to
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.540]   treat studying like a skill and not just
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:54.260]   some generic activity you suffer through.
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.340]   That will make all the difference in
[00:39:56.340 --> 00:39:58.700]   terms of being able to stand out, start
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:00.260]   building that capital you need to get
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.580]   your ideal lifestyle and to do all of that
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:05.660]   without having to study for hours and hours.
[00:40:05.660 --> 00:40:06.660]   Every day.
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:10.100]   When you read Heidegger, can you get through it?
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.980]   No, it just, it's alliterative with Hefeweizen.
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.860]   So I wrote this, I don't know a lot of Heidegger.
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:16.620]   Have you tried?
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:18.860]   I mean, I've tried because I've talked
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:21.620]   about it for a long time and my buddy had
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:23.500]   a book, he gave it to me and I know it's
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:24.060]   really hard.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:25.100]   Heidegger is really hard.
[00:40:25.100 --> 00:40:27.140]   I mean, I come back to him sometimes because
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:29.980]   he, he has some thoughts on technology,
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:31.220]   capital T technology.
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:33.540]   Uh, but when you really get into the weeds
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:37.220]   of being B E I N G and his core philosophies,
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:38.700]   it's, it's incredibly, it's incredibly
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.660]   difficult, but I wrote this essay in grad
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:43.500]   school where the idea of the essay was just,
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:45.020]   I had all these different things you should
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:49.820]   do as a college student to make a study of
[00:40:49.820 --> 00:40:51.900]   intellectual topics, seem romantic and
[00:40:51.900 --> 00:40:53.340]   interesting and something you enjoy, as
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.140]   opposed to seeing schoolwork as this chore
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.060]   that you had to suffer through.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:57.180]   And there's all sorts of ideas like
[00:40:57.180 --> 00:40:59.700]   adventure studying, like go, go to like
[00:40:59.700 --> 00:41:02.300]   exotic places, go read the row by a
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:04.340]   waterfall, don't just do it in the library.
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.140]   There was start attending talks by
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:09.340]   professors in your subject area for no
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:10.700]   other reason than you just want to be
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:13.060]   exposed to the ideas, read books about
[00:41:13.060 --> 00:41:14.780]   your field for no reason other than just
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:15.860]   to read it, like all these things that
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:18.380]   trick your mind into thinking like, this
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:20.540]   is something I'm really interested in.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.060]   Well, one of the ideas I had was go to,
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.340]   I was thinking of Oxford, I'm thinking of
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.300]   CS Lewis and JR Tolkien, and they all went
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.620]   to the same pub and they'd have these
[00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.660]   literary conversations, like go to a,
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:35.620]   you know, an old wood panel bar to read
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.380]   philosophy, you know, and, and, and with a
[00:41:38.380 --> 00:41:39.780]   pint, like very British.
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.580]   And then you feel like you're engaging
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:43.580]   the philosophy as part of trying to
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:44.940]   improve your wife, life.
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:46.140]   Anyways, I needed alliteration.
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.100]   So Heidegger, Hefeweizen.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:49.140]   I like it.
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.060]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:53.900]   I guess we could do like Plato and
[00:41:53.900 --> 00:41:56.380]   Pilsner kind of works, not to say
[00:41:56.380 --> 00:41:57.660]   Heidegger and Hefeweizen.
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:58.740]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:41:59.100]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.620 --> 00:42:01.900]   Uh, and there was a bar, shout out the
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:03.500]   Murphy's in Hanover, New Hampshire, where
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.740]   Dartmouth is, and they used to serve a,
[00:42:06.740 --> 00:42:07.780]   what was the Hefeweizen?
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:11.180]   Harpoon had a summer, had a wheat beer.
[00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.260]   I think Harpoon did, they would serve it.
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:14.180]   And it was a memories of.
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:15.220]   There's Allagash.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:16.740]   They didn't have that then.
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.260]   This was back when there wasn't as
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:19.540]   much New England beer, but I do remember
[00:42:19.540 --> 00:42:21.420]   drinking Hefeweizens at this wood panel bar.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:22.380]   So that's probably where that came from.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.460]   All right, let's do a call, Jesse.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.500]   Do we have something here?
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:25.940]   Yep.
[00:42:25.940 --> 00:42:26.380]   All right.
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:28.260]   Fellow professor.
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:33.180]   Hi, my name is Emily.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.420]   I'm a professor at a university similar to yours.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:38.020]   I'm interested in your thoughts on
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.820]   improvement and deliberate practice for
[00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:41.780]   skills when the output is rare and
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.100]   the feedback loop is weak.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.540]   For instance, one of my major tasks as a
[00:42:45.540 --> 00:42:47.180]   researcher is grant writing, and I'd
[00:42:47.180 --> 00:42:48.220]   like to improve on that.
[00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.500]   But I spend, you know, three months
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.180]   writing a grant and then I get reviews
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:53.580]   back maybe five months later.
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:55.700]   The reviews are going to be very
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:56.820]   different than what I'm used to.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:58.860]   The reviews are going to be highly
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:01.500]   specific to that project, also fairly
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:03.260]   arbitrary based on what reviewers I get.
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:05.900]   Of course, I incorporate any feedback I
[00:43:05.900 --> 00:43:08.620]   get into revision and I try to take
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:10.100]   general patterns into account.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:12.820]   But it's difficult for me to see how I
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.100]   can, you know, day to day improve
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:16.180]   incrementally.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.980]   People always say, oh, deliberate
[00:43:17.980 --> 00:43:18.500]   practice.
[00:43:18.500 --> 00:43:20.420]   But what would that mean for an outcome
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.540]   like this where it's binary, essentially
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.500]   you're funded or you're not and you get
[00:43:24.500 --> 00:43:25.700]   feedback twice a year?
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:28.140]   Of course, I ask for feedback from my
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:30.140]   collaborators, but that's a mixed bag.
[00:43:30.140 --> 00:43:32.380]   It's usually not harsh enough, honestly.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:35.540]   I have somewhat of the same issues for,
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:37.340]   you know, writing academic papers and
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:39.660]   teaching where you get reviews back a
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.540]   little more often, but still maybe once
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.380]   a semester or after three months.
[00:43:44.380 --> 00:43:46.620]   And so I'm just wondering if you have
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.260]   any ideas about how to improve as a
[00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:49.740]   professor.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:52.700]   Well, you know, first of all, let me
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:54.180]   just say I'm in.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:55.900]   I've been a professional academic for
[00:43:55.900 --> 00:43:57.700]   over a decade now and I've been dealing
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.620]   with this issue for all of those years.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:03.980]   The feedback cycle in academia, as you
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:07.540]   point out, is slow, often six months to a
[00:44:07.540 --> 00:44:09.460]   year on any particular piece of work
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:09.780]   product.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.780]   So it is slow.
[00:44:10.780 --> 00:44:13.060]   It is slow and that's kind of
[00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:13.860]   unavoidable, right?
[00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.540]   I mean, you're not gonna be able to
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.140]   speed that up.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:19.260]   So what can you do in this situation to
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:22.100]   try to use feedback to improve going
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:22.660]   forward?
[00:44:23.300 --> 00:44:25.700]   I'll tell you the three ideas that I
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.020]   came up with when I was thinking about
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:27.300]   this.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:28.660]   Things I do.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.060]   One is I try to have submissions,
[00:44:32.060 --> 00:44:33.820]   whether we're talking about grants or
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:35.580]   whether we're talking about academic
[00:44:35.580 --> 00:44:36.180]   papers.
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.900]   To me, these are really the two big
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:41.980]   value bearing work products that you're
[00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:43.940]   going to do as a, as an academic at a
[00:44:43.940 --> 00:44:45.580]   research oriented institution, have
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.060]   something submitted every semester.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:50.940]   So you want to be submitting at least
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:51.860]   one thing in the fall.
[00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:53.020]   You want to be submitting at least one
[00:44:53.020 --> 00:44:53.700]   thing in the spring.
[00:44:53.700 --> 00:44:54.900]   You want to be submitting at least one
[00:44:54.900 --> 00:44:55.860]   thing in the summer.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:57.700]   What this will roughly work out to is
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:44:59.180]   that you never go through a semester in
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.660]   which you're not getting feedback on
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:01.180]   something.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:04.500]   So if it's at least one thing per season
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:05.780]   or semester, you're going to have
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:08.380]   feedback to act on, to work with.
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:09.660]   You're never too far from it.
[00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:12.780]   So do not, as a counter example,
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:15.100]   consolidate all your submissions, for
[00:45:15.100 --> 00:45:16.100]   example, to the summer.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:18.100]   Like I'll work on things all year, but
[00:45:18.100 --> 00:45:20.260]   I'm, as I get time, then I'll submit it
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:20.780]   all in the summer.
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.940]   Spread out your, spread out your
[00:45:22.940 --> 00:45:23.340]   submissions.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:24.900]   And I actually work, especially with
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:28.940]   papers, I work through my submission
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:31.060]   calendars because I, in CS we publish
[00:45:31.060 --> 00:45:32.540]   in peer reviewed conferences that have
[00:45:32.540 --> 00:45:33.500]   set deadlines.
[00:45:33.500 --> 00:45:36.500]   So we have a good distribution of
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.140]   conferences I submit to based on where
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.860]   they fall in the year for exactly that
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:41.140]   point.
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:43.820]   Two, because the feedback cycle is so
[00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:48.340]   long, you don't want to take random
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:48.740]   swings.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:50.180]   You don't want to take flyers on things.
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:52.380]   You want every swing you take
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:55.100]   metaphorically speaking to be an A
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:45:55.500]   swing.
[00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.180]   You want to be really trying to do
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:45:59.980]   something worth doing with everything
[00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.140]   you bother submitting.
[00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.180]   So that means if you're submitting
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:03.620]   grants, you're submitting grants for
[00:46:03.620 --> 00:46:05.140]   the top funding institutions.
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.260]   When you're submitting papers, you're
[00:46:06.260 --> 00:46:09.100]   submitting papers at good venues on
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:11.300]   topics that have a good shot of
[00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:12.940]   attracting citations.
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:17.460]   Just as an aside, based on the research
[00:46:17.460 --> 00:46:19.060]   I did in computer science, I did this
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:19.420]   research.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:20.380]   I've talked about this on the show.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.620]   I've talked about this on my blog, right?
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:23.700]   I took a bunch of new professors who
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:25.260]   had come from the same research groups
[00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:27.060]   and differentiated between those who
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:28.900]   got tenure easily and those who didn't
[00:46:28.900 --> 00:46:30.340]   and looked at a lot of factors to see
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.420]   what differentiated them.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:33.300]   And the biggest differentiating factor
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:35.540]   predicting the early tenure and
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.700]   success with tenure was number of
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:38.460]   citations on their top five papers.
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.980]   So what you want is everything you're
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.060]   submitting is really a good A swing
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:43.180]   towards producing something
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:45.020]   influential that people will cite.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:46.460]   It's making progress on a problem
[00:46:46.460 --> 00:46:48.020]   people care about, or if it's
[00:46:48.020 --> 00:46:49.260]   introducing a new problem, it's
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:51.020]   making a really good case for it.
[00:46:51.420 --> 00:46:52.980]   Doesn't mean that it will get accepted
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.540]   or that it will actually gain traction,
[00:46:54.540 --> 00:46:56.380]   but everything you submit should be.
[00:46:56.380 --> 00:46:58.660]   At least have a shot at that.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:00.500]   So if your, if your slots are limited
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:01.780]   and the feedback is going to be long,
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:03.940]   you want to take your best possible
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:05.940]   shot on each thing you do.
[00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:07.180]   So now I'm mixing metaphors here,
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:09.100]   swings and shots, but I think
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:09.900]   you know what I'm talking about.
[00:47:09.900 --> 00:47:12.300]   Finally, you have to keep
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:13.860]   everything else under control.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.180]   It is easy.
[00:47:15.180 --> 00:47:15.380]   Okay.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.380]   I've submitted this thing.
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.740]   It might be four months
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.700]   till I submit something else.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:19.900]   I'm not going to hear anything else.
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.260]   It's easy to get antsy and start
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:24.660]   taking on more and more obligations,
[00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.860]   taking on more and more, accepting
[00:47:26.860 --> 00:47:28.580]   more and more requests and commitment
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:31.260]   so that you feel sufficiently busy.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:34.460]   Is it a real issue that new faculty
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.820]   have often new faculty have a bit
[00:47:36.820 --> 00:47:40.100]   of a guilt complex that their friends
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:43.060]   and family who have real jobs are doing
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:44.620]   stuff all day and are at the office all
[00:47:44.620 --> 00:47:47.300]   day and you're a new academic and
[00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:48.900]   you're on a reduced course load for
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:50.700]   your first years and you just feel like
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.140]   I don't have enough stuff to do.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.500]   I need to take on a lot of stuff
[00:47:54.500 --> 00:47:56.140]   because in busyness, I will assuage
[00:47:56.140 --> 00:47:57.340]   my guilt that I don't have a real job
[00:47:57.340 --> 00:47:58.500]   or I'm not doing the right things.
[00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:01.020]   You have to prevent that urge
[00:48:01.020 --> 00:48:02.220]   because if you get overloaded.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:04.020]   With the activities that aren't going
[00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:05.860]   to directly lead to your promotion,
[00:48:05.860 --> 00:48:07.780]   lead to your success, it's going to
[00:48:07.780 --> 00:48:10.780]   strangle the cognitive lifeblood that
[00:48:10.780 --> 00:48:12.860]   you need to actually advance.
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.060]   So I would recommend using quota
[00:48:15.060 --> 00:48:16.860]   systems to control everything else.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.540]   I need to review papers.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.340]   Yes, but here's how many I do per semester.
[00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:21.500]   Hit that quota.
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:22.460]   Can't do any more.
[00:48:22.460 --> 00:48:23.980]   I need to do committees.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.420]   Yes, but here's how many I do.
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:26.740]   I hit that quota.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.580]   I don't do more.
[00:48:28.580 --> 00:48:29.980]   So you have these quotas.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:30.980]   You're a little bit selective.
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:32.900]   When you fill the quota, you just tell
[00:48:32.900 --> 00:48:35.300]   the person asking, you know, this makes
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:36.420]   sense, I'd like to do this type of thing.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:37.540]   So I try to do a lot of these things.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.380]   I hit my quota though, the number of
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.420]   reviews already that I can do in this
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.860]   semester, it's a very effective method.
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:47.380]   Because it doesn't leave much of a
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.740]   possible rejoinder for the person to
[00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:51.380]   protest, they would have to say your
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:54.660]   quotas wrong, you should be doing more.
[00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:55.540]   Your quota is wrong.
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:56.980]   You're and people don't like, okay.
[00:48:56.980 --> 00:48:58.340]   Yeah, you've done a lot.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:48:59.700]   You have a reasonable limit.
[00:48:59.700 --> 00:49:00.300]   You've hit there.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.740]   Uh, so they're unlikely,
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:02.860]   they're unlikely to push back.
[00:49:02.860 --> 00:49:04.220]   So it's, it's pretty successful for that
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:06.500]   as well, and it allows you to still do
[00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.500]   the things that are important,
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:08.500]   just that reasonable levels.
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:08.700]   All right.
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:10.140]   So that's my three pieces of advice.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.700]   Spread out submission.
[00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:13.820]   So you always are never far from feedback.
[00:49:13.820 --> 00:49:17.300]   Number two, because feedback's so slow.
[00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:19.140]   Do your best possible work each
[00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.100]   time you submit something.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.020]   And number three, use quota systems to
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:27.900]   control, uh, the non high value activities
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.020]   that are going to threaten to come in
[00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:32.260]   like cognitive kudzu and fill
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.300]   up the rest of your space.
[00:49:33.300 --> 00:49:37.260]   All right, let's see here.
[00:49:37.260 --> 00:49:39.140]   Uh, got a written question.
[00:49:39.140 --> 00:49:44.020]   This one's from over thinker over thinker
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.620]   says, what do you think about over thinking?
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.460]   And how do you deal with
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:49.940]   or recommend dealing with it?
[00:49:49.940 --> 00:49:53.380]   This is a general problem I face and I
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:49:54.980]   have always had, but never had a way of
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:57.340]   dealing with, I have this as far as career
[00:49:57.340 --> 00:49:58.620]   job decisions are concerned, certain
[00:49:58.620 --> 00:49:59.660]   life decisions as well.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:01.340]   And by overthinking and over analyzing
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:02.500]   the potential options, I end up in a
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:05.460]   scenario where I'm more confused than before.
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:08.460]   How do you recommend dealing with this?
[00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:09.420]   Thank you.
[00:50:09.420 --> 00:50:10.940]   All right.
[00:50:10.940 --> 00:50:14.020]   Well, over thinker, typically the issue,
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:15.700]   and this is a common, common problem,
[00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:17.140]   but typically the issue at stake with
[00:50:17.140 --> 00:50:19.740]   this problem is that you're stuck in the
[00:50:19.740 --> 00:50:24.140]   mental schema of a right, wrong decision
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:28.620]   binary so that the mental framework you're
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:30.340]   using when thinking about decisions is
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:32.780]   that there is a right decision and
[00:50:32.780 --> 00:50:34.020]   multiple wrong decisions.
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:35.700]   If you can find the right decision,
[00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:36.900]   there's great rewards to it.
[00:50:36.900 --> 00:50:38.460]   If you miss it and end up on a wrong
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:41.260]   decision, there is great punishment.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:43.460]   Now, when you have the stakes of a
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.420]   binary, you are really going to worry
[00:50:45.420 --> 00:50:47.060]   about that decision because I don't
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:48.780]   want to miss the right decision here.
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:50.860]   It could lead to quite a bit of
[00:50:50.860 --> 00:50:52.500]   hardship if I get it wrong.
[00:50:52.500 --> 00:50:55.700]   That is fertile ground for growing over
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:56.140]   thinking.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:00.700]   So the big shift in mental frame that's
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:02.220]   going to help you here is move away from
[00:51:02.220 --> 00:51:03.940]   this idea that there's right and wrong
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:05.620]   decisions, and your goal is to not mess
[00:51:05.620 --> 00:51:07.820]   up and accidentally do the wrong instead
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:08.740]   of the right.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.060]   In many different areas where there's
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.940]   big decisions to make, there are
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.860]   many different ways forward that are
[00:51:14.860 --> 00:51:17.540]   completely compatible with reward or
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.660]   goodness or whatever it is that you're
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:20.700]   looking to maximize.
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:22.380]   What matters much more than the decision
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.940]   is what you do once you make it.
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:27.580]   Now, where this is made really clear is
[00:51:27.580 --> 00:51:29.340]   in career decisions, which you mentioned
[00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:30.660]   there, we talked about in an earlier
[00:51:30.660 --> 00:51:31.860]   question, which I wrote a whole book
[00:51:31.860 --> 00:51:33.060]   about So Good They Can't Ignore You.
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.620]   So let's focus on that briefly.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:37.100]   Zoom in on that briefly here for a second.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:39.620]   One of the big ideas in that book, So
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:40.700]   Good They Can't Ignore You is that
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:42.380]   people often fell into this wrong
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:43.740]   binary decision frame when it
[00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:44.900]   came to career choices.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:46.460]   There's a right job for me that
[00:51:46.460 --> 00:51:48.060]   matches some sort of magical fairy
[00:51:48.060 --> 00:51:51.020]   tale inborn passion for that job.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.700]   If I find that job, I'll be happy.
[00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:54.260]   If I miss it, I'll be miserable.
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:51:55.620]   So people obsess over what
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:57.540]   job am I going to do?
[00:51:57.540 --> 00:51:59.220]   And as I argued in So Good They Can't
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:01.460]   Ignore You, the decision of what job
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.300]   you do is actually, in some sense,
[00:52:03.300 --> 00:52:04.980]   of minor importance.
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.380]   You're not wired for one particular
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:10.580]   pursuit. You're not wired to be the
[00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:11.780]   social media influencer.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:12.980]   You're not wired to be the social
[00:52:12.980 --> 00:52:15.220]   media brand manager for
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.900]   digital media consultancy.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:19.180]   There's no particular job that
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.540]   happens to be around in the 21st
[00:52:20.540 --> 00:52:21.660]   century knowledge economy that you
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:23.180]   have to do because of your DNA.
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.860]   And if you miss it, you'll be unhappy.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.020]   The reality is there's probably many,
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:28.980]   many different jobs that could be
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:30.660]   the foundation of a passionate,
[00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:31.460]   fulfilling career.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.740]   So just choose one that seems
[00:52:32.740 --> 00:52:33.780]   reasonable. Great.
[00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:36.060]   What matters is what you do next.
[00:52:36.060 --> 00:52:37.540]   And that's where we get into career
[00:52:37.540 --> 00:52:38.380]   capital theory.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.540]   That's where we get into becoming
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:40.900]   so good you can't be ignored.
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:43.100]   Unambiguous skill is leveraged to
[00:52:43.100 --> 00:52:44.380]   shape your job towards things
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.460]   towards resonate and away from
[00:52:45.460 --> 00:52:46.540]   things that don't eventually
[00:52:46.540 --> 00:52:47.940]   arriving at an ideal lifestyle.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:48.780]   The choice of job.
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:49.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.020]   What you do once you make a choice.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:52.540]   Oh, yeah, that matters.
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:55.300]   So we can extend that to almost any
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:56.260]   major decision.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:58.380]   Here's what I would ask.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.740]   Do I have evidence that this
[00:52:59.740 --> 00:53:01.340]   particular decision opens up good
[00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:02.700]   options for me that will move me
[00:53:02.700 --> 00:53:04.740]   closer to the properties of my
[00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:05.780]   desired lifestyle?
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:07.340]   The answer is yes.
[00:53:07.340 --> 00:53:08.740]   Are there other options which are
[00:53:08.740 --> 00:53:10.940]   also tractable that would
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.860]   be demonstrably more.
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:16.420]   Successful at moving me towards
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:18.540]   properties compatible with my
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:19.500]   ideal lifestyle.
[00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:20.660]   If the answer to that is no.
[00:53:20.660 --> 00:53:21.620]   So, yes, no.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.100]   Then great.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:22.740]   Go ahead.
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.300]   So this seems good.
[00:53:25.300 --> 00:53:26.740]   I'll simplify the language here.
[00:53:26.740 --> 00:53:27.820]   This seems good.
[00:53:27.820 --> 00:53:29.100]   It opens up cool opportunities.
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.500]   It leads me in a direction I could
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.340]   imagine constructing a good deep
[00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:33.220]   life around that.
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.900]   And there's not some obvious
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:35.980]   alternative that's way better.
[00:53:35.980 --> 00:53:36.740]   I don't care if there's a lot of
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:37.660]   alternatives that are similar.
[00:53:37.660 --> 00:53:39.260]   There's not one that is obviously
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:39.780]   way better.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:40.540]   Good.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:41.420]   Go for it.
[00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:41.980]   Commit.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:43.660]   And there might be six different
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:44.740]   options that satisfy this.
[00:53:44.740 --> 00:53:46.740]   Flip a roll a six sided die.
[00:53:46.740 --> 00:53:47.380]   I don't care.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.900]   Choose something that seems good.
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:51.900]   Opens up opportunities.
[00:53:51.900 --> 00:53:53.340]   There's not some obviously much
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:54.140]   better answer.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.900]   The interesting thing is then what
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:56.540]   you do next.
[00:53:56.540 --> 00:53:58.340]   Which is once you've made the
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:53:58.820]   choice.
[00:53:58.820 --> 00:53:59.460]   All right.
[00:53:59.460 --> 00:54:00.540]   Now what do I want to do?
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.700]   I've chosen this job.
[00:54:02.700 --> 00:54:03.820]   I've decided to get married.
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:04.940]   I've decided to have kids.
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.660]   I've decided to move to this
[00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:08.580]   completely different environment.
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:08.820]   Great.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.540]   You've made the decision.
[00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:10.340]   You've made the decision.
[00:54:10.340 --> 00:54:12.740]   How now do you build a life around
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:14.780]   that decision that leverages and
[00:54:14.780 --> 00:54:16.500]   maximizes what's good about it.
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.220]   Sidesteps to potential traps.
[00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:19.820]   It allows you to extract from it
[00:54:19.820 --> 00:54:21.380]   all of the possibilities for a
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:23.020]   deeper life for that ideal
[00:54:23.020 --> 00:54:23.500]   lifestyle.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.940]   So that's the frame shift.
[00:54:24.940 --> 00:54:26.820]   The decision is easy.
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:29.100]   Don't make an obviously bad choice.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:30.220]   But if something seems reasonable
[00:54:30.220 --> 00:54:30.940]   that's good enough.
[00:54:30.940 --> 00:54:33.940]   Put more energy into what you do
[00:54:33.940 --> 00:54:34.900]   next.
[00:54:34.900 --> 00:54:39.140]   All right.
[00:54:39.140 --> 00:54:40.700]   Well it's our first podcast in
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:41.340]   July.
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:44.220]   So I think we should talk about
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:46.060]   the books I read last month.
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.180]   The books I read in June 2022.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:52.940]   As longtime listeners know my
[00:54:52.940 --> 00:54:55.500]   goal is to read five books per
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:56.900]   month which I do by making
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:54:59.300]   reading a default activity by
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:00.780]   not using my phone for
[00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:03.020]   distraction and by scheduling
[00:55:03.020 --> 00:55:05.620]   reading blocks on occasion into
[00:55:05.620 --> 00:55:06.820]   my actual time blocked work
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.220]   schedule.
[00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:09.580]   Now Jesse actually for the first
[00:55:09.580 --> 00:55:11.580]   time did not read five books.
[00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:14.020]   I read six in June.
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.020]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:17.260]   Well because we had to deal with
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:18.020]   a week of COVID.
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.620]   So you can't do stuff right.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:22.220]   You can't go and do other things
[00:55:22.220 --> 00:55:23.140]   outside of the house.
[00:55:23.140 --> 00:55:23.940]   So I read an extra book.
[00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.540]   While you were doing the RAR?
[00:55:25.540 --> 00:55:27.700]   I didn't RAR with COVID.
[00:55:27.700 --> 00:55:29.420]   I probably should have.
[00:55:29.420 --> 00:55:31.340]   You use it as an excuse right.
[00:55:31.340 --> 00:55:33.100]   You're like, oh man, technically
[00:55:33.100 --> 00:55:33.660]   I have COVID.
[00:55:33.660 --> 00:55:34.980]   So like really.
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:35.860]   You could have done the RAR.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:36.500]   I need to eat.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:37.700]   I need to eat whatever.
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:38.780]   David Goggins would have told
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:39.340]   you to do the RAR.
[00:55:39.340 --> 00:55:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:41.220]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.220 --> 00:55:42.220]   David Goggins would have wrote.
[00:55:42.220 --> 00:55:42.660]   No, no.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:44.460]   You use it as an excuse.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:45.900]   I think we're leaving that phase
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:47.860]   by the way, where like people care
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:48.700]   and feel bad for you.
[00:55:48.700 --> 00:55:50.660]   So you leave that phase like I
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.740]   got to eat like crap.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:53.100]   I can't exercise.
[00:55:53.100 --> 00:55:53.820]   Like now you can.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:55.500]   You know, it's just stuff you get
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:55.900]   on the RAR.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:59.300]   No, actually what I did, this
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.100]   wasn't during COVID, it was more
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:00.460]   recently.
[00:56:00.460 --> 00:56:04.140]   I did this five day like kind of
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:07.300]   intense daily free weight.
[00:56:07.940 --> 00:56:08.500]   Routine.
[00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:09.300]   It was.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:10.220]   At your house.
[00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:10.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:12.420]   But that was after COVID.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:12.820]   All right.
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.740]   Anyways, six books I read in June,
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:16.500]   2022.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:18.820]   Uh, the order here is arbitrary.
[00:56:18.820 --> 00:56:23.260]   Number one, Ball Four by Jim.
[00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:24.860]   I think it's Boonton.
[00:56:24.860 --> 00:56:26.100]   I'm saying that right.
[00:56:26.100 --> 00:56:26.900]   You've heard of Ball Four?
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:27.540]   I have.
[00:56:27.540 --> 00:56:28.060]   Baseball book.
[00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:28.500]   Yeah.
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:30.380]   Um, I mean, this was a book.
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:31.620]   It was written in the early seventies,
[00:56:31.620 --> 00:56:35.980]   uh, about a pitcher, Jim Boonton, who
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.220]   was a Yankee, I mean, he was really
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:39.540]   good for the Yankees and then sort of
[00:56:39.540 --> 00:56:40.620]   became a journeyman for a while.
[00:56:40.620 --> 00:56:42.140]   It was, it was a book about a year in
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:43.380]   the life and it's actually written
[00:56:43.380 --> 00:56:45.220]   diary format and it was the, it's
[00:56:45.220 --> 00:56:46.740]   famous because it was the first book
[00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.140]   about baseball that pulled back the
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:50.580]   curtain on what life was actually like
[00:56:50.580 --> 00:56:51.900]   for these professional athletes.
[00:56:51.900 --> 00:56:53.740]   I mean, it gets into the, the
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.780]   amphetamines they would take and the,
[00:56:55.780 --> 00:56:57.540]   the carousing with women and the
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.500]   drinking, and this was, I think this
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.780]   was the book that first revealed kind
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:03.500]   of broke the myth of Mickey Mantle.
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:04.900]   The fact that he hit a home run while
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:07.180]   drunk and so it pulled back the curtain
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.780]   and it was sort of a big controversy,
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:09.980]   but it's really influential book for
[00:57:09.980 --> 00:57:12.300]   a lot of people because it was the first,
[00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:14.100]   this is what sports is really like.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:16.260]   Um, I read it for a book group.
[00:57:16.260 --> 00:57:17.260]   I'm in a book group, Jesse.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:19.780]   Not something I would normally think to
[00:57:19.780 --> 00:57:21.060]   do, given how much of my life
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.740]   professionally I spend reading and
[00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:25.900]   writing, but it's a sports book only.
[00:57:25.900 --> 00:57:26.940]   Book group.
[00:57:26.940 --> 00:57:30.700]   And I read sports books as a way to
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.060]   relax because they're completely
[00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:35.420]   unrelated to what I write about normally.
[00:57:35.420 --> 00:57:38.540]   So I figured that'd be a good book group to join.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.820]   So you guys meet once a month?
[00:57:39.820 --> 00:57:41.940]   I mean, last night was our first meeting.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:43.540]   So I've only done it once.
[00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:45.340]   But the book was ball four.
[00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:45.860]   Ball four.
[00:57:45.860 --> 00:57:47.060]   Yeah.
[00:57:47.060 --> 00:57:48.220]   So I'm officially in a book group.
[00:57:48.220 --> 00:57:50.540]   The style is interesting in ball four.
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:52.140]   He worked, it's diary.
[00:57:52.140 --> 00:57:54.820]   I mean, day, every day, March 17th,
[00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:56.020]   you know, April 28th.
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:58.260]   And he would take notes during the day and
[00:57:58.260 --> 00:57:59.860]   then talk into a tape recorder at night.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:01.020]   And then it got edited.
[00:58:01.020 --> 00:58:03.260]   He had a kind of a ghost writer and
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:05.220]   they would edit it, but it's, uh,
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:07.700]   it's almost impressionistic, right?
[00:58:07.700 --> 00:58:08.860]   I mean, if you read now a sort of
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.940]   sports autobiography, it's it's, it'll
[00:58:11.940 --> 00:58:13.900]   follow through time, but there's, there's
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:16.020]   plot lines it's following and it's written
[00:58:16.020 --> 00:58:17.500]   in way that's a little bit more coherent.
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:19.180]   This is more impressionistic.
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.780]   It'll this happen.
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:21.900]   Here's an observation.
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.980]   You will come back to plot lines, but
[00:58:23.980 --> 00:58:25.420]   not in a very structured way.
[00:58:25.420 --> 00:58:28.980]   I mean, it's almost like early modernism,
[00:58:28.980 --> 00:58:30.900]   cubism and art being moved over
[00:58:30.900 --> 00:58:32.860]   to narrative nonfiction.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:34.340]   It's the Mademoiselle, the
[00:58:34.340 --> 00:58:36.740]   Davin young of sports book.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.580]   It's just impressionistic and it's 500
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:40.220]   pages of just doom and this, and, and,
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.940]   and this happened and that happened.
[00:58:41.940 --> 00:58:44.100]   And over time, it's very effective.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.420]   You get a very, uh, Layered understanding
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:49.420]   of life as a player without any carefully
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:50.940]   constructed narratives, without carefully
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.660]   constructed structured chapters.
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:53.980]   So there's some sort of interesting
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.140]   experimental thing going on.
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.860]   I haven't seen a lot of that in books since.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.100]   Who was the manager then?
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:02.460]   So this follows the, I think the 69
[00:59:02.460 --> 00:59:04.860]   season where he spent a year at an
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.220]   expansion team, just a Seattle pilot,
[00:59:07.220 --> 00:59:09.660]   which then became the, the brewers.
[00:59:09.660 --> 00:59:10.180]   Got it.
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:12.540]   Um, so it was interesting.
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.980]   All right.
[00:59:13.980 --> 00:59:16.100]   Other interesting book I read, take the
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:20.700]   gun, leave the cannoli by Mark seal.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.020]   It's a account of the filming
[00:59:24.020 --> 00:59:25.180]   of the first godfather.
[00:59:25.180 --> 00:59:27.620]   So that's a, it's a quote from the first
[00:59:27.620 --> 00:59:29.100]   godfather, Mark seal, I think is a Vandy fair
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:33.100]   reporter, and I was going to California.
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.220]   I was going to wine country, Francis Ford
[00:59:35.220 --> 00:59:37.300]   Coppola, you know, has vineyards up there.
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:39.540]   And so it felt appropriate to read a book
[00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:40.900]   about the making of the godfather.
[00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:41.540]   So it was interesting.
[00:59:41.540 --> 00:59:44.740]   It gets into Rob Evans and Mark Puzo and,
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:46.900]   and, and you know, how the movie came
[00:59:46.900 --> 00:59:48.300]   together and those are kind of
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.140]   interesting books to read.
[00:59:49.140 --> 00:59:49.460]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.460 --> 00:59:50.460]   They just had the 50th
[00:59:50.460 --> 00:59:51.500]   anniversary too, right?
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:53.020]   Oh, interesting.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.020]   And this is an older book, but
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.340]   my timing was good then.
[00:59:55.340 --> 00:59:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:57.420]   The 58th anniversary is like a couple
[00:59:57.420 --> 00:59:57.900]   months ago.
[00:59:57.900 --> 00:59:58.860]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.860 --> 01:00:02.140]   So Puzo went through this whole thing
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.180]   about the record for paperback rights.
[01:00:04.180 --> 01:00:11.420]   So, so Puzo got, I think 500,000 or the
[01:00:11.420 --> 01:00:13.340]   paperback rights to the godfather would
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:17.500]   set the record and, uh, because Stephen
[01:00:17.500 --> 01:00:19.780]   King got 400,000 for Carrie kind
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:20.660]   of around the same time.
[01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:21.860]   So that was, that was the sort of
[01:00:21.860 --> 01:00:23.580]   records back then for rights was
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:25.300]   like four or $500,000.
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:27.100]   And that was back when paperback
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:27.940]   rights were something you sold
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:28.860]   separately and that's where you made
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.980]   all your money no longer today.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:32.660]   All right.
[01:00:32.660 --> 01:00:34.580]   Then I read every tool is a
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:38.740]   hammer by Adam Savage, former MythBusters.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.620]   It's his memoir, an interesting memoir.
[01:00:40.620 --> 01:00:43.620]   You'll see, he'll work in advice about
[01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.020]   workshops and making with the story of
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.860]   his own life and his personal philosophy.
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:52.940]   Uh, Adam Savage, his critical connection
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:56.620]   to this show we do here is that he has
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.900]   the cave, which is this really cool
[01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:00.660]   warehouse in the mission district
[01:01:00.660 --> 01:01:02.380]   of San Francisco, which is his personal
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:04.100]   workshop and it's this cool, amazing
[01:01:04.100 --> 01:01:05.100]   space he goes to.
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.180]   And part of the inspiration for the
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:09.740]   deep work HQ was that he, he has this.
[01:01:09.740 --> 01:01:12.020]   This was his dream to have a dedicated
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:13.980]   space that what he does is builds things.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.260]   And it's this huge, cool workshop.
[01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:18.100]   Uh, just like we have a dedicated space
[01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:19.860]   to come and record and in theory think.
[01:01:19.860 --> 01:01:21.980]   And so I liked the cave.
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:24.260]   I like his videos on tested.com.
[01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.060]   Interesting guy.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:26.660]   Did it talk about the cave in the book?
[01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:27.200]   Yeah.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.860]   And he started his first cave was like in
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:31.140]   a basement of a rental house.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:33.340]   And then, uh, after MythBusters was doing
[01:01:33.340 --> 01:01:35.140]   really well and he made, made money is when
[01:01:35.140 --> 01:01:37.140]   he, he leased out, leased out this space.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:38.740]   It's interesting.
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.740]   There, I think they're having crime
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.820]   problems in the neighborhood.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:44.820]   Like they don't, they don't nearly as
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:46.940]   much anymore have cameraman come film in
[01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:48.380]   there, he'll self film himself in there,
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:50.260]   which he was doing during COVID during
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.700]   the, like the lockdowns, but then he kept
[01:01:51.700 --> 01:01:53.580]   doing it even though now, uh, it's
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:54.820]   obviously not COVID concerns because he
[01:01:54.820 --> 01:01:56.620]   does lots of videos with other people in
[01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:57.340]   other places.
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:01:59.060]   And I heard him say somewhere that it's
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.860]   because, uh, the cars are getting broken
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.900]   into, so he can walk to the cave from his
[01:02:03.900 --> 01:02:06.260]   house so he can go there and film himself.
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:09.020]   But when a crew would come just like clockwork,
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:10.140]   their cars are getting broken into.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:12.460]   So there's a lot of self filming happening.
[01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:13.340]   There you go.
[01:02:13.340 --> 01:02:17.180]   A little bit of, uh, Adam Savage trivia.
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:18.380]   Right there.
[01:02:18.380 --> 01:02:19.020]   But it was a good book.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:21.580]   He talked, I mean, it's, you'll learn about
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   glue, but also learn about, you know, his
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.220]   time at ILM and his struggles.
[01:02:29.220 --> 01:02:30.380]   I mean, so it's like, I think it's a
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:31.100]   really creative book.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:31.540]   I enjoyed it.
[01:02:31.540 --> 01:02:32.940]   All right.
[01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:36.380]   Then I read Cod by Mark Kurlansky.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:38.180]   I like Kurlansky.
[01:02:38.180 --> 01:02:40.180]   There was a period in the, this would
[01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:41.300]   have been the early two thousands where
[01:02:41.300 --> 01:02:42.500]   these books were really big, where you
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:45.300]   would take one topic, uh, Kurlansky wrote
[01:02:45.300 --> 01:02:47.580]   Cod and then he wrote Salt, but there was
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:49.140]   like a book about pencils that was really
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:49.740]   big at this time.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:51.820]   And you take one topic and you go deep
[01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.340]   on that topic and in going deep on that
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:55.060]   topic, you learn a lot about history.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.380]   And Cod was one of the first books to do
[01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:57.540]   this.
[01:02:57.540 --> 01:02:59.740]   I, I, I, when I lived in New England, I
[01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:00.700]   read this and Salt.
[01:03:00.700 --> 01:03:01.500]   I love those books.
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500]   So it's the history of Cod and Cod fishing,
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:06.140]   but you learn the history of Europe and
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.620]   colonial America and all of these different
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:11.980]   things, um, beautifully written and he mixes
[01:03:11.980 --> 01:03:15.820]   it with recipes, but historical recipes.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.540]   Like here's a recipe for preparing
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:19.060]   Cod from 1727.
[01:03:19.060 --> 01:03:20.100]   And it's all mixed together.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.100]   It's a, it's a really nice, uh, innovative,
[01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.140]   beautifully constructed book.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:25.060]   So it was a reread?
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.660]   That I think I probably read at some point.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:30.020]   Back in New England, 10, 15 years ago.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:31.300]   Have you tried any of the recipes?
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:33.340]   Well, they're historic recipes.
[01:03:33.340 --> 01:03:34.740]   So we have cooked Cod though.
[01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:35.340]   Cod's good.
[01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:39.060]   Uh, then I read, cause this is my weird
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.740]   compulsion.
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:44.060]   I don't know why I read these books, but I
[01:03:44.060 --> 01:03:45.180]   keep reading these types of books.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:48.700]   Uh, another Bill Carter book, Desperate
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:51.980]   Networks. So Bill Carter is, you know, New
[01:03:51.980 --> 01:03:54.140]   York times TV reporter, desperate networks.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:56.180]   It's just a book about like a five year
[01:03:56.180 --> 01:04:00.500]   period after NBC's must see TV lineup was,
[01:04:00.500 --> 01:04:02.540]   you know, friends and Seinfeld had all kind
[01:04:02.540 --> 01:04:05.900]   of disappeared and how NBC fell and ABC and
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:07.140]   CBS made their move.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:09.700]   So ABC got lost in desperate housewives and
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:13.060]   CB CBS got CSI.
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:14.460]   It's just, that's it.
[01:04:14.460 --> 01:04:16.900]   Like Bill Carter just writes these books
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:19.820]   every so often years, he'll like take a
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.060]   period of time and write about it.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.780]   So the last one I wrote, read by him and
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:24.580]   talked about on the show is late shift about
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:26.780]   what happened after Johnny Carson retired.
[01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.820]   I don't know why I'm so interested in these
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:31.300]   books about the inside baseball of network
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:34.140]   television, but I find them relaxing and
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:34.580]   interesting.
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.620]   Basically it just comes down to ratings and
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:38.420]   that just gets more advertisers, right?
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:39.740]   Is that how it's determined?
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.060 --> 01:04:42.540]   And, and well, but how these shows come
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:44.060]   together, it's all kind of guesswork.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.140]   I, so I'll tell you the, the anecdote I've
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.500]   extracted from this book, that's going to
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.140]   make it into slow productivity.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:52.420]   So I'll preview this anecdote now, because
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:54.500]   I'm always reading, looking towards anecdotes.
[01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:58.540]   Uh, they talk about CBS was really
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:05:02.940]   struggling and I think it was less
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:04.260]   Moonves who took over.
[01:05:04.260 --> 01:05:05.300]   Might have that wrong.
[01:05:05.300 --> 01:05:07.180]   I'll go back and I listened to him.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:08.660]   I have to buy the book to get the quotes
[01:05:08.660 --> 01:05:08.980]   out of it.
[01:05:08.980 --> 01:05:13.020]   And, uh, he was upset that the
[01:05:13.020 --> 01:05:14.100]   offices were emptying.
[01:05:14.940 --> 01:05:16.660]   There'll be three o'clock on a Friday and
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:18.540]   there, the office would be half full and
[01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:20.340]   that it needs that people aren't taking at
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:24.660]   the CBS headquarters there in, uh, in
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:25.820]   Manhattan where I've been, because I've
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:26.660]   done some CBS stuff.
[01:05:26.660 --> 01:05:28.620]   Um, people aren't here.
[01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.580]   We need energy.
[01:05:29.580 --> 01:05:31.380]   He's like NBC was number one.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.260]   They probably had a lot of energy.
[01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:33.540]   So everyone has to be in the office.
[01:05:33.540 --> 01:05:34.900]   You can't leave till after five.
[01:05:34.900 --> 01:05:38.180]   And if you step back, you say, yeah, under
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:40.900]   him, CBS did rock it up to be much more
[01:05:40.900 --> 01:05:41.420]   successful.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.020]   Why I think it's an interesting anecdote
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.580]   though, is as Bill Carter gets into exactly
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:47.220]   what happened, why did CBS become more
[01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:50.460]   successful because all of the executives
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.020]   and ad people and HR people are in the
[01:05:52.020 --> 01:05:52.780]   office till five?
[01:05:52.780 --> 01:05:54.860]   No, it was because of CSI.
[01:05:54.860 --> 01:05:58.060]   And when you hear the story of CSI and
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:06:00.180]   Bill Carter, it's actually the story of a,
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:02.700]   of someone spending a lot of time thinking
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.780]   through and polishing this concept.
[01:06:04.780 --> 01:06:07.340]   And it's a slow productivity parable.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:09.140]   Les Moonves thought what was important
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:11.140]   for success is that everyone was busier
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.380]   and more visibly active.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.780]   But in the end, what actually saved the
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.460]   company was something that was very slow
[01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:16.180]   and creative.
[01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:17.980]   And there's this story of this, this
[01:06:17.980 --> 01:06:22.500]   television writer who had, had, had a, had
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.660]   gone up in his career and had fallen and
[01:06:24.660 --> 01:06:27.140]   had gotten obsessed with this idea and
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:29.940]   slowly develop something of such value
[01:06:29.940 --> 01:06:31.060]   that it saved an entire network.
[01:06:31.060 --> 01:06:32.740]   So I'm going to pull that together in the
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:33.060]   book.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:34.660]   You'll see when the book finally comes out
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:37.340]   into a cool reversal anecdote about, you
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:38.940]   know, Les Moonves didn't save the company
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.860]   by making everyone more busy, but instead
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.940]   it was this guy whose name I forgot, but
[01:06:42.940 --> 01:06:48.220]   we'll obviously learn, um, slowing down and,
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.980]   and, and inhabiting this idea that ended
[01:06:50.980 --> 01:06:52.300]   up actually making the difference.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:54.580]   So there's a little proto idea that by
[01:06:54.580 --> 01:06:55.860]   the time it comes into my book will be
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:56.500]   quite polished.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:57.980]   So that, that alone made it worth reading
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:06:58.340]   that book.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:06:58.700]   I think.
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:03.620]   Uh, final thing I read, it was June summer.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.060]   I love to read adventure books and
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:05.540]   thrillers.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:09.100]   I read David Morrell's first blood.
[01:07:10.700 --> 01:07:13.580]   So first blood it's known now is the
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:15.340]   first Rambo movie.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.780]   So John Rambo is the, this is the book
[01:07:17.780 --> 01:07:20.100]   that introduced John Rambo, but people
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:24.820]   don't remember properly the lineage of
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:26.140]   Rambo.
[01:07:26.140 --> 01:07:30.620]   So first blood is this, this book about
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:33.540]   political polarization post Vietnam.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.780]   And it's, uh, it was used to be taught in
[01:07:36.780 --> 01:07:37.740]   colleges a lot.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:39.780]   And it's, it's really the plot of the book
[01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.460]   is that John Rambo, former green Beret,
[01:07:42.460 --> 01:07:45.220]   who had been, had this traumatic experience
[01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:47.780]   as a prisoner of war in Vietnam and is
[01:07:47.780 --> 01:07:50.180]   now sort of a drifter, just sort of walking
[01:07:50.180 --> 01:07:52.740]   through across the countryside has a run
[01:07:52.740 --> 01:07:55.940]   in with the straight lay police sheriff
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:56.980]   in this small town.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:58.780]   And I think it's in the, I forgot where
[01:07:58.780 --> 01:08:00.460]   it is in the movie at specific Northwest.
[01:08:00.460 --> 01:08:02.020]   I think this is like Virginia or something.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:07.020]   And he snaps and, uh, he snaps the PTSD
[01:08:07.020 --> 01:08:08.540]   snaps, he kills one of the police officers
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:09.500]   flees into the woods.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:10.620]   The police come after him.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:13.900]   Long story short, he basically kills
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:15.700]   everyone, but the chief and then the
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.340]   national guard comes back and says back
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.820]   and forth, but the way David Morrell wrote
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:21.620]   the book is alternating viewpoints, Rambo
[01:08:21.620 --> 01:08:23.180]   police chief Rambo police chief.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:25.620]   And he was very clear that there's no
[01:08:25.620 --> 01:08:27.260]   clear hero or anti-hero.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:28.100]   It's not, this is the good guy.
[01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:28.900]   This is the bad guy.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.020]   They'll the whole point of the
[01:08:30.020 --> 01:08:31.340]   book was the ambiguity.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.660]   You, you, you kind of understand the police
[01:08:34.660 --> 01:08:36.980]   chief and the he's, he's been divorced and
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.100]   the issues he's having his life.
[01:08:38.100 --> 01:08:39.860]   And you understand Rambo and the PTSD.
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:41.900]   And you're not even sure who's the good
[01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:42.580]   guy, who's the bad guy.
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:43.660]   And that was the whole point of the book,
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:45.260]   because that's the weird ambivalence of
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:48.020]   the post Vietnam era polarization.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.500]   It was this messy time where it was
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.220]   unclear who was right and who was wrong.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:51.780]   And so it's actually like
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:52.740]   a really interesting book.
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:54.820]   And they made into the movie first blood,
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:56.580]   the first Rambo movie starring Sylvester
[01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.220]   Stallone and the movie.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:01.300]   Is not like you think about with Rambo.
[01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:03.460]   I mean, it's a, it's shot like today.
[01:09:03.460 --> 01:09:05.180]   We would see it more like an indie film.
[01:09:05.180 --> 01:09:06.500]   It's in the early seventies.
[01:09:07.300 --> 01:09:09.500]   And it's a small movie.
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.580]   I did invent some very important tropes
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:13.900]   that this is one of the very first sort of
[01:09:13.900 --> 01:09:15.940]   had some of the very first tropes that
[01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:17.500]   action movies of the eighties would then
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.580]   pull from, but it's not a, it's not a
[01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:23.220]   recognizable shoot them up action movie.
[01:09:23.220 --> 01:09:25.500]   So it's, it's, it's like a small movie.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.380]   I rewatched it.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.780]   I've had some, some guys that we do a movie
[01:09:28.780 --> 01:09:31.300]   club, we rewatched it not too long ago.
[01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:34.180]   Then after that was very successful,
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:36.660]   they did Rambo too.
[01:09:36.660 --> 01:09:39.940]   And by Rambo too, now Sylvester Stallone
[01:09:39.940 --> 01:09:43.180]   has biceps, roughly the size of a cantaloupe
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:45.620]   and he's holding M sixties under both arms
[01:09:45.620 --> 01:09:47.660]   and has the red bandana and he goes back
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.260]   to Vietnam and he's, you know, the body
[01:09:49.260 --> 01:09:51.380]   counts pile up, it became the cliched sort
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:53.740]   of this weird over the top Reagan era
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:54.660]   rah, rah, rah movie.
[01:09:54.660 --> 01:09:56.100]   But first blood was not that.
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:57.740]   And the first blood movie was not that.
[01:09:57.740 --> 01:09:59.380]   So I went back and read the original novel.
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:01.660]   Um, that's pretty good.
[01:10:02.820 --> 01:10:05.500]   Uh, he it's, he just kills everybody, but
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:08.260]   he's, it's, it's psychologically interesting.
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.020]   Like they're saying he's broken and the
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:12.540]   police chief is at anyways, in the end,
[01:10:12.540 --> 01:10:15.060]   they both die, they kill each other in the
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.700]   spoiler alert, they kill each other in the
[01:10:16.700 --> 01:10:16.900]   end.
[01:10:16.900 --> 01:10:18.060]   I mean, it's kind of an interesting book,
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:20.700]   but David Morrell said after the second
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.540]   Rambo movie came out, they stopped teaching
[01:10:23.540 --> 01:10:26.820]   the book in colleges because the second
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:28.500]   Rambo movie was very much associated with
[01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.660]   like rah, rah Reaganism and, you know,
[01:10:32.220 --> 01:10:35.220]   mindless action and it tainted his original
[01:10:35.220 --> 01:10:36.220]   work and they stopped teaching it.
[01:10:36.220 --> 01:10:37.860]   So there you go.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:39.940]   David Morrell, first blood.
[01:10:39.940 --> 01:10:40.900]   All right.
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:41.540]   Those are my six.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:44.340]   What was the beast of a book that you're
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:47.900]   reading like back in the springtime?
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:50.820]   Um, did you finish it?
[01:10:50.820 --> 01:10:51.580]   I don't know.
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:53.780]   I've had a, I've had a few beast recently.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:55.980]   I don't know which one in the spring might
[01:10:55.980 --> 01:10:57.300]   have been the beast.
[01:10:57.300 --> 01:10:57.380]   Yeah.
[01:10:57.380 --> 01:10:58.660]   So I'd have to go back and look at our,
[01:10:58.660 --> 01:11:00.820]   are you still working through like a piece
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.620]   of a book right now?
[01:11:01.860 --> 01:11:03.260]   Franklin's a beast of a book.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.100]   I'm 200.
[01:11:05.100 --> 01:11:08.540]   I mean, Ball Four was a beast of a book just
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:08.940]   in length.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:09.420]   It's not hard.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:10.980]   It's not a hard read, but it's 500 pages.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:13.020]   Franklin's five or 600 pages.
[01:11:13.020 --> 01:11:16.100]   Uh, and it's small.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.340]   It is making me feel old.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:19.020]   It's reading glasses small.
[01:11:19.020 --> 01:11:20.300]   You know.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:22.100]   Probably read a lot of books about Franklin, right?
[01:11:22.100 --> 01:11:22.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.540 --> 01:11:24.780]   Last year I read Gordon Woods book,
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:28.140]   Americanization of Ben Franklin and Gordon
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:28.620]   Wood is great.
[01:11:28.620 --> 01:11:31.380]   Gordon Wood is, uh, well, brands is an
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:34.860]   academic too, but what is, um, the most
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.500]   academic of the semi-public facing writers
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:40.100]   about colonial history.
[01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:42.140]   So he's great on the philosophical
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:45.420]   context of, of the revolution.
[01:11:45.420 --> 01:11:47.900]   Like the, the currents of thought going on
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:50.700]   in England and specifically like what
[01:11:50.700 --> 01:11:53.420]   Jefferson had read and what was going on.
[01:11:53.420 --> 01:11:56.300]   Uh, the, the impacts of these various
[01:11:56.300 --> 01:11:57.900]   rebellions that were happening in the
[01:11:57.900 --> 01:12:00.940]   English countryside in the 18th century
[01:12:01.100 --> 01:12:02.660]   and how they influenced what was
[01:12:02.660 --> 01:12:04.700]   happening in America.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.020]   So like, if you really want, I think
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:09.700]   woods at Brown, he's more academic brands
[01:12:09.700 --> 01:12:12.460]   is he's a distinguished professor at UT.
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:16.500]   Austin, but he writes more.
[01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:18.660]   Uh, he's a beautiful writer, but he's
[01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:20.900]   also like McCullough or someone he's
[01:12:20.900 --> 01:12:23.420]   writing for a non-academic art audience,
[01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.020]   but that's a piece of a book that's 600
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:25.500]   pages.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:28.140]   Um, so that, that might take me a minute.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:28.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:28.820 --> 01:12:30.340]   I'm reading four books concurrently right
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:30.460]   now.
[01:12:30.460 --> 01:12:32.540]   I just, I'm jumping between things.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:33.700]   I'm finding things I like.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.180]   I'm just, I'm just all over the place right
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:35.420]   now.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:36.260]   Any audio?
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:37.540 --> 01:12:39.180]   Um, what am I listening to an audio?
[01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:41.300]   Ooh, golden eye.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:42.820]   It's a book.
[01:12:42.820 --> 01:12:44.980]   It was, it's free on audible right now.
[01:12:44.980 --> 01:12:47.260]   So if you have audible, it's free right now.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:51.780]   And it's the story of the house that Ian
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:56.140]   Fleming built in Jamaica when he turned 40.
[01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:58.020]   And it's where he wrote all the James Bond
[01:12:58.020 --> 01:12:58.460]   novels.
[01:12:58.660 --> 01:13:00.940]   So it's, it's a Jamaican history, like what
[01:13:00.940 --> 01:13:02.340]   was going on in Jamaica.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:05.140]   It's the colonial relationship between Britain
[01:13:05.140 --> 01:13:07.100]   and Jamaica, who was living there, all these
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:11.940]   different, my, uh, lesser aristocrats and others.
[01:13:11.940 --> 01:13:15.060]   And Ian Fleming coming there and building
[01:13:15.060 --> 01:13:17.940]   this house and, and where he, he wrote all
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:18.500]   of his books.
[01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:21.380]   And so I'm enjoying that.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:22.220]   Here's here.
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:23.020]   I'll just give the quick bullet.
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:24.980]   I always say I'm always pattern pattern
[01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.220]   matching, interesting bullet points.
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:27.940]   The interesting bullet points is one.
[01:13:28.340 --> 01:13:30.340]   So after the war, so, you know, Fleming
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:32.900]   served, uh, with intelligence during the war.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:36.940]   This was, if you want to look up, uh, British
[01:13:36.940 --> 01:13:39.420]   privilege after the war, he went to get a job
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:43.220]   at, at a paper and he was going to be the
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:45.780]   foreign reporter for some paper run by Lord
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:47.340]   someone, someone he's like, here's the thing.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:50.300]   I need three months off a year to go to
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:53.420]   Jamaica and Lord so-and-so was like, good
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:54.100]   show old chap.
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:55.060]   That's fine.
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:56.380]   You can take three months off a year.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:57.220]   So you can go to Jamaica.
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:13:58.100]   That seems reasonable.
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:13:59.780]   So then he goes and builds this house.
[01:13:59.780 --> 01:14:01.340]   So he'd visited Jamaica in the war.
[01:14:01.340 --> 01:14:03.260]   And so he goes and builds this house in
[01:14:03.260 --> 01:14:07.180]   Jamaica and just partying is partying at this
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:07.420]   house.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.380]   It's not very nice.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:10.020]   I mean, it's a beautiful overlook in the
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:11.620]   water, but the house it's, it's, uh, there's
[01:14:11.620 --> 01:14:12.260]   no windows.
[01:14:12.260 --> 01:14:12.980]   It's just louvers.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.420]   So it's like full of bugs at night and the
[01:14:14.420 --> 01:14:15.740]   bathroom doesn't really work, but you know,
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.900]   he's just partying and womanizing.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.100]   So he builds it when he's 40, he's just out
[01:14:20.100 --> 01:14:23.900]   there drinking and womanizing and then gets
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.900]   his mistress pregnant when he's 43.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:28.540]   And now he's all freaking out.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:30.620]   He's like, I can't be a dad.
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:31.980]   I can't raise a kid or whatever.
[01:14:31.980 --> 01:14:32.540]   I don't know.
[01:14:32.540 --> 01:14:33.260]   He's all freaking out.
[01:14:33.260 --> 01:14:35.460]   So she's like, look, you need to distract
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:36.020]   yourself.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:39.420]   Um, yeah, you can't just be carousing womanize.
[01:14:39.420 --> 01:14:41.860]   Why don't you write like while you're out here.
[01:14:41.860 --> 01:14:45.340]   And so at 43, he's out there at Jamaica
[01:14:45.340 --> 01:14:47.020]   freaking out about having a kid and writes
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:48.500]   Casino Roy, Casino Royale.
[01:14:48.500 --> 01:14:49.220]   Wow.
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.940]   And he gets it down to a science where he
[01:14:50.940 --> 01:14:54.180]   can write these, he, the, he writes one novel
[01:14:54.180 --> 01:14:56.100]   per annual Jamaica visit.
[01:14:56.460 --> 01:15:00.020]   So in three months, one novel right in the
[01:15:00.020 --> 01:15:02.380]   morning and again in the afternoon, overlooking
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:04.020]   the water with the swim in between.
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:05.380 --> 01:15:06.780]   He's got to figure it out.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:09.460]   The downside is he smoked 80 cigarettes a day,
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:14.300]   which if you do the math is constant, it has
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:14.780]   expensive.
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:16.140]   You have to light one with the other.
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:19.940]   So, uh, spoiler alert, Ian Fleming did not
[01:15:19.940 --> 01:15:23.500]   live to a ripe old age, dead at 57, but he
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:24.140]   did some damage.
[01:15:24.140 --> 01:15:24.700]   Anyway.
[01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:25.380]   So I'm listening to that.
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:27.740]   So, so more, more on that when we report
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.780]   on the July books.
[01:15:28.780 --> 01:15:31.100]   All right.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:32.300]   Let's talk briefly here.
[01:15:32.300 --> 01:15:37.220]   Speaking of Ian Fleming and carousing and the
[01:15:37.220 --> 01:15:39.860]   British drinking habits, let's talk about a
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:43.780]   sponsor that Ian Fleming wish wished had been
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:46.140]   around back when he was out at golden eye in
[01:15:46.140 --> 01:15:50.060]   Jamaica, and that is Z Biotics.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:53.140]   God bless the scientists of the world for
[01:15:53.140 --> 01:15:54.900]   working on the things that really matter.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:58.980]   Z Biotics is a pre alcohol probiotic.
[01:15:58.980 --> 01:16:01.700]   It is the world's first genetically
[01:16:01.700 --> 01:16:02.860]   engineered probiotic.
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:04.420]   We have our best and brightest minds working
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:07.060]   on this because this is what Z Biotics does.
[01:16:07.060 --> 01:16:12.300]   It takes the toxic by-product that's produced
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:14.820]   when your body metabolizes alcohol.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:19.780]   The thing that really causes the rough day
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:23.500]   after a night spent doing Ian Fleming style
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:28.900]   drinking, and it helps break it down, reducing
[01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:33.700]   the impact of your drinking more specifically
[01:16:33.700 --> 01:16:36.580]   Z Biotic produces an enzyme that enzyme breaks
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:39.340]   down this specific hole, this specific by-product.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:42.420]   This enzyme does the work that your liver
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:43.940]   would otherwise do, but it does it in your
[01:16:43.940 --> 01:16:45.660]   gut before it gets to your liver, before it
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:47.340]   starts to do its damage.
[01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:50.740]   You drink the Z Biotic before drinking the
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:53.580]   alcohol, then you of course, drink responsibly
[01:16:53.580 --> 01:16:56.100]   and get a good night's sleep and you will
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:58.180]   feel your best the next day.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:01.540]   If this was around in the 1950s, I believe
[01:17:01.540 --> 01:17:04.420]   Ian Fleming would have shipping containers
[01:17:04.420 --> 01:17:07.060]   of Z Biotics sent to him.
[01:17:07.060 --> 01:17:09.020]   And maybe actually he would have got a couple
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:10.580]   extra James Bond novels written, you know,
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.500]   I'm sure that guy had some rough mornings.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:15.260]   He had some rough mornings based on what,
[01:17:15.260 --> 01:17:17.260]   uh, based on what I read.
[01:17:17.260 --> 01:17:20.100]   So Z Biotics, I'm glad again, that our
[01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.900]   scientists are working on what is important.
[01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:23.860]   Never has there been a product that I was
[01:17:23.860 --> 01:17:27.140]   more motivated and inspired to thoroughly test.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:29.380]   So give Z Biotics a try for yourself.

[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:47.260]   So if you're unsatisfied for any reason,

[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.940]   No questions asked.
[01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.260]   So head to zbiotics.com.
[01:17:52.260 --> 01:17:57.740]   So that's the letter Z B I O T I C S zbiotics.com/cal

[01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:07.220]   Also want to talk about ExpressVPN.
[01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:10.940]   You should be using a VPN.
[01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.620]   If you are connecting to the internet away
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:16.340]   from your home, and even if you're connecting
[01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:18.380]   through your home, the way a VPN works is
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:21.060]   that instead of directly talking to the
[01:18:21.060 --> 01:18:23.580]   server service or website that you want to
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:25.900]   talk to, you instead make an encrypted
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:27.660]   connection to a VPN server.
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:29.620]   You tell that server over this encrypted
[01:18:29.620 --> 01:18:31.220]   connection, what service or website you're
[01:18:31.220 --> 01:18:31.740]   interested in.
[01:18:31.740 --> 01:18:34.300]   The server talks to that website or service
[01:18:34.300 --> 01:18:36.620]   on your behalf, and then passes back to
[01:18:36.620 --> 01:18:38.100]   response to the encrypted connection.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:40.260]   That means people nearby who are sniffing
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:40.820]   your packets.
[01:18:40.820 --> 01:18:42.500]   That means your internet service provider,
[01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:45.420]   which hint looks at what you do and sells
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:47.740]   that data, have no idea what you're up to.
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:49.020]   All they see is that you're sending
[01:18:49.020 --> 01:18:51.580]   encrypted packets out to a VPN server, and
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:54.700]   they do not know exactly how many hours you
[01:18:54.700 --> 01:18:58.020]   actually are spending at calnewport.com, as
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.500]   I assume most of you are doing.
[01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:02.180]   So VPNs are critical for using the internet
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:05.100]   in our current age of surveillance and
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:06.620]   unscrupulous data mining.
[01:19:06.620 --> 01:19:09.620]   If you're going to use a VPN, ExpressVPN
[01:19:09.620 --> 01:19:11.900]   is the service you need.
[01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:15.100]   They have servers everywhere.
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.060]   You're never going to be too far physically
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:17.740]   from a server.
[01:19:17.740 --> 01:19:20.020]   They have lightning fast connections.
[01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:21.700]   So you don't even notice that you're going
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:23.180]   through a VPN server.
[01:19:23.180 --> 01:19:25.180]   Their tech is great.
[01:19:25.180 --> 01:19:26.940]   It runs in the background on all of your
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:27.420]   devices.
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:29.300]   When you turn it on, you're then just using
[01:19:29.300 --> 01:19:31.020]   your services, your web browser, like normal,
[01:19:31.020 --> 01:19:32.500]   not even realizing that you're going through
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.260]   a VPN, great seamless experience.
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.380]   So you need to use a VPN and I recommend
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.500]   ExpressVPN as the best choice.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:42.980]   So if you're tired of all of these big tech
[01:19:42.980 --> 01:19:45.340]   and other unsavory actors tracking you and
[01:19:45.340 --> 01:19:46.940]   selling your personal data for profit, it's
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:47.940]   time to fight back.
[01:19:47.940 --> 01:19:53.100]   Visit ExpressVPN.com/deep right now to get
[01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.820]   three months of ExpressVPN for free.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:58.300]   That's ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:19:58.300 --> 01:20:01.780]   ExpressVPN.com/deep.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.380]   All right.
[01:20:04.380 --> 01:20:06.620]   I'm thinking we should do, Ooh, this is
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:08.260]   running, got a good length episode here.
[01:20:08.260 --> 01:20:09.500]   Let's do two more quick questions.
[01:20:09.500 --> 01:20:10.900]   Maybe one of them should be a call.
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.380]   Do we have a good call queued up?
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.020]   Yep.
[01:20:13.020 --> 01:20:13.700]   We do.
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:14.300]   All right.
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:15.700]   It's about slow productivity.
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:16.700]   Hi, Cal.
[01:20:16.780 --> 01:20:19.060]   My name's Robert from Nova Scotia, Canada,
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.300]   and I'm a process improvement consultant.
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:23.700]   And I've been thinking a lot lately about
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:26.060]   your scales of productivity, including
[01:20:26.060 --> 01:20:27.700]   your most recent interview on the Tim
[01:20:27.700 --> 01:20:31.140]   Fares podcast and in my role, I'm stuck
[01:20:31.140 --> 01:20:33.580]   between balancing slow productivity
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:34.700]   and billable hours.
[01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:37.420]   So my measure for productivity is billable
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:39.780]   hours, but it does seem very short term
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:40.420]   focused.
[01:20:40.420 --> 01:20:42.660]   I know in the longterm I can be more
[01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:45.740]   productive by doing activities such as
[01:20:45.740 --> 01:20:47.740]   building a better sales engine, creating
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:50.220]   better training programs, basically all
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:52.540]   of these other elements of being so good
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:54.700]   that our team can't be ignored that aren't
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:56.300]   associated with billable hours.
[01:20:56.300 --> 01:20:59.020]   So currently this has led to extra work
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:00.740]   in the evenings and weekends, which seems
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:03.340]   counterproductive to slow productivity.
[01:21:03.340 --> 01:21:05.740]   So do you have any recommendations for
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.780]   slow productivity for workers that are
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:09.180]   measured by billable hours?
[01:21:09.180 --> 01:21:09.860]   Thank you.
[01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:12.500]   Well, look, if you control your own
[01:21:12.500 --> 01:21:14.340]   destinies, let's say this is your own
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:17.260]   company, what you have to do, and it
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:19.020]   feels uncomfortable at first is you have
[01:21:19.020 --> 01:21:23.580]   to cap your billable hour time, freeing
[01:21:23.580 --> 01:21:26.140]   up more time to work on the longterm
[01:21:26.140 --> 01:21:27.540]   initiatives that are ultimately going to
[01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:30.900]   make your company more profitable.
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.020]   Maybe it's going to increase the
[01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:35.300]   billable hour rate you get, or preferably
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:37.420]   is going to move your business away from
[01:21:37.420 --> 01:21:39.940]   work payment per hours and towards
[01:21:39.940 --> 01:21:41.700]   something more scalable.
[01:21:41.700 --> 01:21:43.220]   So it could be uncomfortable to do
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.460]   because you feel like you're giving
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:48.140]   up money in the short term, but ends up
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:50.140]   being absolutely necessary to make
[01:21:50.140 --> 01:21:52.060]   more in the longterm.
[01:21:52.060 --> 01:21:54.060]   So that's what I would suggest.
[01:21:54.060 --> 01:21:56.140]   Now let's say you're at a revenue
[01:21:56.140 --> 01:21:57.580]   level that you can't go below.
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:22:00.780]   You're barely making the various expenses.
[01:22:00.780 --> 01:22:02.540]   Uh, you're barely getting to the
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:04.700]   expenses that your business unavoidably
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:06.740]   generates with the revenue you're getting.
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:07.460]   Okay.
[01:22:07.460 --> 01:22:08.980]   So now what you might have to do for a
[01:22:08.980 --> 01:22:11.460]   little while is extra work outside of
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.820]   those hours to make yourself more
[01:22:13.820 --> 01:22:15.180]   valuable, to make your company more
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:15.620]   valuable.
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.980]   And what you're trying to do here is
[01:22:16.980 --> 01:22:20.060]   as soon as possible, ask for more per hour.
[01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.340]   There's an interesting book.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:24.100]   Paul Jarvis wrote this book called
[01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.700]   company of one.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:26.660]   It's one of the books I'm actually
[01:22:26.660 --> 01:22:27.620]   rereading right now.
[01:22:27.620 --> 01:22:29.100]   One of the mini books I'm reading
[01:22:29.100 --> 01:22:30.020]   concurrently right now.
[01:22:30.020 --> 01:22:31.060]   So I'm refreshing myself.
[01:22:31.060 --> 01:22:32.940]   I blurbed this book years ago, but I'm
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:34.300]   refreshing myself on this book.
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:35.740]   And he said, one of the traps that
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:37.540]   people get in, in billable hours, when
[01:22:37.540 --> 01:22:38.460]   they, when they start to get more
[01:22:38.460 --> 01:22:43.020]   successful is they add more hours.
[01:22:43.020 --> 01:22:44.220]   There's more demand for me.
[01:22:44.220 --> 01:22:45.740]   So I add more hours of work
[01:22:45.740 --> 01:22:46.820]   so I can make more money.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:47.980]   And he says he actually, the right
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:49.700]   thing to do in that instance is
[01:22:49.700 --> 01:22:50.660]   probably the opposite.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.500]   If there's more demand for my work,
[01:22:52.500 --> 01:22:54.420]   I should ask for more money.
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:58.340]   And now I can actually reduce the total
[01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.660]   number of hours I'm working while
[01:22:59.660 --> 01:23:02.060]   keeping the revenue the same.
[01:23:02.060 --> 01:23:04.700]   That's the alternative.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:06.180]   And often it's the right alternative
[01:23:06.180 --> 01:23:07.540]   is I get better and better.
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.700]   Instead of trying to make more money,
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:11.580]   which means working more hours, I
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.540]   could actually try to work less
[01:23:13.540 --> 01:23:14.740]   time for the same money.
[01:23:14.740 --> 01:23:16.660]   So you have to ask for more
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:17.900]   money as you earn it.
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:19.820]   Then you don't have to work as many
[01:23:19.820 --> 01:23:22.300]   hours to generate the same revenue.
[01:23:22.300 --> 01:23:24.340]   Now you can spend that extra time
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:25.300]   improving your business.
[01:23:25.300 --> 01:23:28.500]   Now you make even more per hour that
[01:23:28.500 --> 01:23:30.060]   you work or eventually even move past
[01:23:30.060 --> 01:23:31.420]   the billable hours and get to a sweet
[01:23:31.420 --> 01:23:32.900]   spot where you're working the
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:33.980]   amount you want to work.
[01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:35.540]   You're more than comfortable with
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:36.740]   the money that you're making.
[01:23:36.980 --> 01:23:39.020]   It's a very good sustainable place to be
[01:23:39.020 --> 01:23:41.180]   good, slow product to be target, good
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:43.180]   foundation for a deep life.
[01:23:43.180 --> 01:23:44.380]   Now I've been to Nova Scotia.
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.260]   It's beautiful up there and
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:47.340]   you need your downtime.
[01:23:47.340 --> 01:23:51.300]   You need to go get out the Cape Breton.
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:53.260]   Do some references here.
[01:23:53.260 --> 01:23:55.980]   Go down to Louisburg, Louisburg,
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.660]   get out to Prince Edward Island.
[01:23:57.660 --> 01:23:59.180]   You can't do that if you're up all
[01:23:59.180 --> 01:24:00.540]   night doing billable hours.
[01:24:00.540 --> 01:24:03.740]   So there is my advice for that.
[01:24:03.740 --> 01:24:05.620]   All right, let's end with a deeper
[01:24:05.620 --> 01:24:07.180]   question here that comes from Kevin.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:10.380]   Kevin said, I've recently been reading
[01:24:10.380 --> 01:24:12.180]   the classic seven habits of highly
[01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:15.020]   effective people and are wondering
[01:24:15.020 --> 01:24:17.380]   what the seven or choose the
[01:24:17.380 --> 01:24:18.780]   appropriate number of principles of
[01:24:18.780 --> 01:24:20.900]   deep life are of the deep life are.
[01:24:20.900 --> 01:24:22.700]   I, what are the fundamental truths
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:24.060]   that have universal application
[01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:26.500]   to cultivating the deep life?
[01:24:26.500 --> 01:24:29.740]   Well, Kevin, I don't have a full,
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:31.340]   fully developed answer to that yet.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.900]   I will, by the time I'm done writing
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:35.220]   my deep life book, but I'm writing
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:36.620]   my slow productivity book first.
[01:24:36.620 --> 01:24:38.020]   So for now I'm just playing
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:39.380]   with ideas in the background.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:42.740]   But let me give you three right now.
[01:24:42.740 --> 01:24:45.020]   Extracted from some of the notes I've
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.620]   been taking as I, as I look ahead to
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:47.740]   the process of writing my deep
[01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:48.700]   life book in the future.
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:49.420]   Right.
[01:24:49.420 --> 01:24:51.540]   Idea number one, this is my current
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:53.940]   tentative formulation for what
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:55.060]   the deep life requires.
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:58.260]   The deep life requires the radical
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:24:59.860]   alignment of your daily existence.
[01:24:59.860 --> 01:25:01.980]   Towards things you value and
[01:25:01.980 --> 01:25:04.020]   away from things you don't.
[01:25:05.020 --> 01:25:05.180]   All right.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:06.980]   There's three pieces to that formulation.
[01:25:06.980 --> 01:25:08.540]   All right.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:12.020]   One, you have to shift your life,
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:14.180]   where you live, what you do for work,
[01:25:14.180 --> 01:25:16.060]   how you work, how you fill your time,
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:18.500]   whatever you have to shift major
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.060]   elements of your life towards
[01:25:20.060 --> 01:25:21.140]   things you really care about.
[01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:22.980]   So there's this intentional shaping
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:24.300]   of your life towards things you care
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:27.100]   about to the shift should be radical.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:31.220]   So there's something deep and meaning
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:33.580]   generating about making big shifts.
[01:25:34.180 --> 01:25:35.900]   So it's not just, I'm trying
[01:25:35.900 --> 01:25:37.060]   not to work on weekends.
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:39.820]   It's you radically changed your job so
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:41.860]   that you're working half days, four days
[01:25:41.860 --> 01:25:43.300]   a week, it's the radical shift.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.140]   It's not just, I want to hike more.
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:49.060]   It's I moved the Vancouver island
[01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:51.020]   where I live among the woods, right?
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:51.860]   The, the, something about the
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.780]   radicality helps unlock depth.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:55.580]   And the third piece of this formulation
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:25:57.700]   is to focus more on the things that
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:26:00.020]   value you have to pretty severely
[01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:01.460]   reduce all the things that don't.
[01:26:03.980 --> 01:26:05.260]   So there's a simplification that
[01:26:05.260 --> 01:26:06.340]   seems to come with the deep life.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:07.780]   The, the, the focus on one thing,
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:10.260]   you have to excise more of the other
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:11.300]   things and not just getting rid of
[01:26:11.300 --> 01:26:13.140]   the things that are bad, but also
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.180]   being willing to step away from
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.060]   the things that are fine.
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:15.860]   Just not as good as the
[01:26:15.860 --> 01:26:16.940]   things you really care about.
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:18.700]   So you can't have all the different things.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.300]   All right.
[01:26:20.300 --> 01:26:24.060]   Idea two, that transformation requires
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:27.540]   practice, so it's hard to make
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:28.500]   big changes in your life.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:30.420]   It's hard in two ways.
[01:26:30.780 --> 01:26:33.140]   One, just building up the muscle and
[01:26:33.140 --> 01:26:35.580]   the discipline of controlling being
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.500]   very efficacious about directing your life.
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:39.420]   That's why on this podcast, I often
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:42.260]   talk about the deep life bucket exercise.
[01:26:42.260 --> 01:26:43.780]   You identify the buckets of the deep
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:45.340]   life and you do the keystone habit in
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:47.620]   each, and then you spend six to eight
[01:26:47.620 --> 01:26:49.660]   weeks dedicated to each bucket, doing
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:51.100]   a transformation of that piece of your life.
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:53.500]   A big part of that is practice.
[01:26:53.500 --> 01:26:56.180]   Getting used to intentionality and
[01:26:56.180 --> 01:26:57.420]   discipline in the shaping of your life.
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:58.780]   That actually does take some work.
[01:27:00.340 --> 01:27:01.420]   The other thing that benefits
[01:27:01.420 --> 01:27:03.260]   from practice is insight.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:06.100]   Insight on what matters to you and
[01:27:06.100 --> 01:27:07.940]   what doesn't and the nuances of how
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:10.700]   something matters is often extracted
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:15.140]   as a side effect of action in doing
[01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.380]   something, trying something, making this
[01:27:17.380 --> 01:27:19.700]   change, taking this month off, putting
[01:27:19.700 --> 01:27:23.060]   on this routine, praying five times a day.
[01:27:23.060 --> 01:27:24.220]   Whatever it is to change you make it's
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:25.620]   in the actual friction generated by
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:27.140]   taking that action that you gain.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:28.740]   Ooh, our timer went off, Jesse.
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:32.660]   That you actually gain insight.
[01:27:32.660 --> 01:27:35.100]   And by the way, for those who are
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:36.820]   watching at home, you hear me reference
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.260]   a timer, I'll hold it up to the camera
[01:27:38.260 --> 01:27:42.140]   here, a reader or a listener sent us.
[01:27:42.140 --> 01:27:42.740]   Dave Z.
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:44.900]   Dave Z sent us this, what's it called,
[01:27:44.900 --> 01:27:45.180]   Jesse?
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.580]   Focus timer.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:48.220]   Focus timer, so free plug.
[01:27:48.220 --> 01:27:50.740]   For those who are listening,
[01:27:50.740 --> 01:27:54.580]   it is a plastic hourglass.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.900]   Yeah, it's basically to avoid
[01:27:55.900 --> 01:27:57.140]   using your phone for a timer.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:57.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.420 --> 01:27:59.060]   And it has, I haven't quite figured it out.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.020]   We just opened the box before the episode,
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:02.740]   but it has led lights to indicate how
[01:28:02.740 --> 01:28:04.020]   full it is or not full it is.
[01:28:04.020 --> 01:28:05.300]   And when you twist it, it does something
[01:28:05.300 --> 01:28:07.940]   and you turn it over and it anyways, once
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:09.660]   you learn how to use it, you can basically
[01:28:09.660 --> 01:28:11.940]   set a timer and run it and just watch
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:14.540]   led sand move down through a, through a.
[01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:15.700]   Hourglass.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:18.380]   So you can time yourself without having
[01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.060]   to look at digital numbers on a, on a phone.
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:21.380]   So was it Dave Z?
[01:28:21.380 --> 01:28:22.060]   Dave Z.
[01:28:22.060 --> 01:28:22.500]   Dave Z.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:23.140]   Thank you very much.
[01:28:23.140 --> 01:28:24.300]   That's what went off for those who are
[01:28:24.300 --> 01:28:26.460]   listening, just went off during our recording
[01:28:26.460 --> 01:28:29.100]   here, but the point I was making before
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:31.300]   the, the focus timer went off is.
[01:28:31.300 --> 01:28:33.340]   Through action, you gain insight.
[01:28:33.340 --> 01:28:35.060]   In fact, action is often a better route
[01:28:35.060 --> 01:28:37.380]   to insight than mere reflection.
[01:28:37.380 --> 01:28:39.900]   It's why a lot of the great wisdom
[01:28:39.900 --> 01:28:41.020]   traditions of the world have
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:42.460]   so much ritual involved.
[01:28:42.460 --> 01:28:43.420]   You can't just sit.
[01:28:43.420 --> 01:28:46.940]   You can't just sit and think about Torah.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:49.340]   You actually have to do the five-time
[01:28:49.340 --> 01:28:50.740]   daily or whatever it's three-time daily
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:53.260]   prayer, you have to go through the, the
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:55.940]   rituals of the, the days of awe that do
[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:57.660]   ritual through activity, through commitment.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:29:00.220]   You gain insight that applies
[01:29:00.220 --> 01:29:01.100]   to life transformation too.
[01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.300]   So you're not just going to sit here
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:03.780]   and watch documentaries and read books
[01:29:03.780 --> 01:29:05.020]   and get inspired and figure out, you
[01:29:05.020 --> 01:29:06.900]   actually have to take action at a smaller
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.660]   scale to get the insight needed to take
[01:29:08.660 --> 01:29:10.740]   successful action at the larger scale.
[01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:14.700]   Third idea, Kevin, a career capital
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.980]   theory is often the fuel of the deep life.
[01:29:17.980 --> 01:29:20.540]   So the universe doesn't care
[01:29:20.540 --> 01:29:21.860]   about your values and dreams.
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:25.460]   And so if your radical change is not
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:28.060]   practical or sustainable, the stress and
[01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:29.500]   uncertainty that it creates, let's say
[01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:31.660]   financially or otherwise is going to
[01:29:31.660 --> 01:29:33.660]   counteract the potential benefits.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:36.900]   So deep life transitions are most
[01:29:36.900 --> 01:29:38.500]   successful when they're made with a.
[01:29:38.500 --> 01:29:42.180]   Foundation of confidence, financially
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.380]   speaking, I don't healthcare, education,
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:45.340]   connection, whatever the things are you
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:46.500]   worry about that you're able to make
[01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:48.740]   this with confidence, career capital is
[01:29:48.740 --> 01:29:50.740]   going to be your buddy in this mission
[01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:51.500]   becoming so good.
[01:29:51.500 --> 01:29:52.180]   You can't be ignored.
[01:29:52.180 --> 01:29:54.100]   It skills gives you leverage.
[01:29:54.100 --> 01:29:55.660]   You can use that leverage to shape your
[01:29:55.660 --> 01:29:57.020]   career towards things that resonate and
[01:29:57.020 --> 01:29:59.500]   away from things that don't shifting
[01:29:59.500 --> 01:30:01.500]   towards a deep life is the ultimate
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:02.660]   example of shifting your life
[01:30:02.660 --> 01:30:03.540]   towards things that resonate.
[01:30:03.540 --> 01:30:05.460]   You might need to build up a pretty big.
[01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:08.860]   Pool of career capital to make that happen.
[01:30:08.860 --> 01:30:10.460]   So this goes contrary.
[01:30:10.460 --> 01:30:11.660]   A lot of times when people think about
[01:30:11.660 --> 01:30:12.740]   something like the deep life, it's all
[01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:14.460]   about the inspiration and the boldness,
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:17.220]   but it's actually often the, the, the
[01:30:17.220 --> 01:30:18.740]   focus of getting really good at something
[01:30:18.740 --> 01:30:20.340]   valuable that's most important.
[01:30:20.340 --> 01:30:22.340]   That's what opens up the options for
[01:30:22.340 --> 01:30:24.980]   you to sustainably try something different.
[01:30:24.980 --> 01:30:27.140]   All right, Kevin, that's tentative, but
[01:30:27.140 --> 01:30:30.300]   that's some of my recent thoughts on.
[01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.180]   Successfully identifying and
[01:30:33.180 --> 01:30:35.140]   transitioning to a deep life.
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:37.340]   Now, if only my book will sell as many
[01:30:37.340 --> 01:30:39.780]   as Stephen cubby, seven habits.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:41.940]   I think we will all be happy.
[01:30:41.940 --> 01:30:44.500]   That might be one of the bestselling
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:45.740]   advice books of all time.
[01:30:45.740 --> 01:30:47.020]   Yeah, probably.
[01:30:47.020 --> 01:30:47.460]   I think so.
[01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:49.180]   It's like 30 million copies or something.
[01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:50.580]   It's crazy.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:53.220]   I mean, look, I don't wanna be greedy.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:54.980]   I'd be okay with a half that.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:30:56.020]   It's a good title.
[01:30:56.020 --> 01:30:58.380]   Yeah, it's a good title, but I think
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:30:59.820]   people give too much credit to titles.
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:01.620]   It sells more books, right?
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:01.860]   Yeah.
[01:31:01.860 --> 01:31:04.460]   But if the book is not, I've been in the
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:07.060]   business long enough to know books sell a
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:08.540]   lot of copies because they, they hit a
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:11.340]   cord with people, they just hit the right
[01:31:11.340 --> 01:31:13.940]   cord and they, people pass them on to
[01:31:13.940 --> 01:31:15.140]   other people, pass them on to other people.
[01:31:15.140 --> 01:31:17.580]   The titles can help, but this idea that,
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.500]   you know, Mark Manson sold 18 million
[01:31:21.500 --> 01:31:23.900]   copies of the subtle art of not giving an
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:25.420]   F word because the F word was in it.
[01:31:25.420 --> 01:31:26.180]   It's crazy.
[01:31:26.180 --> 01:31:28.860]   It's because the book was the perfect tone
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.740]   on the perfect topic to reach a
[01:31:30.740 --> 01:31:32.420]   perfectly large audience.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:34.700]   Seven habits is great, but everyone wrote
[01:31:34.700 --> 01:31:36.540]   books with seven in the title after that.
[01:31:36.540 --> 01:31:37.820]   It's not the title.
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:40.980]   It was a, uh, values driven approach to
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.380]   productivity, which is as relevant
[01:31:42.380 --> 01:31:43.420]   today as it was back then.
[01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:46.220]   And it's, it's, it's a really good book.
[01:31:46.220 --> 01:31:48.540]   Deep work sold a lot of copies.
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:49.860]   I mean, I think the phrase deep work is
[01:31:49.860 --> 01:31:52.380]   good, but it's also just hit the zeitgeist
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:54.220]   at a time where people were intuiting.
[01:31:54.220 --> 01:31:57.300]   Something negative about the distraction
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.820]   and the freneticism of their, of their
[01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:00.180]   working life, and they couldn't quite put
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:01.660]   their finger on it and the book, put their
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.020]   finger on it in a way they could then
[01:32:03.020 --> 01:32:04.380]   articulate to others.
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:06.460]   And, you know, million copies
[01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:08.020]   later, that thing spread.
[01:32:08.020 --> 01:32:09.660]   So I'm a believer titles kind of matter,
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:13.020]   but a title cannot make a book
[01:32:13.020 --> 01:32:13.980]   into a massive seller.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:14.660]   That makes sense.
[01:32:14.660 --> 01:32:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:15.780]   That's my theory.
[01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.940]   All right.
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:19.460]   Well, we've gone, Ooh, hour 30.
[01:32:19.460 --> 01:32:20.700]   We haven't done hour 30 in a while.
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:21.620]   I feel good about that,
[01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:22.700]   but we should wrap it up.
[01:32:22.700 --> 01:32:26.220]   So thank you everyone for listening.
