[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500]   you have made comments saying that you would never wife someone who has a child with someone in the
[00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.280]   league so my question to you is like what inspired you to feel that way what comments are you
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.300]   specifically talking about i think i think you're talking about when he said that he wouldn't wife
[00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:18.960]   somebody that was already oh that had talked to an athlete yeah i feel like if you dated like
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.420]   publicly like a player it would be hard just because of it would be tough dating someone's
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.740]   old girl and they just always have that like over you takes a very understanding person i want to
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.380]   take on that role when you're going into life with a woman who has a child it's something that i've
[00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.860]   always thought i would steer away from could be like an ego thing or like a insecurity thing i don't know
[00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.760]   it could be i'm open to change i'm not stuck in my ways
