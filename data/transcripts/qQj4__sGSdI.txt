[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620]   Hey everyone, this is Tony again, and before we dive into today's episode, I want to ask you a favor.
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.960]   We love to serve you in this podcast and we want this podcast to serve you even better in 2020 and beyond.
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.480]   And to do this means we need to hear from you. We need to know you.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.660]   We need to understand more about what you're thinking when it comes to this podcast. What do you like?
[00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.540]   What do you not like about this podcast? Tell us. Go online to DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:32.940]   That's DesiringGod.org/survey. And I'll mention this address again at the end of today's episode, which starts right now.
[00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:42.800]   Well, Pastor John and I recorded a handful of episodes live and in person in Nashville this summer,
[00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.680]   and we ended our live recording session with an audience question about parenting non-Christian teenagers.
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.420]   Here's the question and Pastor John's response.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.860]   We got some really important valuable emails from people in this room who are parenting non-Christian teenagers.
[00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.200]   Teenagers who have not made a profession of faith. A number of questions have to do with like enforcing church attendance.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.480]   We heard from a woman named Angela who grew up going to Roman Catholic Mass every Sunday.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.740]   Her dad made her go. You have to go. You have to go. So she started to resent Christianity.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.580]   She later came to the faith, married a godly man, is now involved in a wonderful church.
[00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.020]   But she looks back on that and wonders as you're parenting teens, especially in the mid to late teen years,
[00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.460]   and they have made no profession of faith, they don't have any interest in the gospel or church.
[00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.580]   How much do you enforce church attendance? Where do you draw that line between
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.220]   expecting them to attend a church meeting on Sundays and
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.480]   being patient with them and not making Christianity come across as though it's something being enforced upon them?
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.280]   I can't just jump in to a 16 year old, 17 year old
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.080]   behavior without backing up a little bit. And I know that's not the question being asked, but let me just say
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.720]   we're not God and we do not
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   create our teenagers
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.360]   completely, but partly. Okay.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.320]   We start rearing teenagers when they're in the womb.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:18.500]   How we pray for them in the womb. We affect the behavior of a teenager when they're two
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.740]   years old.
[00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.500]   I watch a lot of young parents today.
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.820]   They seem to believe you cannot control the behavior of a child or that it's wrong to.
[00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:33.420]   Child's making an absolute mess or chaos of every relationship and every dinner meeting, every
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.700]   grocery store, and the parent seems powerless. That's not helpful for teenagers.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.500]   It's coming, you know, 12, 13 years later. So a little child needs to feel
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.580]   profoundly
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.540]   secure,
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.540]   profoundly loved,
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.940]   cherished,
[00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.940]   enjoyed, and
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.940]   profoundly under authority. And those are not contradictory and every child knows it.
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.220]   Children want
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.900]   boundaries and
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.900]   massive love inside the boundaries.
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.900]   And so there's the setup that I would love to see happen.
[00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:22.180]   So that even when at 14 or 15 or 16 a child starts to question and says finally on one scary
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.580]   awful night, "Daddy, I
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.540]   don't believe this anymore. Don't think I ever did."
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.300]   That the structure of parenting at that point is such
[00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.900]   that they may not be a wild-eyed rebel against the family,
[00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.500]   but almost a broken-hearted
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.380]   rebel against the family. Maybe. I mean it's all a continuum, right?
[00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:54.740]   We got kids who are just viciously opposed to mom and dad for whatever and others who are compliant, but unbelieving.
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.740]   Yeah. And what you do on that
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.500]   continuum in the middle is really difficult.
[00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.420]   I would say if you have a child who after a very serious...
[00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:12.180]   I mean you've got to avoid rage here because I'll tell you everything in you will just collapse at that news, right?
[00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:19.260]   My child that I've invested in for 15 years has told me that the most precious thing in my life is not precious to him.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:25.220]   That's just about as bad as it gets, right? That's worse than death. It's worse than death.
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.020]   So they tell you and
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.020]   you've got to avoid rage and
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:39.620]   dig in and try to draw out and listen with everything you're worth because stuff is going on you don't know.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.900]   You do not know what's going on in this kid. You don't know what he heard at church.
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:48.140]   You don't know what he heard at school. You don't know what his friends are treating him.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:55.060]   You don't know anything because he hasn't come forth and you you got to patiently dig in and and then affirm,
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.580]   "I'm gonna love you no matter what. You're my son. You're my daughter. I'm gonna love you no matter what."
[00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.140]   Then you say,
[00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.340]   "This is a Christian home.
[00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:12.220]   Mom and dad set the tone here. Mom and dad are the authority here and this is a Christian home.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.780]   We have Christian standards. We have Christian practices. While you're part of this house,
[00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.100]   we don't expect you to be fake.
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.820]   We're not saying that the behavior we expect is a
[00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:32.340]   covering, a hypocritical covering for faith so that you can look good to the world and make us look better.
[00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.340]   We want nothing to do with that kind of hypocrisy.
[00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.620]   We just want you to comply with these
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:45.700]   standards while you're here. If by the time you're ready to go, they're not yours. Gonna love you.
[00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.300]   You'll go. You'll set your own pattern and see what you can get.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.780]   I mean a kid who's big,
[00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.480]   I'm thinking boys now because I had four boys and then a girl, a kid who's big and is strong
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:06.120]   cannot go if he doesn't want to go. Just get in the car and drive away or he'll leave. You can't make
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:11.940]   kids do if they're that rebellious. You can't make them.
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:16.300]   But I think you should try and you do it in a real
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.020]   honest face-to-face, give meaning to it.
[00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:25.340]   Here's what going to church would mean for you as an unbeliever with us on Sunday morning at age 15.
[00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:31.020]   Here's what it would mean. It would mean I respect my mom and dad. They brought me into this world.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.380]   They invested in me for 15 years. They're paying me for my food and lodging. They're probably gonna help me go to college.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.500]   I owe them some respect. They want me to go to church.
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:46.460]   I'm gonna go and sit there and they know it doesn't mean anything to me and I know it doesn't mean anything and so does the
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.020]   pastor.
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.020]   And I'm there and
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.940]   the hope for my parents is that I'll hear something that would lead me to Christ.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.260]   My hope is that I can survive and get out of there as soon as possible.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.740]   So that's the kind of negotiation you would do.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.140]   But I will admit that there are going to be situations where you say to a 16, 17, 18 year old
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:12.460]   son, daughter, we do
[00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.620]   not have
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:20.900]   boyfriends over to sleep here in this house or girlfriends. We don't do that.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:27.820]   If you insist on that, you can't live here. So you will draw a line eventually, but
[00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:34.540]   one of my pastoral strategies and I found it so helpful is that people would come to me at the end of services with the most
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:37.260]   mind-boggling
[00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.900]   situations in life that I'd never even thought of and I would generally see them
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.900]   conceiving of them in
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:45.980]   realities.
[00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:51.940]   This horrible thing or this glorious thing is going to happen. Help me decide
[00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.460]   how to navigate this. And I would say
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.860]   God is God and he's never shut into those two things.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:02.980]   There's always a third option and
[00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.500]   I would say let's pray to see if
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:10.860]   something you've never even imagined could happen right here could happen.
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:15.900]   We just pray for it because I don't have an answer for them, but God has an answer. That's really good.
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:18.940]   We should do this again.
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:25.740]   This is great.
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.620]   Thank you for listening to the podcast. Thanks for sending in your questions.
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:32.860]   Pastor John has to get back to Minneapolis. Got to catch a flight. Thank you Pastor John. Appreciate it.
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:42.580]   So good. What a great memory. Thinking back to that session and that was the end of our first live recording together.
[00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:46.940]   Pastor John and I this summer in Nashville and it seemed to go so well.
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:51.380]   We're planning to do it again in April at Together for the Gospel in Louisville.
[00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:58.560]   Check the T4G schedule for that session and I'm sure we'll see many of you there. Looking forward to that.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:04.260]   Next up, will God give my future spouse a similar calling to the calling he's given me?
[00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:08.860]   How much should we expect marriage to be a matching of vocational callings?
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:12.100]   It's a great question from a single woman on Friday.
[00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:18.140]   And until then, if you're willing to help us out, fill out our online survey. And several of you already have. Thank you.
[00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:27.180]   If you want to join them and help us out, go to DesiringGod.org/survey. That's DesiringGod.org/survey.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:29.420]   Thanks.
[00:09:30.300 --> 00:09:32.300]   You
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.360]   you
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
