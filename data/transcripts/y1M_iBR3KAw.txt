[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.040]   A really crucial question comes into us from podcast listener Amy who writes this
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.120]   Dear Pastor John, please don't read this as accusatory. I'm just wanting to understand
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.200]   Throughout the Bible the theme seems to be that God can use bad people for his good
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:27.880]   So my question is how can God be most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him when he uses people like Judas?
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.120]   Iscariot
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.560]   He even uses Satan for his own purposes
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.200]   If God is most glorified in us only when we do good that seems to simplify his majesty. How would you explain this?
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.440]   Well, first of all, no offense taken at all. It's a great
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.240]   question
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.240]   I've had to clarify this in fact several times because my motto
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.780]   Does seem to some people anyway to rule out?
[00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.800]   God being glorified in his works of justice and his works of
[00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.360]   Wrath, I mean I say God is most glorified in us when we are most
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.640]   Satisfied in him and that seems to indicate to some people. Whoa, so God can't get glory when he does hard and
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.200]   Just and wrathful things towards unbelievers
[00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.400]   for example Exodus 14
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:30.920]   4 I will harden Pharaoh's heart and he will pursue Israel and I will get glory
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.200]   over Pharaoh and
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.800]   all his host
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.400]   In the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord and people hear that and they say whoa Piper's motto
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.000]   Doesn't seem to make any room for that or Exodus 14 17. I
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.560]   Will harden the hearts of the Egyptians so that they will go in into the Red Sea after Israel and I will get glory
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.720]   Over Pharaoh and all his host his chariots his horsemen
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.200]   So when I say that God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in him
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.560]   I don't mean that God can't be glorified in people who are not
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.640]   Satisfied in him like Pharaoh and his soldiers and I don't mean that God
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.120]   settles for a
[00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.120]   display of less
[00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.720]   glory in the universe when he glorifies his justice in the judgment of
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.760]   unbelievers
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.560]   Then he would have if he'd if he'd gotten everybody saved in and they were all fully satisfied in him
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:41.040]   It my motto doesn't go there doesn't mean that God God knows exactly
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:49.480]   How to put all his attributes on the greatest display with mercy and grace and wisdom and power
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:57.760]   patience and righteousness and wrath all taking their perfect place on the canvas of
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.040]   History that God is is painting. Yes. So when the question comes out of that conviction, I say yes
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.240]   Amen what I mean by the words
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.920]   God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in him. Is that this is true about us?
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.880]   Us
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.560]   Believers, I'm trying to answer the question. How do I John Piper as a believer?
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.440]   glorify God
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.840]   Most do I glorify him most?
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.080]   by being
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.960]   Partially satisfied in him do I show he is?
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.880]   gloriously all-satisfying
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:47.640]   Best by not being fully satisfied in him. Do I glorify him by?
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.960]   pursuing
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:58.200]   merely external obedience to Christian rules as if my heart and its joy in him doesn't really matter do I
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.040]   glorify him by
[00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:01.720]   ignoring the command
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.520]   serve the Lord with
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:10.240]   Gladness as if serving him were all that matters and with gladness can just be struck out of that command
[00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:17.160]   Do I glorify him most by not pursuing Psalm 16 11 with all my heart in your presence is?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.520]   fullness of joy at your right hand our pleasures forevermore
[00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:27.200]   My answer is no I John Piper the believer who wants to live for the glory of God
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:29.280]   most I
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.560]   glorify God
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.600]   Most when I am most satisfied in him
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.440]   If I treat him as
[00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:40.560]   minimally satisfying I
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.560]   John Piper the sinner in that act am not glorifying him as I ought
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.120]   now if God takes my sins and
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.640]   My failures to treasure him and someday makes all of those failures
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:59.880]   serve his
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.520]   Glory that that will not have been my doing I'm talking about my doing
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.160]   He will not have been glorified in me in my conscious intention to glorify him
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   He will not have been glorified in me in me. He will have been dishonored by
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Sin, and I don't want that to be true for me. So I'm asking the question. How can I?
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.560]   Most glorify him and so I say with great longing in my heart
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.320]   Not to do that
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.400]   God is
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.400]   glorified in me
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.680]   most
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:42.640]   When I am most satisfied in him
[00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:51.640]   Amen, thank you pastor John for shining light on the importance of the affections and magnifying God and keeping the stress here over and over
