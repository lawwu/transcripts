[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120]   Let's talk about guilt and shame.
[00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.120]   Yes.
[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.840]   I've heard some kind of catchphrase-y stuff, not from you, but like, oh, you know, guilt
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.720]   is about the thing you did and shame is a feeling about who we are.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:20.760]   And you know, while I'm not against those sort of 1990s, early 2000s kind of psychology-isms,
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.280]   I feel like they're not very useful.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:31.920]   How do you define, no pressure here, but how do you define guilt versus shame and what
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   about guilt and shame?
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.920]   Great.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.920]   Two of my favorite topics.
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.600]   I have a couple of different ways of defining things.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.040]   Unlike you, to me, I like defining things in ways that are very concrete and very usable.
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.040]   That's all.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.480]   And if there's multiple ways of doing that, that's great.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.580]   So the way I think about guilt, and this will probably set us off in a direction about what
[00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:58.440]   is not guilt also, is guilt is a feeling I have when I act out of alignment with my values.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.440]   And in that way, guilt is a really useful feeling, real useful, because it makes me
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.080]   reflect on, wait, I didn't act in line with my values.
[00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.920]   I wonder why.
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.240]   What would I have had to do differently?
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.240]   What got in my way?
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.320]   Well, I'm so glad I have that information from my body to have this deeply uncomfortable
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.800]   feeling to set in that process, right?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.040]   So if I yell at my kid, I'm going to feel guilty, right?
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.620]   I think about a time when my kid told me, "You know, I lied to you.
[00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.360]   I did take that eraser from that kid in school, and I feel really guilty."
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.040]   And I said, "First of all, I'm so glad you told me that.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:37.520]   I'm so glad you're feeling guilty.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.520]   That's the right way to feel.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.440]   Now, there must have been something so hard about seeing something so shiny and fun that
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.440]   you don't have.
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.880]   I totally get that."
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.240]   And you're right.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.160]   It's not in your values to take it.
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:50.600]   So that's a useful feeling.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.520]   That feeling is going to help you not do something like that again.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.640]   Let's figure out what you can do, not just to say, "Sorry, this is what parents miss.
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.640]   You know what's going to happen another time?
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.520]   You're going to see something else pretty cool, someone's cubby, and you know what most
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.520]   people think?
[00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.040]   I'm going to take that."
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.040]   You're going to have to think again.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.040]   I would too.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.440]   What can you do the next time you have that thought, right?
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.640]   All of this comes because of guilt.
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.680]   Useful feeling.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.920]   Guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment with your values.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.120]   Now, to me, guilt is one of the most misunderstood feelings because what you hear all the time
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.040]   -- and you'll hear how much it kind of conflicts with this definition -- is something like
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.040]   this.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.320]   "I haven't seen my friends in years.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:38.720]   There's finally a dinner, but it would require me not to put my kid down to sleep."
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:39.720]   You know?
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.920]   And if I'm talking to someone, I'd say, "Okay, well, I'm guessing you're not leaving your
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.920]   kid alone."
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.920]   Now, again, my husband or my mom, someone who's a totally safe adult.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.680]   "But, Becky, I told my kid, and she was clinging to me like, 'No, Mommy, I needed to be you.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.680]   I needed to be you.'
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.320]   And so I'm not going to dinner -- do you know what I'm going to say, Andrew?
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.440]   -- because I feel so guilty."
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.680]   This is -- right.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.800]   "Oh, someone asked me to be in the PTA meeting, and I'm so busy, I can't, but I can't do it
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.960]   because I feel so guilty."
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.960]   Okay.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.480]   Again, I'm just curious -- I say, "Well, it sounds like you really want to go to dinner
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   with your friends."
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.960]   She's like, "Oh, I do.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.440]   All I do as a parent these days, I literally haven't seen these friends in years.
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   They're in town."
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.560]   And I said, "Tell me about your friendships.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:31.520]   I mean, you value my --" "Yes, I know that I'm kind of more than just someone who puts
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.320]   down my kid for bed, and I love doing that, but this matters, too."
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.520]   So I said, "This is really interesting.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.520]   You really value your friendships.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.040]   Your life right now feels out of balance in that your friendships, that part of your burner
[00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.040]   of your stove is, like, really low, okay, and you're not going because you feel guilty.
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   I just want to share an idea.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.400]   Guilt is a feeling you have when you act out of alignment with your values.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.880]   It seems like going to dinner would be in line with your values."
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.400]   And almost -- it's like, "Yeah, that's true.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.200]   So what is this feeling?"
[00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.120]   And here's what I think the feeling is.
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.840]   I call it "not guilt" just because I haven't figured out a more sophisticated term, but
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.480]   here's what I think is happening.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:15.920]   A lot of us, especially women, when we were growing up, we learned to notice everyone's
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:24.600]   feelings around us, and we learned that our value, really, and our worth, really, and
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:32.400]   we were kind of best and good girls when we took care of everyone else's feelings except
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.080]   for our own.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:41.920]   I think so many young girls, especially, become expert at what people need of them
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.120]   by becoming distant from what they need for themselves.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.640]   The picture I get in my mind is sort of like having an antennae cast in every direction
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.800]   except perhaps at the exclusion of paying attention to the antennae that are inward.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.480]   And we are -- you know, attentional resources are finite.
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:06.120]   I mean, we just don't have the capacity to, like, respond to other people's emotions and
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.760]   feel at the same time to the same degree that we would if we just concentrated on theirs
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760]   or our emotions.
[00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.280]   I mean, that's just a fact of how humans work.
[00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.120]   Yeah, and kids are oriented by attachment.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.600]   They have to learn with their families, "How do I become the most lovable, safest version
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   of myself?"
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:20.600]   So I have a friend who -- it's true.
[00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.120]   I remember her.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.920]   Even in middle school, I can't come.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.440]   My dad's traveling, and my mom really needs me to stay home and watch a movie with her,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   right?
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   And I know this mom well.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.860]   "Oh, you don't love me.
[00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.860]   You don't --" right?
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.720]   I mean, this was -- so she became expert at always noticing other people's emotions and
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:44.800]   not only noticing them, taking the emotions from them, kind of like taking them into their
[00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.080]   body and almost metabolizing them for them.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.800]   That's not guilt.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:06:00.340]   That is taking someone else's emotions and taking them into your body at the expense
[00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.900]   of taking care of your own needs.
[00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.200]   And so I have a visual for this, because I think it's really powerful, where -- let's
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.480]   say it's the situation where a mom is saying, "I really want to go out to dinner, but I
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.480]   feel so guilty."
[00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:11.880]   First thing, it's just powerful to say, "That is not guilt.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:16.600]   It is something else, and it is real, and it is powerful, but it is not guilt."
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   What is happening?
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.920]   I'm on one side of a tennis court, like me and you, Andrew, but let's say it's a tennis
[00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:24.840]   court, and you're on the other side, or even -- and like in between, instead of a net,
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:27.060]   it's like a glass table.
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:34.180]   Over here, I am here in my desire to go out with my friends, because I do value my friendships.
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:37.540]   Over there is you're upset about it.
[00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.860]   And let's say instead you're my daughter, you're like, "No, no, don't go.
[00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.100]   No one else can put me to bed."
[00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.440]   That is definitely hard to deal with, but that is your daughter's feelings.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.560]   Those are not your feelings.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:49.980]   Those are your daughter's feelings.
[00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:54.500]   And some of us, slash a lot of us, have developed this tendency where we're on this court, and
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:59.080]   all of a sudden, all those feelings from your side somehow go through that wall, and they
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.140]   come to your side, and you call it guilt.
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:03.140]   It is not guilt.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:09.420]   And to me, one of the most liberating things -- and this actually relates to empathy -- is
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.060]   to give that feeling back to its rightful owner.
[00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:17.980]   Because what that means is if I really give it back, now I have a boundary.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.380]   That's my kid's feeling.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:21.020]   That's not mine.
[00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.700]   And I can now actually empathize.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:24.860]   People said, "No, I was empathizing.
[00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:25.860]   I wasn't going out."
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.460]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.900]   That's not empathy.
[00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:32.480]   You weren't going out with your friends because you couldn't handle the distress in your body.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:34.860]   You just made your daughter's feelings your own.
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.900]   You just engaged in something almost selfish.
[00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.620]   This has nothing to do with your daughter.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.420]   In those situations, that's why we say weird things to our four-year-old.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.100]   Like, "Don't you want mommy to have friends?"
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.700]   I feel like four-year-olds are like, "Why are you asking me that question?"
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.380]   It's like a pilot being like, "Don't you want me to make an emergency landing?"
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:54.420]   It's like, "If you need to make an emergency landing, don't ask me for permission."
[00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.620]   Because once I give it back to my daughter, I can do this.
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:00.140]   I can say, "You really wish I would put you to bed tonight.
[00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:01.140]   You're right.
[00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.820]   It feels so different when grandma does it.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:04.620]   Oh, it does.
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.180]   I'm going out.
[00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:08.420]   It's okay if you're upset.
[00:08:08.420 --> 00:08:11.940]   I'll be back and I'll kiss you and I'll see you in the morning."
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.840]   And then this next part's so important.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:18.420]   When you walk out, I don't want any person having any illusion that the daughter's going
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.500]   to be like, "Yes, you go, girl.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.300]   No, she is going to scream.
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.300]   That's okay."
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.300]   Going back to the boundary.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:35.260]   You're allowed to take care of your needs and other people are allowed to be inconvenienced
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:37.020]   and upset by it.
[00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:39.900]   It doesn't mean your needs are wrong.
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.860]   It doesn't mean their feelings are wrong and it definitely doesn't mean you feel guilty.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:52.860]   [Music]
