[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Phil, a listener from Oakville, Ontario, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.440]   Pastor John, regarding the theological significance of Christ's virgin birth, if God saw it fit
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.680]   and right for His Son to be born of a virgin woman without the intervention of a man, what
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.300]   does this say about human sexuality?
[00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.540]   This is a totally surprising question to me, and I'm excited about it because the end of
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:33.200]   my answer has a surprising twist, so hang on, hang around for another four or five minutes.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.560]   Let me read the text because the text really matters here.
[00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.720]   So it's Luke 1, 26 and 31 to 35.
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.560]   Gabriel was sent from God to a virgin, betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, and said,
[00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.160]   "Behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus."
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:57.480]   Now verse 32, "He will be great and will be called Son of the Most High, and the Lord
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.600]   God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.960]   Jacob forever and of his kingdom.
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:04.960]   There will be no end.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.280]   And Mary said to the angel, 'How will this be, since I am a virgin?'"
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.680]   No sex, right?
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.600]   And here's the answer, verse 35, "The angel said to her, 'The Holy Spirit will come upon
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.360]   you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.160]   Therefore the child to be born will be called the Son of God."
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.480]   He'll be called holy, the Son of God.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:42.760]   Now the explicit connection made by the angel is that God chose to bring Jesus into the
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.640]   world through a virgin because he wanted to make a statement about the uniqueness of his
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.120]   sonship.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.200]   "I come to you a virgin, the Holy Spirit will come to you, the power of the Most High
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.800]   will overshadow you, therefore," that's the key word, "therefore," this is why I'm doing
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:10.280]   it this way, "therefore the child will be called the Son of God."
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.240]   And the point was not sexual relations with Joseph were defective or evil.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.440]   The point was that this child was not going to be an ordinary child.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:28.520]   He would have a human nature from Mary, but he would also have a divine nature from God.
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.280]   The point was not that the birth was clean because there was no sexual intercourse, the
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.680]   point was that the birth was supernatural because there was no human father.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.600]   So beware, I'll say this now to the person who asked the question, beware of inferring
[00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.280]   lessons from texts that are not written to give those lessons.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:00.440]   There is no intent on Luke's part or the angel's part to teach about the value of human sexual
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.400]   relations.
[00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.040]   To realize what that is, you have to go to places where that's the point of the text.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.760]   So you go to a place like 1 Corinthians 7, 2, it goes like this, "Each man should have
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.440]   his own wife, and each woman her own husband.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:26.320]   The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights," that means sexual relations, "and
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.640]   likewise the wife to her husband."
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.680]   Give him sexual relations.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:35.880]   "For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does, and likewise
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.920]   the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.600]   Do not deprive one another from sexual relations, except perhaps by agreement for a limited
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.760]   time that you may devote yourselves to prayer, but then come together again so that Satan
[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.520]   may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control."
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.280]   Now here is a clear teaching about sexual intercourse.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.640]   It belongs in marriage, it should be relatively frequent, and its purpose is not just for
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.920]   having babies.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.480]   Those three things are clearly implied in that text.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:18.960]   One of the highest things that could be said about sexual relations is that it is the becoming
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.000]   of one flesh in marriage on the analogy of Christ becoming one with his church.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.760]   Ephesians 5 goes like this, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church and
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.120]   gave himself for her."
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.760]   And then verse 31, "Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.960]   to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   That happens in sexual intercourse, and a profound and beautiful, glorious thing that
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:55.920]   belongs in marriage happens, a one flesh union expressed in sexual union.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:58.160]   Here's the surprising upshot.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:07.880]   The virgin birth was designed by God to bring the Son of God into the world so that he could
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:17.480]   die for his bride, the church, and thus ransom his bride so that husbands would know how
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:24.160]   to make sexual relations with their wives the climax of their portrayal of Christ in
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.560]   the church.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.400]   In other words, the virgin birth really does have something to do with sexual relations.
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.720]   It wasn't written with that in view, but when you take all of redemptive history into
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.440]   account and say, "Okay, what does the virgin birth say?"
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.840]   It says, "We now have in the world a God-man."
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.280]   Why do we have him?
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:50.440]   That there might be an atonement for sin.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:51.440]   Whose sin?
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.040]   The sin of the church.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.120]   To what end?
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:59.240]   That the church might belong to her beloved husband, Jesus Christ.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.680]   And what does that have to do with human marriage?
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.800]   It gives the portrayal of what human marriage means.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.080]   What does human marriage mean?
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:16.280]   It means a man and a woman cleaving to one another and coming to union of flesh in sexual
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:23.160]   intercourse as a way of displaying the intensity of the love and covenant relationship between
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.000]   Christ and his church, which was made possible by the virgin birth.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:34.560]   Therefore, all the positive places in the Bible that speak of the beauty and the rightness
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:43.200]   of sexual pleasures in marriage are possible because there was a virgin birth.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:48.800]   And tomorrow, we will look again at Christmas, and this time more broadly, and ask Charlie
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.360]   Brown's million-dollar question, "Can anyone tell me what Christmas is all about?"
