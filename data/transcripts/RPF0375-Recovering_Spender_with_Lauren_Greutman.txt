[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.400]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.080]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.760]   My guest today is Lauren Groupman.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.800]   Lauren, welcome back to a reprise performance on Radical Personal Finance.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.800]   Thank you so much.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.840]   I'm happy to be back as always.
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.200]   You were last back with your husband, excuse me, you were last here with your husband,
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.000]   Mark, on episode 108.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.880]   So back in the early point of the show.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.600]   And now you're back to show off your new book, The Recovering Spender.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.600]   Yes, definitely.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.800]   I can't believe it's been that long since the first time I was on.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.720]   It has been quite a while.
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.440]   So we're going to primarily talk about the book and primarily talk about some of the
[00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.200]   tools and tactics and techniques that you have learned and are now sharing with others.
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.680]   But go ahead and give us a brief intro story of your and Mark's story, especially as it
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.080]   relates to personal finance.
[00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.080]   Yeah.
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.120]   So my husband and I, we've been married for 14 years.
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.120]   We got married young.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.600]   Actually, we were still in college and we got married.
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.200]   We got married in between our junior and our senior year of college.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.040]   And we both, you know, I didn't have very much luck with money in my teen years and
[00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.440]   in my college years.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.680]   And so it was just it was just a train wreck right away financially.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.600]   I ended up getting us into $40,000 with the debt.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.880]   I handled the money and paid all the bills and I did a poor, you know, very terrible
[00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.880]   job at it back then.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.480]   And so Mark didn't really know a lot of, you know, what was going on behind the scenes.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.080]   So one day, just, you know, after we had a car towed away and we just were like running
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.560]   a thousand dollars short every single month, I decided, you know, I've just got to like,
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.120]   I've got to stop spending money and getting us into more debt.
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.400]   And I've got to come clean with Mark about what's going on and, you know, how terrible
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.400]   I am with money.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.760]   And so I came clean to him and told him about our debt.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.600]   And so that was back in 2006.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.440]   And so or 2007, I'm sorry.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.480]   And so we were debt free two years later.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:15.880]   And I've just taken what I've learned as a spender and decided to teach others, you know,
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.560]   how to get out of debt if you're a spender.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.200]   And that's why I wrote the book, The Recovering Spender.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.320]   Why did you guys come to this arrangement to handle your financial affairs early in
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.320]   your life?
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:30.480]   So it's kind of odd, right, that the woman I think is like, I'll take care of the money
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.080]   and like they don't work together.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.080]   But for me, I always grew up with my mom doing the bills.
[00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.840]   Like I remember her, you know, watching her sitting in our dining room table, writing
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.280]   down the money.
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.840]   And so I always remember that, like that, you know, in my mind, the woman does the bills.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.600]   And so that's kind of, you know, I took over, you know, thinking that's what a wife is supposed
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.600]   to do.
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.160]   When we first got married, you know, Mark had the job, I wasn't working.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.720]   So I would handle the family finances and take care of the home.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.360]   And you know, I was just a complete mess.
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.800]   Like I just I was very disorganized and I was missing bills all the time and overdraft
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.640]   fees, and it just got to be really unmanageable for me.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:22.240]   So how has that changed in the way that you handle money together?
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.400]   What does it look like now?
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.600]   Yeah, so now we do it together.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.640]   What makes this even kind of humorous, I guess, is that my husband is an actuary.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.680]   And so he loves numbers, he loves budgeting, he loves spreadsheets, he loves talking about
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.680]   money.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.520]   And so we really are polar opposites.
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:47.360]   Like he was at work number crunching while I was at home getting us into debt.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:53.920]   And so we had to really come together and really, you know, make sense of our strengths
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.640]   and how we could work together.
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   And so now we we call it the budget night.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.880]   And the last Sunday of every month, we sit down and we plan the entire month out.
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.180]   That's going to come up.
[00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.760]   We plan it out before it even happens.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.360]   And so Mark usually manages the tool.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.200]   We have a budgeting tool on our website.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.480]   He manages that as we go through the budget.
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.960]   I write it down in my paper planner because I prefer paper.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.520]   And we talk about what the month looks like.
[00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:25.800]   And we're on the same page.
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.880]   But it wasn't always that way.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.880]   And it was hard to learn how to not fight over money all the time.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   So that was difficult.
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:42.720]   Yeah. So you went from having no budget to and let's walk back to 2006, 2007, 2008 for
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.680]   now and then we'll come to today.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:50.160]   And you took on kind of a very proactive, we're going to only spend $4,000 this next
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:51.160]   month.
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.760]   And what tactically did you do?
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.800]   Did you use envelopes?
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.200]   Did you use a checkbook register?
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.080]   What did you do at that time that allowed you to get out of debt in two years?
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.960]   So, well, the first thing that we did is we really sat down and figured out where we were
[00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.040]   spending the most of our money.
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.120]   And at that time it was on food.
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:15.040]   We were spending probably $1,000 a month on groceries like at the grocery store.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.800]   And then we were spending probably another $600 to $700 eating out because our food had
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.560]   gone bad or we didn't plan or we just were lazy.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:28.280]   And so that was around $1,600 we were spending at the grocery store.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.040]   So we really learned how to meal plan.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040]   That was like the biggest thing.
[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.000]   I learned how to use coupons.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.040]   I learned how to save money if we were eating out, how to save money on that purchase.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.800]   But we kind of like cut eating out altogether because we realized like we just can't afford
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:46.800]   it.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.120]   Like we're $1,000 short every month and that's just going down the drain with our grocery
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.400]   bill and all that.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.080]   So that was a really practical thing.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.600]   I learned how to cut our grocery bill.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:04.680]   So in a couple months, I cut that grocery bill from $1,000 a month down to $200 a month.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.840]   And so I fed us on $50 a week for about three years.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.680]   And let's bring things current because last interview we talked a lot about couponing.
[00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.280]   I don't want to labor there, but as we record this here in the beginning of August, July,
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.800]   do you remember how much you spent on food in July?
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.360]   Yes, $550.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.160]   And that was for a family of six.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   Yep.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.160]   Right.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   Yep.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   That's impressive.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.160]   Oh, well, thank you.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:34.280]   Yeah, we do a lot of meal planning and freezer cooking and we shop at Aldi.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:38.160]   It's like a big thing of ours, but we plan out everything that we eat.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.560]   And so that really, you know, I don't use a ton of coupons anymore.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.280]   Why not?
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.240]   Honestly, it got to the point where it was just, I had to choose.
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.720]   I can't do everything right.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.640]   So I'm running my website full time.
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.000]   I'm working full time now doing that with Mark and I have four kids and I have a house
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.120]   to clean.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:03.760]   And so I thought to myself, okay, I still coupon for things like toilet paper and toothpaste
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.640]   and you know, all those kinds of things.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:10.320]   But I don't do the kind of extreme couponing that I used to just because my time has to
[00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.320]   go somewhere else and I can't be everywhere all the time.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.320]   So I've had to say no to a few things.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.800]   And honestly, I can shop at Aldi and save a lot of money and then coupon for the things
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.040]   that are really expensive and I'm spending around the same amount of money just with
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:29.280]   less stress.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.320]   One of the things I've always wanted to do, and when I read your book last time when you
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.240]   were on episode 108, you sent me a copy of the book and I looked at the couponing book.
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:44.760]   I always wanted a coupon because I always was impressed by, look at this, you know,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.760]   money jujitsu.
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   Right.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:47.760]   And so I came to that thought.
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.240]   I was like, man, this is a ton of work for a small amount of turn.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:56.680]   And the challenge, well, let me not say that.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.440]   This is a lot of work and it takes a lot of time.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.720]   And the challenge is what is the alternative use of my time?
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.740]   What's the opportunity cost?
[00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:11.120]   And I've often come to the point where I have other things that are important for me to
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.440]   be doing with my time.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.560]   And so I've always felt a little guilty that I've never become a master couponer.
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.760]   Like I should be this frugal expert.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:27.320]   But what I do now is I do probably the bulk of the shopping for our family, including
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.020]   the food shopping.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:34.520]   But I joined the local restaurant warehouse store and so I get a lot of good deals there.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.440]   And then also a Costco membership.
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:43.520]   And I've worked out just the simple basics of I know what prices things can be.
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:47.640]   And one of the best, my little best tools is by joining the restaurant warehouse store,
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:52.120]   I can get food that they often put on clearance where they're trying to get rid of things.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:59.920]   So yesterday, as an example, I bought 10 pounds of chicken drumsticks for 30 cents a pound.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.920]   And so some of those types of things, I look at them and I say, this is a better way for
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.960]   me at this stage of my life than couponing.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.840]   Yeah, and I think that's where I got to where I was couponing with one kid, and I wasn't
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.840]   working a job.
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:13.880]   So that was kind of like my job.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:17.680]   I saw it, like what you said as a, you know, an opportunity cost.
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:23.320]   So like for me, I could either go out at that time and get a, you know, minimum wage job,
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.800]   or I could sit at home and clip coupons and make enough money.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:33.120]   And to make, you know, $100 or $50 an hour, you know, if I spent two hours and saved 100
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:36.200]   bucks in the grocery store, that was a better use of my time.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.600]   But I'm at the point now where I'm running a business with my website and, you know,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.280]   all the media stuff that I do.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:47.880]   And it just got to be too crazy where I'm like, I could better spend my time either
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:54.680]   with my kids or, you know, I can make more money doing this.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:10:00.040]   Did you figure out what your hourly rate probably was when you were focusing heavily on coupons?
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   It was about $50 an hour.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:08.600]   So I do want to emphasize this because one of my frustrations with modern schooling is
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:17.800]   that there's no emphasis placed on the study of home economics.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.040]   And I'm convinced that home economics, I'd love to write just an entire course about
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:29.640]   it, but home economics is an incredibly valuable area of focus that where a stay-at-home mom
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.120]   can make a huge difference in the family budget.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.960]   And so I don't want to dismiss the value of couponing.
[00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:41.320]   If you could get the equivalent of $50 an hour of savings, you have to remember that,
[00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.200]   number one, that's a six-figure salary.
[00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:48.080]   $50 an hour, if you were working that at 40 hours a week, comes out to be $100,000 a year
[00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:50.560]   salary when projected forward.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.200]   So that's an incredible value.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:56.760]   Plus, when you recognize the fact that this is savings, so $50 an hour is money that's
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:58.640]   being saved, not being earned.
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.600]   So the equivalent, if you were to add back in employment taxes, if you were to add back
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:09.080]   in some of the costs of actually going and earning $50 an hour, you're probably more
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.980]   saving like the equivalent of $65 an hour because it's savings and not earned income.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:20.640]   So if a stay-at-home mom with a couple of kids where she's got some time during the
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:25.360]   day to actually do this, if a stay-at-home mom can focus on this, that can be a huge,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.420]   huge benefit to the family budget.
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:33.760]   And when that's expanded out onto other areas, not just groceries, but onto other areas,
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.200]   home economics is incredibly valuable.
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:41.480]   And I hate to see what a short shrift it gets in today's world.
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:47.640]   I totally, totally agree with you because we have all these moms that are going out
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:56.120]   to in the workplace making $30,000 a year, but then they're too busy to eat at home and
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.840]   they're eating out all the time.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.340]   And they could probably make more money or be richer if they stayed home and focused
[00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.980]   on getting their budget low, making their food at home.
[00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.140]   If you think about taxes and all of that, and that's where we were at when we were in
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.220]   debt.
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.900]   We had to sit down and it's like, "Okay, I can go out to work right now and make this
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:21.660]   minimum wage job, or I can work at home and work my tail off to spend as little money
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:22.660]   as possible."
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:29.440]   And we even got so crazy that we sold our huge custom built house and moved into a townhouse
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:35.080]   because we were just like so sick and tired of being broke all the time and really focused
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.720]   on the home economics, like what you said.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:42.920]   And that's really, a lot of what I teach online is that.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.480]   And through my book, I have a book, a chapter in the book calling "Declutter Your Life,
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.480]   Regain Your Joy."
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.820]   And it's all about how you can go through your home and find hidden, like thousands
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:56.700]   of dollars worth of hidden stuff in your home and how to sell it and where to sell it.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:00.300]   And that's part of the whole home economics that you were talking about.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:04.660]   Give us some more practical examples from the "Declutter Your Life" section.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.660]   Okay.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.460]   So I did a little experiment probably about six months ago.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.940]   Because I go through my house probably once a year and we usually do a yard sale.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:12.940]   But this year I'm like, "You know what?
[00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:14.660]   I don't want to do a yard sale.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:19.480]   Let me go through my house and find some things that I can sell online on eBay."
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:27.480]   And so I found a few things that were like old, like a company sent me, what was it?
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.580]   Like a pretty expensive bottle of perfume as a gift.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:36.840]   And I didn't have any use for it because I didn't want to.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:38.920]   It was, I was like, "This is too expensive to spray."
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.520]   Like it was a really expensive bottle of perfume.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.600]   And so I sold that on eBay.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.640]   I had a whole bunch of old iPhone accessories.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:49.240]   I sold those on eBay.
[00:13:49.240 --> 00:13:51.800]   So anyway, I'm going through my house and I'm finding all this stuff and I ended up
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:57.920]   making $1,200 in two weeks just by selling things on eBay.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.360]   And so one of the things that I actually have taught a lot of people in my area, especially
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:07.000]   my sister-in-law, my brother-in-law works full-time for us now.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.480]   And then my sister-in-law runs an eBay business where she goes to thrift stores on their like
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:18.480]   half price days and buys like name brand clothing, like special brand labels that you have to
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:20.160]   find and then sells them on eBay.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:23.960]   And she makes like a thousand to $1,500 a month doing that from her house.
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:26.320]   And she has four kids too.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:31.040]   And so, so there's so many ways that you can go through and like declutter and go yard
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:39.320]   selling and find stuff to sell, you know, find clearance sales at stores.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.360]   And there's just so many ways.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.040]   So that's like one way that I think, you know, declutter your life, regain your joy that
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:51.160]   like clutter steals your joy and it kind of clutters your mental space, right?
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:54.720]   If you have so much junk around and you're like, "Oh, it's just so dirty all the time."
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:55.720]   I don't know.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:59.480]   For me, it kills my productivity if like I'm just around clutter.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:03.760]   And so people are like, "Oh, I can never make enough money or whatever," but they don't
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:08.760]   realize that they're sitting, you know, literally sitting on stuff that they can sell online.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.560]   I keep telling my wife, I said, "If you wanted to, you can make us a thousand bucks a month
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:14.560]   from your curb diving."
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.080]   My wife is the world's greatest curb diver.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:21.200]   And she's just awesome at finding stuff on the side of the road and bring it home.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:22.880]   And she enjoys cleaning stuff up.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:26.040]   So she'll get this thing that's dirty and she'll scrub it up and she gives the stuff
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.040]   away.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.000]   I keep telling her, "You can make a thousand bucks a month if you just want to turn around
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   and sell the stuff."
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   But she never wants to actually do it.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Seriously.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.800]   She should because even with like, I don't know if you guys have in your area, but we
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.320]   have, you know, Facebook buy/sell groups for your area.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:44.440]   And I've done that before where I've gotten something for free and, you know, put some
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.920]   chalk paint on it and scratched it up a little bit and sold it for $75.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:48.920]   Awesome.
[00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:52.600]   You know, I'm always thinking about fun ways because I enjoy that.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.360]   I really enjoy, you know, redoing furniture and stuff like that.
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.360]   So that's always fun.
[00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:02.760]   And my hope, I think hopefully as our oldest son gets a little older, I think it'll be
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.480]   a good way, a good project for him because she's good at finding the stuff and she enjoys
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.660]   fixing it up.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:12.720]   So if we can get him making the Craigslist ad or putting it in the Facebook group, et
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.040]   cetera, I think that'll provide a good little business opportunity for him when he's five
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:17.400]   or six years old is my hope.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:18.400]   Oh, definitely.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.400]   We'll see.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:24.800]   But I mean, our dining room table found on the side of the road, I refinished it and
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:26.240]   it's an awesome table.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.640]   She finds all kinds of stuff.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.960]   It's just amazing some of the stuff that she pulls off the side of the road.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   Oh, I love that.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   I love that.
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:36.160]   So you in your book go through these 12 recovering spender steps.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   Right.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.840]   And I want to get to those and have you walk through them.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:44.400]   But before you do that, talk a little bit about shopping.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.480]   In your book, you talk about the triggers for shopping.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.400]   You talk about an emotional shopper and a trophy shopper and an image shopper and a
[00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:56.240]   bargain shopper and a codependent shopper and a bulimic shopper and a collector shopper.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:03.640]   These things, my guess is that the radical personal finance audience skews male and it
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:08.600]   probably skews heavily to these intellectual type of people who say, "I don't make emotional
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.080]   decisions with money.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:15.240]   I'm perfectly content and I'm a human calculator when it comes to money," which is nonsense,
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   of course.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:21.120]   But I don't really relate with this shopping gene.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.520]   The stuff you do, the Today Show, kind of the feminine, "Oh, you can just say no to
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.600]   the mall," I don't connect with that.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:29.400]   So I don't know how to speak to that.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:34.560]   So talk about people who do have that habit built up of being a shopper and how to break
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.560]   free from that.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:42.040]   So I think you bring up an interesting point, first of all, that I think that there are
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.200]   mostly women who deal with this problem.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:47.080]   But there are a lot of men, but they just shop in different ways.
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:48.600]   Just different stores and different stuff.
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:50.040]   Well, different stuff, right?
[00:17:50.040 --> 00:17:56.480]   Guys typically spend more money on hobbies and sneakers and things that they really enjoy
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:03.600]   like golfing or if they like to fix up cars or Mark's really big into craft beer right
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.680]   now.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:10.280]   So men tend to overspend or spend more money on those kinds of things, whereas women are
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:12.240]   more emotional shoppers.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:16.080]   But I think what's really important as we start talking about this to people that are
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:21.760]   listening is that if you're, let's say you're a financial advisor and you're dealing with
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:27.520]   people, the common thing that I get all the time is that I need somebody who understands
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:32.600]   the mind of a shopper or a spender because people just don't realize that they have a
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:35.660]   problem and they're spending so much money.
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:40.960]   And so this book is really, I think, helpful not just for shoppers to spend, but to get
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:46.040]   into the mind of maybe other people's, of your clients who you're like hitting your
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:49.120]   head up against the wall because they are getting into debt more and more and more and
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.600]   you can't stop them.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:55.280]   And so that's just like a little side note with that.
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:19:02.520]   I think that with women specifically, they a lot of times, I'll talk from my personal
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.960]   experience is that I was an emotional shopper.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.640]   I think I changed a lot of times over the years, but I would get depressed about something
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.400]   and then I would go shopping and it would make me feel better.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.080]   But then I would feel sad that I just shopped and that would make me depressed so that I'd
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:20.440]   go shopping again and then I'd feel better.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.400]   And it was just kind of this whole cycle.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.560]   But I think a lot of people do image shopping too.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:28.320]   You know, they're trying to keep up with the Joneses.
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   Everybody has this.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.560]   They go to the mall together as friends.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.660]   They don't want to look less than.
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:37.160]   They wear expensive clothing and nice cars.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:40.360]   And a lot of times guys are image shoppers as well.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.960]   You know, the guy that always picks up the tab at the bar is wearing flashy clothing.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.120]   You know, he's a spender.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:53.720]   So it's different in, I guess, classifying guys versus girls.
[00:19:53.720 --> 00:19:59.540]   But there's also, I said the bulimic shopper, the person who goes and buys something and
[00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:03.260]   then gets a home and doesn't like it, so returns it and buys something else and gets a home
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:04.260]   and doesn't like it.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:07.020]   And it just happens over and over and over again.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.220]   A lot of people are like, "Oh, I do that all the time.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.240]   I didn't realize that that meant that I was a spender."
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:18.740]   And the collector shopper, that my son is a collector, like big time.
[00:20:18.740 --> 00:20:23.740]   So I look at this and I'm like, "Oh, he's like, I just know I've got to work on him
[00:20:23.740 --> 00:20:24.740]   harder with this."
[00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.320]   But he always, it's the thrill of having a collection.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:34.860]   You know, baseball cards or having the same, you know, jersey or whatever you want to think
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:38.660]   about, you're the collector shopper and you're a spender.
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:45.060]   And so I think that when spending becomes a problem, it's when your spending starts
[00:20:45.060 --> 00:20:48.800]   to become more important than your true values in life.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:53.020]   So if you're spending despite being in credit card debt or you're spending despite not being
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:57.000]   able to afford your mortgage or you're spending money on a credit card not knowing where that
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:02.020]   money is going to come from, you're sacrificing your value, which my guess is to have, you
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.820]   know, live a happy, fulfilled, debt-free life.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:09.900]   And when your spending becomes opposite of that, that's when I feel like you really got
[00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:10.900]   to kind of take a look at it.
[00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:12.500]   And that's what happened to me.
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:21.980]   I was, you know, I remember one story that I went shopping and I went to the mall and
[00:21:21.980 --> 00:21:26.040]   hid the clothes in the trunk of my car and then went inside.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:29.700]   And then the next day when Mark went to work, I brought the clothes inside and hung them
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:33.020]   up in my closet because I didn't want to get in an argument about it.
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.380]   Like I was like so over him being like, "What did you spend money on, Lauren?"
[00:21:36.380 --> 00:21:37.700]   So I didn't want to deal with it.
[00:21:37.700 --> 00:21:41.580]   And so, you know, this we were probably married like five years then or something.
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:47.980]   And so I hid it in the closet and I realized that, you know, my marriage was way too important
[00:21:47.980 --> 00:21:54.340]   to be lying about this kind of stuff that I wanted a marriage that would last.
[00:21:54.340 --> 00:21:58.220]   And in order to do that, it couldn't be based on secrecy.
[00:21:58.220 --> 00:22:01.660]   And so I really had to kind of take a look at my value system and realize that like I
[00:22:01.660 --> 00:22:06.380]   couldn't keep spending that way because, you know, it was just getting worse and worse.
[00:22:06.380 --> 00:22:10.860]   So I think that's kind of was a wake up call for me.
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.980]   How did you come to talk about it as far as what was it if you were in that situation
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:20.980]   where you were hiding things from your husband in order to compress through?
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:23.220]   What brought the point?
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:27.100]   How did you actually overcome that to be able to communicate about it?
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:32.740]   Well, I have this saying and I talk about it in the book and it says that when the pain
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:37.300]   of being broke is greater than the pain of changing your spending habits, that's when
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.180]   you're going to make a change.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:44.380]   And so I was so sick and tired of being broke and being so stressed out over money that
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:51.500]   it was I was more afraid to stay in that spot than I was to talk to Mark about it, if that
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:53.020]   makes sense.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.420]   And so I just got really, really...
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.380]   Oh, hold on.
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.140]   My daughter just started knocking on my door.
[00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.140]   Hold on.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:02.140]   Sorry, Josh.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:03.140]   Sorry.
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:07.900]   I figured it's one of the joys of a home-based business.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.140]   No, I'm not going to edit it out.
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.140]   It's fantastic.
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:11.140]   Hi, everyone.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.140]   My daughter is knocking on my door.
[00:23:12.140 --> 00:23:17.740]   My dog's bark in the background in my show.
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:18.740]   It's normal.
[00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:19.740]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:20.740]   So I got four kids.
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:21.740]   Somebody always needs me.
[00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:22.740]   Right.
[00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.060]   You hear the little knock on the door?
[00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:25.060]   She's like, "Hello.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.060]   Hello."
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.340]   My daughter, so my one-year-old daughter does that, but she does it unintentionally.
[00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.020]   And so my kids know when I close the door and I have some soundproofing curtains that
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:37.580]   helps to cut down most of the noise between my office and the living room.
[00:23:37.580 --> 00:23:41.580]   But my little one-year-old daughter, she likes to totter around.
[00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.500]   And so she comes up to the door and she loves to bang things with her hands.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.140]   She'll go, "Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang."
[00:23:46.140 --> 00:23:52.340]   And often I have to hit pause on my recording and go and say, "Okay, Tiffany, please take
[00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.340]   her away.
[00:23:53.340 --> 00:23:54.340]   Let's go to the other room.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.340]   I need to get the show done."
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.340]   Oh, man.
[00:23:57.340 --> 00:23:58.340]   That's funny.
[00:23:58.340 --> 00:24:02.340]   So when the pain of being broke exceeds the pleasure that you get from shopping, that's
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:03.340]   what you were saying.
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:04.340]   Right.
[00:24:04.340 --> 00:24:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.860]   So the pain of being broke was suddenly greater than the pain of changing and talking to Mark
[00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:09.860]   about it.
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.540]   And I was like, "Okay, it's easier for me to talk to him about it than it is for me
[00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:18.020]   to continue to keep spending like this because I'm just so at my wits end."
[00:24:18.020 --> 00:24:21.340]   And so we sat down and I kind of just laid it all out.
[00:24:21.340 --> 00:24:26.860]   I actually literally laid my credit card bills out on the bed and just he came in and I just
[00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:31.740]   blurted it out because I'm like, "I don't know how to casually say this, but we're in
[00:24:31.740 --> 00:24:32.820]   $40,000 with the debt."
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.540]   And I was waiting for him to scream at me or something like that.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:41.380]   And he just kind of looked at me in shock for a while and then he said, "I forgive you.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.900]   We're going to move through with this together."
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:46.140]   And that was really healing for me.
[00:24:46.140 --> 00:24:50.980]   And so we, from that day, started working towards getting out of debt.
[00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:52.900]   So what are the rules that you have in place for you now?
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:55.540]   In your book, you go over kind of you learned your triggers.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.380]   Tell us about some of the triggers that you observed and the rules that you put in place
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:24:59.740]   to control your spending.
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:00.740]   Yeah.
[00:25:00.740 --> 00:25:03.420]   So some of them are kind of funny.
[00:25:03.420 --> 00:25:06.980]   I don't go to home-based business parties.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:08.540]   That's a big no-no for me.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:14.260]   So I don't go to Mary Kay parties or 31 parties or any, whatever kind of party.
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:19.820]   I don't go to them because I am a sucker for a good deal.
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:23.380]   And I hate saying no to people when they're asking me to buy something when I know they're
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:24.380]   right there with it.
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:27.100]   So I just know that that's a big no.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.940]   So I never go to those.
[00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.420]   I haven't been to one in maybe seven years.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.580]   And I get invited all the time and I always say no.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:38.300]   I don't go to the mall alone.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:39.300]   That's a big no-no for me.
[00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:43.500]   I don't go into Target without one person.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.860]   Usually it has to be an adult.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:49.580]   So usually I won't go to Target without Mark or like Hobby Lobby, like all of those stores.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:52.540]   I feel like when I'm walking into them, I'm like walking into heaven.
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:55.840]   It's like, like the music is coming down.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:26:00.060]   So any store that gives me that feeling of like, "Oh, this is amazing," that I just can't
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:05.500]   go into because I get like sucked in.
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.260]   I don't do a lot of extravagant parties.
[00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:15.860]   I see on Pinterest, like a lot of my friends are throwing these amazing birthday parties
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.420]   with like all of these hand-crafted balloons or whatever.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:22.420]   I don't do those.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.100]   I'm just really simple and not trying to spend money.
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:28.860]   And I only use cash most of the time.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:31.020]   I don't use credit cards at all.
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:35.900]   I have one credit card for my business that I use to pay business bills.
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:38.440]   They get paid off right away.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:44.580]   And that is only for security because I travel so much right now.
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.020]   But I use cash on pretty much everything.
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:52.500]   So those are kind of the boundaries that I've set for myself.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:57.020]   I can talk about, do you want me to talk about like the fence analogy?
[00:26:57.020 --> 00:27:02.220]   So I think this is really important when a lot of spenders, like you say the word budget
[00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:08.340]   and it makes them cringe because it makes it like literally years ago when we were starting
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:11.260]   to learn how to budget, like it would make me almost nauseous.
[00:27:11.260 --> 00:27:15.220]   Like the thought of budgeting was so overwhelming to me.
[00:27:15.220 --> 00:27:18.620]   And so I would have all good intentions and I would make a budget and then I just could
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:19.620]   never stick to it.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.500]   And I did that over and over and over again.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.940]   And one day I was kind of watching my kids play outside and we have a fenced in backyard.
[00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:31.580]   This is when we had two kids and we had a fenced in backyard and a swing set and they
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:33.540]   were back there playing.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:38.100]   And for some reason it just kind of, I was doing my budget on the back deck for like,
[00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:39.300]   you know, updating it.
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:46.100]   And the idea just kind of came to me that, you know, as a spender, I'm always so afraid
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:52.740]   of budgeting, but it's really there to keep me safe from whatever, you know, triggers
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:58.340]   I have or things in the world that I just shouldn't be taking part of.
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:02.100]   So what I mean by that is that when you have a fence, like so my kids have a fenced in
[00:28:02.100 --> 00:28:03.460]   yard so it keeps them safe.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:04.460]   It protects them.
[00:28:04.460 --> 00:28:05.980]   They can still have fun within the yard.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:10.000]   They can still play, but they're safe and secure.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:13.100]   But if they were to go on the outside of the fence, they might get run over by a car or
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.440]   a dog could attack them or they get lost or something like that.
[00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:20.860]   And so I kind of started looking at budgeting as a fence around my money that I can still
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:24.740]   have fun with my money, but the fence just gives me a boundary.
[00:28:24.740 --> 00:28:28.500]   The budget just gives me that boundary to say, you know what, this is what you can do.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.620]   And so every month we sit down and we figure out where that fence is going to be for the
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.620]   month.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.940]   You know, what are we going to spend our money on?
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:39.140]   And it gives me as a spender a sense of freedom because now I feel safe from all of those
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.140]   outside things.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:44.020]   I feel safe to say, I'm sorry, but I can't come to your party tonight.
[00:28:44.020 --> 00:28:48.620]   Or I'm sorry, I can't go to the mall today because I have that boundary.
[00:28:48.620 --> 00:28:53.340]   Whereas before when there was no boundary, it was like I could go play in the road and
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:59.020]   get hit by accident and use a credit card and go into debt.
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:04.020]   And so when I started looking at it that way, that it actually was there to give me freedom,
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:07.820]   that it really changed the way that I saw spending money.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:14.980]   If you, I mean, my opinion on the shopping spending thing is if you look at how people
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:22.300]   view spending, if you view spending as meeting a need that you have, whether it's an emotional
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:26.060]   need or, it's often an emotional need.
[00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:28.540]   It could be an emotional need for soothing.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:30.180]   It could be an emotional need for release.
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:31.980]   Maybe you have relationship stress.
[00:29:31.980 --> 00:29:33.460]   It could be an emotional need for self-confidence.
[00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:38.980]   As you said, I need to buy this certain thing so that I appear this certain way.
[00:29:38.980 --> 00:29:42.920]   The only way to, well, one way to overcome it is to adjust how you view it.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:48.100]   And if you view it as, for me, what I think is really powerful is get a goal that's more
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:50.020]   compelling.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:55.860]   Like you said, nothing, your quote that you said that I didn't write down where I wasn't
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:01.900]   born to pay bills, but rather have this compelling vision of what's positive, it adjusts the
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:03.360]   conversation.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:06.980]   And then once you see that and you put some limits on it, whatever those limits are, you
[00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:14.980]   can create them for yourself, then you can do it without it hurting other aspects of
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:16.540]   your life.
[00:30:16.540 --> 00:30:21.180]   Back to your question like fences and triggers, I do think this is extremely valuable for
[00:30:21.180 --> 00:30:25.900]   people to do and to consider the things that you consume in your life.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:32.340]   I do think it's unfair, although it seems to me that the kind of the extreme emotional
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:40.220]   reflexive spending does often come from women who might go to the mall or go to Target or
[00:30:40.220 --> 00:30:42.660]   something like that.
[00:30:42.660 --> 00:30:45.060]   Men it's just a little bit more disguised.
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:48.020]   So usually I always make fun of my friends.
[00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:53.220]   They make fun of, I always call out my buddies who want to talk about, "Oh, that girl spent
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.340]   $350 on a pair of high heel shoes."
[00:30:55.340 --> 00:31:00.340]   And I say, "You see these $300 boots you have over here?"
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.740]   You see this Cabela's catalog that you have here on your table?
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.180]   It's no different, buddy.
[00:31:05.180 --> 00:31:06.660]   You just don't care about high heels.
[00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:07.900]   You care about something else.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.900]   So don't give me that nonsense.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   Exactly.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.140]   It's just the way that you put it, where you spend it.
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.140]   Right, right, right.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:15.140]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.020]   I need this tricked out $3,000 gun.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:18.020]   Yeah.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.020]   The one you don't shoot?
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.020]   Of course you do.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.220]   You know what's funny, Josh?
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:27.620]   I just was part of, so part of kind of, I did a video project for my book and what I've
[00:31:27.620 --> 00:31:31.980]   been doing the past three months, I've been flying to Cincinnati to help a family who,
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.780]   the woman was a spender, right?
[00:31:33.780 --> 00:31:37.980]   And so the past three months, once a month I've been there and I've been helping them
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:41.380]   and we've had a film crew come in and film it and everything.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:47.980]   And what's funny was by month two, when Bridget started, you know, stopped spending money,
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:52.700]   then all of the sudden, Andy, her husband's spender, spending came out.
[00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:57.980]   And then it was interesting because now he couldn't blame it on her anymore.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:02.100]   Because he was going and spending $50 at the casino every once in a while.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:05.980]   And he was going and playing golf with his buddies and then going out drinking afterwards.
[00:32:05.980 --> 00:32:13.620]   And he had a $1,000 beer cooler in his basement that he was unwilling to give up because he
[00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.420]   had plans for in the future.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.620]   And so it's totally different.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:25.460]   But so many times the girl gets the rap and there's plenty of guy spenders out there.
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:29.620]   So it's a good point that it's just different, you know, the way that guys spend money.
[00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:31.360]   That's where the numbers don't lie.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:36.420]   Another one that I do have done sometimes is, you know, the husband's griping about
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:39.780]   the money that his wife spends at the mall.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:44.260]   But meanwhile, okay, here's this brand new F-150 that you have no need for.
[00:32:44.260 --> 00:32:46.980]   Hey, let's calculate how much that thing's costing you every month.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:50.460]   Ah, you're getting about $270 depreciation a month.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:53.300]   So is this $100 over here at Target really the key?
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:57.180]   Or is this $270 depreciation something that we should also take a look at?
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:32:58.180]   That's good.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:32:59.180]   I like that.
[00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:03.900]   You got to look at the actual numbers.
[00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:07.500]   But I think we all should assess and understand our triggers.
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:09.260]   So here are a couple for me.
[00:33:09.260 --> 00:33:15.060]   I don't get connected to the mall or Target, things like that.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:20.140]   But I learned years ago that I had to unsubscribe from things like men's magazines.
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:27.020]   I used to really enjoy magazines like Men's Journal or some of the kind of the male-focused
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.020]   magazines.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.300]   But I was always lusting after some new $1,200 kayak or some new $2,000 thing.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.320]   And I realized the entire purpose of this thing is to sell me stuff.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:39.660]   And so as soon as I just got rid of it and dumped the subscription and quit reading it,
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.340]   all of a sudden I wasn't feeding that desire to have this certain thing.
[00:33:44.340 --> 00:33:48.580]   Same thing with cars, car magazines, all of that type of content.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:52.420]   What you focus on becomes where your attention goes.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:57.140]   And we make those choices intentionally, or at least we should be making those choices
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:33:58.140]   intentionally.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:03.020]   And so in the same way that you intentionally choose to consume a certain type of media,
[00:34:03.020 --> 00:34:08.780]   which is built into creating this dissatisfaction in you, because one of the key hallmarks of
[00:34:08.780 --> 00:34:12.580]   sales and marketing is to create dissatisfaction.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:18.740]   You have to create dissatisfaction in your prospective customer and then show how your
[00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.220]   product or service meets that dissatisfaction.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:25.580]   So once you cut out all the sources that are creating dissatisfaction, all of a sudden
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:27.660]   you have less things to spend your money on.
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:28.660]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:29.660]   That's so true.
[00:34:29.660 --> 00:34:34.620]   And I think everybody needs to know what makes them overspent.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.460]   That's a really great point because if you're overspending, you don't need to be spending
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:38.460]   that money anyway.
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:40.300]   You could be putting it towards retirement or something else.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:42.380]   Lauren, you guys have these four beautiful children.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:47.540]   I'm curious, have you changed anything with what you've allowed into their lives or how
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:52.500]   you've chosen to spend or not spend money on them and their desires?
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:53.940]   Yeah, actually.
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:59.080]   So there's been a few ways that we've changed.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:01.460]   So my son is 11.
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.700]   Actually today is his 11th birthday.
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:09.540]   And so then I have seven, five, and three-year-old daughters.
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.900]   And the younger girls weren't raised during my spending time.
[00:35:12.900 --> 00:35:14.380]   So they don't really know any different.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:20.860]   But my son was kind of there at the most difficult time or I guess the time when I was spending
[00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:22.300]   the most amount of money.
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:26.940]   And so I really, I feel like, you know, he has a natural spending tendency.
[00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:31.940]   And I feel like when I was spending money and I would buy him whatever he wanted, when
[00:35:31.940 --> 00:35:34.780]   we'd go into Target and it was like, I was a collector.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:37.540]   So we needed to collect all the Lightning McQueen cars because this was when like the
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.220]   Cars movie first came out.
[00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:41.500]   You know, we had to collect all those.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:45.180]   So he's a little bit harder and I'm continuously having to work with him.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.140]   But that being said, there's many situations where they wanted to borrow money from us.
[00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:52.840]   And we have the saying, you know, in our house, I'm not your credit card.
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:58.020]   And so we'll make them do chores or certain things to earn money to get the item that
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.020]   they want.
[00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.380]   But also, you know, we're just not, we're not a stuff family.
[00:36:03.380 --> 00:36:05.940]   We don't, we don't buy a lot of stuff.
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.160]   We don't go to malls.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.540]   We don't go on elaborate vacations.
[00:36:10.540 --> 00:36:14.820]   And so actually yesterday, what happened yesterday?
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:19.620]   We went to the grocery store and my daughter asked me for two things and it was like crackers
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:20.620]   and something else.
[00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:21.740]   And I said yes to both of them.
[00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:27.500]   And she looked at me and she's like, "Why are you being so nice today?"
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:31.780]   Because in the store, I'm usually like, I have a list and don't ask me to deviate from
[00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.300]   the list because I have a budget.
[00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:34.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:34.300 --> 00:36:35.300]   Right.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:36.300]   And I'm like, "Okay, I'll ask her."
[00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:40.820]   And so they're just used to like us saying no to them a lot when it comes to money.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:45.180]   But our son actually works for us now.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:47.140]   He's our office cleaner.
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:55.660]   And so he makes $10 a week, you know, spending 45 minutes to an hour to, to wash or to clean
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.660]   our office.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:59.020]   And then we make him put that in a savings account.
[00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:02.400]   He has to tithe off of it first and then he has to put it in savings.
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:05.520]   And he hates us for it, but we're working with him.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:06.560]   We're working with him on it.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:11.640]   But we, we do a lot of, you know, teaching our kids when I do coupon, they cut them for
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.640]   me.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.600]   They know what I'm using them for.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:18.000]   They are very familiar with me looking for good deals.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.540]   They're used to wearing used clothes.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:25.680]   And we talk a lot about budgeting and about money and about financial freedom and even
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:27.480]   compound interest with my 11 year old.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:29.000]   He, you know, he understands that now.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.760]   So yeah, we just really, you know, I didn't get that financial training.
[00:37:33.760 --> 00:37:36.800]   And so we work really hard to, to instill it in our children.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:39.160]   I think it makes all the difference in the world.
[00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:45.520]   I look at young men and women and the ones who go into a ditch financially are usually
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.800]   trying to satisfy something that their parents didn't teach them.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:55.080]   You know, buying expensive athletic shoes is often a way of appearing cool.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.720]   But if you can adjust those goals and give a different, better goal, you can, you can
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:00.480]   set your children on a strong course.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:01.480]   Exactly.
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:02.480]   All right.
[00:38:02.480 --> 00:38:03.480]   You've got 12 steps.
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:04.960]   Give us your 12 steps as a brief overview.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:09.680]   I mean, tons of content in the book, but I've got a listener who says, Hey, I'm frustrated
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.040]   with my spending.
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:15.360]   I, you know, I connect with what you're saying, Lauren, that, that I also am a spender.
[00:38:15.360 --> 00:38:19.120]   What are the 12 steps that I need to, to overcome my addiction to spending?
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:20.120]   All right.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:23.760]   So step one is to admit that you have a problem.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.760]   Wait a second.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.760]   I've heard this somewhere.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:26.760]   You stole these 12 steps.
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:34.520]   No, actually, you know, I, I, I saw this 12 steps of like a spenders anonymous or whatever.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:35.680]   And I thought, you know what?
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:38.920]   Like I like step one and I like step two.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:42.920]   So we're going to use those two, but then the rest of them are a little, are a lot different.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:45.320]   So so step one, admit you have a problem.
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:51.320]   I think the biggest thing for me was to be an admit that like, I can't use credit cards.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:58.760]   I can't, um, you know, I know my weaknesses and I really want to be, uh, transparent with
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:00.560]   that so that I don't overspend.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:04.480]   So, um, so number one is to admit that you have a problem.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.960]   And I actually have, um, so let me read you these, these 20 questions.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:13.840]   And, and I say, I talk about this in this chapter of the book too, but I want to share
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:18.200]   it and kind of get into depth of that with you on here that most, most spenders will
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.880]   answer yes to at least five of these questions.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.360]   So I'm going to read these 20 questions to you.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.960]   So if somebody says yes to five of these, then, you know, my guess is that you have
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:27.960]   a spending problem.
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   Okay.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.640]   So number one, um, is your spending making your family unhappy?
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:34.240]   Even you unhappy could do that.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.360]   Um, do the feelings of being in debt cause you to lose sleep at night?
[00:39:38.360 --> 00:39:42.120]   Does the pressure of getting out of debt distract you from daily living or work?
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.000]   Um, have you ever borrowed something and failed to give it back?
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Now this is interesting.
[00:39:47.120 --> 00:39:52.240]   A lot of people don't think about this, but it shows a disrespect for money and that shows
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:56.200]   that you don't have empathy for other people's money if you constantly borrow things and
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:57.200]   give people back.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:40:01.320]   So if you don't have empathy for other people's money, how can you have empathy for your own?
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:07.600]   Uh, number five, are you afraid that your friends will, you know, work, coworkers, church
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:09.000]   will find out about your spending.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.040]   Uh, number six, do you pray for someone to give you a large sum of money to pay off your
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040]   debts?
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.040]   I can't tell you how many times I did that.
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:18.880]   I was like, God, just let a $10,000 check show up in my mailbox, right?
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   That it never happens.
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.880]   Um, cause he wanted me to do the work.
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:25.760]   Um, number seven, do you make a, do your debts make you feel bad about yourself or giving
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.680]   you a low self-esteem?
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:31.720]   Number eight, do you find yourself shopping because you feel bad about your debt?
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:34.740]   Number nine, have you ever lied to somebody about how much debt you're in?
[00:40:34.740 --> 00:40:39.520]   Number 10, have you ever borrowed money without taking into consideration how you pay it back?
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:43.840]   So that's the same thing as using a credit card without knowing where your money's going.
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:48.720]   Uh, number 11, have you ever promised something to a creditor that you know you will not be
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   able to fulfill?
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:54.600]   Number 12, do you continue to spend as if you have plenty of money and no debt despite
[00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:57.320]   having no money and being in a lot of debt?
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:02.240]   Number 13, do you continue to do everything your friends do for the fear of being found
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:03.240]   out?
[00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:04.240]   Uh, okay.
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:06.520]   The last six, have you tried fail?
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.120]   Have you tried to budget in the past but failed over and over again?
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:12.600]   Number 15, have you ever lied about spending money?
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:17.680]   Number 16, have you hidden a purchase or failed to mention it because you knew it would trouble
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:18.960]   someone?
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:21.920]   That's like me, hold, you know, hiding the stuff in the trunk of my car.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.600]   Um, do you find yourself living around chaos or drama when it comes to your money?
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:28.360]   You're always bouncing checks, missing payments.
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:30.720]   Number 18, do you live paycheck to paycheck?
[00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:33.720]   Number 19, do you have a hard time passing up a good deal?
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.320]   And number 20, do you have little to nothing in savings?
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.440]   So those are good questions.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:45.040]   If you answered five yes to five of those, um, then that those are warning signs.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:49.840]   And um, so, so that's, that's the first step.
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:53.560]   Step two, step two, get help from the one above.
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.800]   Um, this was a step.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:59.800]   This is a step in common, you know, 12 step programs.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:07.560]   Um, but I really had to realize that I was not doing a very good job on my own.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:12.720]   Um, I really needed to find, uh, something else that was bigger and outside of myself
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.720]   to help me.
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:19.200]   And so, um, I really started going back to church and reading my Bible and learning how,
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:24.200]   um, God could help me, you know, get, get better and, uh, have somebody else to rely
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:25.200]   on.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.200 --> 00:42:31.720]   I think this is a, an area where many people gloss over and, uh, I know your book is not,
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.600]   uh, necessarily intended as a religious text.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:42.560]   But if we do not see the way that we handle our money as an extension of our faithfulness
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.800]   to God, it leads to a much less of an importance on it.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:49.600]   And many people have this perspective, well, I can just do whatever I want.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:54.000]   Well, you're going to be held to account for the way that you handle your money.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:59.440]   And so if you've been faithless with the money that's under your stewardship, if you don't
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:04.640]   start with repentance of that faithlessness, you're not building on a, on a very solid,
[00:43:04.640 --> 00:43:06.720]   uh, on a solid foundation.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:08.720]   It's not just a matter of, oh, you made some mistakes.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:11.400]   It's a, it's, it's, you've been a faithless steward.
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:15.020]   Uh, and the Bible has something to say about being a faithless steward.
[00:43:15.020 --> 00:43:19.480]   And one of the great things about it is that if you begin with this foundation, uh, if
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:23.640]   you can begin with the foundation that you're a steward of the funds and that God is actually
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:29.940]   willing and able to help you to live on, on, on what you have, it transforms everything.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:34.660]   In your book, you briefly quote, um, one of the favorite scriptures that I love to talk
[00:43:34.660 --> 00:43:37.020]   about with people, scripture Philippians 4.13.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:42.140]   It's one of the most quoted that probably, probably about five Bible verses.
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:45.220]   I always laugh when people are like, here's my favorite Bible verse.
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:52.020]   About, uh, I would guess there's five Bible verses that probably account for, uh, 80%
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:54.700]   of the time when people say, here's my favorite Bible verse.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.740]   And what's fascinating to me about each of those Bible verses is that they're usually
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:01.140]   not put into context.
[00:44:01.140 --> 00:44:06.060]   So for example, um, one of the favorite ones, uh, that people say, Jeremiah 29, 11, for
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.060]   I know the plans I have for you says the Lord, you know, plans to prosper you and plans to
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:11.500]   give you hope in the future.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:15.260]   I always tell the people, have you read the 29 chapters before that?
[00:44:15.260 --> 00:44:21.300]   Because if you read the 29 chapters before that, you might not quote that verse so readily.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:24.860]   Another one though, is this is the verse Philippians 4.13.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:29.260]   Uh, and what happens is, is that Christians have this terrible disease of quoting Bible
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:31.020]   verses out of context.
[00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.540]   And so you'll often see the verse Philippians 4.13, I can do everything through him who
[00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:38.940]   gives me strength, quoted and applied to all kinds of things.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.780]   And you get it and people get really kind of strangely mystical, uh, at some point.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:45.580]   And we ask people, what can you do through him who gives you strength?
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:49.900]   I can go through cancer, you know, I can lift a car off of, wait a second, at some point
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:52.300]   in time, we have a question, uh, about that.
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:56.980]   But what's so fascinating is if you actually look at that verse and you actually look at
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:45:04.380]   it in context and you go back and you say, what can you actually do through God who strengthens
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:05.380]   you?
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:08.300]   And I don't deny that, that God can strengthen you to go through a cancer diagnosis.
[00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:11.980]   I don't deny that God can strengthen you to go through these things, but that's not what
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:14.300]   that verse is actually talking about.
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:18.540]   What that verse actually applies to when, when the Bible says I can do all things through
[00:45:18.540 --> 00:45:25.540]   him who strengthens me, that verse is being applied to living on your income, whatever
[00:45:25.540 --> 00:45:26.540]   it is.
[00:45:26.540 --> 00:45:28.140]   It's a hundred percent about money management.
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:32.260]   It's not about this mystical sense of I can go through cancer, I can face this difficult
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:34.500]   relationship, I can deal with my drinking problem.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.260]   Well, you might be able to deal with those things, but you can't take this verse and
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.460]   just make it a blanket statement that you can do all things through him who strengthens
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:42.460]   me.
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:49.820]   And the context of that verse is where, I'll read it just for listeners who are interested,
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:53.700]   but the context of that verse, Paul says this in Philippians, "I rejoiced in the Lord greatly
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:57.740]   that now at length you have revived your concern for me.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:01.220]   You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:07.900]   Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:09.260]   to be content.
[00:46:09.260 --> 00:46:13.300]   I know how to be brought low and I know how to abound.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:21.700]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.060]   and need.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:26.380]   I can do all things through him who strengthens me."
[00:46:26.380 --> 00:46:30.220]   And when you put the verse into its proper context and you don't take it as this mystical
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:36.340]   let me wave a Bible verse at life, but you actually say, "Oh, I can live on my income."
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:38.620]   It makes it so much more powerful.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:43.180]   So one of my biggest frustrations when people misquote and misapply scripture, and so I'm
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:47.460]   glad to see that verse actually spoken about in the context of living on your income, because
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:48.460]   that's what it's talking about.
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:49.460]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:50.460]   I'm glad you brought that up.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.460]   Did I steal your sermon?
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.460]   No, go ahead.
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:53.460]   I'm loving it.
[00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:54.460]   Bring it on.
[00:46:54.460 --> 00:46:55.460]   I'm loving it.
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.820]   A little pet peeve of mine.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:03.580]   And I encourage all of, the majority of my audience is a mixture of secular and partial
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.140]   Christianity, but I encourage you, if you know a Christian who misquotes scripture,
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.060]   someone quotes John 3.16 to you, ask him what John 3.15 says and ask him what John 3.17
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.060]   says.
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:17.420]   If someone quotes Jeremiah 29.11 to you, ask them to describe the context of the first
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:22.820]   29 chapters of Jeremiah and explain to you why God is saying what his plans are for you
[00:47:22.820 --> 00:47:23.820]   in your future.
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:24.820]   Right.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:28.140]   And help them to be a little bit more diligent with understanding what their Bibles say.
[00:47:28.140 --> 00:47:29.620]   Oh, I totally agree with you.
[00:47:29.620 --> 00:47:35.380]   And you know, it's interesting because in my book I talk about my experience with Mary
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:41.060]   K. and that was one of their Bible verses that they promoted all the time.
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:45.860]   Yes, it was about finances, but it was all about like growing bigger in the company and
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:46.860]   all of that.
[00:47:46.860 --> 00:47:53.020]   And it was just totally, in my opinion, the opposite of what the verse was supposed to
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:58.780]   mean because they were all about, you know, recruiting and getting more people and more
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:48:02.220]   debt and, you know, sharing the opportunities that their company can grow.
[00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.300]   And I don't know.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.620]   So I break that all down for you.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.460]   And, you know, some people might be upset that I kind of rag on MLM, you know, multi-level
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:12.940]   marketing companies, but it's my experience and my truth that, you know, they're not all
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.940]   good.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:14.940]   Yeah, definitely not.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:15.940]   All right.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:16.940]   Step three.
[00:48:16.940 --> 00:48:20.860]   Step three, admit your spending to someone else.
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:27.380]   So for me, I needed to kind of just talk about, you know, what was going on.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:32.340]   And so for Mark, I told him first and then I told a bunch of my other friends.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:38.180]   But I think one of the strange things is that when being vulnerable, it actually, you know,
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:39.740]   a lot of people think like vulnerability.
[00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:45.040]   If I tell my friends, what are they going to say that actually looks at as weakness.
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:51.140]   But I talk about it as vulnerability is actually the most accurate measurement of courage.
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:55.300]   And so when people come out to talk about, you know, I might not be able to go to this
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.940]   mall, you know, tell your friends if you have a spending problem or if you think that you
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:04.980]   need to just get out of debt or, you know, that vulnerability is a sign of courage that
[00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:05.980]   you want to get help.
[00:49:05.980 --> 00:49:09.340]   And so that's my step number three.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:10.740]   It's really hard to do things alone.
[00:49:10.740 --> 00:49:14.500]   And especially if it's going to involve a significant life change, it is hard to do
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:15.500]   things alone.
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:19.260]   And the key is to recognize that when you're doing something positive, I mean, if you're
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:22.300]   saying I'm going to go become a drug addict, you probably don't need to tell other people
[00:49:22.300 --> 00:49:24.980]   that because they're not really going to encourage you.
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.080]   They'll probably figure it out anyway.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:31.440]   But if you're saying, "Hey, I'm going to stop using drugs by enlisting the help of
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:34.060]   other people," or "I'm going to stop spending so much money," or "We're getting out of
[00:49:34.060 --> 00:49:36.100]   debt," you can do two things.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:41.020]   Number one, you can involve them in your journey and that will adjust their behavior.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:44.020]   They'll invite you to a potluck or they'll invite you to come along with them to the
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.120]   beach instead of to the mall.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:49.140]   And it will help and be a positive influence on their lives.
[00:49:49.140 --> 00:49:53.740]   And most of us have been influenced by somebody else who's losing weight, somebody else who's
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:54.940]   getting out of debt.
[00:49:54.940 --> 00:49:57.860]   And that can help you to impact their life.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.860]   And you know what?
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:05.540]   There's a TED Talk that I quoted in the book that by, I believe it's Mr. Brown.
[00:50:05.540 --> 00:50:10.580]   And he says that if you put shame in a Petri dish, it needs three things to grow, secrecy,
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:12.140]   silence, and judgment.
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:17.300]   If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy, it can't survive.
[00:50:17.300 --> 00:50:23.660]   And so, you know, by keeping your shame of spending or whatever you're dealing with and
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:27.580]   keeping that secrecy and the silence and judging, maybe judging yourself or somebody else judging
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.180]   you, you know, that's going to make it even get worse.
[00:50:30.180 --> 00:50:32.740]   And so empathy is super huge.
[00:50:32.740 --> 00:50:37.140]   You know, if you're listening to this and you might know a spender, you know, judgment,
[00:50:37.140 --> 00:50:40.180]   shame, secrecy, that's going to make it worse.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:42.180]   Douse it with empathy and they're going to get better.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.500]   They're starting, you know, starting and that worked for me.
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:47.460]   You know, if Mark had yelled at me and said, "You're never going to do better.
[00:50:47.460 --> 00:50:48.820]   This is just the way you are."
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:53.820]   You know, it would have been harder for me to stop spending and to get us out of debt,
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:54.820]   you know?
[00:50:54.820 --> 00:50:55.820]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.820 --> 00:50:59.220]   Step four, make a list of all the people to whom you are in debt.
[00:50:59.220 --> 00:51:00.220]   Right.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:07.100]   So this just, you know, kind of helps put everything, you know, into, you know, a list
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:08.780]   of what you have.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:13.620]   So you kind of get it all on paper, helps you not have as much stress because a lot
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:16.380]   of times we're trying to juggle all this stuff in our brain.
[00:51:16.380 --> 00:51:17.860]   So that's step number four.
[00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.860]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:21.380]   And if you don't have a list, you don't know what you're working on.
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:22.380]   Exactly.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.820]   And you can't even create an intelligent plan of attack if you don't know what the amounts
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:28.060]   are, if you don't know what the interest rates are.
[00:51:28.060 --> 00:51:32.860]   Generally, when people get out of hand, and I'm guilty of this just like anybody else,
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.060]   when things get out of hand, it's due to lack of attention.
[00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:38.020]   When your weight goes up, it's because you're not paying attention.
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:41.420]   When your debts grow and all of a sudden you wake up and say, "I owe $40,000 in debt.
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   How did that happen?"
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.220]   Well, it's because you weren't paying attention.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:50.500]   So make a list and detail and even detail what's the amount, to whom do I owe it, what
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:53.060]   are the interest rates, what are the terms.
[00:51:53.060 --> 00:51:56.660]   And then there's an episode in the podcast in the archive of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:52:00.200]   I'll look up the number in just a moment where it says, "Here's how you intelligently order
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:05.020]   that list and figure out in what order to pay off those debts."
[00:52:05.020 --> 00:52:07.100]   Rule five, take an inventory of your spending.
[00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:08.100]   Right.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:12.040]   So this is kind of as a spender, it's a good starting point.
[00:52:12.040 --> 00:52:15.120]   Similar to weighing yourself before you go on a diet, you want to know what your starting
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:16.120]   point is.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:20.840]   And so one thing that I did is took inventory of the past three months of my spending, took
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:24.740]   an average, and then that was the number that I started with a budget so it didn't feel
[00:52:24.740 --> 00:52:26.240]   so shocking to me.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:31.240]   And so I needed to know where I was overspending because that helped me figure out those triggers
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.240]   of mine as well.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:36.800]   The episode I was referring to was episode 32 of Radical Personal Finance.
[00:52:36.800 --> 00:52:39.400]   It's titled, "In What Order Should I Pay Off My Debts?
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:43.800]   A Rational Guide to the Debt Snowball, Debt Avalanche, and Other Considerations."
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:48.400]   So I encourage listeners who are doing this step to go back through there.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.760]   Step six and seven.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:53.680]   Step six is set your new budget.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:57.920]   And step seven, as I'm scrolling down through here, because I don't have my book in front
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.920]   of me.
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:52:59.920]   Create your boundaries.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.920]   Create your boundaries.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:01.920]   There you go.
[00:53:01.920 --> 00:53:02.920]   That's a good one.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.320]   So explain the budgeting process and boundaries that you teach people in the beginning.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:11.800]   So the budgeting process is take that summary that you just did of the past three months
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:16.040]   of your spending and you're going to use those numbers to create a budget for the first time.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:19.480]   You're going to figure out what you want, what your needs and your wants are.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:22.200]   You start with your wants, putting them into the budget when you run out of money.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:23.200]   Or I'm sorry.
[00:53:23.200 --> 00:53:26.640]   You start with your needs in the budget and as you're going through, once you start running
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.960]   out of money, those wants you have to get rid of.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:33.440]   So if you have to get rid of DirecTV or because you just can't afford it, you have to learn
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.080]   how to do that.
[00:53:35.080 --> 00:53:37.960]   And then the goal is to stick to the budget for the first month.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:41.520]   So the goal is not to dramatically reduce the money that you have been spending in that
[00:53:41.520 --> 00:53:42.520]   first month.
[00:53:42.520 --> 00:53:46.960]   The goal is to stick to the budget because as a spender, we need to be able to feel empowered.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:49.120]   And so I always teach people to do that.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:51.080]   Just use what you have been spending.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:53.440]   You know, we have time to get out of debt.
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.860]   But for right now, you need to feel empowered to start moving forward.
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:54:01.880]   So do you prep people for, do you expect you will be good at budgeting in the beginning
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.400]   or do you prep people for failure?
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   Oh, no.
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:09.240]   I expect that it's going to take about three to six months for us to get this figured out,
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:16.200]   to be able to stick to it, to get the numbers right, to give them a little wiggle room so
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.840]   that they have some sort of play money.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:19.160]   Because I think that's really important.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:25.400]   You know, whether it's $5 or $50 a month or whatever, you know, I think that that's really
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:26.400]   important.
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:31.160]   And so I think it takes, you know, a good three to six months for us spenders to really
[00:54:31.160 --> 00:54:32.160]   kind of get under control.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.400]   I just want to emphasize that because budgeting is a skill.
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:40.800]   And if you do not have that skill, which you obviously don't because you're saying I'm
[00:54:40.800 --> 00:54:45.520]   a spender and I'm trying to change, then to expect to go from no skill to perfect skill
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:46.520]   is illogical.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:49.360]   And there's going to be a process.
[00:54:49.360 --> 00:54:53.320]   And so I think it's much safer to view it and say, "Over the next six months, I'm going
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:55.240]   to learn to become skillful with budgeting."
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:57.960]   That's a doable thing.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:03.240]   And you can build the skills to plan because budgets get messed up, budgets get thrown
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:06.920]   off and it takes time to build those skills.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:11.000]   And I think it's really important too because most spenders have budgeted and failed and
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.200]   budgeted and failed and they just feel like they can never get it.
[00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:18.240]   And so by setting the precedent that, you know what, like we're going to do this, it's
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:21.800]   going to take us like probably three months to get these numbers right.
[00:55:21.800 --> 00:55:24.760]   So let's just expect that we're going to have some wiggle room.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.280]   You're going to need to try your best.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:31.000]   Like I'm expecting you to stick to this, but we're going to wiggle with these numbers a
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   little bit.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.720]   And you know, in three months, you're going to be doing great.
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:38.280]   But I think to encourage them because they're so used to failing at it, that to encourage
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:41.160]   them that like, "We can do this and this is what's going to happen."
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:45.560]   Next, declutter your life to regain your joy.
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:46.560]   Step eight.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:50.560]   So we talked about a little bit about that earlier, about decluttering your life, regaining
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:55.720]   your joy, going through your house, finding things to sell, using that money to pay down
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:58.840]   debt or put it aside in an emergency fund.
[00:55:58.840 --> 00:56:03.920]   And then, you know, learning how to just kind of declutter your house and declutter your
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:07.720]   brain so that you can move forward with joy again.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.960]   What do you mean by step nine?
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:09.960]   Declutter your finances.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.960]   Okay.
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.160]   So declutter your finances.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:17.400]   Like this was really hard for me at first because I had things that were coming out
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.640]   of my bank account that I didn't realize it.
[00:56:19.640 --> 00:56:25.360]   Like you know, all of a sudden all these like iTunes things would pop up and you know, Netflix
[00:56:25.360 --> 00:56:30.000]   was coming out and I just didn't know what we were spending money on because I would
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.720]   sign up for a free trial and then all of a sudden, you know, what happens when you don't
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:35.840]   look at your checking account because I wasn't.
[00:56:35.840 --> 00:56:40.080]   I wasn't looking at my checking statement like ever back then is that I had cluttered
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.080]   finances.
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:44.800]   I had stuff going on that I didn't know and things would come out and checks would bounce.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:50.200]   So I talk about decluttering your finances that you need to, you know, figure out all
[00:56:50.200 --> 00:56:51.440]   the details about your money.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.920]   You need to write down your credit cards.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:53.960]   What are the interest rates?
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:54.960]   When are the due dates?
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.480]   What are the minimum payments?
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:57:00.040]   I always tell people to set up what I call a money flow center so that everything has
[00:57:00.040 --> 00:57:01.040]   a place.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:10.080]   So you know, I have a basket and in the basket is all of like our checks, stamps, pens, envelopes
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:11.680]   for all of our bills.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:15.600]   So everything is in one place in our house and everybody knows that that's where all
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.520]   of the money stuff goes.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:23.440]   And so, you know, just making sure that your finances are decluttered for everybody so
[00:57:23.440 --> 00:57:25.360]   that they know where everything is as well.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:31.080]   And also with regard to decluttering your finances, I encourage people minimize the
[00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:32.640]   number of accounts that you have.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:35.000]   Minimize the number of things that you're tracking.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.800]   Oftentimes people have very complicated financial lives.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:39.360]   I got three credit cards that I'm using.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:40.840]   I've got a couple of checking accounts.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:42.320]   I got a savings account.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:46.000]   And then they go from having no money management system to trying to have a money management
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:47.800]   system for five accounts.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:49.840]   That's hard to do.
[00:57:49.840 --> 00:57:50.840]   Start simple.
[00:57:50.840 --> 00:57:56.040]   Just minimize, downsize down to one checking account and do everything out of one checking
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.040]   account.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:58.880]   Try to keep things very, very simple.
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:58:02.960]   The simpler you have things, the better it will be.
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:03.960]   Right.
[00:58:03.960 --> 00:58:04.960]   Exactly.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.960]   Exactly.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:10.360]   So step 10 is do an expense audit.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:15.480]   This is just a careful examination of your day to day, you know, day to day spending.
[00:58:15.480 --> 00:58:20.880]   Free up more money for your emergency fund and just really make sure, you know, this
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:24.040]   is when you take a look at like, do I really need to watch cable?
[00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:28.880]   You know, if I took that same money for cable and I put it aside, then I would have, you
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:32.840]   know, almost enough cable or enough money to pay for my son's college, you know, when
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:34.280]   he was born.
[00:58:34.280 --> 00:58:40.200]   And so, so those kind of things to kind of look at the big picture stuff and cancel things
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.200]   that you don't need.
[00:58:41.200 --> 00:58:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.640]   Next 11, which is get out of debt now.
[00:58:44.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   I'm like, what is that now?
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.760]   I don't have my, I forgot my book at the office.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:52.800]   I'm scrolling through the manuscript on my computer and I'm not going fast enough, Josh.
[00:58:52.800 --> 00:58:53.800]   Get out of debt now.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:54.800]   Get out of debt now.
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.640]   So this is all about strategically paying down debt.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:59.680]   And I know you have a podcast on it because I listen to it because I like, I love your
[00:58:59.680 --> 00:59:00.680]   podcast.
[00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.880]   So I listen to it almost in every flight I'm listening to, Josh.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.760]   Just so you know.
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:09.240]   So, so I love, I love talking about this part and I actually in a book, I have a little
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:14.880]   chart that shows the difference between paying off the lowest, the lowest balance versus
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:16.720]   the highest interest rate first.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.320]   And so, you know, a lot of people are, there's two different, I mean, you know, there's two
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.880]   different fields of thought on this that people think that paying down the highest interest
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:27.760]   rate is better.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:33.080]   But I did a scenario where I took $1,200 in credit cards.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:38.600]   And so if I paid off the highest interest rate first, it actually ended up getting paid
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:41.840]   off one month sooner, I believe.
[00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:44.120]   And we had one month sooner.
[00:59:44.120 --> 00:59:46.720]   But, but you didn't have those small wins along the way.
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:52.040]   So it just gives you some questions about, you know, how do you pay off your debt strategically?
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:54.400]   Which, which order do you want to do it?
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:58.440]   You know, personal loans, credit cards, car loans, friends.
[00:59:58.440 --> 01:00:02.000]   And so I break that down in that chapter as well.
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:07.240]   The key, the key to this question, which has very simple answer, it's called looking at
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:09.680]   an actual individual situation and running the math.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.960]   But the key is the makeup of the debt and how aggressive the payoff plan is.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:20.000]   There's no question mathematically that if you're paying the same amount of money to
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:25.280]   a higher interest rate debt, that you won't have, that you'll have a better mathematical
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:26.280]   outcome.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:27.600]   It's, it's very simple.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:31.480]   The question is, are you actually going to be paying that amount of money?
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:35.840]   There's also, in my mind, no question that if you have somebody with a few small debts
[01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:40.000]   and a couple big ones, that you can get a big psychological win by getting rid of a
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.920]   few small ones and by having your mental energy focused.
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:49.720]   So, but in terms of applying it, you have, in order for there to be a significant, like
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:53.680]   in order for them to be comparable, you got to recognize that, that you're, you're going
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.520]   to be paying off the debt in a short period of time.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:58.480]   That's the goal is paying off the debt in a short period of time.
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:01.760]   And if you're really hustling, you're paying off debt in a couple of years, then there's
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:04.480]   not going to be a huge impact of interest rates.
[01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:08.280]   And you have to look at the actual makeup of somebody's debt.
[01:01:08.280 --> 01:01:12.360]   I got an email a few days ago from a listener who said, "I got one debt, I think it was
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.680]   $15,000 at this higher interest rate, and I got another debt that's $17,000 of a lower
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:18.680]   interest rate," or, or vice versa, excuse me.
[01:01:18.680 --> 01:01:21.680]   And is there going to be a big psychological win for that person?
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:27.160]   I don't know, maybe not, not so much as there is if somebody has a Target card with $300
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:32.240]   on it, a Pet Boys card with $400 on it, you know, et cetera, and then a big debt over
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:33.240]   here of $12,000.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.920]   Well, yes, there's going to be a big psychological win.
[01:01:35.920 --> 01:01:37.960]   So no problem with that.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:41.400]   Details on that discussion in episode 32 of Radical Personal Finance.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:44.920]   Finally, step 12, curb your spending and define your values.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:49.800]   Yeah, so this goes back to what people value in life and what people are chasing.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:51.960]   You know, are you chasing retirement?
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.960]   Are you chasing being able to travel when you're older?
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:58.120]   Are you chasing, you know, financial security right now?
[01:01:58.120 --> 01:02:02.400]   And we have to learn always how to make your spending a reflection of that value system.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.520]   And so part of, of helping spenders, and I think anybody can, can really relate to this,
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:11.440]   is that you, we really have to be spending our money according to the values that we
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.800]   hold really dear in life.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:15.920]   And you know, when I was spending, I wasn't doing that.
[01:02:15.920 --> 01:02:22.080]   I was, I was doing what I wanted then, but I wasn't doing, you know, what I wanted for
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:23.320]   the long run.
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:27.520]   And so I, that's why I put it as the last chapter is I feel like it's so important for
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:32.080]   us to really put our money where our values are.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:38.400]   And recognize that you, only you are going to know the place that you are in life.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.800]   You might see somebody who's able to, to drive to the mall in a Mercedes and go around and
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:46.120]   do some impulse shopping and walk away with a few thousands of dollars worth of stuff
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:47.400]   in a bag.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:52.880]   And for that person, it may make zero impact to their financial life because they have
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:56.240]   millions of dollars of income coming in from the dividends of their stocks and you don't
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.280]   know anything about their history.
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:02.160]   But if it's putting you in a place where you're stressed out and it's causing your relationships
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:09.400]   to suffer and you're suffering from depression and, and, and, and, and fear about the future,
[01:03:09.400 --> 01:03:15.000]   well you might want to face it and recognize that your values probably don't include depression
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:20.880]   and fear about the future and that a few simple decisions in, in your spending decisions can
[01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:21.880]   make a big difference.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880]   Yep.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.880]   So true.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.880]   So true.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:25.880]   Well Lauren, I want to compliment you on writing the book.
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:29.080]   I've been impressed very much with all the progress that you've been making on the business.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:34.280]   I Am That Lady and all of the associated, all the associated businesses.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.920]   You're getting some tremendous press, tremendous.
[01:03:36.920 --> 01:03:37.920]   Thank you.
[01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:40.160]   Your public relations work is, is fantastic.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.960]   And so I'm just thrilled to see all of the success that you and Mark are enjoying.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.420]   And I recommend if anybody is, is suffering from spending, this book is very targeted
[01:03:50.420 --> 01:03:53.520]   towards people who are spending.
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:04:00.840]   And Lauren's, Lauren's experience is an experience that many, many people share of being high
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.600]   consumption and the stress that comes with it.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:04.680]   It's not a book on investing.
[01:04:04.680 --> 01:04:06.560]   It's not a book on, on, on how to get rich.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.320]   It's a book on how to adjust spending.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.320]   The title is The Recovering Spender, How to Live a Happy, Fulfilled, Debt-Free Life.
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:16.600]   And so this would be a great book for you to pick up if that's you or if you've got,
[01:04:16.600 --> 01:04:19.880]   if you're looking for a present or a gift for somebody who's struggling with it and
[01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:24.760]   would like to hear it firsthand, this would be a great, a great book for somebody in that
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.760]   situation.
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:26.760]   Thank you.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:27.760]   And when does the book launch?
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.040]   September 13th, but people can pre-order it now at therecoveringspender.com.
