[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   what was some of the twitter rants is that stuff that now because of backlash you are like hesitant
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.080]   to talk on or do you stand on some of that stuff i mean i'm always gonna stand on stuff i'm not
[00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.320]   like a super big conspiracy theorist but people really didn't know about the bohemian grove but
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.920]   that's actually been around for a minute real politicians got together into the woods which
[00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.140]   sounds crazy and and did like weird like rituals i don't think it's that far-fetched because once
[00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.000]   people get money and then they get fame the only next thing is power like y'all call me crazy that's
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   crazy like bro i don't care how big i get i ain't going to no woods and celebrating no owl and it's
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.420]   burning and when you start talking about this stuff you usually get labeled as crazy lunatic weirdo and
[00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.440]   i just felt like it was my mission to start speaking the truth shit
