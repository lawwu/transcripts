[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720]   - You're always at the edge of the set of principles
[00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.000]   you've developed, you're doing new things always.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.840]   - Right.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.360]   - That's where the intellect is needed.
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.640]   - Well, and the inspiration.
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.640]   The inspiration is needed to do that, right?
[00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.280]   Like, what are you doing it for?
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.000]   It's the excitement. - So what is that thing?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.840]   What is that thing?
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.800]   - The adventure, the curiosity, the hunger.
[00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.760]   - What's, if you can be Freud for a second,
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:24.800]   what's in that subconscious?
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.040]   What's the thing that drives us?
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.040]   - I think you can't generalize of us.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.660]   I think different people are driven by different things.
[00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.840]   There's not a common one, right?
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.000]   So, like if you would take the shapers,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   I think it is a combination of subliminally,
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.080]   it's a combination of excitement, curiosity.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.000]   - Is there a dark element there?
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.860]   Is there demons, is there fears?
[00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.000]   Is there, in your sense, something dark that drives them?
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   - Most of the ones that I'm dealing with,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.800]   I have not seen that.
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.320]   I see the, what I really see is,
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.760]   whoo, if I can do that, that would be the most dream.
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.480]   And then the act of creativity, and you say, ooh.
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.280]   So excitement is one of the things.
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.040]   Curiosity is a big pull, okay?
[00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.840]   And then tenacity, you know, okay, to do those things.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.440]   But definitely, emotions are entering into it.
[00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.800]   Then there's an intellectual component of it, too, okay?
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.160]   It may be empathy.
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.840]   Can I have an impact?
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.080]   Can I have an impact?
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.320]   The desire to have an impact, that's an emotional thrill.
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.360]   But it also has empathy.
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.840]   And then you start to see spirituality.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.060]   By spirituality, I mean the connectedness to the whole.
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.440]   You start to see people operate those things.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.500]   Those tend to be the things that you see the most of.
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.560]   - And I think you're gonna shut down this idea completely,
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.640]   but there's a notion that some of these shapers
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.560]   really walk the line between sort of madness and genius.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.040]   Do you think madness has a role in any of this?
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.360]   Or do you still see Steve Jobs and Elon Musk
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.240]   as fundamentally rational?
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.000]   - Yeah, there's a continuum there.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.800]   And what comes to my mind is that
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   genius is often at the edge,
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.520]   in some cases, imaginary genius,
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.280]   is at the edge of insanity.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.920]   And it's almost like a radio that I think,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.760]   okay, if I can tune it just right, it's playing right.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   But if I go a little bit too far, it goes off, okay?
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.780]   And so you can see this.
[00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.400]   Kay Jamison was studying bipolar.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.040]   What it shows is that that's definitely the case,
[00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.640]   'cause when you're going out there,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.520]   that imagination, whatever,
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.040]   is at the, can be near the edge sometimes.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.600]   Doesn't have to always be.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.760]   (silence)
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.920]   (silence)
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.080]   (silence)
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.240]   (silence)
[00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.400]   (silence)
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.560]   (silence)
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.720]   (silence)
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.720]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
