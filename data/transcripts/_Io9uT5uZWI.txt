[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.940]   We all choose different paths in life.
[00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.200]   I've gone to Seals and worked in White Houses,
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.200]   and now I'm a senior executive in a public company.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.680]   And so that doesn't mean my path is the right path.
[00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.360]   Everybody's got different passions
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.520]   and abilities and interests.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.000]   And if I wrote something that only pertained
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.880]   to people who have followed similar paths to mine,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.400]   then I wouldn't be achieving the goal of the book,
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.560]   which is to try to make as positive of an impact
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.760]   in as many people as possible's lives.
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:30.880]   And so that's really what I've aspired to do.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.240]   I think that no matter where you are,
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.240]   the principles that engender and cause the success
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:41.880]   in the Seals or the White Houses or wherever you are,
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.520]   are really the same thing no matter what somebody chooses
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.280]   to do in life, whether you're being a better father
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.000]   or a husband or a better neighbor or a better person
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   on your town board or a nonprofit board.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.320]   It just doesn't matter what path people choose.
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.440]   In fact, it's very important, and why I write about this
[00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.920]   is to celebrate that we all are motivated
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.600]   by different things, we all have different passions
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.360]   and interests and abilities, and people who choose
[00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.320]   different paths than us should be celebrated
[00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.280]   because that's what takes the world to go around.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.480]   - Hello, and welcome to another episode of "All The Hacks,"
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.520]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.560]   I'm Chris Hutchins, and I am excited you're joining me today
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.720]   for a conversation with Mike Hayes,
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.600]   who happens to have one of the most impressive resumes
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.280]   I have ever seen.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.200]   He spent 20 years in the U.S. Navy Seals,
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.120]   serving around the world, including the conflicts
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.780]   in Bosnia, Kosovo, Iraq, and Afghanistan.
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.580]   His last job in the Navy was the commanding officer
[00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:45.460]   of Seal Team Two, overseeing a 2,000-person
[00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.680]   Special Operations Task Force in southeastern Afghanistan.
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.960]   Before that, he was a White House Fellow
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.360]   and served as Director of Defense Policy
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.440]   and Strategy at the National Security Council.
[00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.520]   And after his military career, Mike spent four years
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.960]   at the investment firm Bridgewater before moving
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.800]   into the tech sector, where he's now
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.520]   the Chief Digital Transformation Officer at VMware.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.640]   And just last year, he published his first book,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.120]   "Never Enough," which is about living a life
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.960]   of excellence, agility, and meaning.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.880]   Oh, and if that's not enough, he is also fluent
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.000]   in German and Spanish.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.480]   In our conversation, I wanna unpack what he's learned
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.960]   about leadership, decision-making,
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.920]   handling difficult situations, manufacturing discomfort,
[00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.240]   and what it takes to embrace the principles
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.200]   of excellence, agility, and meaning.
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.940]   I am so excited for this conversation, so let's jump in.
[00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.040]   Mike, thank you for being here.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.640]   It's an honor to speak with you.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.400]   Thank you for your service.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.680]   Chris, the honor is mine.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.560]   It's so awesome to be around people
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.440]   who have made this great nation greater,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.320]   so thanks for having me here today.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.880]   I'm just gonna jump in.
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.800]   In the intro to your book, you laid out
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.680]   these three principles, excellence, agility, and meaning,
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   and you say they cover the spectrum
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.080]   of what we need to aim for in everything we do.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.320]   So first off, thanks for boiling the entire ocean of life
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.600]   down to three principles, but more importantly,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.640]   what led you narrow the world of potential principles
[00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:20.960]   down to these three?
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.120]   Well, man alive, I think if you understand me,
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.920]   the famous words of Epictetus, the Stoic philosopher,
[00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.640]   he said, "When somebody criticizes you,
[00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.480]   "the only correct answer is to say,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.000]   "clearly you don't know me well enough,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.320]   "for if you knew me better,
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.040]   "you would criticize me for my far greater faults."
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.040]   So anyways, the three things, excellence, agility,
[00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.120]   and meaning, I have to start with the last one.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.640]   I've recently gone over the half-century mark,
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.680]   and all that does is means that I've messed some things up
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.080]   in life and got wisdom from things
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.400]   that I could have done better.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:54.040]   And one thing I'm very confident in though,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.800]   that is the world is about meaning.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.320]   It's how do you find purpose?
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.480]   How do you have impact?
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.040]   How do you make a difference?
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.320]   You know, I've been very, very fortunate in my life
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.760]   to be around a bunch of people who the world would think,
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.400]   would deem and define as ultra successful.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.320]   And from all of these conversations,
[00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.120]   I will tell you that every single person,
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:16.160]   no matter how much money or how rich and famous they are,
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.920]   they will tell you that their life is the richest
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.800]   when they're giving back
[00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.600]   and they're making a difference for others.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.560]   And I've, you know, in the SEALs or in two White Houses,
[00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.440]   I've been very privileged to be able to give back.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.280]   I've been through some hard days also,
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.600]   and many hard days like every SEAL of my era has,
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.160]   but I have to start with the meaning aspect of that
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.040]   because everybody has to find their own reason
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.880]   for being here.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.920]   And so that's number one.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.360]   And then you say, how do you do that?
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.440]   So meaning is kind of the what.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.800]   The how is really focusing on excellence and agility.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.920]   The excellence I've often said, we're only excellent
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:52.600]   if we know we're never excellent enough.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.360]   And that, please don't mishear me.
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.320]   It's like the title of the book,
[00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.720]   "Never Enough" can get interpreted as,
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.160]   you know, not positive enough or not good enough.
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.000]   And no, no, no, no, no.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.320]   It's about always striving to be a little bit better,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.760]   but at the same time being satisfied with who we are.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.720]   I know that sounds a little bit paradoxical,
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.840]   but really the point is excellence is about drive
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:19.600]   and determination to continue to get better.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.880]   I spent a whole third of the book on that.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.720]   And then the last, the third one, I would say agility.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.400]   Look, that's about dropping into a situation
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.040]   and understanding that you need to be different things
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.640]   and have different tools in the toolkit
[00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.640]   and be able to approach life different ways
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.080]   in order to create that meaning and impact.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.520]   So the first is the what, and the other two are the how.
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.360]   Chris.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.680]   - I think I've been fortunate to read the book.
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.960]   I've got it right here.
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.840]   Thank you for sending me a copy.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.800]   What I will say is now that I've read it, I understand it,
[00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:53.880]   but I think some people might read the intro,
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.720]   read the beginning and think,
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.160]   "Wow, so many of these principles that you share
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:00.360]   involve these wild life and death situations.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.000]   They might not feel relatable."
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.280]   Do you think that those lessons can still be taken
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.880]   and used when stakes aren't as high?
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   - 100% yes.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.000]   And that, if there's any way to judge
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.920]   whether the book has been successful or not,
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.640]   it is the question of relatability.
[00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:17.560]   Because look, we all choose different paths in life.
[00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.840]   I've gone to Seals and worked in White Houses,
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   and now I'm a senior executive in a public company.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.320]   And so that doesn't mean my path is the right path.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.000]   Everybody's got different passions
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.160]   and abilities and interests.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:31.640]   And if I wrote something that only pertained
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:34.520]   to people who have followed similar paths to mine,
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.040]   then I wouldn't be achieving the goal of the book,
[00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:40.200]   which is to try to make as positive of an impact
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:43.400]   in as many people as possible's lives.
[00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:46.480]   And so that's really what I've aspired to do.
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:48.840]   I think that no matter where you are,
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:53.000]   the principle around, the principles that engender
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.920]   and cause the success in the Seals or the White Houses
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:58.720]   or wherever you are, are really the same thing
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.800]   no matter what somebody chooses to do in life.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.080]   Whether you're being a better father or a husband
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.360]   or a better neighbor or a better person on your corporate,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:10.440]   your town board or a nonprofit board.
[00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:12.960]   Like it just doesn't matter what path people choose.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.040]   In fact, it's very important, and why I write about this,
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:18.540]   is to celebrate that we all are motivated
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:19.640]   by different things.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.940]   We all have different passions and interests and abilities.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.800]   And people who choose different paths than us
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.700]   should be celebrated because that's what takes
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.680]   the world to go around.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.280]   And so I've really aspired, I'll leave it to the readers.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.120]   You can skim through the Amazon reviews,
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.520]   but I think you'd come to the conclusion
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   that there's a lot of positivity
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.160]   around making the book relatable.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:44.080]   So I do hope people find it that way.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:46.920]   - Yeah, before we jump in, maybe let's just take an example
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.200]   of your first life and death experience in Peru
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.880]   and what that taught you about doing the right thing
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.200]   and what people can take away from that.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.840]   - Absolutely, so like I said, I'm 51 years old.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:08:01.400]   When I was 26 or so, 25, I don't know, 1996,
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.640]   so I was 23 years old.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.280]   I was leading a group of SEALs
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.000]   on my first overseas assignment in Peru.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.440]   And honestly, it was just an evening
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:13.040]   where six of my teammates had flown forward.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.800]   They were out in Quito, actually,
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:17.520]   which is an offshoot of the River Nanai,
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:20.440]   which feeds into the Amazon in the rainforest.
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:23.120]   And myself and a friend of mine, Ken,
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.160]   we're just getting a meal together.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.440]   And when we were driving back home,
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.280]   these two police cars pinned us in.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.240]   Six guys jumped out, heavily armed, right away.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.600]   And Ken and I were like, "Okay, these cops,
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.800]   "they just have us mistaken for somebody else."
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.040]   But we were wrong.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:43.360]   They were either heavy criminals or terrorists.
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.400]   We still, to this day, don't know which they were,
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.320]   but they drove us around.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.520]   They threatened me with execution and torture
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.440]   and really bad things.
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.640]   And fortunately, I'm fluent in Spanish,
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:53.280]   and I was able to communicate and just say,
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.640]   "Hey, look, we're just desk workers.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:55.680]   "We're economists.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.440]   "Your brain, in these life and death situations,
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:01.280]   "becomes a supercomputer.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:03.200]   "Everything just slows down."
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:04.040]   And you're just thinking,
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   "Okay, how do I maximize the probability
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.000]   "of living through this situation?"
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.800]   We weren't armed, et cetera.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.080]   I could have jumped out of the car and saved my life.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.360]   But I remember very vividly, Chris, thinking,
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:16.840]   "If I jump out of this car and save my life,
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.200]   "they're probably gonna shoot Ken,
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.080]   "and I could never, ever live my life
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:23.160]   "knowing that I caused harm to a teammate like that."
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:24.280]   So we stuck it out.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:25.840]   Ultimately, we lived through it.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.040]   And Chris, you asked the question
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:28.880]   about what did I learn?
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.200]   I learned a couple things.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:33.360]   Number one is when I was very near death,
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.760]   all I did was think about, at the time, my fiancee,
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.040]   now wife of 25 years.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.280]   And you just think about the people
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.120]   who you care about in life.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:44.360]   And honestly, this will sound weird,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.720]   but death, for yourself, isn't that hard.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:50.920]   I have had several near-death experiences,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:53.520]   and what I have found is that you think about
[00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:55.960]   the people who you are closest to.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:59.280]   And so, number one is, first and foremost,
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.600]   it's cliche for a reason,
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:02.080]   but live every day like it's your last.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.080]   Leave nothing unsaid.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.560]   Make sure you never miss an opportunity
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:07.160]   to tell people how important they are to you,
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.200]   and to be the best person you can be.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.640]   Quick to forgive.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.480]   Patience.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.520]   Look, I'm imperfect, like we all are,
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:16.760]   but aspire to be as least imperfect
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.200]   as we can be every day.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.720]   That's one set of learnings.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:22.880]   The other is more, I'll say, tactical, if you will.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.480]   It's like, in these situations,
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:27.160]   how do you very simply think,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.120]   okay, what's the outcome that you want,
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:31.040]   what's the strategy that's gonna get you there,
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:33.120]   and then how do you perform in the moment?
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:38.120]   And that is very simply what life as a SEAL is,
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.240]   and that was kind of foreshadowing for decades of conflict.
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:43.000]   When things get really hard,
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:45.880]   how do you stay extremely calm,
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.320]   and see the outcomes, and say,
[00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.320]   what needs to happen here in this hard moment
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.760]   in order to maximize the safety and success
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:55.080]   of my teammates and myself?
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:57.680]   So, lots of learning from a very hard situation
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.560]   at a young age, Chris.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.400]   - Wow.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.000]   Is there any training you got for slowing down
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.800]   in those moments that you could share
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:05.960]   that might be helpful to people?
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.280]   I know some people get a little anxious
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:10.760]   when things are distraught.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.600]   - Well, look, it takes practice.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.440]   Like, there's another question behind your question,
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.160]   which is, you know, people can hear me sometimes
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:19.040]   and think, wow, this guy's really got it together.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:20.480]   He knows how the world works.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.600]   I'd say, look, false.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.160]   I'm figuring it out just like everybody else, you know?
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.280]   But what I would say is that
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:29.200]   the nature versus nurture question,
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:30.960]   how much of ability is nature,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.960]   and just like, hey, you were born with a certain ability,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.040]   and how much of it is nurture?
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.760]   How much is trained, and learned, and improved?
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.720]   And, look, I think that way more of life is the nurture,
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.160]   the training, than the nature aspect,
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.600]   because it's just a matter of
[00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.480]   how good do you wanna get at something,
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   and then what's the work that it takes to get there?
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:52.000]   And are you willing to pay the cost
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:53.320]   of that work to get there?
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:57.000]   In SEAL training, my class started with 120 guys,
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.320]   19 graduated.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.800]   Now, all 220 who came in the front door
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.160]   had the physical ability to be a SEAL,
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.240]   and the 19 who graduated
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.200]   also had the mental ability to be a SEAL.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:10.640]   It's much harder, the mental aspect of these situations
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:13.560]   is really what determines the great outcomes
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.880]   and the success, Chris.
[00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:19.880]   So what you need to do is put yourself in hard situations,
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:23.880]   ideally in training, and then afterward,
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.560]   don't spend time talking about what went well.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.400]   Spend time talking about what didn't go well enough,
[00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.120]   because the next time you do something,
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.280]   inertia will keep that goodness remaining good.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.880]   What you need to do is arrest or change the direction
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:39.960]   around the things that aren't going well enough.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:42.200]   And so we, like, let me use an example,
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.320]   a SEAL platoon in the States training to go overseas
[00:12:45.320 --> 00:12:47.400]   and deploy, like, it's not training
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.920]   if we're just go out every night
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:51.280]   and we succeed and do everything perfectly.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.280]   That, like, as a commanding officer of a SEAL team,
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.280]   and if I just see people succeeding
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.720]   night after night after night,
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:12:59.960]   I'll say, "Hey, your training's not hard enough."
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:04.480]   So that failure and the coming up short and learning
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.360]   is where all of the training,
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:07.920]   is where all the learning comes from.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.400]   So then in that, and I'm sorry, this is a long answer,
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.440]   but I'm passionate about this topic, Chris.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.880]   The learning comes from the after action review
[00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:18.600]   or the hot wash or the debrief, we call it,
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.720]   and where we go around and say,
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.400]   what could have been done better?
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:22.600]   And what's really important,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.720]   and I wrote about this in the book,
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.800]   is you don't teach people what to learn,
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:28.840]   you teach people how to learn.
[00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.640]   You know, not what to think, how to think.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:33.360]   You know, when you're in a village
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:34.800]   in the middle of Iraq or Afghanistan,
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.160]   which I and many SEALs have been
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.160]   in the dark of the night many, many times,
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.320]   you're never gonna see the exact same situation
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.200]   twice.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.640]   So to say that you came out of a building and turned left
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:46.080]   and say, "Oh, you should have turned right,"
[00:13:46.080 --> 00:13:48.240]   and think that that's the debrief, false.
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:50.360]   What you wanna do is get the logic underneath it
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.760]   and say, "Why did you turn left?
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.600]   "What did you see?
[00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:54.080]   "What was going through your head?"
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.240]   And unpack that because that's gonna be,
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:00.540]   that lesson at that level, at that deeper why,
[00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:04.260]   will absolutely be used again on an operation in the future.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.100]   And that's where you can say,
[00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:07.120]   "Hey, you know, you turned left and here's why,
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.060]   "but did you think about the other side
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:10.280]   "and maybe you should have thought about it
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.160]   "a different way,
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:13.120]   "or maybe I should have thought about it a different way."
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.620]   And being in a culture where that behavior is celebrated
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.320]   as trying to make each other better,
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:20.700]   not tearing each other down,
[00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.500]   but making the team stronger is really the reason
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.840]   that all of the greatness happens.
[00:14:26.840 --> 00:14:29.400]   - You're now working in a totally different industry,
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.680]   you know, the same kind of technology industry
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:33.640]   that I've spent a lot of time in.
[00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:35.980]   Have you used that same principle
[00:14:35.980 --> 00:14:38.060]   to the way you debrief situations there?
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:41.100]   And is there a similar example using what you learned
[00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:43.440]   in a different professional environment?
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:44.280]   - Absolutely.
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.480]   I will say that the corporate environment
[00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:51.640]   is the delivery of the feedback
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.000]   has to be rangier, if you will.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.640]   We've got a wider variety of backgrounds
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:02.560]   and people in the real world than we have in the SEALs.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:05.040]   You know, and I don't mean that necessarily
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:08.160]   just from like your classic dichotomies
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.100]   that we have in the world.
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:11.080]   In the corporate environment,
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:15.560]   what we think about is how do we deliver the message
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:19.880]   so that it is the maximum probability of growth happens?
[00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.620]   You know, and that really is one thing.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:23.640]   It's do you care about the person
[00:15:23.640 --> 00:15:25.400]   you're giving the feedback to?
[00:15:25.400 --> 00:15:27.180]   You know, all of us, whether it's you or me
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.920]   or anybody listening, if we get criticized,
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.560]   well, let me not even use the word criticized.
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.040]   If we get feedback, we have a really good radar
[00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:38.560]   and a detector to be able to tell
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:40.440]   whether the person delivering the feedback
[00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:44.940]   is coming from a space of make me better or tear me down.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:48.120]   And we tend to respond really well
[00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:49.400]   when we genuinely feel like
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.020]   somebody's trying to make us better.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.600]   We don't respond well when somebody
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.200]   is just trying to tear us down.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.980]   Now, I think, so if you think about that
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:57.360]   on how do you deliver feedback,
[00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:59.920]   it has to come from the space of caring
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:01.300]   and helping the team.
[00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.700]   And I think that, look, I think that,
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:06.960]   I haven't found many people in the corporate world
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.040]   who don't want to be better.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:10.320]   Nobody wakes up and says, well, can I screw up today?
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.920]   You know, people, I think we've as a society
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.360]   become a little bit better with a lifelong of learning.
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.200]   - In the book, you talked about an experience
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:22.400]   where how to think actually was all that mattered
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.680]   because I think you got thrown into a conversation
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:27.880]   about the START Treaty, which I'm not gonna try to explain.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.020]   And you kind of had to, in a more professional environment,
[00:16:32.020 --> 00:16:34.020]   use only how to think because you didn't really
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:35.700]   have much context on what was happening.
[00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.540]   Is that fair?
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:37.360]   - That's fair.
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:40.460]   I was privileged to be selected as a White House fellow.
[00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:42.380]   And I served the last six months
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.020]   of the Bush administration.
[00:16:44.020 --> 00:16:47.700]   And then it served into the Obama administration
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.860]   and as the Director for Defense Policy and Strategy.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.100]   So I reported to the National Security Advisor
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.580]   and then, you know, I've either run or attended
[00:16:55.580 --> 00:16:58.160]   hundreds of meetings in the White House Situation Room.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.220]   And I've seen the best our nation has,
[00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:03.140]   the brightest minds solving the hardest of problems.
[00:17:03.140 --> 00:17:04.540]   But Chris, there's an inverse of that,
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:08.340]   which is also, you know, egos and desire for credit
[00:17:08.340 --> 00:17:12.180]   and lack of humility or having the meeting after the meeting,
[00:17:12.180 --> 00:17:14.180]   you know, those kinds of cultures,
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:15.500]   getting in the way of progress.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:18.260]   And so on day seven, I wrote about this in the book,
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:19.460]   a little bit of spoiler alert,
[00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:22.140]   but day seven or 10 or something like that
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.380]   in the White House, I had to kind of unstick a treaty,
[00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:28.700]   a START treaty that the interagency could not agree on.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:31.100]   So Department of Defense and Department of State
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:33.200]   and Energy and the Intelligence Community,
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.020]   they all want a different language
[00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:38.620]   in our text for the treaty.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:40.500]   And all I had to do is get everybody in a room,
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.500]   in the sit room and say,
[00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.540]   "All right, we got to come to an agreement here."
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:46.940]   And that's the how that you just described.
[00:17:46.940 --> 00:17:48.320]   Like I stood in front of the room and I said,
[00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.620]   "Look, there's 15 minutes of Washington DC
[00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.580]   standing in front of you running this room, this meeting.
[00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:57.940]   And there's 150 plus years of experience in this room,
[00:17:57.940 --> 00:18:00.260]   Washington DC experience in this room.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:03.020]   And what I can tell you is that I'm really good
[00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:05.020]   at keeping these doors shut until we figure this out."
[00:18:05.020 --> 00:18:07.620]   You know, and my other observation is
[00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.300]   that everybody in DC wants to play
[00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:11.220]   the my dad can beat up your dad game.
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:12.980]   You know, like, let's not agree at the table here.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:14.980]   We go back to our home organizations.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.180]   We tell our boss that nobody wants to agree with us
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:19.760]   and we think somebody else is gonna sort out our problems.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.240]   And so my response was simple.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:25.860]   I said, "Hey, if you think your boss is smarter than you
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:29.420]   on this topic right now, please raise your hand."
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:30.740]   And of course, nobody raised their hand,
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.580]   a little bit of a logic trap there, right, Chris?
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:33.980]   And so I said, "Okay, great.
[00:18:33.980 --> 00:18:35.940]   So we've got the smartest people in Washington DC
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.100]   in this room to go solve this issue.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:40.700]   It's our responsibility as a nation to go solve it."
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.780]   And so on, I don't know, day 20 or something,
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:45.180]   I was privileged to fly overseas
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.580]   with a White House delegation
[00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.740]   and be part of the leadership negotiating across the table
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.420]   from the Russians in 2008, you know?
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.880]   So anyways, the how there, like you said,
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:58.820]   matters way more than the what.
[00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.820]   - You just talked about the Situation Room.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:03.500]   And I think it's something that everyone has seen
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.340]   in a show, in a movie.
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:07.860]   Any fun tidbits of information you can share
[00:19:07.860 --> 00:19:10.300]   of just like, what's it actually like to be in that room?
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:11.980]   Is it what we all expect
[00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:14.860]   from watching whatever TV show we've seen?
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:19.180]   - On the one hand, the electronics and the communications
[00:19:19.180 --> 00:19:22.100]   and is always state of the art.
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.260]   I haven't been in that room in a couple of years,
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:26.060]   but it's always getting better.
[00:19:26.060 --> 00:19:27.900]   And just even from when I was in there,
[00:19:27.900 --> 00:19:31.660]   like I've led a couple of things in there
[00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:34.220]   that where we had different places
[00:19:34.220 --> 00:19:35.660]   from around the globe plugged in,
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.660]   and you've got people on kind of the nerve center,
[00:19:40.660 --> 00:19:43.740]   if you will, of the nation, and it's super cool.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:45.920]   In fact, actually, here's a good way to say it.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.920]   My swim buddy from SEAL training
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.960]   later became an astronaut, Chris Cassidy.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.360]   He's one of my greatest friends on the planet.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:57.360]   Chris is now, Chris flew the second to last shuttle mission,
[00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.600]   and then also did two deployments
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.000]   to the International Space Station.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.560]   And when Chris went on his first shuttle mission,
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.160]   I flew down to with my family to go watch it launch live.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:09.480]   It was delayed a couple of times,
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.560]   and we couldn't stay down in Cape Canaveral any longer.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:15.280]   I went back to DC and I decided during,
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.200]   his blast off was during the workday.
[00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:19.280]   I asked, there was not a meeting in the room,
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.720]   and I talked to the people on watch, we call it,
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.120]   and I said, "Hey, can we just get the launch
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.760]   "up on one of the screens?"
[00:20:27.760 --> 00:20:28.940]   And they were like, "Absolutely, sir.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:32.920]   "And would you, you know, once the shuttle's up in orbit,
[00:20:32.920 --> 00:20:35.400]   "would you like us to patch a call into your friend, Chris?"
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:39.280]   And I was just like, oh my God, this is incredible.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:40.920]   No way would I possibly do that.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.400]   That'll be like some national story
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:46.480]   of like the misappropriation or misuse of authority
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.240]   or abilities, but the ability to go
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:51.440]   from like White House sit room to space shuttle
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:53.760]   with two SEAL training, you know,
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:57.200]   friends from age 21 would have been super cool.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:00.200]   - Today's episode is brought to you by Riverside.
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.880]   And I mean, this episode literally
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:03.680]   wouldn't exist without it.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.880]   Riverside is far and above the best platform out there
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:09.760]   to record studio quality podcasts or videos
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:11.560]   from anywhere in the world.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.880]   I use it for all my remote interviews
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:17.960]   and it consistently delivers high quality audio and video.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:20.120]   And it's not just me that loves Riverside.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.040]   Tens of thousands of creators and top companies
[00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.760]   like Spotify and the New York Times use it
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.600]   to create their content.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.520]   What's amazing about Riverside is that
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.480]   it records everything locally,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.560]   which means you get high quality uncompressed audio
[00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:39.360]   and video that works even with unstable or slow wifi.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:41.380]   Then once your recording's done,
[00:21:41.380 --> 00:21:44.380]   you can use their editor to make ready to publish video
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:47.800]   with a few clicks, or you can easily download
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.640]   separate audio and video tracks
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:52.160]   and edit until your heart's content.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.600]   I don't know where I would be without Riverside.
[00:21:54.600 --> 00:21:56.420]   So if you're looking to collaborate with others
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:21:58.560]   to make audio or video content,
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:00.840]   you should definitely check them out.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.460]   And for all the Hacks listeners,

[00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:23.260]   And get 15% off with the promo code, Chris.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:27.400]   I wanna go back to what you were talking about earlier
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:30.000]   about trying to put yourself in training.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.620]   Now, I would argue that maybe the SEALS Buds training
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:36.560]   is one of the hardest, if not the hardest training programs
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.440]   that exists on the earth.
[00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:41.360]   How do you think people, mere mortals like me,
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:43.980]   can, without enlisting in the SEALS,
[00:22:43.980 --> 00:22:46.420]   which I think that ship has certainly sailed,
[00:22:46.420 --> 00:22:48.220]   kind of create some of that training
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.980]   and kind of bring on this practice you described
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.500]   as like manufacturing discomfort in their lives.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.580]   I think for people who've grown up
[00:22:55.580 --> 00:22:57.340]   in really hard situations, they know it.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:22:58.780]   For people who maybe have grown up
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:00.360]   a little bit more privileged,
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:03.840]   maybe they haven't had that discomfort and want to,
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.580]   but maybe don't wanna go run through Buds.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:09.620]   Look, I think it starts with being really clear
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:11.440]   what your goals are in life.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:15.640]   A lot of us just kind of tend to drift a little bit
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.540]   and say, "I'm just gonna go do these things."
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:19.760]   To step back from time to time and say,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.160]   "Why am I doing what I'm doing?
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.720]   "And what is the impact that I wanna have?"
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.920]   Going back to that meaning conversation
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.080]   we had at the beginning.
[00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:31.280]   So then you say, "Okay, I wanna achieve a certain thing.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:33.720]   "What's the work that it takes to go do that?"
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.320]   And a lot of times we don't try the harder things
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:39.980]   because we have this subconscious fear of failure
[00:23:39.980 --> 00:23:42.040]   or, "Hey, I might look bad
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:44.400]   "if I try something really hard and fail."
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:46.480]   Chris, I think the reframing in the brain
[00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.320]   that has to happen,
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.240]   and to some degree culture is in an organization,
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:53.600]   has to say that success, excuse me,
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.120]   if you fail and learn, you have just succeeded.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:23:59.640]   If you fail and don't learn, you've totally failed.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.840]   And so it's easy to celebrate what is clearly success,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:07.420]   but do we celebrate failure and learning enough in society?
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:12.000]   That's where I think that we as humans
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:15.200]   who don't try the hard things tend to not recognize
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:17.360]   that if we try really hard things,
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:21.240]   the people who are around are probably going to celebrate
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.860]   the fact that we tried something really hard and we learned.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.720]   If they don't, then we're around the wrong people.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:30.060]   Thinking forward in a hard situation and saying,
[00:24:30.060 --> 00:24:31.300]   "Okay, really, no kidding.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:33.720]   "What are the people who actually matter to me
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:37.600]   "going to think if I try this and it doesn't go well?"
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:38.960]   Like, spend that mental energy,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.060]   and you'll find out that, "Oh my gosh, you know what?
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:43.000]   "My family and friends aren't gonna think less of me.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.760]   "Great, let me go try to build a podcast
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.600]   "with a million or 10 million followers,"
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:51.440]   like, you know, or whatever it is that people choose to do.
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:53.320]   And so that I think is really important
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:54.720]   is to be comfortable.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.200]   I also wrote about kind of the concepts
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.640]   of confidence and humility.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.680]   A lot of people see those as a point on a single line,
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:04.440]   when in reality, you have, you know,
[00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:07.080]   confidence and humility are two different axes.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:09.600]   You can, and you have to try to aspire to live
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.800]   in that highly confident and highly humble quadrant,
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.880]   'cause those can simultaneously coexist.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:20.240]   And so I believe, ultimately, Chris,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.840]   it's about not being worried about fear of failure
[00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:25.600]   and leaning into the harder path.
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:27.800]   - On an episode recently, we were talking about health.
[00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.480]   Completely different conversation,
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.940]   but Liz Moody, who I interviewed, said,
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:34.200]   she liked manufacturing discomfort in her life.
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:37.560]   And so for her, every day before she gets out of the shower,
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:39.600]   she just throws it on the coldest it gets
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:41.160]   and stands there for 60 seconds,
[00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:43.600]   'cause it makes her feel like she did something hard
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.320]   and she thinks that that's a good skill to have.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:49.520]   Is there anything you think in your experience
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.280]   that you could tell someone listening
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.800]   that they could try today or tomorrow in their life
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.120]   to kind of manufacture just a little bit of discomfort,
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.800]   maybe that isn't a cold shower,
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:03.060]   to try to just build that tolerance for it?
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:04.500]   - Awesome, awesome, yes.
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.260]   And I've got a couple of things to throw at you.
[00:26:06.260 --> 00:26:07.740]   Some things are super simple.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:10.340]   How long can you do a plank for?
[00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:11.460]   Just think, whatever that number is,
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.540]   I don't care if it's one second or a minute or 10 minutes.
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.240]   Go do it for 10% longer or 5% longer than you think you can.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.140]   And live in that struggle like that.
[00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:24.500]   It's funny because in SEAL training,
[00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:26.940]   one of the parts of the physical fitness test
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.400]   are how many push-ups can you do in two minutes?
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:34.760]   And most SEALs do about 120 push-ups in two minutes
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.400]   on average for these tests.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.940]   The thing is, I see some people get to 120
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.720]   and then be like, "Okay, I'm fine,"
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:43.580]   and kind of like mail it in.
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:47.660]   But I also see people get to 100 and struggle super hard.
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:50.660]   What I will tell you is that I learn more about the person
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.660]   in the way that they do their last push-up
[00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:56.140]   than you'd ever imagine.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:26:59.540]   And so no matter whether your last push-up is your 80th
[00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:01.860]   or your 100th or your 120th or your first
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.360]   or your fifth for that matter,
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:07.980]   think about the struggle when you can't do any more.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.420]   Whatever that is, push harder.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.820]   I often say like SEALs, when we give us a backpack,
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.880]   we'll fill it and then take 10% more
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.940]   than it's supposed to take.
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.660]   So that's a little bit,
[00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:25.140]   fill your life up with 5% more weight than you can carry.
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:27.940]   So whether it's a plank and doing more minutes,
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:29.660]   meditate for 10 minutes.
[00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:34.060]   My mind personally, I find myself thinking 17 things
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.740]   at once, I've got my Headspace app,
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.340]   like we all do, or Calm or whatever these,
[00:27:39.340 --> 00:27:42.900]   and for me to try to create the solace and the focus
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:45.380]   is super hard, super hard.
[00:27:45.380 --> 00:27:48.040]   And so for me, that's my equivalent.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.020]   How do you plank or you meditate or your thing,
[00:27:51.020 --> 00:27:55.140]   pick something and do it beyond exhaustion?
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:27:57.380]   - I like that, I have a Peloton bike
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:00.220]   and the reason why, it's funny, I had this DIY version
[00:28:00.220 --> 00:28:02.980]   of it, which was like build your own bike,
[00:28:02.980 --> 00:28:05.300]   get an iPad, mount it, put some sensors.
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:07.640]   And then I got the real one and the difference
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:09.580]   between the real one and not was very subtle
[00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.140]   and it was just tracking how much you were doing
[00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:15.020]   on the bike in the app.
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:18.180]   And that subtle difference was what made me go and say,
[00:28:18.180 --> 00:28:20.260]   I can do a little bit more the next time.
[00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.100]   And I can't tell you the number of times
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.380]   that because of that one difference in feature
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:27.540]   that unfortunately costs like $1,000,
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:28.700]   I get to the end and I'm like,
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:32.100]   ooh, I'm within spitting distance of what I did last time.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:35.260]   And this is probably oversharing,
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:36.540]   but and then I get to the point that I'm like,
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:39.540]   almost going to throw up to try to beat my last record,
[00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:41.540]   which I'm sure a health expert out there
[00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:43.020]   will say that's maybe not the best thing,
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:45.220]   but I like being in that discomfort.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:47.500]   And that's the only thing in my life
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.700]   that really makes it forceful to do
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:51.940]   is trying to beat a record
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:53.940]   in some sort of physical activity.
[00:28:53.940 --> 00:28:57.060]   - In SEAL training, you heard me a couple of minutes ago,
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.060]   if I haven't lost you already in this,
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:01.500]   120 people start, 19 finish.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:06.020]   What we do in training is we stretch young trainees
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:07.380]   beyond their limit,
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:10.220]   but beyond what they perceive as their limit.
[00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:12.420]   And then we let them get comfortable again.
[00:29:12.420 --> 00:29:14.020]   And then the next day or the next hour,
[00:29:14.020 --> 00:29:16.220]   we stretch them even further
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.100]   and then we get them comfortable again.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.060]   And we keep doing that over and over and over.
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.900]   And it sounds like an exercise in stretching your limits,
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.700]   you know, in learning that the human can do
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.860]   more and more and more.
[00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.380]   That is true,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:32.180]   but it's also not the biggest lesson from that.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:33.540]   The biggest lesson from that
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:35.220]   is when you're repetitively stretched
[00:29:35.220 --> 00:29:37.740]   beyond what you perceive as your limits,
[00:29:37.740 --> 00:29:40.940]   what you realize is that they actually are not your limits.
[00:29:40.940 --> 00:29:44.220]   And so a common trait that SEALs have
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.780]   is this high confidence that I described before,
[00:29:46.780 --> 00:29:51.500]   which is every single SEAL has been in many situations
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.420]   where they think it's going to be beyond a limit
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:55.660]   and you realize it's not.
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.860]   And then what you do is you unlock the brain
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:01.820]   in a way that lets you realize
[00:30:01.820 --> 00:30:03.780]   there is no such thing as a limit in life
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:06.020]   unless you place that limit on yourself.
[00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:07.580]   So we go into situations
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.160]   actually literally unbound in our thinking.
[00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:13.620]   Is there maybe an activity or an exercise
[00:30:13.620 --> 00:30:15.580]   you put SEALs through in that training
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:18.540]   that isn't as crazy, you know,
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.140]   that someone could do at home or test out
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.820]   and try to build that themselves?
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:24.940]   - It's what we described before,
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:26.540]   just pushing yourself beyond the limit.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:28.300]   Sure, there's a lot of crazy things in SEAL training.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:31.360]   You know, you get pushed in the deep end of the pool,
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:35.700]   14 feet deep, and you have your ankles and your wrists tied.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:36.940]   Your wrists are behind the back
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.580]   and you've got to survive for an hour.
[00:30:38.580 --> 00:30:40.260]   And, you know, like there's a lot of stuff
[00:30:40.260 --> 00:30:41.540]   that don't try at home.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:42.780]   But honestly, Chris,
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:45.460]   the great majority of SEAL training is no secret.
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:49.720]   It is like just as simple as a human
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.900]   and his or her body weight
[00:30:51.900 --> 00:30:54.180]   to take yourself beyond that limit.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.380]   And so we all, if you can't manufacture that on your own,
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:30:59.060]   then just get your favorite fitness app
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:01.340]   and whatever it says to do, do it.
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:02.540]   Don't hurt yourself,
[00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.820]   but take it to that point that you're describing.
[00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:07.860]   - You said a lot of situations that, you know,
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.340]   you now go into as a former SEAL,
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.460]   you think there's no limit.
[00:31:11.460 --> 00:31:14.260]   So I think a lot of people in the workplace,
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.900]   and I've put myself in this situation many times,
[00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:20.700]   get in trouble for kind of not following the rules.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:23.660]   But you talk a little bit about how to use your instincts
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.660]   and how to think about rules
[00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.540]   and making kind of a practical sense of that hard choice
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.980]   where there's rules
[00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:31.780]   and you think there might be consequences,
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:32.700]   but you know what's right.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:36.020]   How do you make those decisions and hone those instincts
[00:31:36.020 --> 00:31:38.240]   and feel free to give an example of it?
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.560]   - Look, if the whole world were just rule followers,
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.060]   we'd never advance anything.
[00:31:43.360 --> 00:31:44.940]   We would just all go follow the rules
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:47.580]   and we wouldn't have the innovation
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:52.020]   and the entrepreneurship that the world needs.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:55.180]   That said, we are, as a society,
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:59.100]   we are more productive when we together do harmonize
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.540]   and live with, you know, laws and customs
[00:32:02.540 --> 00:32:04.540]   that help us build each other up
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:06.620]   and help us respect the fact that we're all different.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:09.820]   And so that's a balance that has to happen in the world.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.000]   First of all, what's the intention?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.940]   Is the intention good?
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.780]   And then what's the likely cost or harm of the action,
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.420]   the rule that you're gonna break?
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:23.640]   And then you just think it's really not more complicated
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:26.500]   than a simple cost-benefit analysis.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:29.180]   Do the overall costs, or excuse me,
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.600]   do the overall benefits outweigh the costs?
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:34.420]   If they do, go do the thing.
[00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:37.140]   You know, don't cross any red lines of morals
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.580]   and ethics in the law.
[00:32:38.580 --> 00:32:41.100]   Like, as long as you're on the right side of morals
[00:32:41.100 --> 00:32:44.180]   and ethics in the law, go push, go push.
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:45.220]   Don't be afraid to push.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.660]   Make great things happen.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.860]   That's, it takes energy and momentum in new directions
[00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:50.920]   to try new things.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:54.500]   In so many times, you know, in the world,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.540]   if you look at new markets, like how many of us in 2000
[00:32:57.540 --> 00:32:58.780]   thought we'd need to walk around
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.780]   with one of these smartphones either, you know,
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.760]   pegged to our ear or being, you know,
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:04.580]   stared at 20 hours a day in our hands?
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:06.940]   And, you know, like we couldn't imagine a world
[00:33:06.940 --> 00:33:10.300]   with an ecosystem of the application development
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.100]   that we hold in the power of our hands now.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:14.780]   What's that gonna be in the next five years,
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.100]   10 years, 20 years?
[00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:17.720]   We don't know right now.
[00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:19.580]   But the only way we're gonna figure that out
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:21.580]   is by people continuing to have vision
[00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:23.780]   and then go after the things, you know,
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.820]   pursue the dreams and the visions that they have.
[00:33:26.820 --> 00:33:30.960]   So it takes a combination of smart rule breaking,
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.420]   is the way I would phrase it.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:36.380]   - As a manager, I am really frustrated
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:39.580]   when people just completely ignore what, you know,
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.060]   you ask them to do, but I'm actually not frustrated
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.580]   when they come back and say,
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:45.500]   "Hey, actually, I heard what you said,
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.660]   but this insight led me to think
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:49.460]   that this might be a better path."
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.780]   You know, maybe it's good to flag that
[00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.780]   as early as is possible.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:55.320]   But I do think that what you said,
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:57.780]   I've seen play out in the workplace well,
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.820]   but it's when you don't have that intention behind,
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:03.100]   you know, your deviation from the task
[00:34:03.100 --> 00:34:05.340]   that I think things really fall apart.
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.320]   - I've never met somebody who wakes up and says,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.280]   "I'm gonna go screw something up at work today."
[00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:14.020]   You know, it's really ultimately about that drive
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:17.500]   and that determination to go make positive change.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:19.900]   So I net out the same as you do.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:21.380]   - You've said that asking for help
[00:34:21.380 --> 00:34:24.360]   is actually a sign of strength, not weakness.
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.980]   I think that's, you know,
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:28.040]   a big shift in the military in recent years.
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:30.080]   I know, you know, maybe 20, 30 years ago,
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:33.480]   that wouldn't have been the way people think about it.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.600]   You think that's a good shift?
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.800]   How did that come about?
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:38.160]   And how can we use that in our own lives?
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:41.680]   - Yeah, look, it's a necessary shift.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.280]   I, like every SEAL of my era,
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:44.620]   have buried way too many friends.
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:48.560]   I've got about 70 friends who have, you know,
[00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:50.120]   killed in action or perished
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:53.360]   during the last decades of conflict.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:55.860]   And ultimately, that's why I wrote my book.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:57.460]   I forgot to mention in the beginning, you know,
[00:34:57.460 --> 00:35:00.160]   that I donate every penny from never enough
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.120]   to a 501(c)(3) I started
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.080]   that pays off mortgages for Gold Star families.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:09.600]   And, you know, I think the most important thing
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   to recognize is that when you're doing things for others
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.400]   and you're connecting back to that mission
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:17.940]   and the meaning and the purpose,
[00:35:17.940 --> 00:35:21.000]   then it makes it very, very much easier.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.680]   But you have to start with the outcome-based thinking.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:27.160]   Like you said, the number of times in life I've had,
[00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:28.680]   let me use a military example,
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.000]   at the end of a six-month deployment overseas,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.120]   you know, you get somebody who says,
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:35.800]   "Hey, you know, I wrote 3,000 intelligence reports."
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.520]   And I'm like, that's an output.
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:40.880]   Like, what did those intelligence reports do?
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.360]   What did they lead to?
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.620]   Or, you know, you get your logistics teams that say,
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:49.360]   "Hey, we, you know, spent $1.1 million on this thing."
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.400]   And like, okay, great,
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.460]   but what did we get for that $1.1 million?
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:58.020]   The number of missions that you go on are irrelevant.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.600]   What's relevant is what are the outcomes
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:01.440]   from those missions.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.600]   And so, Chris, I think that what we need to think about
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.920]   in life, and this is what I think about in business,
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.960]   is, you know, we have a certain amount of investment dollars
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:11.320]   that we can make choices with
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:13.360]   on how we spend them within our firm.
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:16.160]   Do we, you know, where do we invest
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.080]   and where do we work to take the business?
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.960]   And do we invest in new capability?
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   Do we try to open new markets?
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:23.920]   You know, what do we do?
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.360]   How do we think about that?
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.720]   You have to think about what's the outcome that you're after
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:30.200]   and then what's the efficiency,
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.920]   the most efficient way to go achieve the outcome.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:37.200]   So you have to look at like a return on invested capital
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:39.760]   or an IRR, internal rate of return type of,
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.160]   not to sound too mathy,
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:43.760]   but like if I take, if I have a dollar
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:47.320]   and I can turn it into a $1.10,
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:50.120]   we're doing one thing and a $1.11 doing another thing,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.680]   then, you know, go do the thing
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:53.520]   that's gonna make you a $1.11, you know?
[00:36:53.520 --> 00:36:56.800]   And so how, what, but did you think about the path
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:58.880]   of least resistance there?
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:00.560]   I want the person that didn't write
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.280]   3,000 intelligence reports,
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.000]   I want the person that wrote one
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   and that one intelligence report
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.920]   led to the biggest success ever.
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:11.160]   I'd much rather have, I joke around,
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:13.640]   the L in SEAL stands for lazy.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:16.480]   You know, we find the easiest path to the goal
[00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:19.640]   because then after that, we have more time,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.840]   more effort and energy so we can go
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:24.440]   either do more missions or rest more for the next mission
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.840]   and whatever's around the corner.
[00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:27.800]   But in all cases, we're always better off
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:29.960]   being as efficient as we humanly can
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:32.920]   and that's why bringing it back to the business world,
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.400]   you know, when we're in a meeting,
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:35.640]   the first thing that I do is say,
[00:37:35.640 --> 00:37:38.280]   what do we want out of this meeting?
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:39.880]   We're only doing one of a couple
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:42.040]   of elemental verbs in a meeting.
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.920]   We're either deciding something,
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:45.640]   we're teaching about something,
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.200]   we're informing and giving people information
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:50.240]   or we're brainstorming a problem
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:51.520]   and trying to think about,
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:54.740]   creatively come up with a set of solutions.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.880]   Maybe there's another verb or two,
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.040]   but those four verbs are basically
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.560]   the reason to have a meeting.
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:01.080]   If you are not doing that,
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:03.040]   then what are you doing and why?
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.180]   If we're just hearing people talk to hear people talk,
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.000]   we are wasting the company's resources
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.600]   because we can be letting people go do work
[00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:12.680]   on different things.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.880]   So at the end of the meeting,
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:16.480]   the acid test for me, Chris,
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:20.560]   is to ask who is going to go do what differently
[00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:21.840]   after the meeting?
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.080]   If we leave a meeting and nobody can answer that question,
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:26.120]   we didn't just need to have that meeting.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.320]   - It's funny, I look back at all the episodes I've done,
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:30.400]   I have a lot of personal beliefs about meetings
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:34.920]   and David Marquet is another former submarine commander
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.960]   who wrote a book, we talked about meetings
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:39.040]   and now I think my answer is,
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.800]   if you're running a meeting in your company,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:42.600]   the best thing you can do is find anyone
[00:38:42.600 --> 00:38:43.440]   that's been in the military
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.560]   and have them run the meeting
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:47.920]   because I feel like the best meeting advice I've gotten
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.960]   is from people in the military.
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.360]   So I think that's great advice.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.920]   We really waste a lot of times with meetings.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.040]   - Can I say Nick, one more point on this,
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.280]   which is a culture point, Chris,
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.160]   which is if we're running a meeting,
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.560]   say you and I are in a meeting with 10 other people
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:05.560]   and somebody starts talking and creating an avenue
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:07.320]   in the meeting that is not productive
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.920]   to the main goal of the meeting, what do you do?
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.720]   Do you cut the person off or do you let them keep going?
[00:39:12.720 --> 00:39:15.160]   The polite thing, the easy thing is let them keep going
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:17.800]   and be like, okay, they'll be done in four minutes.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:19.480]   You know, it'll be done in six minutes.
[00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.800]   Six minutes is 10% of a 60 minute meeting.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:23.920]   Like, do you want to lose 10% of a meeting
[00:39:23.920 --> 00:39:25.480]   letting somebody ramble?
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.760]   No, like you want to cut that person off politely,
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:30.200]   of course, but then like, how do,
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:34.240]   that takes a certain culture where that's okay.
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:36.000]   - Do you have an example of how you would cut someone off
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:36.840]   politely in a meeting?
[00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:39.400]   I think anyone listening might have that question.
[00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:43.760]   - Well, yeah, when somebody gets the real answer,
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.600]   let me know.
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:46.540]   I've been trying to politely cut people off for years
[00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:50.440]   and often people, you know, there's no way around it.
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:54.680]   People are gonna feel slightly over-corrected
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:55.560]   when you do that.
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.760]   But I think, you know, look, it's just,
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:39:59.840]   it's just tackle everything head on.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:03.800]   You know, you talked a minute ago about, you know,
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   what in essence is passive aggressive versus direct.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.920]   You know, there's no room for passive aggressivity.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:13.560]   You know, just say what you're thinking and help people,
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:15.620]   but do it in a respectful way.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:18.040]   Like I talked in Washington, D.C.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.440]   when we were doing the START Treaty,
[00:40:19.440 --> 00:40:22.120]   you get all these people who, after the meeting,
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.880]   start wanting to grab another person
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:25.640]   and do the whisperer campaign.
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.200]   And oh, what about this, what about that?
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:28.640]   No, if we have something to say,
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.020]   let's do it at the table and out in the open,
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:32.760]   because it's just way more efficient.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.000]   It's way more productive.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.940]   So I think it takes a little bit of practice.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.200]   It's making people feel safe.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:41.480]   It's making people feel like if we do cut them off,
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.800]   they know it's because we're trying to be the best group
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:45.900]   that we can be and have the best meeting we can.
[00:40:45.900 --> 00:40:47.500]   And I think just like, you know,
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:50.140]   my mom's a psychologist, social worker,
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.140]   and use the famous sandwich technique,
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:55.860]   you know, compliment, cut off,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:58.020]   and then compliment or something, I don't know.
[00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:00.180]   I wish I had the answer to your question, Chris.
[00:41:00.180 --> 00:41:01.900]   You could treat my rambling as the fact
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:03.860]   that I have no idea how to do it.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:05.780]   - The best answer I have is from Andy Ratcliffe,
[00:41:05.780 --> 00:41:06.900]   who I've had on the podcast,
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:09.620]   and he's run the company I work at now,
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:11.660]   because I got into a lot of these situations myself,
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:13.140]   and people would say, "Ah, Chris is like
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:14.860]   "trying to derail this thing,"
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.620]   or, you know, "It's kind of frustrating."
[00:41:16.620 --> 00:41:18.240]   And his advice to me was,
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.700]   "You need to make sure you state your intentions more."
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:22.780]   So instead of interrupting someone and saying,
[00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:24.980]   "Hey, you're going on a little long.
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.140]   "We got a purpose here.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.500]   "Let's move on."
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:31.100]   You say, "Hey, I just want to interrupt quick.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.960]   "I really want to make sure that this meeting
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:35.120]   "can be the most productive use of everyone's time.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.140]   "We came here for this reason,
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:39.740]   "and so maybe we should get back on topic."
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:41.140]   For me, it's shown up a lot where I say,
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:44.100]   "Look, I really want to see us go big."
[00:41:44.100 --> 00:41:46.280]   So when I criticize this thing,
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.920]   it's not because I think it's bad.
[00:41:47.920 --> 00:41:49.060]   It's 'cause I think we can do better.
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:52.340]   So I didn't do that for a lot of time in my role
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:55.980]   in a few jobs, and it caused a lot of friction with people,
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.500]   because they thought, "Oh, he just doesn't care.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.080]   "He's just on his own mission.
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:01.460]   "He has his own accord."
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:04.000]   And the reality was I needed to make sure people knew
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:05.820]   that I'm only here to build the best thing we can
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.660]   at this company.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:07.900]   That's all I care about.
[00:42:07.900 --> 00:42:11.700]   And stating that puts everything else you say in context
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:16.060]   and saves a lot of back-channel criticism of you.
[00:42:16.060 --> 00:42:17.740]   - One of my classmates from grad school
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:20.300]   is now a leadership professor at Harvard Business School.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:25.180]   I go back and guest in his class every year,
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.580]   have for the last six or seven years
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.620]   for there's a specific case that I help with.
[00:42:28.620 --> 00:42:29.580]   And it's a ton of fun.
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:31.220]   I see one of my best friends on the planet
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.460]   be an incredible professor and see him in action,
[00:42:33.460 --> 00:42:34.820]   and it's just really special.
[00:42:34.820 --> 00:42:37.500]   But there was one year where this, I don't know,
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:40.580]   I'll say grad school student was sitting
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:43.100]   in the back of the room and asked the proverbial
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:45.180]   three-minute windup of a question.
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:46.460]   You all know the type.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.940]   It's the, "I wanna tell you how smart I am,
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:51.480]   "but really kind of pretend it's a question."
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.480]   And so the tail end of it was some thinly veiled question.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:59.000]   And I said, "Rather than me answering that,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.260]   "let me take this a different direction."
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.340]   He said, "Honestly, I experienced you
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:05.660]   "as a very bad question asker.
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:10.580]   "And so let me tell you why."
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:13.540]   Here's where I, it wasn't succinct enough.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:15.560]   It wasn't, you know, XYZ gave constructive feedback.
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.260]   And I said, "Look, right now you're probably
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.100]   "not feeling great.
[00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.020]   "You're probably shrinking in your chair a little bit,
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:21.300]   "or you're frustrated with me,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.000]   "or some combination of negative emotions.
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.820]   "But let me ask you this.
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.100]   "Would you rather me share this feedback with you
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:32.400]   "and then let you have you ask yourself like,
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.780]   "Hey, maybe there's something in there
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.040]   "where I can learn and grow from,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.940]   "or would you rather have me not say what I just said
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.220]   "and let you keep going through life
[00:43:39.220 --> 00:43:41.320]   "as a terrible question asker?"
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:44.940]   Like theoretically, it's really easy to understand.
[00:43:44.940 --> 00:43:46.480]   No, I wanna be a great question asker.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:48.140]   Okay, great, but how do you feel right now?
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:51.980]   And so you have to get over that negative feeling
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:55.140]   when somebody is trying to help build you up.
[00:43:55.140 --> 00:43:56.900]   Now, you could argue that it's maybe publicly
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.660]   in 110 person classroom or whatever
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:43:59.620]   is not the place to do that.
[00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:02.300]   But I was making a point for a reason.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:04.100]   I was trying to make a metaphorical point
[00:44:04.100 --> 00:44:06.040]   to 110 students in the classroom is,
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:10.480]   go through life presuming positive intent from others.
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:12.480]   But when something goes sideways,
[00:44:12.480 --> 00:44:16.280]   like no matter if you're one or 99% wrong or 100% wrong,
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:17.500]   start with yourself and say,
[00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:18.800]   "What could I have done better?"
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.360]   And then you won't miss that opportunity
[00:44:20.360 --> 00:44:22.200]   for growth in the principle of excellence,
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:24.680]   which we talked about at the beginning.
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:26.520]   - Yeah, I mean, you could have followed up with said,
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.220]   "And I could have said this to you privately,
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:29.080]   "you could have learned well,
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:31.200]   "but aren't you glad that 109 other people
[00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:32.040]   "get to also learn that?"
[00:44:32.040 --> 00:44:33.980]   - Oh, dude, I wish I would have thought that at the moment.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:37.420]   You're a better professor and guest professor than me.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:39.000]   - No, no.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:41.600]   - This is a great opportunity to use your own feedback.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.860]   Earlier, I asked a question about asking for help.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:45.460]   We took a little bit of a detour.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.240]   So you gotta work a little bit, Mike,
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.160]   on your skills listening to the question being asked.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.000]   - I love it.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:53.620]   - But I wanna come back to it.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:56.400]   I was trying to get at whether asking for help
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.000]   is a sign of strength or weakness.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:00.880]   It seems like something that shifted in the military.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:02.640]   Can you talk about your perspective
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.120]   and why asking for help
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:05.640]   might be something we should do more of?
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:08.760]   - Yeah, first of all, your feedback is spot on.
[00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:11.120]   You're absolutely correct.
[00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:13.660]   And I already was like, "Gosh, how did I miss answering that?
[00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.680]   "You totally asked it and I didn't answer it."
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.320]   My brain was in a million different spots
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:20.640]   and I simply wasn't good enough to remember what you said
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:22.040]   and answer your question directly.
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:24.200]   So that's my response.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:27.900]   Now, hopefully in there, people can hear the modeling
[00:45:27.900 --> 00:45:30.680]   for the giving and receiving and feedback
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:31.640]   back and forth.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:33.080]   There's a meta point in there.
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:37.080]   But to answer directly now, it is a very serious topic.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:38.960]   I grew up in the SEALs in an era
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.560]   where you only showed strength or perceived strength.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:44.360]   You did not show weakness.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:46.540]   And that is not healthy.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:51.840]   After the stress of decades plus of combat,
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:57.440]   I've buried about 70 different friends over time
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:01.840]   and everybody who's served knows somebody
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.280]   who has paid the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:09.280]   So the question right now is when somebody needs something,
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:14.960]   how do you make them feel when they ask?
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.300]   Do you make them feel taller or smaller?
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:19.780]   We have to build up people who ask for help.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:21.520]   If you just look at the number of people now
[00:46:21.520 --> 00:46:23.480]   who have died by suicide,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:25.440]   I had a really good friend who I looked up to
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:28.200]   who was a BUD/S instructor, a SEAL instructor of mine,
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:31.680]   who was an incredible human being.
[00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.240]   I deployed with him to Iraq.
[00:46:33.240 --> 00:46:35.400]   We did a bunch of missions together.
[00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:36.560]   He took his own life.
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.120]   And it really hit me hard on the weekend.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.680]   I don't know the details.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:44.380]   He's a friend who I haven't talked to in a couple of years.
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:48.120]   And unfortunately, stories like this are way too common.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:50.280]   And I beat myself up over the weekend and saying,
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:52.200]   gosh, I haven't reached out to him lately.
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:53.040]   What was that?
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.200]   Did I come up short?
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.720]   And I just felt I had a tough weekend.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:58.640]   I'll just say that.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:01.560]   Why was my friend not able to ask for help?
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.060]   I don't know the answer to that question.
[00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:04.760]   I really don't.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.960]   But I also will say the flip of this is,
[00:47:07.960 --> 00:47:11.840]   the flip side of this is that
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.340]   to let asking the hard questions be okay.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:20.280]   I'm gonna ask the hard intrusive questions from now on.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   I've said this 'cause I've learned from people
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.920]   that I haven't helped well enough.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   And now I go through life pretty comfortable saying,
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:32.040]   hey, have you ever considered harm to self
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:34.360]   or how are you really doing?
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:36.120]   And most Americans or people when they say,
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:36.960]   how are you doing?
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.260]   We don't really want the answer.
[00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:39.580]   That's just a little quick little,
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:40.420]   hey, how's it going?
[00:47:40.420 --> 00:47:41.240]   How are you doing?
[00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.080]   Okay, great.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:42.920]   You're good?
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.740]   Okay, good.
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:44.580]   No, no, no.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.740]   When we're really intrusive in people's lives,
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.480]   we are actually listening to what we can do
[00:47:50.480 --> 00:47:53.320]   to make sure that their life is as good as it can be.
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:57.160]   And so we have to celebrate being intrusive
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.440]   in people's lives as positive.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:03.920]   So asking for help on one side is a positive thing.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.640]   And being intrusive in people's lives is positive.
[00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.120]   99 times out of 100, when I say to a friend of mine,
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.880]   have you ever considered harm to self?
[00:48:10.880 --> 00:48:12.500]   It can be awkward.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.720]   It's like, no, man, what are you asking me that for?
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:17.040]   And defensive or whatever.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:20.800]   But for the one time out of 100, when the person says yes,
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:24.760]   I'll take the 99 awkwards for the one yes,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:26.640]   because that is a way to make sure
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.640]   that you get people the help that they need.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.120]   It has to be okay to ask for help.
[00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:31.240]   I'm droning on and trying to,
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   because I'm emphasizing the fact that the culture
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.880]   really had to change and it has changed,
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.560]   but it's still not where it needs to be,
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.880]   not just in the SEALs, but in the military writ large
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:42.340]   and in society writ large.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.160]   Life is hard in this pandemic.
[00:48:44.160 --> 00:48:47.440]   How do we make sure that people are as strong as they can?
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:50.360]   One more thing I'll say on this is that a trick
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:55.000]   that I've learned in this is to not think about absolutes.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:56.560]   Think about relative.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:59.280]   In a team, and when I say team, I mean,
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.080]   that's a team is family, it's your neighbors,
[00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:02.360]   it's your friends, it's your colleagues,
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:05.580]   it's people in your civic organizations.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:09.660]   In a team, there are people who are always relatively up
[00:49:09.660 --> 00:49:11.480]   and relatively down.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:13.400]   So the people who are relatively up
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.920]   have to help the people who are relatively down.
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:18.760]   Because tomorrow, the roles will be reversed.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:21.080]   And so if the people who are always relatively up
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.160]   are helping the people who are relatively down,
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:27.580]   that's how you make a team as strong as you humanly can.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.880]   - I'm really sorry for your loss,
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:32.520]   and I appreciate you being open and sharing like that
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:33.420]   on the show.
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.880]   What's a way to ask those questions at work?
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.760]   I think to find out where people are down
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.400]   and try to help build them up,
[00:49:41.400 --> 00:49:43.880]   are there questions you ask
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:45.080]   or things you bring to a meeting
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:47.360]   to try to kind of level the playing field?
[00:49:47.360 --> 00:49:49.080]   Levels, maybe the playing field is the wrong word,
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:51.640]   but you try to bring people together towards that medium
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:54.640]   if you're having a day where you're on the top.
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:49:56.520]   - It's creating comfort, you're absolutely.
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.800]   And so this is a situation
[00:49:57.800 --> 00:49:59.980]   where it's not in the 110 person classroom
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:01.120]   or conference room.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:03.340]   This is truly a one-on-one conversation.
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.000]   And so, look, I'm in an organization of 40,000 people now.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.080]   I help run, I run global operations for VMware,
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:15.080]   a massively awesome software company based in Palo Alto.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:19.160]   And look, I can't help 40,000 people, right?
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:23.760]   And so how do I help as many people as I can?
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.840]   Well, it's simple.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:27.760]   How do I take my seven or eight direct reports
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:30.880]   and do that with those seven and eight people
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.680]   and then help make sure that they're doing it
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:34.520]   with their seven or eight direct reports
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.080]   and then that it cascades through an organization.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:41.720]   So leadership has to model the behaviors that we want.
[00:50:41.720 --> 00:50:43.280]   Now, it doesn't have to be prescriptive.
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.960]   You don't always have to do everything my way.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:47.080]   That'll be unhealthy for an organization,
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.580]   but the goal, go achieve that goal,
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:51.200]   however it makes the most sense,
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.200]   but really understand what is making someone
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:56.960]   either motivated or demotivated
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:01.240]   and help them have more of the good and less of the bad.
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:03.280]   - One tactic I know you mentioned in the book
[00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:07.000]   was going to meet just one-on-one people,
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:08.640]   trying to have a conversation with people
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.880]   you don't know at work.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.020]   Can you talk a little bit about why you started doing that
[00:51:12.020 --> 00:51:14.620]   and what it's brought to organizations
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:15.680]   you've been a part of?
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.440]   - Specifically when I was in the White House,
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:20.440]   we worked two administrations,
[00:51:20.440 --> 00:51:22.980]   both administrations, Bush and Obama.
[00:51:22.980 --> 00:51:24.720]   People work super hard in the White House.
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:27.600]   We can always make fun of whatever party's in
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:28.960]   or out of favor or whatever.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.760]   Look, there's a lot of really great public servants
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.520]   who are working long, long days
[00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:35.120]   to try to make this great nation greater.
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:37.160]   What I have found is that it's hard to slow down
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:40.400]   when you're in those very visible roles.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:43.720]   And I made a point to just go get a lunch
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:46.840]   with somebody three times a week.
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.540]   And look, it's a costly hour in the middle of the day.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:51.380]   You're like, oh, I could be,
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.800]   and inevitably, Chris,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.400]   when I had to peel myself away from my desk
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:59.640]   and I have a million things that are needing to be done,
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:01.840]   I'd be scratching my head saying,
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:03.480]   gosh, what do I need to be,
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:05.480]   why did I just do this?
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.380]   Honestly, 15 minutes into that lunch,
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:11.640]   I was not thinking about all the things I needed to do.
[00:52:11.640 --> 00:52:13.280]   I was locked in with somebody else.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.220]   And usually from either another part of the White House
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:20.440]   or an organization that had something to do loosely
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:24.440]   with whatever professional goals
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.720]   that I and we were trying to achieve.
[00:52:27.720 --> 00:52:29.320]   And what you realize is at the end of the day,
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.800]   when you go home at 10 o'clock,
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:32.360]   you're not remembering that hour
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:35.980]   that you didn't spend at your desk in the middle of the day.
[00:52:35.980 --> 00:52:38.680]   But what you do remember is the relationship
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:39.840]   and the person and what you learned
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.680]   from the hour in that lunch.
[00:52:41.680 --> 00:52:44.480]   And then, not ironically,
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.920]   over time, you develop an ecosystem of people
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:52.720]   that you can call on and help make great things happen.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:55.560]   So a lot of times people ask me
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.800]   how to think about networking.
[00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:01.400]   My advice is that a network is not a group of people
[00:53:01.400 --> 00:53:02.920]   who you get something from.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:06.680]   A network is a group of people who you give something to.
[00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:08.880]   Then in the few times in life
[00:53:08.880 --> 00:53:11.800]   when we really do critically need help,
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.080]   that group of people that we've invested in,
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:17.400]   not surprisingly, is the group where we get energy back from
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.960]   and we get help back from.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:21.240]   So a network is a group of people we invest in.
[00:53:21.240 --> 00:53:23.240]   And so by investing in other people
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.880]   and understanding what is this colleague
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:26.340]   in the other wing of the White House
[00:53:26.340 --> 00:53:29.440]   or the other part of my company organization structure
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:30.940]   trying to achieve,
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:32.920]   well, I might be able to connect dots
[00:53:32.920 --> 00:53:36.720]   that that person may not be able to connect him or herself.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.760]   And so if I can create value for somebody else
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:41.120]   in very easy ways by connecting dots,
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   then you're making your organization
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.720]   and then, frankly, the nation,
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:50.000]   if you extract it out, a lot stronger.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:50.920]   - I love that lesson.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:52.480]   I've used it a lot.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:55.080]   In a virtual world, I think it's been harder,
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:59.060]   but one tactic I'll share is that it can be so hard
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:00.340]   when you're on your computer working
[00:54:00.340 --> 00:54:02.620]   and then you have a meeting and you mentioned,
[00:54:02.620 --> 00:54:04.780]   gosh, in the moment, I just have all this stuff to do.
[00:54:04.780 --> 00:54:06.040]   I have to step away.
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:07.800]   Well, when you're doing a video call,
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:10.180]   sometimes it's really hard to not to step away, right?
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:11.580]   You've got your other tab open.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:14.700]   And so what I try to do myself
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:18.480]   is I try to force myself to put the meeting in full screen
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:21.060]   and slide back from my desk a little bit.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:24.580]   So the keyboard's not quite in reach and I'm not distracted.
[00:54:24.580 --> 00:54:26.580]   I try to treat it more like that.
[00:54:26.580 --> 00:54:28.260]   It's difficult.
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:31.120]   I've actually started pushing away the virtual meeting
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:32.660]   and just saying, can we just do a phone call
[00:54:32.660 --> 00:54:33.500]   and go on a walk?
[00:54:33.500 --> 00:54:36.500]   Because when I'm walking, I'm not distracted by work
[00:54:36.500 --> 00:54:38.500]   and I'm more engaged in the conversation.
[00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:41.460]   And it seems counterintuitive to me to think,
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:44.140]   wow, if I don't see you, I might be more engaged.
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:47.220]   But when I see you, I see the alert popping up on my email.
[00:54:47.220 --> 00:54:50.220]   I see the chat popping up on Slack or something.
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:52.600]   And so I've been struggling
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:54.660]   with the lack of in-person meetings.
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.940]   And I do genuinely believe those in-person meetings
[00:54:56.940 --> 00:54:59.820]   can be more valuable than their virtual counterparts.
[00:54:59.820 --> 00:55:01.500]   But I think there are a few tactics you can use
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:03.980]   to try to make those virtual conversations better.
[00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:04.900]   - I still agree.
[00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:07.780]   And I'm not good enough at it myself.
[00:55:07.780 --> 00:55:09.140]   I get distracted too easily.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:11.340]   There were two tricks that somebody told me.
[00:55:11.340 --> 00:55:12.780]   And I did a little bit of live TV.
[00:55:12.780 --> 00:55:15.780]   I was on a bunch of different channels
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:18.220]   when my book first came out about a year ago.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:20.740]   And I just took a little yellow sticky
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:24.800]   and I drew an arrow to like right where I needed to look
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.240]   for where the pinhole is on your camera,
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:28.800]   whatever camera you use.
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:31.380]   And so that your eye then goes better,
[00:55:31.380 --> 00:55:32.980]   like right into the camera.
[00:55:32.980 --> 00:55:35.560]   And that way you're not like checking your stock prices
[00:55:35.560 --> 00:55:38.280]   or Instagram or whatever the case may be.
[00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.400]   And then Chris, I've never said this to anybody,
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.880]   but I've got this little sticky that says,
[00:55:41.880 --> 00:55:43.200]   be present in the meeting.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.160]   And I stick this right on my desk here.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.720]   So as I sometimes start to like reach for something else,
[00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.920]   I'm like, no, wait a minute, lock in, lock in.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:51.460]   Because we're recording a conversation
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.580]   where I feel like presence is the most important thing.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:54.640]   If I were writing my email,
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:57.200]   this would be a terrible interview, I assume.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:59.720]   I actually invested and it wasn't that expensive.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:04.100]   It was maybe a hundred dollars in a teleprompter,
[00:56:04.100 --> 00:56:08.060]   which is, you know, and I have an iPad that sits under it.
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:09.740]   So I joined this meeting from an iPad
[00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:12.200]   that projects your face onto a mirrored screen
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.660]   with the camera behind it.
[00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:16.760]   So I'm not actually looking at my computer right now.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:19.400]   I'm looking at a piece of glass in front of a camera
[00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:23.720]   and you know, it's allowed me to really be looking at you,
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.000]   having a conversation, feel like it's working,
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.240]   not feel like the, okay, do I look at the camera?
[00:56:28.240 --> 00:56:29.600]   Do I look at Mike's face?
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:31.520]   And you know, it got stressful.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:33.200]   And so that hundred dollar purchase
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:35.640]   has made the presence I have in these conversations
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:38.040]   a lot better and it might seem like overkill,
[00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:42.680]   but you know, if delivering meetings is part of your job,
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:43.500]   things like that,
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.600]   things like even just buying a decent microphone.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:48.840]   I noticed a side effect of this podcast
[00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:50.080]   was when I went to work meetings
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:52.000]   with the podcast microphone,
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.980]   people are like, wow, you sound so crisp.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:57.540]   Like it really feels like two people in my core team
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:59.540]   went and bought a microphone after that
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:01.880]   because they were like, look, I wanna sound present.
[00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:03.560]   I wanna be more, be there.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.080]   I don't wanna sound like I'm distracted,
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:07.340]   dishes clinking in the background or whatever.
[00:57:07.340 --> 00:57:09.760]   So there are a few tactics you can use there as well.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.600]   So hopefully this is all helpful,
[00:57:11.600 --> 00:57:14.760]   but you know, I hope we get more opportunities,
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:16.480]   you know, to spend time in person.
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:19.480]   And I already at my company see them happening right now.
[00:57:19.480 --> 00:57:20.560]   - Well, Chris, I take the opposite.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:21.960]   I'm a lot smarter when I'm on mute
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.920]   and I look better when the video's off.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.040]   - I wanna jump to something
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:29.640]   that we touched on a little before,
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:32.520]   but you've been in a lot of situations
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:33.640]   and you talk about them in your book
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:36.720]   where you're at life or death, shoot or don't shoot.
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.640]   And I wanna come back to that before we wrap
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.800]   and just talk about how some of those
[00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:44.840]   really high stakes decisions you've been in,
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.800]   where you had to make a decision in a moment
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.240]   can be a lesson for people listening.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:51.800]   - Okay, great, another spoiler alert,
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.120]   but there's enough good stuff in the book
[00:57:53.120 --> 00:57:55.640]   where nothing I've said should dissuade you
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.120]   from picking up "Never Enough."
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:58:00.360]   The way I open "Never Enough" is actually a situation
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:02.660]   in 2007 on the streets of Iraq.
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:07.340]   And there was a sealed platoon that was clearing houses
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.720]   and the job is very simple.
[00:58:09.720 --> 00:58:10.920]   How do you stop bad people
[00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:12.800]   from doing bad things to good people?
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:14.280]   Well, this particular night myself
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:16.440]   and a teammate of mine named Josh
[00:58:16.440 --> 00:58:19.480]   were actually holding security outside the building.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.680]   And a man at two in the morning,
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:26.240]   stepped out of his house on the other side of the street.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.360]   And he very quickly started to reach into his garb.
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:34.240]   And it looked like he was potentially pulling a weapon out.
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:39.240]   Now, Josh and I both were instantly aimed at the guy
[00:58:39.240 --> 00:58:42.560]   because we were like, we're not gonna let him shoot at us,
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.520]   but we were both so highly trained
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:46.040]   that we were able to wait for it
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.160]   and pause and let life slow down.
[00:58:48.160 --> 00:58:50.600]   And actually what he did was he pulled out an ID card
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:53.280]   to show that he was not a bad person.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.640]   And that could have been a deadly decision
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:58:58.800]   to reach for quickly for an ID card.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:02.400]   But fortunately, Josh and I were trained well enough
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.760]   where we could slow down and have that confidence
[00:59:04.760 --> 00:59:07.840]   where we could wait another couple milliseconds
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.780]   to see what does this guy actually pull out of his garb.
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:13.640]   And thank God we did, because Chris,
[00:59:13.640 --> 00:59:16.280]   we don't wanna harm anybody that we don't have to harm.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:17.680]   Like that's terrible.
[00:59:17.680 --> 00:59:20.960]   And so that's a very proud day.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:24.840]   The story, seals that didn't kill someone,
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.040]   that's a celebration for us.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:30.000]   And so we're trying to make the world a better place
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.160]   and that's the mission of the community really.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:36.120]   And so how does that happen?
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.320]   Again, we talked earlier in this conversation about training
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.500]   and about how do you get the world to slow down.
[00:59:42.500 --> 00:59:44.980]   But in these life and death situations,
[00:59:44.980 --> 00:59:49.980]   it really is about remaining extremely calm
[00:59:49.980 --> 00:59:55.380]   and not letting the distracting thoughts get in your head.
[00:59:55.380 --> 00:59:57.940]   Fear or any other negative emotions
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.580]   will only reduce the probability of a great outcome,
[01:00:02.580 --> 01:00:05.180]   the best possible outcome for you and your team
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:07.460]   and or your team or your organizations.
[01:00:07.460 --> 01:00:10.360]   And so that's, it's a hard thing to do,
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:12.080]   but you can get better and better at it.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:15.040]   Ideally in training situations where it's safe,
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.520]   but then on game day, when you really need to perform
[01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.120]   or in this particular two in the morning
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:22.520]   in the streets of Fallujah in 2007,
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:25.560]   then you can perform when you have to.
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.120]   - I'm curious how you see the principles
[01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:30.520]   from Never Enough changing in a person's life
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.360]   and do some of them become more or less important
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:34.720]   at different stages?
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.000]   - The most important thing is that principle
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.640]   around agility is exactly what you're describing.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:43.860]   Everybody's heard the kind of the battlefield comment
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:47.180]   where no plan survives first contact with the enemy.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.280]   Well, I'll tell you in my mind,
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.820]   my plan is already for the plan to change.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.700]   So I don't even, like when you go into a situation
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.980]   knowing that it's gonna be dynamic,
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:01.580]   you're already a step ahead.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.580]   So in my real job now,
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:12.260]   at VMware, my job is to not help transform VMware
[01:01:12.260 --> 01:01:13.900]   and our customers.
[01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:17.320]   My job is to transform our ability to transform.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:21.580]   If we can, that's building that ultra agility
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.500]   into the organization
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.080]   because none of us know where markets are going.
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:26.420]   Nobody can foresee the future.
[01:01:26.420 --> 01:01:28.540]   We can make smart guesses,
[01:01:28.540 --> 01:01:31.360]   but how do we improve our ability to react quickly
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:33.460]   and as well as possible?
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:36.120]   So I think that what I've written in Never Enough
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:39.020]   is an elastic set of principles
[01:01:39.020 --> 01:01:41.160]   that can apply not just today,
[01:01:41.160 --> 01:01:43.860]   but set you up for the unforeseen tomorrow.
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:45.840]   - Now, I'm very thankful you wrote the book
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.340]   because it's actually the kind of book
[01:01:48.340 --> 01:01:50.620]   where I've both read and referenced
[01:01:50.620 --> 01:01:52.860]   and taken some notes in.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:55.100]   But I actually heard you say in an interview
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:59.060]   that earlier you wanted to not be Googleable.
[01:01:59.060 --> 01:02:00.620]   You didn't wanna be found
[01:02:00.620 --> 01:02:03.180]   and that writing it was out of your comfort zone.
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:06.200]   What changed for you to,
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:08.160]   and I thank you for making the change,
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:09.480]   but what happened and how did you make
[01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:12.280]   that kind of large change to start writing this book?
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:13.720]   - Great, man, you're the first person
[01:02:13.720 --> 01:02:16.000]   to ask that question that way.
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.400]   First of all, what you said is right on.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.440]   I will emphasize, I tried to stay off of,
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:24.560]   like you said, not Googleable forever.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.440]   And it was a real different moment for me.
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:29.240]   I'm probably like one of the last comers
[01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:30.840]   to social media, if you will.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.760]   I've been on Instagram.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.900]   I got on Instagram because of the book.
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:36.700]   And I said to myself, if I'm gonna write a book,
[01:02:36.700 --> 01:02:38.300]   I want it to be successful.
[01:02:38.300 --> 01:02:39.380]   And what is success?
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.540]   It's not about me.
[01:02:40.540 --> 01:02:41.980]   Never Enough isn't about my case.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.940]   I could care less about that.
[01:02:43.940 --> 01:02:47.740]   What I care about is elevating the conversation for people.
[01:02:47.740 --> 01:02:51.660]   And then literally, the book, the profits,
[01:02:51.660 --> 01:02:53.780]   go to the 501(c)(3) that pay off mortgages
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:54.660]   for gold star families.
[01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:56.780]   I've personally, with my foundation,
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:00.260]   paid off six mortgages for widows and children
[01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:04.040]   whose fathers paid the ultimate sacrifice.
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.840]   And for me, that's what it's about.
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:07.200]   I can't sit still, Chris.
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:09.360]   I'm never able to rest.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:12.520]   And so for me, that mission to go continue
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:16.360]   to do great things for others is predicated on,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.600]   frankly, even doing this podcast.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.740]   I love talking to you, but at the same time,
[01:03:22.740 --> 01:03:24.160]   in the spirit of what we said earlier,
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:26.020]   asking for help is a sign of strength.
[01:03:26.020 --> 01:03:28.080]   It isn't easy for me to go out there and say,
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:30.480]   hey, will everybody listening please jump on Amazon
[01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.840]   or wherever you get buy books, go buy Never Enough.
[01:03:32.840 --> 01:03:35.120]   It's all of about 15 bucks or it's on Audible
[01:03:35.120 --> 01:03:35.960]   and I read the book.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:39.520]   And asking for that kind of help is really hard for me,
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.180]   but I've gotten used to it and out of my comfort zone.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:45.280]   The way I personally am able to square the circle there
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:47.120]   is because I'm not doing it for me.
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:50.000]   I'm doing it to try to make a positive impact for others.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.480]   I've been asked for life advice so many different times
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.000]   that I just don't have the capacity to do it for everybody.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:59.760]   Now I can hand them my best effort at a really good set
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:03.080]   of combination of stories and advice and insights.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:05.280]   - And if you're listening,
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.040]   you're actually helping people buying this book.
[01:04:07.040 --> 01:04:09.080]   Mike's not making a profit here.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.040]   So I thought it was fantastic.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:12.560]   I can highly recommend it.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:15.840]   My wife borrowed it over the holiday a little bit ago
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:16.760]   and she enjoyed it.
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:18.840]   So definitely check out the book.
[01:04:18.840 --> 01:04:20.340]   I have one other random question,
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:22.560]   which didn't fall into the narrative of the book,
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:25.320]   but you talk a lot about how,
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:27.640]   when you're a SEAL, you don't sleep a lot sometimes.
[01:04:27.640 --> 01:04:29.840]   You might stay up for five days straight.
[01:04:29.840 --> 01:04:31.360]   Is that a skill you've retained?
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:34.440]   Is that something that through a lot of your,
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.100]   you know, post-SEAL life learnings,
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:37.360]   you've talked about meditation,
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:40.040]   you've probably thought about sleep a lot.
[01:04:40.040 --> 01:04:42.240]   How has your feelings on sleep changed
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:44.980]   and are there any tactics that you took away from that
[01:04:44.980 --> 01:04:47.300]   that have been helpful in life after SEALS?
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.280]   - Well, Chris, I just wanna first a little bit
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:52.240]   challenge the premise of what you said.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:56.160]   Being able to operate on a little bit of sleep
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.520]   is essential, but it's also dumb.
[01:04:59.520 --> 01:05:03.920]   And so what we always try to do is be as rested
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:05.600]   and as strong as we possibly can.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:10.600]   And so we only build that skill or the ability to do that
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:12.480]   because we have to at times.
[01:05:12.480 --> 01:05:14.480]   And as a leader in the SEALS,
[01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:15.920]   what you're constantly thinking about
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:19.900]   is just very simple physical performance.
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.160]   It's scientifically proven.
[01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:25.120]   Like as we diminish in our sleep,
[01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.680]   our performance does degrade.
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:29.760]   And so in SEAL training, we're up for a week straight.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:32.560]   We're up from a Sunday morning to a Friday afternoon
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.880]   in what's called hell week.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:36.600]   And what you learn that you really can keep moving
[01:05:36.600 --> 01:05:38.080]   for literally a week straight.
[01:05:38.080 --> 01:05:40.840]   Yes, you get like 20 minutes of sleep on like the Wednesday.
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:41.680]   The instructors are like,
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:43.200]   "Oh, you're the best class we've ever seen.
[01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:44.080]   We're actually gonna get you,
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:45.360]   let you rest for a little bit."
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.960]   You lay down and then 20 minutes later,
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.760]   they wake you up with bullhorns and yelling at you
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:51.020]   to go jump in the Pacific ocean at 62 degrees
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:51.940]   or whatever it is.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:54.980]   So, you know, like these are things that you do stretch
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.660]   like we talked about before.
[01:05:56.660 --> 01:05:58.620]   So we all know that we can stay up for a week straight
[01:05:58.620 --> 01:05:59.780]   if we have to.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:04.060]   But I don't think that operating on less sleep
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:09.060]   is something that you actually reap that many benefits from.
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:12.020]   I would encourage people to sleep
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:13.460]   as much as they humanly can.
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:16.120]   - Yeah, we're about to have baby number two.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:18.500]   So I might have to take some of the lessons
[01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:20.520]   of knowing I can get by, but I agree.
[01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:23.740]   I think sleep's important, but appreciate you sharing.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.780]   Before we wrap, I've got my other question
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:30.040]   I like to ask everyone is to pick a place
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:32.000]   that you're kind of familiar with
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:35.620]   and share to anyone who might end up in that city,
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:37.880]   a place you think they should go grab a meal,
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.660]   grab a drink and an activity that they might wanna do
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:43.280]   that's not the most obvious thing to do.
[01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:46.100]   - Well, my happy place is Sonopee, New Hampshire.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.800]   Lake Sonopee, it's a fresh air.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:50.880]   I'm in Westport, Connecticut right now,
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:54.600]   but we've got a place up in Sonopee, New Hampshire
[01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:57.520]   that that's where we really go when we wanna get away.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:02.520]   Beautiful little small town harbor in the fall,
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:03.960]   it's the leaves in the summer,
[01:07:03.960 --> 01:07:08.400]   it's the incredible swimming and harbor
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.800]   and just four seasons of fun there.
[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.320]   So it's a hidden gem.
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:15.480]   It's actually a little known fact,
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.520]   but Steven Tyler is actually from Sonopee, New Hampshire.
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:21.320]   So he lives down the road a bit.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:24.440]   But other than Steven Tyler,
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:28.240]   there's not a lot of like a glitz and glam to Lake Sonopee.
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:30.800]   It's just a wonderful hidden gem, Chris.
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:33.280]   - Any place you'd say if someone's up there,
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:34.960]   is there a place to eat, something to do?
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.800]   - I wish there were better places to eat.
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.000]   So that's why I spent time in DC, as you noted.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:42.200]   So I know how to not answer the question that you asked.
[01:07:42.200 --> 01:07:44.160]   And so I intentionally didn't go the eat route,
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:47.640]   but yeah, no, we'd love for people
[01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:48.680]   to open better restaurants.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.880]   But no, there's a couple,
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:54.480]   the Anchorage is a great place right in the harbor.
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:07:57.600]   You're gonna really enjoy, let's just say the,
[01:07:57.600 --> 01:07:59.480]   let's zoom out from the dish itself.
[01:07:59.480 --> 01:08:03.640]   And let's just say the atmosphere could not be better.
[01:08:03.640 --> 01:08:04.560]   - That sounds great.
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.480]   I really enjoyed the book.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:08.500]   What is next for you?
[01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.920]   Where can people stay in touch
[01:08:09.920 --> 01:08:11.160]   with everything you're working on
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:12.620]   and how can they support you?
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:13.460]   - Awesome.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:16.760]   So first and foremost, I'm loving helping transform VMware.
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:18.880]   But like many of us, we have a million things
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.220]   that we're doing in life.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:23.040]   And one of mine is being on the board
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.960]   of the National Medal of Honor Museum,
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:28.120]   where we're on a mission to inspire America.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.480]   We're building a new museum outside of AT&T and Stadium
[01:08:31.480 --> 01:08:33.040]   and in Dallas, Texas.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.080]   And one of the things that I will do
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.880]   in the coming couple of months is to start a podcast
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:39.000]   with a lifelong friend of mine,
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.720]   who is one of the nation's 66
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:43.280]   Living Medal of Honor recipients.
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.520]   His name is Brett Slabinski, affectionately Slab.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:48.400]   Slab and I are gonna co-host a podcast.
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.560]   We've got incredible people,
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:54.320]   lots of ex-presidents on the advisory board for the museum,
[01:08:54.320 --> 01:08:58.320]   people that I just am super excited to bring to life
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:09:02.040]   via a podcast associated with the Medal of Honor Museum.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:05.440]   So I'd say, you know, lock in on Instagram.
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:09.360]   This is dot Mike Hayes, or on Twitter, this is Mike Hayes.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:11.400]   And we will, in the coming months,
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:14.840]   be bringing more and more Medal of Honor Museum
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.040]   and leadership content out.
[01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.520]   So love for people to follow
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.120]   and start getting at the front of the line.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.640]   - We will link to both those in the show notes.
[01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.200]   You mentioned the foundation you set up.
[01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.200]   Is that something people can read more about,
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.000]   or is it kind of a private foundation?
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.840]   - Well, it's a 501(c)(3), so it is Googleable,
[01:09:30.840 --> 01:09:33.080]   but I will tell you, we have no full-time employees.
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:34.480]   We're all volunteers.
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:37.040]   And the best help that people can give
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:39.320]   is help Never Enough get out there in the world more.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:41.760]   Help elevate the conversation.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:44.600]   All of those profits are going to Gold Star families.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:46.960]   So I think the easiest ask and the best way to help
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:50.120]   is to, you know, get a copy or a couple copies
[01:09:50.120 --> 01:09:51.760]   of Never Enough for your family and friends
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:55.400]   and people whose lives you want to positively influence.
[01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.960]   - Mike, that's such a great idea.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.360]   Thank you for writing this book.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.560]   Thank you for being here.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:00.560]   - No, thank you, my friend.
[01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:01.840]   And appreciate all that you're doing
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:03.760]   to make this great nation greater.
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:06.340]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:08.920]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:11.520]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:14.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:16.680]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:21.320]   you
