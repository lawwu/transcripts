[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.480]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.080]   of the Everyday Educator podcast.
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.840]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.380]   and I am excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.800]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.720]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.060]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.300]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.480]   this homeschooling possibility
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.600]   or deep into the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.720]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:41.480]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.480]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.600]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.980]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.240]   Well, welcome friends to this Advent season.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.420]   I'm so excited that you have joined us for this podcast.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.340]   I've got a suggestion for your family,
[00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.560]   actually for all of our families this Christmas.
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.520]   What if we intentionally spent time together
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.560]   doing the simplest things?
[00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.760]   What if we practiced some simple habits
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.080]   designed to draw us to one another,
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.000]   designed to start meaningful conversations,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.800]   designed to provoke us to deeper thinking,
[00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.620]   maybe designed to encourage us to true worship?
[00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.400]   What if in this season of busy, busy, busy,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.060]   we celebrated Christmas by praying together,
[00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.060]   playing together, reading together, exploring together,
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.040]   and serving together?
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.540]   So this Advent season, the everyday educator
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.980]   wants to practice these simple habits along with you.
[00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:03.460]   We're gonna be talking to others
[00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.660]   who want to try this plan too.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.940]   You can listen in every Tuesday to ponder the next habit.
[00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.680]   And friends, I'm here to tell you, this is our last habit.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.980]   We have finally come to simplify,
[00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.140]   Advent, serve together.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.980]   And I have a dear friend, Jamie Hayes, with me
[00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.320]   to help us explore this simple way
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.560]   to practice Advent together this year.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.860]   Jamie is a dear friend who's a long-time homeschool mom.
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.420]   She has served as a director with Classical Conversations
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.740]   and as an SR, and she serves right now
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:49.060]   on the curriculum development team alongside me.
[00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.500]   And so Jamie, welcome to the podcast.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.740]   - Thank you, I'm excited to be here.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:57.060]   - I'm excited to have you and to pick your brain
[00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.860]   a little bit, but I wanna start out
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.900]   with some easy peasy questions.
[00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.080]   First of all, what do you and your family
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.860]   love about Christmas?
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.860]   And I want to know, are you guys exuberant celebrators
[00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.440]   or quiet celebrators, or somewhere in between?
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:23.460]   - So I guess it all depends on how you define those terms,
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.800]   but I would put us between, towards leaning,
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.520]   towards the exuberant ones.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.600]   - I can see that.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   - Yeah, we love just being with people
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.500]   and through this season especially.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.980]   And so when our families can get together
[00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.800]   and we tend to play loads of cards and board games
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   and watch movies that make my dad roll in the floor
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.300]   with laughter, and so we watch the movies just to watch that.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:58.740]   - Yes, yes, yes.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.780]   - And so just making memories,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.140]   whether it be with family or friends,
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.140]   is something that we really enjoy about this season.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.640]   - I love that.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.200]   You know, people always say Christmas is a time for family.
[00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:21.260]   But I look around and I don't always see it.
[00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.580]   I see families going in a hundred different directions.
[00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.140]   Everybody going to their own Christmas party
[00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.880]   or their own Christmas whatever.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   So I love it that your family loves to spend time together
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.700]   doing things together.
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.120]   'Cause it's possible to all be home at the same time
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.260]   and still not be together.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.900]   So I like it that you say,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.020]   and you've given us some good ideas,
[00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.420]   playing games, card games, and board games.
[00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:53.340]   My sons-in-law are game people.
[00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.600]   And so we play games together.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.840]   We always have, even when they were just dating my girls,
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.780]   they introduced us to a lot of games
[00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.860]   that I'm sure I would never have played otherwise.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.580]   And our family likes to watch movies together too.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.300]   I sort of like it that we watch the same movies
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.720]   and so we all have our pet lines
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.420]   and we can all quote whole sections of the movie.
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:22.760]   I had a niece one time who was watching a movie with us
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.900]   and apparently her family doesn't watch movies
[00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.180]   the same way we do.
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:29.780]   And so after about the fourth chorus
[00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.980]   where we had quoted a section of the dialogue,
[00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:36.660]   she said, "Wow, do y'all memorize all the movies
[00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:37.500]   "that you watch?"
[00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:41.140]   It's like, well, maybe, I don't know, not intentionally.
[00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:43.740]   Maybe that just happens to classical educators.
[00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:44.580]   I don't know.
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.020]   - Yeah, yeah, we definitely just recently watched
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.620]   "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers."
[00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:51.700]   - That's one of our big favorites.
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.460]   - And yeah, just all of us belting out the songs throughout.
[00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.300]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.100]   - My dad's favorite lines,
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:03.220]   which are probably somewhat PG-13 rated now.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:05.900]   - Yes, that's so funny.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.780]   Every time I watch that movie for like weeks after that,
[00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.300]   I wake up thinking, bless your beautiful eyes.
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.340]   And it's just, I cannot get out of my mind.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:18.780]   It's like a worm in my mind.
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.260]   So let me ask you this, Jamie,
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.860]   because you guys love to do family things together,
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:28.860]   I suspect that you have a good many family traditions.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:31.140]   So what are some of your,
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:33.460]   yours and Mark's or yours and your kids,
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:36.500]   what are some of your favorite family traditions?
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.500]   How did they begin and were they intentional
[00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:43.380]   or unintentional?
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.940]   - So one of the favorites is guessing
[00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.900]   which gifts are whose.
[00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.180]   - Ooh, so they don't have tags on them?
[00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.220]   - They do not.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:59.900]   All they say is one, they have four different words
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:01.740]   I will put on them.
[00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:07.820]   Want, need, book, cloth.
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:08.820]   - Gotcha.
[00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:16.260]   - And then they find out which wrapping paper is theirs.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   Once they've opened their stocking,
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:21.260]   there is a little piece of their wrapping paper
[00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:22.940]   at the bottom of the stocking.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.420]   And so my kids just love sitting,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:28.820]   our tree is really close to our dining room table
[00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:30.380]   and while we're sitting there at meals,
[00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.580]   they're like, yeah, I'm now convinced
[00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:34.660]   that the striped one's mine.
[00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.380]   Or the one with the snowman, hmm,
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.380]   that looks sort of like something that I'd like to have.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.980]   - Oh, that is awesome.
[00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:47.500]   - So I enjoy just getting them involved
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.180]   in talking about the excitement of receiving gifts
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:55.460]   because we received a great gift many years ago, right?
[00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:57.540]   Of our savior being born.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:00.900]   And so just building excitement around gifts
[00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:04.860]   is something that I've really enjoyed doing.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.700]   And that one was intentional.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:10.300]   I had a dear friend who was doing that
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.020]   when I visited her out West and I just loved the idea.
[00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:17.220]   And we've probably been doing it for 10 to 12 years now.
[00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:19.500]   And so my kids expect it.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.700]   And now my grandkids are experiencing it,
[00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:25.140]   whether they'll expect it for the years to come.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.380]   I don't know.
[00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.020]   They're a little young, but,
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:32.340]   and then the other thing that we actually just decided
[00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.540]   this year, because we have a couple of older children
[00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:39.820]   who no longer live with us and they have their own schedules
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.660]   and, or at least the schedule that I don't see, right?
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:49.660]   And so this year we decided the first weekend of December
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:52.540]   would be our weekend to get together
[00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.860]   to put up the Christmas tree and put up all the ornaments
[00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.780]   and talk about why we have this ornament or that ornament.
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:04.220]   And those ornaments are very intentional.
[00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:07.340]   We pick them because they either remind us
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:09.660]   of places we've been together,
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.740]   or there's one for every anniversary
[00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.180]   that my husband and I have had.
[00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:16.260]   We have them labeled on the back.
[00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:18.220]   It was which anniversary they belong to.
[00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.420]   And some of them deal with trips that we went on
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:23.420]   for that special anniversary or whatever.
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.180]   And then some are childhood ornaments, especially for Mark.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:32.060]   He has a clay baked Christmas tree that's trying
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:36.340]   to swivel, shrivel into the,
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.740]   everything around the edges is just curling in.
[00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:41.340]   And so, but that one's special.
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.180]   He remembers the teacher at school
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:44.700]   that helped him make that one.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.940]   And so, yeah, we enjoyed doing that.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:51.540]   And then the last thing that I thought of was just that
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.500]   we do and have done since they were babies.
[00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:58.540]   So my oldest is 24.
[00:09:58.540 --> 00:10:02.580]   Since she, yeah, since she was a baby,
[00:10:02.580 --> 00:10:07.180]   we've done a Jesse tree that we actually made ourselves
[00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.300]   out of felt and made all the ornaments together out of felt.
[00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.180]   She was old enough to,
[00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.100]   well, I guess probably not since she was a baby,
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.700]   since the next ones were babies because she helped me.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.500]   So she would have been about six.
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.620]   And so she helped me make all the ornaments.
[00:10:24.620 --> 00:10:26.980]   And every year we've gotten it out
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:30.780]   and we walk through the lineage of Christ
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.580]   and what has come before to prepare us
[00:10:34.580 --> 00:10:37.820]   for this day that we celebrate of Christ's birth.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:41.100]   And this year and even years, the last couple of years,
[00:10:41.100 --> 00:10:44.220]   we've swapped it around to where we no longer tell
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:47.380]   the stories, but we just ask what the kids say.
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.940]   You tell the story, just from what you remember,
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:53.180]   tell us the story of what this one represents.
[00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.860]   - Oh, I love that, I love that.
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:01.740]   How do your kids feel about your traditions?
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.460]   Do they love them?
[00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:05.220]   Do they tolerate them?
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.300]   Do they advocate for new ones?
[00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:13.300]   - So there are some that don't fit everybody's bill
[00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:15.860]   of, yeah, let's do this yearly.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:20.860]   But I do remember, I'm reminded the last two years,
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:23.620]   in fact, they've asked me already this year,
[00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:27.100]   you're gonna get that candy, right?
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:28.980]   That certain kind of candy.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:31.220]   And I don't even know what they're called.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.180]   It's some foreign thing that they like
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.620]   that I can get at a local store, thankfully,
[00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:40.140]   but I got it one year and every year since then,
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.860]   don't forget to buy those, those are so good.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.660]   - Isn't that funny how you do it one time
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.980]   and it simply becomes a tradition to your children.
[00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:53.540]   - Yes, and I also do another tradition that this year
[00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:57.380]   I'm backing off of and I'm just really seeing
[00:11:57.380 --> 00:11:58.940]   if they're going to notice.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:02.700]   So they tend to get socks in their stockings
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:05.580]   'cause I'm like, what is a stocking without some socks?
[00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:09.300]   And also for years past, I used it just to be able to say,
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:10.700]   now we're throwing those away.
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:14.260]   They have holes, we're done with those, you have new ones.
[00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:17.660]   But now my kids are older and they throw their socks away
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:20.700]   as they get holes now and I'm like,
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:23.020]   okay, I'm not hearing the need for socks.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.540]   But I was telling Mark the other day, I was like,
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.100]   maybe they just assume I'm gonna give them socks
[00:12:28.100 --> 00:12:31.380]   so they're not gonna tell me there is a need right now.
[00:12:31.380 --> 00:12:32.780]   - Right, right.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.180]   - So I might be in trouble in 10 days or so.
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.500]   - That is so funny.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:39.740]   I remember when I was little,
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.740]   did you get those like lifesaver storybooks?
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.900]   - Yes.
[00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:49.680]   - Every year when I was little, I got one of those.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:52.860]   And so when I started having kids, I thought,
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.460]   well, everybody, they were just magical to me.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:57.940]   I mean, we didn't have a lot of candy when I was growing up.
[00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.860]   And so to have all of those roles that were just mine
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:03.580]   was sort of magical.
[00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:05.460]   So I did that for my kids.
[00:13:05.460 --> 00:13:08.460]   And it was probably three years ago.
[00:13:08.460 --> 00:13:11.060]   My adult girls finally said,
[00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:14.000]   like, if you want to stop doing that,
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.660]   we would be okay with it.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.460]   And I thought, oh my gosh, I did not have any idea
[00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:23.100]   that it did not strike them as magical as it struck me.
[00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.860]   But their life is full of more candy than my life was.
[00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:27.300]   - Right, yes.
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:29.100]   - That's it, it's so funny.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.480]   Our kids love some traditions and some they don't love.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:36.140]   But you know what I have discovered?
[00:13:36.140 --> 00:13:40.080]   It's the traditions of our family,
[00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:45.080]   the beloved ones and the tolerated ones alike
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.300]   that draw us together, that give us common memories
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.800]   and something to rally around and something to groan against.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:56.440]   And so there's a lot to be said for all of those traditions.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:01.440]   - I know, Jamie, that your family is very active
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.180]   in serving your community.
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:05.420]   I love hearing what y'all are doing,
[00:14:05.420 --> 00:14:08.540]   what benefit you're involved in
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:11.600]   and what project you have going on now.
[00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.600]   Are there some things that y'all do every year to serve?
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:23.180]   Is there a tradition that you do every year as a family?
[00:14:25.700 --> 00:14:30.700]   - So yes, we try to do as much as we can
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:34.500]   be a part of our community here.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:37.920]   And one of the ways that we've found to do that
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:42.940]   is just that there are local businesses
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:46.340]   or nonprofits actually that we want to support.
[00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:49.760]   And financially is not always an aspect
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.740]   that my children at least can give you.
[00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:57.740]   And so we have found ways for, oh, we need extra people
[00:14:57.740 --> 00:15:00.260]   to help carry this banner in the parade.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.140]   And so there's, in our little town,
[00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:06.620]   there's at least three parades every year.
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:09.740]   And so we are always at the top of the list
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:13.580]   for those nonprofits saying, hey, call us if you need people.
[00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.700]   And my kids enjoy walking or riding in those parades.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:21.420]   And in fact, a couple of them are very disappointed
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.460]   when our schedule doesn't allow us to be in town
[00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:26.780]   for some reason or another.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:31.140]   And so, yeah, doing the parade and then quite a few of them
[00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:34.980]   also do fundraising banquets and they need servers
[00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:39.300]   and they actually want children or teenagers
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.340]   to be the servers to get them more involved
[00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:43.960]   in community events as well.
[00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:47.620]   And so once again, we're just on that list of,
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:52.100]   hey, if you need servers and it works with our schedule,
[00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:53.260]   we will jump in.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:57.220]   And so usually I'm in the background just instructing
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:00.540]   and but the teenagers are actually the ones
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.700]   that are serving the food or cleaning up or whatever.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.660]   And so those are things that we do.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:10.260]   And then this time of year,
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:14.340]   during our advent season, we try to instigate
[00:16:15.300 --> 00:16:20.300]   walking around and caroling once one night in December.
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:26.540]   And so we put it out on our local Facebook group
[00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:29.300]   just saying, hey, we're meeting in this grocery store
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:32.860]   parking lot and we have the song books
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:36.420]   and we have people who are organized
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:39.300]   and ready to take groups of like eight to 10
[00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:40.740]   down this street and this street.
[00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:43.580]   You meet at this time and you'll be put with a group
[00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:46.300]   and enjoy getting to know your neighbors
[00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:47.580]   that you're singing with,
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.860]   as well as the neighbors that you're singing to.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.380]   So those are just some things
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.820]   that we enjoy doing together as a family.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.760]   And it does help that for the most part,
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:00.700]   we are a musical family.
[00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.380]   - Certainly y'all really are.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.900]   And that's something that,
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.340]   although I had a podcast guest just earlier this month
[00:17:07.340 --> 00:17:09.980]   who said, "Yeah, we always go Christmas caroling
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.380]   "as a family and I'm not sure it's a real blessing
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.620]   "'cause we're not really musical."
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:19.620]   But I think the warmth of somebody sharing
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.980]   a Christmas carol with you in an unexpected way
[00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.500]   is a blessing even if it's like a joyful noise
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:29.260]   instead of a heavenly choir.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:32.780]   So that's a really, I love all of those ideas.
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:35.860]   I knew that you would have some really good ideas
[00:17:35.860 --> 00:17:40.340]   for families because really and truly one of the best ways
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.260]   for us to celebrate the season
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:47.900]   is to give the gift of ourselves.
[00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:51.260]   I love what you said earlier, Jamie,
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:53.240]   that it reminds us of the gift,
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.700]   the greatest gift of all that God gave to us
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:58.360]   in the gift of his son.
[00:17:58.360 --> 00:18:00.900]   And so giving of ourselves,
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:03.300]   giving of our time is really cool.
[00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.260]   So I love that.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.220]   You went in a couple of different ways.
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:10.300]   I don't know if I had ever thought about calling
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:15.260]   a local nonprofit and volunteering to be their face
[00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.860]   in the parade, although our little town has a local parade
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.900]   and I do know that people along the parade route
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:26.940]   love to see kids and teenagers.
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.660]   And so that is an awesome way.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:31.900]   And there are, you're right,
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:34.300]   there's so many banquets going on.
[00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:38.260]   Church banquets and nonprofit banquets
[00:18:38.260 --> 00:18:40.380]   and what a blessing to say,
[00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:42.700]   "Hey, I'll be your waiter or waitress."
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:46.920]   And that's such a great way for the kids to be involved
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:51.920]   and maybe to be drawn in to the mission of that group.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.900]   It kind of is a soft introduction for them.
[00:18:55.900 --> 00:18:57.740]   - Yeah, whether it ends up being that group
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.820]   or just being aware, do you seek out
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.460]   how you can be a servant wherever they land,
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.500]   whether they stay nearby or in another town, yeah.
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:09.660]   - I think that's great.
[00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:10.500]   Let me ask you this.
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:13.100]   Did your family, the family you were born into,
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:15.940]   did y'all do missions when you were growing up?
[00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.740]   I mean, is serving as a family just kind of part
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:21.020]   of your DNA?
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:27.260]   - I wouldn't have said that while I was growing up,
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.760]   but looking back, yes.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.300]   Did we go on mission trips?
[00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:33.720]   No.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.760]   Not one.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:36.860]   - Right, right, right.
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.360]   - But there was one year, and I come from parents
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.880]   who actually didn't give gifts to us growing up.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.460]   And so, but they would every so often,
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:53.920]   and one I remember specifically when I was nine,
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:59.600]   they announced at the breakfast table to us siblings saying,
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:04.600]   "We are going to give you each a certain amount of money,
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:10.020]   but you only get to choose on who it is spent on
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:13.380]   or whom it is spent on."
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:18.380]   So I remember that one just very vividly
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:21.660]   at the time we were praying for a relative
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:26.660]   who had an issue that was abusive to their bodies.
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:32.860]   And so giving money to them was probably not wise,
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:35.520]   but as a nine-year-old, I just remember going,
[00:20:35.520 --> 00:20:36.720]   "They don't have much."
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:38.900]   But I didn't realize they didn't have much
[00:20:38.900 --> 00:20:41.200]   because they spent it on the wrong things.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:46.640]   But my parents were wise and crafty enough to say,
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.440]   "Okay, we will give your gift to this person,
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:54.860]   but you need to know that we're not handing them money.
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:20:58.980]   We're actually going to go buy food for their household.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:03.000]   We're going to buy clothing that we know that he needs."
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.480]   And that was just a fun day,
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.560]   the day that we showed up unannounced to their house.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.560]   And I had probably seen this person at his worst.
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:20.420]   I was not secluded from the repercussions of his life.
[00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.280]   But I just remember him sitting on the front porch steps,
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:28.980]   just bawling and weeping when we showed up
[00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:32.200]   with just bags and bags and bags of things
[00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:33.800]   for the whole family.
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:39.860]   And then later on, I was not homeschooled,
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:41.360]   but private schooled.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:45.200]   And my parents, especially my dad, would say,
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:46.340]   "You know what?
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:50.260]   You're going to only go to school four days a week.
[00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:52.420]   I'm going to tell your principal that,
[00:21:52.420 --> 00:21:54.540]   and I'm going to choose what you're going to do
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:55.960]   on the fifth day."
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:22:00.480]   And for years, I either went to two different homes.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:05.220]   I went to my aunt's home who had, at the time,
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:10.220]   just her 10th and 11th child, they were twins.
[00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:15.240]   She was homeschooling from number four down to the last ones.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.560]   And I would go and just minister to her.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.680]   And that required my mom driving me there.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.000]   It was a family thing,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.580]   even though maybe I was the only one dropped off.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:33.000]   And then the other household was a family
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.860]   that just found out their dad had terminal cancer.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:41.860]   And they decided to go a more natural diet way
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:46.480]   to see if they could help with treatments.
[00:22:46.480 --> 00:22:49.280]   And so for about a year,
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:52.880]   because he's still living 27 years later-
[00:22:52.880 --> 00:22:55.200]   - Wow, that's awesome.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   - I would go every Wednesday and just scrub vegetables
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:03.600]   and help make the soup that he had to drink,
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:06.040]   juice a lot of veggies.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   And the Lord has just used that mightily in our family
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.660]   as my mother-in-law has had cancer twice.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.400]   And I've worked alongside her.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:19.680]   She decided to do the same type of thing.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.640]   And so just the things that my parents decided
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:28.080]   to push us to, and I know my siblings have their own stories,
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.300]   but we were all pushed to,
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:34.520]   these things are important,
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:38.700]   but not as important as you making you aware
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:41.120]   that you can serve, you should serve,
[00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:44.040]   and here's some ways you can serve.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.040]   - Man, those are some of the best outside the box.
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:55.340]   I mean, everybody thinks when you say
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:59.180]   serve your community, thinks about going to the soup kitchen
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.040]   or going on a local mission trip.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:07.040]   But these, these are ways to be the hands and feet of Christ
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:13.120]   to a local family, to somebody whose face you know,
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.960]   to somebody whose life you could be a part of.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.200]   You know, your life, your days could be intertwined
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.840]   with theirs, there could be some real community.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:30.140]   You know, it's really funny, I can remember my mom
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.680]   when I was little, I was blessed,
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:34.460]   my mom stayed at home with us.
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.460]   And I can remember my mom, she called it doing for,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.960]   she would do for older neighbors in our neighborhood,
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.080]   you know, older ladies who needed help to,
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.700]   back then we didn't have, I mean,
[00:24:49.700 --> 00:24:51.560]   people hung their wash out to dry,
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:54.720]   and so I can remember my mom helping those,
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:57.880]   we would do for those, and she would send me next door.
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.140]   Our, right next to us, we lived in a duplex,
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:05.680]   and the family next to us was an older couple,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.960]   Mr. and Mrs. Smith, and Mr. Smith became bedridden,
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.620]   and she would send me over in the late afternoon,
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:16.620]   and I would stand at the stove and skim the fat
[00:25:16.620 --> 00:25:20.240]   off of the broth, 'cause he couldn't have fat,
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:24.480]   he was only eating soup, and so I learned how to skim broth,
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.760]   I would go over every day, and I would skim the broth
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:31.760]   off of his dinner, and I got to fix his tray
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:35.980]   and carry it into him, and it was, like you said,
[00:25:35.980 --> 00:25:40.500]   just something that my mom, it was part of what she did,
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:45.320]   we just did for others, we did for neighbors.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:51.340]   That's really cool, and you know, I look back now,
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.020]   and as a kid growing up, I did not think about
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.300]   that my mom was teaching me something important,
[00:25:58.300 --> 00:26:00.900]   it was just something that I did,
[00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:03.160]   or my mom showed me how to do it, we did it together,
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.600]   'cause she was showing me how to do it,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.880]   but now I understand that she was teaching me
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.880]   how to love one another, how we love one another well,
[00:26:12.880 --> 00:26:16.360]   and so, I don't know, Jamie, I guess I would just say,
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:21.320]   and I'm sure you would agree, that part of celebrating
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:25.540]   Advent in a simple way for families might very well
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:29.440]   be teaching your children how to love their neighbor well
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.840]   by serving them.
[00:26:30.840 --> 00:26:35.520]   So how have you and Mark, since y'all have been married,
[00:26:35.520 --> 00:26:39.440]   how have you and Mark drawn your kids into serving,
[00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:42.560]   and what kind of things, especially what kind of things
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.660]   did you do with them when they were very little?
[00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:51.640]   - So one of the things was just starting at home,
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:54.100]   helping them learn how to do chores,
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:27:00.640]   because if they could do it a minuscule amount,
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.180]   then they could go somewhere else and still do
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.880]   that minuscule amount, and I know that one of my teenagers
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:13.440]   right now has a local fast food restaurant job,
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.320]   and he came home one day, and he's like,
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.840]   "My manager wanted me to pass a note along to you,"
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:21.640]   and I was like, "Okay."
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.400]   He said, "Thank you for teaching him how to sweep."
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:27.240]   - Oh my gosh.
[00:27:27.240 --> 00:27:30.080]   - He said, "Until I became a manager, I didn't know
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.840]   "that you had to teach people how to sweep."
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.360]   He's like, "But I haven't had to teach your child,"
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:41.360]   and he does amazing, and so yeah, just doing chores,
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.960]   you never know who you're gonna bless.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.720]   - That is so good.
[00:27:45.720 --> 00:27:49.840]   - And then we also, I remember when we would go
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:55.740]   to either events or somebody else's house for a meal,
[00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:58.600]   on the way there, we would just talk about,
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   okay, where are we going, how can we serve them?
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.920]   They're letting, they've invited us into their house,
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.120]   and what are some ways that we can serve them?
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:14.540]   And I just remember one thing that my mom just instilled
[00:28:14.540 --> 00:28:19.540]   in us was, you don't leave the kitchen until the person,
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:24.320]   the hostess or the host, has told you,
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:27.080]   "No, I don't have anything else for you to do."
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.240]   Then you can go play with your friends,
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.160]   and so that was one thing that my mom just kept instilling.
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.360]   She's like, "Be at their side and just say,
[00:28:36.360 --> 00:28:40.640]   "I'm available if you have anything that I can do for you."
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:45.640]   And I also watched my mom host many events
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:50.120]   and have people come in and do the same to her,
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:53.300]   and she would always have this little list,
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:55.300]   either in her head or off to the side,
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:57.620]   that she knew if anybody had asked,
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:28:59.760]   it didn't have to be done,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.140]   but it could be done and just be a little icing
[00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:05.140]   on the cake for the event.
[00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:07.460]   And so she would always have something
[00:29:07.460 --> 00:29:10.300]   that she could tell somebody else
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:12.600]   what they could do if they offered.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.920]   And so, yeah, those things,
[00:29:15.920 --> 00:29:20.440]   we also learned to bake together in our kitchen.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.060]   And when we lived in Virginia for a short time,
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:26.500]   we, for the first time and only time in our lives,
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:30.360]   we lived with neighbors right next to us.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.480]   We live on a big farm now and nobody's really close.
[00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.120]   - Nobody's close, yeah.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:38.240]   - So when we lived in Virginia,
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:43.240]   we started baking cookies around Advent season time
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:46.400]   and would just take them door to door
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.920]   and greet our neighbors,
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:49.800]   because sometimes we would just see them
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:53.560]   as we were walking into our house, wave across the way.
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:58.120]   But we also purposely tried to make something
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:01.860]   that the children were involved in making
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:04.540]   and then also go greet our neighbors
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:09.140]   just to let them know that we knew they existed
[00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.080]   and that they were worthwhile of thinking over.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.640]   And so walking was fun.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.420]   It was fun to live in that area
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.280]   for those two to three years that we lived there,
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.860]   just 'cause within a half a mile,
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.840]   we had a dozen houses that we could hit
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.400]   and get to know our neighbors
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:34.000]   and hopefully be a light to them,
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.240]   even in just handing them cookies and greeting them.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:39.060]   - That's so great.
[00:30:39.060 --> 00:30:40.560]   It's a whole attitude.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:44.180]   That's what I'm taking from what you're saying, Jamie,
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.480]   is that you and Mark have just really sought
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.300]   to instill in your children an attitude of service,
[00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:57.260]   that we can always be thinking about
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:59.020]   what we could do for other people
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:02.560]   or how we might minister to them in some way.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:08.480]   And it may be in every day along the way ways
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:12.980]   and not in some big grand gesture
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:15.660]   that has lots of zeros attached to it
[00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:17.620]   or multiple day trips.
[00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:20.520]   It could just be an attitude of,
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.880]   I care about you as a person.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.820]   How can I lighten your load?
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:26.280]   And I love that.
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.220]   I love that.
[00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:33.220]   What is the best thing for you about serving as a family?
[00:31:33.220 --> 00:31:38.560]   - Well, outside of just getting to be together,
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:42.220]   that would be just number one.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.800]   It's seeing the growth in my children.
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:52.800]   And also just, we all compare whether it's good or bad.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.600]   We do tend to be that species that does that.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:04.680]   And they would come to us and they would go,
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:07.440]   oh, I wish this person would help me.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.560]   And I was like, well, what did you say to them?
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:15.240]   Or what could you say to them to encourage them
[00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:19.680]   to do what you feel the need to do
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:21.880]   in serving your neighbors or your friends
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:22.860]   or wherever you are?
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.500]   And so I loved seeing that they realized
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:30.100]   that it can be a lacking in people.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:33.120]   And so I think that pushed them to make sure
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:35.840]   that it wasn't a lacking in them.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:39.880]   And then it also just creates a great love
[00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:44.640]   and concern for others like the scripture tells us to do.
[00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:47.480]   And as far as working together as a family,
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.680]   they actually get to see,
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:54.680]   hey, mom and dad can't do everything, but they're trying.
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:59.240]   And they will at least put their hands that can lift things
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:03.200]   or move things around to bless others.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.080]   And also just working together,
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:09.120]   we can accomplish so much more
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.320]   than if just one of us goes or two of us goes.
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:15.560]   And my mom always would say to us
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.320]   when we would sort of go, ah, here we go again.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.400]   She would just, or the chore list would come out.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:25.000]   And we expected the chore list every Saturday, it showed up.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:28.740]   And she would just right on the bottom
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.480]   of where she had signed us all the numbers of the chores,
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:35.280]   she'd say, remember, many hands make like work.
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.560]   You could be doing all of these on your own.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:42.160]   And so that's just a really good reminder
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:44.680]   that I've tried to pass along to my children
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.640]   is that when we all work together,
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.560]   like we run a wood stove at our house during the winter.
[00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.640]   And so everybody, we just call out,
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.720]   hey, we're getting wood.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.200]   And everybody is supposed to come downstairs
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   because if all currently five of us run outside
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.160]   and get armfuls of wood,
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:11.160]   we probably only have to make two, maybe three trips each.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:16.160]   But if it was one person, that's 15 trips possibly.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.320]   And so it's a huge, huge difference.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.600]   And so another saying that my mom said,
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.000]   or had actually on our wall to remind us
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:30.260]   was those who work together get to eat together.
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:33.680]   And eating was always a fun thing
[00:34:33.680 --> 00:34:36.340]   because we did it together around the table.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:41.600]   But we had to work to get to that table.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.200]   And so she was like, if we all work together,
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:46.040]   then we're all gonna get to eat together.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.440]   And that's exciting.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:51.560]   - It's that together part is that my mother-in-law
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:53.800]   had a saying when my husband was little,
[00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:57.400]   and she would tell them when we work together,
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:00.300]   work is just like play.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:02.760]   Now, when my kids were really little,
[00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:05.040]   it was easier to convince them of that
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:08.840]   because we could work together in silly ways.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:12.040]   We could walk in silly ways or we could sing silly songs.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:13.720]   And when they became teenagers,
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:16.280]   they would sort of sometimes roll their eyes about that.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:18.840]   It's not just like play, mom, it's work.
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:25.340]   But it's well taken that when anything that we do together
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:32.640]   builds our fellowship and builds our love for one another,
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.420]   and builds a sense of community.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.400]   So I agree with all of that.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:42.720]   And serving together, especially when we serve together
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:46.400]   at Christmas, it does a lot of different things.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.960]   It draws our hearts together.
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:54.740]   Sometimes within our community,
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.960]   we'll call attention to what we're doing,
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:35:59.800]   not because we want accolades,
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.920]   but because it then gives us a reason
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.700]   to share the good news of Jesus.
[00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:09.480]   We do this because God first gave to us.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.480]   And so how does serving help your family
[00:36:14.480 --> 00:36:18.100]   celebrate the season, Jamie?
[00:36:18.100 --> 00:36:19.460]   - So it's just like you said,
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.820]   it makes us realize all the more
[00:36:21.820 --> 00:36:26.320]   that Christ modeled to us how to do this.
[00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:30.000]   And that should make us just every more thankful
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.880]   for the Father sending him.
[00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:38.680]   And like our Jesse tree, I love watching my children
[00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:42.800]   or hearing them retell the stories
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:47.760]   and then see them make the connections of this had to happen
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:50.240]   and this person acted like this,
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   which is a Christ-like reaction that I should do as well.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.720]   And they just turn and say,
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.920]   "Is that why they're in the genealogy?"
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:04.560]   And I'm like, "Good possibility."
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.640]   And so it's just, it's a great reminder
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.040]   just of what a model and what a gift we've been given.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:14.520]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.600]   Thank you so much for talking about this with me.
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   I hope, listeners, that this series of Simplify Advent
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:25.780]   has been a blessing to you.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:30.780]   I hope that your family has celebrated maybe more simply,
[00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:34.080]   but certainly more deeply this year
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:40.640]   what the Lord has done for us by sending his son to us.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.460]   If you're looking for something else for your family to do,
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:46.720]   I know we had a couple of weeks ago,
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.800]   we had Simplify Advent read together.
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.080]   I've got a suggestion for you.
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.820]   If you're looking for something for your family
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:00.700]   to read together, our Copper Lodge Library series

[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:34.180]   a moral imagination in your child, because here's a truth.
[00:38:34.180 --> 00:38:39.180]   What we read shapes who we become.
[00:38:39.180 --> 00:38:43.080]   So build your family's library with quality stories

[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.440]   you
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:19.440]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
