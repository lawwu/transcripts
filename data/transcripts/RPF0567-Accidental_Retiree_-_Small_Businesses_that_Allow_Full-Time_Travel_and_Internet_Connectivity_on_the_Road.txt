[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.840]   I'd like to pivot now to talking about some of the nuts and bolts of technology because
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.560]   you're a real expert in that.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.720]   And I think that'll be of help and interest to my audience and to me personally.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.500]   It also it's a fascinating world in which we live.
[00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.800]   My audience is hearing our voices right now through a technology that's been developed
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.280]   15 years ago, but really today, and it's really come into its own in the last five years,
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.200]   ever since the iPhone started automatic wireless downloading of podcasts.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.680]   That's where this world has come into being.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.800]   I know you don't identify, you don't listen to a lot of podcasts, you don't read a lot
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.680]   of blogs, but there's a huge community out there who does, who's interested in your knowledge.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.560]   So let's start with techie for hire.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560]   What is techie for hire?
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:30.640]   Well, I, as I often say to people, if you don't absolutely need it, I probably specialize
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.640]   in it.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:40.920]   In other words, I really do the kinds of things that a lot of the luxury items I do, you know,
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.280]   everything from satellite dish, rooftop satellite dish installations.
[00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:51.600]   I do a fair number of television retrofits, like you can see here, home theater style
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.320]   sound systems in RVs.
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.960]   I do solar installations.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:06.520]   I do inverters, batteries, a lot of it's, you know, the solar has been quite big in
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.760]   the last few years.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.920]   There's been, I can't even remember how many years it's been going on now, but there's
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.800]   been a 30% tax credit on not only solar panels, but everything related to their installation,
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.280]   the wiring, the solar charge controller, batteries, the labor, everything like that.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.780]   You get 30% back on your taxes.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.760]   So that's the last, probably the last three or four years I've been doing, you know, a
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.360]   fair number of solar installations.
[00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.360]   Internet access.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.360]   Thank you.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.360]   Yeah, that's huge.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:47.240]   And that ranges from, I do directional wifi antennas for people that are at parks that
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:52.800]   have wifi, which tend to be mostly the private parks, but I've got good directional antenna
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.920]   solutions for them that make a huge difference.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:01.560]   And basically my philosophy is that with an RV, that when it comes to connectivity, that,
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.480]   you know, you set up your own local area network in the RV and then you make just one connection
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.480]   to the outside world, as opposed to, you know, some people come into parks and they've got
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.320]   four or five, six devices and they're connecting each one individually to the campground.
[00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.280]   My approach tends to be to connect to your own internal router that puts you behind a
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.080]   firewall and gives you all the, you know, kind of nifty things that you can do when
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.320]   your devices can talk to each other.
[00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.440]   So I mean, something as simple as a, as wireless printing, you know, can really only reasonably
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.520]   be accomplished when, when your, your device that you want to print from and the printer
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.440]   itself are both connected to the same router.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.000]   Typically campgrounds block that kind of thing, doing client isolation.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.640]   So you can't connect your printer and your, your laptop to the campground router and expect
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.080]   to be able to get your print job through.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   So anyway, I mean, so a lot of it's luxury items, but then again, you could also say,
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.680]   well, for people who like this kind of camping, some of this stuff is relatively, you know,
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.560]   I mean, if you're for people like me who, who I wondered earlier in the interview, I
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.440]   was talking to you about any changes and one of the thoughts that I, and I don't know whether
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.360]   this is an exposure bias in the world that I am exposed to.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.640]   I see a lot more younger people, a lot of people who's knit, who the nature of their
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.160]   work allows them to do things like this.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.960]   I don't see a lot of younger families who are pursuing things that previously they wouldn't
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:29.960]   have done.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.120]   So I see this exposure bias, the world that I pay attention to versus what actually is,
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:39.440]   but I could, I can't go on the road without some form of connectivity.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.840]   And that can range from with my job.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:48.480]   Thankfully I can, as long as I touch data once a week or so I can do things reasonably
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.480]   well.
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.480]   Some people don't need that.
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.240]   They need Monday through Friday, nine to five East coast time.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.220]   They need to be available on chat with their office.
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.800]   And so they really need that.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:02.000]   But it's very doable in today's world to adjust your level of connectivity.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.600]   So you can be very present even though you are traveling and that's what you really specialize
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.080]   in, which is really incredible.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.320]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.040]   And again, that's, that's gotten so much better since, even since we started RVing.
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:26.120]   I mean in, in we bought this rig in 2010 and you know, at that point in time, I mean cellular
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.160]   internet connectivity was just, you know, just happening to the point where you could
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.560]   think about using it for, you know, for something significant.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:38.680]   But still, I mean, you know, we're talking about, I mean, I originally, I was setting
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:44.240]   up people with three, you know, three G types of connections, which were okay for, you know,
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.480]   for, for the kinds of things people wanted to do at that point in time.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.960]   But really the, the kind of interesting thing that's going on with, with the internet and
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.080]   with, with our ability to connect to it is the requirements of the internet have gotten
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.040]   so much bigger over the years.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.120]   It seems like every year I get calls from people who, you know, they're kind of accessing
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.760]   the same websites and doing the same things that they were doing the previous year and
[00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:13.760]   can't understand why they're using more data.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:14.760]   Right.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.760]   And it's like, well, that's because...
[00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:22.120]   You went from 360 on your 360 pixels.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.600]   Anyway, you went from low def to high def on your, on your, on your videos you're viewing.
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   And that makes a big difference.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   Exactly.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   In terms of bandwidth use.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   Exactly.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.200]   The photo, the photos that they're seeing on those websites, the images are all higher
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.200]   resolution.
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:41.680]   If they're doing anything with video, it just, you know, I mean, everything that's going
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.400]   on behind the scenes with, you know, you access one individual webpage, you feel like you're,
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.840]   that's all you're accessing, but there might be, you know, there might be a dozen servers
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.100]   behind that, that are, that are all providing data to that, feeding data to that webpage.
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:05.440]   So let's begin, let's focus on the technology that would be helpful for somebody who's seeking
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.920]   to go on the road in some format and still be able to work.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:17.160]   So they need access to communications and some data connection for their virtual work.
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.160]   What's the low hanging fruit?
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:22.520]   Where do you start in terms of making sure that you can establish and maintain a connection?
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.520]   I, you know, I think that you probably have to, I mean, I just went through this exercise
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:30.280]   with somebody that I was setting up.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:36.040]   We were over by a great sand dunes national park in Southern Colorado.
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:43.360]   And you know, they, they just knew they needed to improve their, their ability to use their,
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:47.800]   their devices, but they didn't really know how to go about doing it or what would be
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.800]   the best approach.
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:56.120]   And you know, with them, I really needed to start by talking about voice versus data and
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:02.400]   what was, what was important to them because there are a lot of really good ways to improve
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:08.720]   your data connectivity that will do absolutely nothing for your voice connectivity.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:16.620]   So in, in a lot of the, a lot of the best installations that I've done and, and most
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:23.320]   effective have probably been, have probably been data oriented because there aren't quite
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.960]   as many things you can do to improve your voice, your voice connection.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:36.200]   I mean, you can use a, you can use an amplifier like the WeBoost Drive4GX and Drive4GM are
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:43.560]   good recent examples of, of devices that have an inside antenna, an amplifier and an outside
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.200]   antenna that allow you, I mean, they will help both with voice and data, but they're
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.040]   not definitely not the ultimate solution for data.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.360]   So they're, they're probably about the best thing going for voice.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.360]   But but with, you know, if you have a really good, I'm going to have to go take care of
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   that here.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   Go ahead.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.360]   Do you want to pause for just a second?
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.360]   We got the wind kicking up and we need to go and put the awning in.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:18.760]   I put mine in this morning because I was concerned about it and it's not nearly as strong.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:19.760]   Did it break it?
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   Did it flip up?
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.920]   It flipped up, but it's, it should be okay.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:23.920]   It's not broken.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.920]   Okay, good.
[00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:25.920]   Good.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.720]   It's a, it's a, it's a known issue when it's windy.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:33.240]   You have a beautiful rig here.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.440]   This is, I mean, have you redone anything?
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.440]   Is it?
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:38.440]   Yes.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   Redone a lot?
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   Yes.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   We, we took down about four walls of mirrors.
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   Okay.
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:52.760]   Which I guess were great sales tactics back in the, in the late nineties to make it look
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.640]   bigger, but they drove us crazy.
[00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:57.040]   So, so we took down a lot of mirrors.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.040]   We redid the upholstery.
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:09:59.040]   Um, yeah.
[00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.040]   Very nice.
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.040]   It's supposed to gust to 30 today.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   Wow.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   Step over the top here for a second.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:11.040]   I'm glad I took mine down when I did.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.280]   You use these screens and just whenever you stop, you put these screens up and that helps
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:18.920]   with solar shade as well as it does.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:19.920]   It's privacy.
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:20.920]   Yes.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.640]   And you have them custom installed, installed the little snaps and then made.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:30.000]   So if you ever run into Todd and Renee Sealy, you should definitely interview them because
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.400]   they, uh, they make these.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.400]   Okay.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.400]   Because it's their business.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.400]   Okay.
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:36.400]   They're on the road business.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:38.400]   What other types of on the road businesses have you seen?
[00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:43.560]   Like, uh, well we have some good friends that have, uh, that run a website.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.800]   They had, they actually each have their own business.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:54.520]   One of them has a website called go pet friendly.com and her whole thing is, you know, trying to
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.040]   communicate with people about the best ways to, to travel with pets, where to go places
[00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:06.000]   that are, they're friendly towards, uh, having dogs on the trails and that kind of thing.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.520]   And he's got a, um, uh, evaluation.
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:17.600]   He's a, an accountant and he does business valuations and a few different types of coaching.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:21.360]   I guess that is probably the way that I would describe it.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.680]   They need constant internet connectivity.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.800]   And I've done, I've, I've upgraded.
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.680]   I mean, that's, that's a, that's another interesting thing about when it comes to internet connectivity.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:35.960]   Last year's best solution is not this year's best solution.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.280]   And you can, you can typically go, you know, you can, you can skip.
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:43.760]   It's not like you have to upgrade every single year, but generally when you're on the road,
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:48.920]   I mean, if you haven't changed the way that you connect to the internet in a couple of
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:53.120]   years, it's probably time to at least be looking at it.
[00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:59.800]   And I mean, I mean, I, I upgrade our system basically every year in some form or fashion.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:05.040]   Um, just so that I'm on top of what the, you know, the best and latest ways to connect
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.000]   are, um, and, and to get the best performance.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   I mean, this, this, uh, you know, this, this whole thing with, with, with LTE advanced,
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.560]   which a lot of people don't even know about.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:19.480]   I mean, it's been sort of a soft transition.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:24.880]   I hear more people talk about 5G than they do about, about LTE advanced, but yet LTE
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.040]   advanced is, which has, um, carrier aggregation.
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.320]   So you've got multiple connections to the cell tower, uh, simultaneously, and also the
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:39.360]   ability to support, um, uh, MIMO antennas, just like you see on a router where you used
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.560]   to be, you'd get a router and you'd have one antenna on it.
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.560]   Right.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.920]   And then now you see them and, you know, three is common and you see them with five and seven
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.520]   and each one of those antennas is able to do, you know, one could be sending and the
[00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.600]   other could be receiving and one could be operating at one frequency and the other at
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:00.440]   a different frequency and, um, and just, you know, doing more work and less time.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.440]   And the same thing is going on with, uh, with cellular connectivity.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.760]   So I mean, I've, I mean, I can't believe the, some of the numbers that I've been seeing,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:10.840]   uh, in the last few years.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:15.280]   Personally I've, you know, I've, I've topped out at about, uh, just short of a hundred
[00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:16.280]   megabits per second.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:22.000]   This is the fastest that I've seen, but I have the equipment now, uh, with, with what's
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.280]   called a category 12 data modem.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.720]   And um, I'm in touch with people on some of the forums that I'm active on that are able
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:36.880]   to, to get, uh, in the neighborhood of 200 megabits per second over a cellular data connection.
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:37.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   Wow.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   I know.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:40.880]   So let me just simplify.
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.240]   I want to, we, we threw out a whole bunch of jargon there, so let me just simplify real
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.240]   quick.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.240]   So thank you.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.280]   First, when you make a distinction between voice and data, specifically what you're talking
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:53.440]   about is the ability to speak over a cellular connection, which is using in essence, the
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.000]   old phone systems.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.120]   It's still piggybacked on, on the old phone systems.
[00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.040]   It just goes through the cellular connection.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:01.760]   So that's a voice connection.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:05.840]   And there are certain things that you can do to improve your ability to do that.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:11.680]   So if speaking on a voice connection is important, probably the best solution there is some form
[00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.400]   of a cell phone amplifier, right?
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:14.400]   Right.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   Okay.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.960]   And a cell phone amplifier from my understanding is a device that takes, uh, usually has two
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.960]   antennas.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.720]   It takes an external antenna that you put outside of your home, outside of your office,
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:28.440]   outside of your vehicle, wherever you are, you as a, some kind of antenna that is a,
[00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:33.160]   an antenna that's optimized for more gain in the cellular bandwidth, uh, which then
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:38.480]   it takes that antenna passes the signal through an amplifier, amplifies it to a small internal
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   antenna.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:44.080]   And then that small internal antenna produces a signal that your actual cellular device
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:48.860]   will read, will listen to, will communicate with, and it will use that signal.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:54.340]   So as long as you have some form of cellular connection, some week, at least a week cellular
[00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:59.180]   connection that's being served by the Verizon towers, the AT&T towers, et cetera, the sprint
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.580]   towers, then that amplifier will take it and amplify it.
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:08.260]   And you can speak on your phone using the actual built in cellular connection, uh, more
[00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:09.260]   reliably.
[00:15:09.260 --> 00:15:10.900]   And the best solution there is a cell phone amplifier.
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:11.900]   Right.
[00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:12.900]   Good.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:13.900]   Okay.
[00:15:13.900 --> 00:15:17.260]   And, and also in that I should, I should probably just, just add on one thing to that.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:21.720]   And that's that your phone needs to be very close to that inside amplifier.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.480]   And the reason is, is because, uh, and this is a problem unique to RVs.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:32.300]   You just don't have the ability to get the ideal separation between the inside and the
[00:15:32.300 --> 00:15:34.500]   outside amplifier.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.160]   And um, uh, I think you can use the analogy of a microphone and a speaker where you can
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:40.660]   actually create feedback.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:41.660]   Right.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:46.420]   And so the inside and outside, if the antennas, if they're too close and the inside antenna
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.580]   is too powerful, then you can just end up with, with a loop with oscillation.
[00:15:51.580 --> 00:15:58.180]   So as a result, they, they make the inside, uh, antenna a very short range device to try
[00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:04.720]   to avoid reamplifying the signal from your outside antenna and creating that loop.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:10.860]   So the best solution there is use some sort of wireless, uh, Bluetooth connection to your
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:16.060]   phone and then place the phone near the end indoor amplifier and use that to speak on.
[00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:20.220]   And Hey, I mean the very most rudimentary, um, if you're ever in an emergency, take your
[00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:25.020]   phone, put a strip of duct tape on a, on a pole, stick it up in the air and use a Bluetooth
[00:16:25.020 --> 00:16:26.020]   to speak to it.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:27.020]   You can get, I've tested it.
[00:16:27.020 --> 00:16:29.340]   You can get some gain, a little bit of gain and signal that way.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.660]   I mean it, it does make a difference if you have to.
[00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:33.660]   Yeah.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:36.940]   Now on the data side and data can be used for voice connections.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:42.500]   So for example, I try to almost exclusively use some sort of data application for voice
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:48.180]   communication and many of us do, whether that's Facebook audio, um, uh, FaceTime, Apple's
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:53.780]   FaceTime, uh, audio or FaceTime video, whether that's something like Skype or many other
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:59.100]   applications and encrypted app like signal or wire, those all work over the data network.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:03.020]   So many times, like I actually, I don't really care about the phone connection.
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:06.220]   All I really care about is data because I don't use the phone connection.
[00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:08.040]   I just use the data connection.
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.580]   So now when data connection, you're saying there's a whole range of other things that's
[00:17:11.580 --> 00:17:12.980]   available, right?
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:14.780]   And you, you threw out a bunch of jargon.
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:19.540]   Uh, you said, yes, cell phone amplifiers can help a little bit, but really what you want
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:23.660]   to look at is going to multiple, uh, what was the word you used?
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.660]   Uh, MIMO.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.660]   MIMO.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.660]   What does that mean?
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.660]   Multiple in, multiple out.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:28.660]   Okay.
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:32.980]   So the ability to have multiple, uh, several antennas in an array, either omni directional
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:33.980]   or directional.
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:38.060]   And with what you said, LTE advanced, that's a communications protocol that allows you
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:42.220]   to use a router or a switch of some kind with multiple antennas.
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:48.780]   And it can actually draw the signal from different carriers using the LTE protocol.
[00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:55.300]   And by aggregating those signals from different carriers is basically in my layman's understanding,
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:59.100]   splitting up the data packets and spent sending little bits of data packets over different
[00:17:59.100 --> 00:18:01.940]   networks, which allows you to maximize your speed.
[00:18:01.940 --> 00:18:02.940]   Is that accurate?
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:03.940]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.460]   I mean, they're the, um, I think from an engineering standpoint, there, there are a
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:15.300]   lot of efforts going on to figure out how to get the most out of our existing LTE network.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.220]   And so these are some of the developments that have happened to say, okay, well, we're
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:25.620]   still using the same LTE technology, but now we're able to have two streams going to the
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.820]   cell tower at the same time instead of just one.
[00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:30.060]   And it provides, it's amazing.
[00:18:30.060 --> 00:18:35.300]   I mean, um, I'm not really sure of the technical reasons for this, but, but my experience has
[00:18:35.300 --> 00:18:40.780]   been that it's, that it's typically a fourfold increase in performance.
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:46.420]   So if you have, you know, say you've got, uh, you know, 10 megabits per second on the
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:52.980]   download with, uh, without carrier aggregation, you know, with just a modem with a single
[00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:58.780]   antenna, you go to a MIMO setup with carrier aggregation and suddenly that same location,
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:02.180]   everything else, the same, you could be seeing 40 megabits.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:07.500]   So if I wanted to set up on my own rig, my own MIMO setup, where do I start?
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.580]   What brand names do I look at?
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.140]   How do I figure that out?
[00:19:10.140 --> 00:19:16.540]   Yeah, it's, um, I wish it was a little bit, uh, uh, easier to put these systems together.
[00:19:16.540 --> 00:19:19.460]   I mean, I suppose you wouldn't make as much money as you do.
[00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:20.460]   I'm glad for your sake.
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:21.460]   It's still a little bit hard.
[00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.460]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:28.980]   So, so, um, anyway, it's kind of interesting because the, the, the cell phone industry
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.340]   in a lot of ways maybe is going in, in a little bit different direction.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:38.420]   I mean, cell phones themselves have actually gotten quite a bit better in the last few
[00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   years.
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:44.700]   I mean, it's not unusual for, uh, for a high end cell phone now to not only have carrier
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:49.620]   aggregation, but have something called four by four MIMO, which means that, uh, you've
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:53.780]   actually got four antennas built into a cell phone and, you know, you think of the size
[00:19:53.780 --> 00:19:56.260]   of a cell phone, what difference could that possibly make?
[00:19:56.260 --> 00:19:58.680]   But it does make a huge difference.
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.460]   So having a, you know, having the kind of the best possible phone that you, technology
[00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:05.500]   available is, is helpful.
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:11.800]   But anyway, back to your question about as far as data, um, the, uh, for a long time,
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.500]   the USB modems were, and there's, there are, uh, there's a company called cradle point
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:24.100]   and another one called a pep wave that make, um, uh, routers that are specifically designed
[00:20:24.100 --> 00:20:28.420]   with USB ports that are designed for cellular USB modems.
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:35.300]   Unfortunately the, between people with phones and, and, uh, the ability to hotspot their
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:42.020]   phones and also with these little my fi devices that, uh, that are just easy for the stores
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:50.140]   to deal with and sell and explain USB modems have been kind of fading away a little bit,
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:56.340]   but the good news is that there are still some, some, um, standalone modem devices.
[00:20:56.340 --> 00:21:02.700]   Uh, Sierra wireless is a company that makes, that makes some really good ones and they're,
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:09.660]   they're targeted more at the internet of things world where, you know, with the idea that
[00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:14.500]   you could say like having, you know, an ATM manufacturer could just have a place where
[00:21:14.500 --> 00:21:20.820]   they can plug in a modem and then that, that, that ATM machine can talk, you know, over
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:27.260]   their encrypted network to, uh, and, and, uh, you know, back to the bank or, or whatever,
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.180]   whatever clearing house is being used.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.220]   But anyway, those same modems, which have, you know, which have gone from sort of category
[00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:42.340]   three category four modems now to, um, uh, category 12 technologies online, category
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:50.220]   16 is coming and those little card style modems can be put in a USB enclosure and then that
[00:21:50.220 --> 00:21:54.300]   USB enclosure can be connected to a router device.
[00:21:54.300 --> 00:22:00.620]   And I've been also moving away from the kind of mainstream manufacturers like cradle point
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:06.900]   and I've been, uh, the last half dozen installations that I've done have all been, uh, where I've
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:13.540]   put the solution together with individual pieces using, um, using a really inexpensive
[00:22:13.540 --> 00:22:18.680]   project computer called a Raspberry Pi that can actually be turned into a router, combining
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:26.780]   a Raspberry Pi with one of these, uh, uh, card style modems, connecting the two of them
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:33.180]   together and then connecting the modem to, uh, to two antennas, external antennas.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.940]   And the performance has been unbelievable, uh, compared to, you know, it's been a, it's
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:43.100]   been a, uh, a significant jump, you know, from, from what I was doing to, to what I've
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:46.020]   got going on now with those setups.
[00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:51.100]   And also the other great thing with this open source router software that I'm using, you
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:55.260]   really get great visibility to, to what's going on with the modem.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.040]   You know, it's, it's much more transparent as opposed to the industry trend, which is
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.260]   towards sort of opaqueness with, you know, the real kind of nuts and bolts.
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.880]   So for people who don't care about that stuff, they don't have to, you know, they don't really
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.180]   have to pay attention to it, but for people who do want to know, well, geez, what, you
[00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:15.220]   know, what is my real signal strength right now?
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:20.660]   Uh, what, you know, what are my, uh, in the, in the three G era, it was something called
[00:23:20.660 --> 00:23:27.420]   RSSI in the, in the LTE era, it's called RSCP, but it's just a, a measurement of the quality
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:28.420]   of your signal.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:32.820]   Um, you can get real numbers off of, you know, off of this kind of setup.
[00:23:32.820 --> 00:23:35.060]   You can tell what band you're connected to.
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.780]   You can actually see when, when you've got two bands that are aggregating together.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:43.820]   Um, and, uh, you know, there's, there's lots of configurability.
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:50.380]   So it just, it allows everything from sort of the just person who wants a good setup
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.420]   that's going to work well for them to sort of the power user that really wants information
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:58.740]   to, uh, to be able to, you know, get what they're looking for out of a setup like that.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:06.060]   So you're a power user and with your setup, which is admittedly advanced and admittedly
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:09.940]   you're, you're a geek, you're dealing with this, you're on the cutting edge.
[00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:16.220]   So with your setup, however, given that you spend a lot of time in rural areas, if you
[00:24:16.220 --> 00:24:22.380]   had a job that was nine to five that required you to be accessible with reasonable speeds,
[00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:27.780]   chat, little bit of video conferencing, you know, multiple times per week is the current
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:32.180]   setup in the United States sufficient that you could do that and work full time on a
[00:24:32.180 --> 00:24:37.300]   nine to five schedule with the type of advanced setup that you do?
[00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:38.300]   Susan's shaking her head.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.300]   No.
[00:24:39.300 --> 00:24:42.180]   And she's right in that you can't do it everywhere.
[00:24:42.180 --> 00:24:43.180]   Okay.
[00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.180]   Okay.
[00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:47.700]   So, um, I mean, there still are places in the, I mean, this is the thing, which I'm
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.900]   really glad there are places like that because I don't want, yeah, I don't want everywhere
[00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:52.900]   to be on the grid.
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:53.900]   I really don't.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.900]   I want to be off the grid myself.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:55.900]   Right, right.
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:25:01.180]   So, yeah, I mean, there still are, there still are lots of places in the country where, you
[00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:05.900]   know, you're, you're absolutely challenged to get a decent cellular signal.
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:14.260]   It's been, it's pretty rare these days when we have no cellular whatsoever.
[00:25:14.260 --> 00:25:19.820]   Once in a while it happens, but, but generally we've got at least, you know, the kind of
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:25.500]   can do the basics, you know, we can, we can send and receive a text messages.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:30.220]   We can check our email, we can, you know, we can order something if we need to, we can
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.500]   look at the news, that kind of stuff.
[00:25:33.500 --> 00:25:39.380]   But that next level, which I think, you know, if you're, if you're a remote worker, you
[00:25:39.380 --> 00:25:43.860]   know, typically you need, you need more than that.
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:46.340]   Maybe not every day, but I mean, you certainly need it.
[00:25:46.340 --> 00:25:49.700]   Like, I mean, you were saying you needed to, what, every five days or something, you've
[00:25:49.700 --> 00:25:51.940]   got to have a decent connection.
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:58.460]   So, but the, the situation has changed dramatically in terms of, I mean, we just came from, from
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:02.940]   a place above Steamboat Springs at about 9,500 feet.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:06.460]   I was talking about that earlier called Rabbit Ears Pass.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:11.780]   And there was a review on there from, I don't know, last year, maybe where the guy was saying
[00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:15.820]   that, you know, there's a whiff of Verizon and that's about it.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.340]   We were getting 10 megabits on, on Verizon.
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:22.300]   So with 10 megabits, I mean, you know, we were streaming, we were, we can do everything.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.340]   We did team viewer.
[00:26:23.340 --> 00:26:29.980]   You can, I mean, there's, there's no, you know, anything above about three megabits,
[00:26:29.980 --> 00:26:34.140]   maybe four megabits, you're really up into the territory where you, most anything I can
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.140]   do.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.140]   Right.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:41.420]   So I'd say I'm amazed at how many places are like that, where you can do that in pretty
[00:26:41.420 --> 00:26:43.620]   remote places.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:49.260]   When we were in Breckenridge, which was kind of just before Rabbit Ears Pass.
[00:26:49.260 --> 00:26:54.140]   I mean, that's, you know, it's a small kind of vacation skiing community.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:26:58.740]   And I mean, we had, we had performance as good as, as I see in, you know, when we're
[00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:00.380]   close to any big city, right.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:04.180]   I mean, just absolutely top, you know, LTE type performance.
[00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:08.660]   So the, the you don't have to limit yourself much.
[00:27:08.660 --> 00:27:13.540]   I mean, the couple that I was talking about earlier that have the, the GoPet friendly
[00:27:13.540 --> 00:27:16.340]   website and do the valuation business.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:21.620]   I mean, they, they need a good connection pretty much every day.
[00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:28.080]   And and, and they, for, for quite a few years, they were, you know, they would stay really
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:33.540]   focused on the areas that, that where they knew they would have really good connectivity.
[00:27:33.540 --> 00:27:39.300]   But I, but I know with the installations that I've done for them three, four years ago,
[00:27:39.300 --> 00:27:43.380]   and again, this last year, I mean, they've, they're now able to expand out into places
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:47.380]   that they wouldn't have considered before because they, they, they know they can get
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:48.980]   the connectivity they need.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:56.340]   If somebody were going to hire someone like you for just a good setup and then fund it
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:28:00.500]   with the appropriate lines that you would recommend, how much does it cost to install
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:04.660]   some good current gear and how much does it cost per month?
[00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.660 --> 00:28:06.660]   Okay.
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:16.380]   So the, I mean, I, so I charge $65 an hour and you know, something like the setup, a
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:23.340]   couple of the recent setups I've done, I, I suppose between the hardware and, and the
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:32.300]   labor, they tend to run up around $700, maybe something like that, seven, $800, you know,
[00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:36.860]   for me to do all the work and for me to show them how to use it, that kind of thing.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.060]   And probably half of that is labor and half.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.400]   So about a thousand dollars.
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:41.400]   Somebody has a budget of a thousand dollars.
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.400]   Oh yeah.
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.400]   They can get a good strong setup.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.940]   And then how much does it cost with the plans, multiple SIM cards, et cetera?
[00:28:47.940 --> 00:28:48.940]   Sure.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.020]   How much does it cost in a month to maintain a good connection?
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.020]   Yeah.
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:57.540]   So you kind of have to jump on the good, the good data plan options when they're out
[00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:02.340]   there and they, they, they tend to come and go.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:07.740]   The I, we used to only have Verizon, but in the last couple of years we've expanded down
[00:29:07.740 --> 00:29:14.100]   to where I have SIM cards from Verizon, AT&T and Sprint.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:18.760]   And we just, you know, we've been able to get good deals along the way, but we just,
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.300]   we just redid our Verizon plan as an example.
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:30.780]   And we put, we put one, one of our phones on the, what Verizon now is calling their
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:36.140]   above unlimited plan, which, which is, you know, there was unlimited and then they went
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:41.700]   to beyond unlimited and now they have above unlimited and all three of those exist simultaneously.
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:43.300]   Above is their top connection.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:54.240]   But, but, but the above unlimited plan gives you 70, it gives you, it's unlimited data,
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:30:02.440]   but up to 75 gigabytes a month before there would be the possibility of being deprioritized.
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:06.040]   And it gives you 20 gigabytes of hotspot data.
[00:30:06.040 --> 00:30:11.000]   And then that, that's a, that's basically your, when you get to that 20 gigabytes, they
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.360]   drop you down to pretty much of an unusable level.
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:21.220]   But the nice thing is, is that you can add additional for 20 bucks per device.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:23.720]   You can add additional devices to that.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:27.540]   And each one of them gives you another 15 gigabytes a month.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:29.200]   So you can, you can pretty much go from there.
[00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:35.120]   We just signed up for a $160 a month plan, which is the most we've ever paid for, for
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.920]   cellular, but I'm actually pretty happy with it.
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:41.680]   I mean, we've got, you know, we, so we've got that, we've got that phone plan and we've
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.800]   got three additional data device.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:48.960]   Each, you know, each of them able to do another 15 gigabytes a month.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:53.000]   So you're looking at 15 plus 45 pluses.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.480]   So 65 gigabytes a month for $160.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.640]   And each, you know, each device can be on a different, at a different level.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.680]   You don't have to, not all of them have to be on above unlimited.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:07.080]   You can have one phone if you have multiple phones.
[00:31:07.080 --> 00:31:12.720]   So anyway, I mean, I think, I think that, uh, and it's not a contract, which is great.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   Right.
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:18.800]   And the point is that with that plan, you're using that as functionally your TV service.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.040]   I would assume you have just a high definition broadcasting, but you also are using the data
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:28.280]   for internet streaming, TV, entertainment, Netflix, that type of thing.
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.340]   That's also your work.
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.960]   So you're using it for all of your work, internet connection, and then also just your normal
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.280]   personal browsing of the internet and your personal connectivity.
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:41.040]   So if you were to take $165 a month, if that's sufficient, plus the gear, and you were to
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.560]   compare that to many people's monthly budgets, that's in line, even living on the road, that's
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:49.840]   in line and perhaps less than many people and their monthly budgets for all those services
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:52.680]   for home internet, for home TV, for home, right.
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:53.680]   For cellular service.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.280]   And at the same time, not being particularly limited, right.
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:32:00.520]   You know, having, having an, you know, equivalent type of service.
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:01.520]   Right.
[00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:05.160]   And that, that I think is a huge change from, from when we started RVing.
[00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:08.560]   I mean, there was a clear difference between what you could do in a residence and what
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:09.560]   you could do in an RV.
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:11.320]   And I think those lines have really blurred.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:12.320]   That's exciting.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:14.320]   So where do you winter?
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.680]   And if somebody wants to hire you, how do they get ahold of you?
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:17.680]   Okay.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:18.840]   For you to work on their rig.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:22.400]   Because certainly having seen your setup, I'll affirm, you know, Scott's designing his
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:23.480]   own equipment.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.200]   He's designing his own enclosures.
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:27.780]   He's putting stuff together in a really powerful way.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:31.240]   And there's not a chance in the world that I could create something that is just simply
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:32.240]   as well done.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.160]   And it's going to last as long as what you're doing.
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:40.080]   And for somebody who's needs it, definitely they should be hiring somebody like you just
[00:32:40.080 --> 00:32:44.360]   to install it and consider it a cost of getting on the road.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.280]   Because for many people, if they have that reliable connection, it can make a difference.
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:53.080]   You know, last week I had some important calls and I had a plan, you know, I went down from
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.280]   where we are to the city that's 45 minutes away to get a reliable connection.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:02.540]   But I found what I thought was a reliable wifi connection and it was in the beginning.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:06.200]   But then as more and more people started using it, then my signal degraded and I didn't have
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:11.040]   a plan and I need to have, yes, I only need it about once a week, but once a week I need
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.440]   to have a reliable connection.
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.960]   And that is a make or break it thing for me.
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:17.760]   It makes a difference between my being able to do what I do.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.760]   And so for many people, this is a, used to be maybe bill pay was an issue.
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:24.800]   Today many people, this is the sticking point.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.880]   Can I work from the road?
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:27.800]   And to do that, they need the connection.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.040]   So how do they get ahold of you and, and, and sure.
[00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.040]   Yeah.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:37.200]   So, um, uh, so for five months of the year, we're in, in and around Fountain Hills, Arizona,
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:40.720]   which is a kind of an extension of Scottsdale.
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:45.120]   Um, and, uh, we're in one of two parks.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:52.040]   Um, the, we're in a private park for, for some of that time called Eagle view RV resort.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.480]   And the other park, um, that's on the other side of Fountain Hills, they're only about
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:34:01.560]   15, 20 minutes apart, uh, is called McDowell mountain regional park.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.880]   And that's, uh, that's a Maricopa County park.
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.480]   So they, they have, they have very different fields.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:13.720]   The, uh, Eagle view, one of the reasons we kind of got going there and stayed there,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:18.560]   um, we used to spend the entire five months there because we actually, they've got a couple
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:21.760]   dozen sites there that have hardwired internet.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:26.920]   And uh, you know, five, six, seven, eight years ago, that was magic.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.800]   Um, we could, you know, we could really do a lot with that.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:34.000]   And, and when I was, you know, I was doing work for people with their laptops and that
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.720]   kind of, it wasn't unusual for me to have to do a, you know, one gigabyte download just
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:40.120]   to update somebody's laptop.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.940]   And so that was great for that.
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:45.520]   But anyway, now with, uh, you know, with what we've just been talking about with the fact
[00:34:45.520 --> 00:34:48.880]   that the cellular is so good, it doesn't really matter to me.
[00:34:48.880 --> 00:34:54.520]   As a matter of fact, last winter, I didn't even sign up for the campgrounds, um, uh,
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.520]   hardwire internet.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.520]   I just use sprint.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:00.960]   Um, and, uh, it's the least expensive plan that I have.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:05.880]   And I, you know, I would get 80 megabits off a sprint at either, at either of those two
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:11.040]   campgrounds with, you know, relatively, uh, unlimited usage.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.040]   So yeah.
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.960]   And then as far as getting in touch with me, the best way is probably, uh, my email address,
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:21.160]   which is techie for hire at live.com.
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:29.760]   So that's T E C H I E, the number four and then H I R E at live.com.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:36.400]   And um, yeah, for those five months, I mean, I'm, I, I'm working, uh, most of the week
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:41.480]   and then the other seven months, I mean, I do projects for people in campgrounds.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:46.640]   So, um, if somebody wants to try to rendezvous with me at a place like this, I mean, it's
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.280]   usually the biggest challenge is just getting ahold of the stuff we have to order and where
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:54.480]   to, you know, I'd say, I'd say that's one thing that hasn't, uh, that probably hasn't
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:36:00.520]   improved that much with, uh, with this kind of, of lifestyle is it's still difficult to,
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.520]   you know, actually physically get a package.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:03.520]   Yep.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:05.000]   But, um, but you know, you figure it out.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:06.680]   I mean, there's, there, there are ways.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:12.920]   And, uh, we just, when we were in, uh, Breckenridge, I mean, now that Amazon owns Whole Foods,
[00:36:12.920 --> 00:36:16.760]   they've started putting in lockers at the Whole Foods locations.
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.760]   And so we were using that.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.640]   As a matter of fact, the only limitation there was the fact the lockers were full.
[00:36:21.640 --> 00:36:25.800]   Uh, every other time we tried to use them, we'd have to wait a day for people to pick
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.520]   up their stuff at, uh, at the Amazon locker.
[00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:34.960]   But, um, anyway, so that's, that's, that's the only thing about, uh, uh, about, uh, doing
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:39.680]   projects in the summer is, is just, you know, I mean, I keep, I keep the small stuff on
[00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.680]   hand.
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:46.000]   I've got, uh, a little less than about three quarters of a ton worth of tools and parts
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:50.120]   in my, in my, uh, lower bays that you saw down there.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.840]   And I keep all the, you know, the small stuff that you need to, to do a project.
[00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:57.880]   But, but when it comes to putting in something like, you know, like a solar system, I mean,
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:02.360]   obviously there are big panels and, and, uh, that kind of thing that have to show up.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:08.760]   But I just, I did a, an installation for somebody at, on the Mogollon Rim in Arizona at a forest
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:10.320]   service campground.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:11.320]   They just ordered everything.
[00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:12.760]   They were at a private campground.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:13.760]   They ordered everything.
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:14.760]   It all got delivered.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.840]   They threw it in their car, drove up to, uh, the Mogollon Rim at 9,000 feet.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.520]   And, and I did the whole installation right there.
[00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.520]   That's great.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.040]   Closing words of advice.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:30.080]   If you were speaking to your younger selves, somebody listening to this, who's working
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:35.160]   in Chicago and a corporate job and has said, wow, you know, so interesting.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.480]   What, what closing thoughts would you give, uh, to such a listener?
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.480]   Start with you, Susan.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:41.480 --> 00:37:42.480]   What do you think, Susan?
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:49.960]   I would say that, um, you, you should try it.
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:51.720]   You won't have any regrets.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:53.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:54.520]   Yup.
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:59.280]   And even with the fear of not knowing what's the worst that could happen, it's not all
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.280]   that bad, right?
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.640]   You can always go back to work, start a new business.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.960]   And we didn't talk in part one, when we talked about RV finances, I'll tell you this, the
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:16.240]   thing that I have been so interested in with RV finances as a financial planner, a mobile
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.520]   lifestyle, whether it's sailboats or especially RVs, because sailboats, as you discussed,
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:24.000]   have a lot of costs, but a lot of those costs also are associated with moving.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.880]   If you just had a sailboat and you anchored up in a Harbor that was reasonable, you can,
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.160]   you don't need new charts every year.
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:32.620]   You can diminish a lot of those things.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.880]   You can scrub the bottom yourself.
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:37.960]   You know, you can, you can lower a lot of those expenses, but especially in RVing.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:43.360]   One of the amazing things about the RV lifestyle is you can adjust your expenses as necessary.
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:48.560]   I've talked and read about and talked with people who are living on very low budgets,
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:54.560]   a thousand dollars a month total, and they just simply have the opportunity to adjust
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.780]   their lifestyle.
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:39:00.200]   So most people don't have the ability to eliminate their rent payments when they need to, but
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.080]   people who are living on very low budgets, if they have a big expensive repair, they
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.120]   spend a month out on BLM land.
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:08.160]   They don't drive, they don't use fuel.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.440]   They just spend a month out there and their costs are very low.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:14.280]   And then when they save up their money, they get the next social security check.
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:17.200]   Then they go ahead and they fill their tank and they move on, et cetera.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:22.040]   Now, obviously that's not the budgets that, that, that either you or I are living on,
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.180]   but that is something unique to RVing.
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:29.640]   So if you try something like that and it doesn't work out, you can always transition back in.
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:32.400]   I say a lot easier than a lot of people could do.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   You can pivot, you can pivot very quickly.
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:35.400]   Right.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:37.400]   Scott, your closing words.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:41.720]   I took over the thing, but what closing words would you have?
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:42.720]   Oh gosh.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:46.360]   I mean, I would say much the same thing.
[00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:53.800]   It's, it's, you know, I think that you don't, you don't necessarily have to have, you know,
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:57.880]   a huge plan and I wouldn't, I wouldn't over process on it either.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:05.520]   I mean, I think that we've, when I, when I look back at our, kind of our younger selves,
[00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:09.520]   you know, we were constantly, we'd go on a, we'd go on a one week vacation to a place
[00:40:09.520 --> 00:40:14.040]   like this and we'd pack everything in the car that, you know, we could possibly ever,
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:18.200]   you know, the rollerblades, the, the bikes, the, you know, golf clubs, you know, we were
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.480]   going to do all this stuff.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.760]   Plus we were going to catch up on reading and, you know, whatever else that, that we,
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.640]   anything that we hadn't been able to do because we were working.
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:32.600]   And I think that, that, you know, it's just amazing when you, when you kind of just, just
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.560]   pull it back a little bit and, and, you know, just go slowly.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:43.880]   I mean, we, we never drive more than about 550 or a hundred miles a day.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.960]   We were spending the entire summer in Colorado, you know, there's no reason to, we don't have
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:52.920]   to see the entire US and, you know, in a six month period or something like that.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:58.760]   So anyway, I would say just give, give yourself a chance, go out, give it a try and, you know,
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:04.280]   let the lifestyle, let the lifestyle kind of come to you, you know, cause it, it, you
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:09.080]   know, it's amazing how transformative I think it can be and, and how much things that maybe
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:14.120]   you thought you needed or were really important, just wash away, just disappear.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.120]   Yeah.
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.320]   Well, techie for hire at live.com.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:20.040]   If you'd like to get in touch with Scott, Scott, thank you for coming on the interview.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.640]   I did twist your arm just a little tiny bit.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:24.000]   Scott wasn't looking for publicity.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.440]   He wasn't necessarily out doing this.
[00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.240]   He didn't send me an email like so many people do wanting to get on the show.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:33.160]   He is not really involved in reading about this stuff.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.720]   He's just involved in doing it.
[00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.120]   So thank you for coming on techie for hire at live.com.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.520]   Scott and Susan, thank you both.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.520]   All right.
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.520]   Thanks.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.520]   Thank you for listening.
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:46.000]   You've honored me with your time and attention, and I'm grateful for that.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:50.800]   And I hope that I've effectively served you today with some ideas and strategies and tactics
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:55.520]   and techniques and tools that will help move you towards your goals.
[00:41:55.520 --> 00:41:57.880]   Before you go, three simple requests.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:03.640]   One, if there's an idea that's been helpful to you in today's show, make a plan to take
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.680]   action on it.
[00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:11.080]   Listening does lead to learning, but learning in and of itself doesn't automatically lead
[00:42:11.080 --> 00:42:13.440]   to a life change.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.400]   It's action that leads to a life change.
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.120]   So take action.
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:24.760]   Two, take something that was helpful to you in today's show and share it with somebody
[00:42:24.760 --> 00:42:26.320]   that you care about.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:33.520]   I'm depending on you to be a co-laborer with me in helping me to propagate the message
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.980]   that I'm seeking to share.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:39.480]   That helps the person that you are engaging with.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:44.100]   And it also helps you because teaching others is one of the most effective ways for you
