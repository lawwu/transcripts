[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   That's an incredible process that you describe in several places to arrive at the truth.
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.080]   I apologize if I'm romanticizing the notion, but let me linger on it.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:18.640]   Just having enough self-belief, you don't think there's a self-delusion there that's
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.640]   necessary?
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.560]   Especially in the beginning you talk about in the journey, maybe the trials or the abyss.
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.400]   Do you think there is value to deluding yourself?
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:39.840]   I think what you're calling delusion is a bad word for uncertainty.
[00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.080]   So in other words, because we keep going back to the question, how would you know and all
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.080]   of those things.
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.360]   No, I think that delusion is not going to help you, that you have to find out truth
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.240]   to deal with uncertainty, not saying, "Listen, I have this dream and I don't know how I'm
[00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.840]   going to get that dream."
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.960]   I mentioned in my book principles and described the process in a more complete way than we're
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.960]   going to be able to go here.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.880]   But what happens is I say, "You form your dreams first and you can't judge whether you're
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.940]   going to achieve those dreams because you haven't learned the things that you're going
[00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.440]   to learn on the way toward those dreams."
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.440]   Okay?
[00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.680]   So that isn't delusion.
[00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.480]   I wouldn't use delusion.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.840]   I think you're overemphasizing the importance of knowing whether you're going to succeed
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.840]   or not.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.840]   Get rid of that.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.840]   Okay?
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:41.880]   If you can get rid of that and say, "Okay, no, I can have that dream, but I'm so realistic
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.520]   in the notion of finding out.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   I'm curious.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.520]   I'm a great learner.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.280]   I'm a great experimenter."
[00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.360]   Along the way, you'll do those experiments which will teach you more truths and more
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.040]   learning about the reality so that you can get your dreams.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.320]   Because if you still live in that world of delusion, okay, and you think delusion's helpful,
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.440]   know that delusion isn't - don't confuse delusion with not knowing.
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   Yes.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.040]   But nevertheless, so if we look at the abyss, we can look at your own that you described.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.160]   It's difficult psychologically for people.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.120]   So many people quit.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.080]   Many people choose a path that is more comfortable.
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.600]   The heartbreak of that breaks people.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.640]   So if you have the dream and there's this cycle of learning, setting a goal, and so
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.320]   on, what's your value for the psychology of just being broken by these difficult moments?
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.320]   Well, that's classically the defining moment.
[00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's almost like evolution taking care of, "Okay, now you crash.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   You're in the abyss.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Oh my God, that's bad."
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.320]   And then the question is, "What do you do?"
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.280]   And it sorts people, okay?
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.320]   And that's what - some people get off the field and they say, "Oh, I don't like this,"
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   and so on.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:07.080]   And some people learn and they have a metamorphosis and it changes their approach to learning.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.460]   The number one thing it should give them is uncertainty.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:19.760]   You should take an audacious, dreamer guy who wants to change the world, crash, okay,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:27.520]   and then come out of that crashing and saying, "Okay, I can be audacious and scared that
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.640]   I'm going to be wrong at the same time."
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.060]   And then how do I do that?
[00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.380]   Because that's the key.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.100]   When you don't lose your audaciousness and you keep going after your big goal and at
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.940]   the same time you say, "Hey, I'm worried that I'm going to be wrong," you gain your radical
[00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.420]   open-mindedness that allows you to take in the things that allows you to go to the next
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:50.460]   level of being successful.
[00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.160]   So your own process, I mean, you've talked about it before, but it would be great if
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.900]   you can describe it because our darkest moments are perhaps the most interesting.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.380]   So your own and with the prediction of another depression.
[00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.380]   Economic depression.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.380]   Yes, I apologize.
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.380]   Economic depression.
[00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.780]   But can you talk to what you were feeling, thinking, planning, strategizing at those
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:15.780]   moments?
[00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.980]   Yeah, that was my biggest moment, okay?
[00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:21.880]   Building my little company.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.940]   This is in 1981, '82.
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:31.700]   I had calculated that American banks had given a lot more money to, lent a lot more money
[00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.100]   to Latin American countries than those countries were going to pay back and that they would
[00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:41.020]   have a debt crisis and that this had sent the economy tumbling.
[00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.580]   And that was an extremely controversial point of view.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:49.580]   Then it started to happen and it happened in Mexico defaulted in August 1982.
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.820]   I thought that there was going to be an economic collapse that was going to follow because
[00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.540]   there was a series of the other countries.
[00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.420]   It was just playing out as I had imagined.
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.980]   And that couldn't have been more wrong.
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:07.380]   That was the exact bottom in the stock market because central banks, these monetary policy,
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.500]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.860]   And I couldn't have been more wrong.
[00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.880]   And I was very publicly wrong and all of that.
[00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.980]   And I lost money for me and I lost money for my clients.
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.780]   And I only had a small company then, but these were close people.
[00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.940]   I had to let them go.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.500]   I was down to me as the last person.
[00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:32.940]   I was so broke I had to borrow $4,000 from my dad to help to pay for my family bills.
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:34.180]   Very painful.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:41.020]   And at the same time, I would say it definitely was one of the best things that ever happened
[00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.020]   to me.
[00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:45.380]   Maybe the best thing for him happened to me because it changed my approach to decision
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.380]   making.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:47.380]   It's what I'm saying.
[00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:51.940]   In other words, I kept saying, "Okay, how do I know whether I'm right?
[00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:53.780]   How do I know I'm not wrong?"
[00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.940]   It gave me that.
[00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:01.540]   And it didn't give up my audaciousness because I was in a position, "What am I going to do?
[00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:07.340]   Am I going to go back, put on a tie, go to Wall Street and just do those things?
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:10.580]   No, I can't bring myself to do that, so I'm at a juncture.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.180]   How do I deal with my risk and how do I deal with that?"
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.340]   And it told me how to deal with my uncertainties.
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:19.500]   And that taught me, for example, a number of techniques.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.180]   First, to find the smartest people I could find who disagreed with me and to have quality
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:26.180]   disagreement.
[00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.220]   I learned the art of thoughtful disagreement.
[00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:30.540]   I learned how to produce diversification.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.980]   I learned how to do a number of things.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:36.220]   That is what led me to create an idea meritocracy.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.260]   In other words, person by person, I hired them and I wanted the smartest people who
[00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.460]   would be independent thinkers who would disagree with each other and me well so that we could
[00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.580]   be independent thinkers to go off to produce those audacious dreams because you have to
[00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.660]   be an independent thinker to do that.
[00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:58.500]   And to do that independently of the consensus, independently of each other, and then work
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.420]   ourselves through that because who know whether you're going to have the right answer.
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:06.740]   And by doing that, then that was the key to our success.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:11.040]   And the things that I want to pass along to people, the reason I'm doing this podcast
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:18.960]   with you is I'm 70 years old and that is a magical way of achieving success.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.820]   If you can create an idea meritocracy, it's so much better in terms of achieving success
[00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:27.640]   and also quality relationships with people.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.220]   But that's what that experience gave me.
[00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:37.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:47.620]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
