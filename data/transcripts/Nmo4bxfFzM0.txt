[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to Huberman Lab Essentials,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.380]   where we revisit past episodes
[00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.560]   for the most potent and actionable science-based tools
[00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.320]   for mental health, physical health, and performance.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.880]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.880]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.980]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.120]   This podcast is separate
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.380]   from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.380]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.440]   to bring zero cost to consumer information
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.680]   about science and science-related tools
[00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.840]   to the general public.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.920]   Today, we are going to talk about two hormones,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.120]   thyroid hormone and its related pathways,
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.420]   and growth hormone and its related pathways,
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.200]   which arguably are the two hormones
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.740]   and two systems in the body that are most significant
[00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.720]   for setting your overall level of metabolism.
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.840]   So metabolism is the consumption of energy,
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.200]   not necessarily eating,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:56.440]   but it's the use of energy in the cells of the body
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.000]   for growth of tissues, for repair of tissues,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   and also just for day-to-day maintenance of function.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.040]   These two hormones, thyroid hormone and growth hormone,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.280]   we think of as related to metabolism of things in the body,
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.320]   keeping body fat low and keeping muscles strong
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.160]   and tendons strong and repairing themselves, et cetera,
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.360]   but they are also key for brain function,
[00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.580]   for the ability to maintain cognitive function
[00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.160]   throughout the lifespan.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.340]   So the big theme I'd like to introduce
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.740]   is that metabolism isn't just about losing weight,
[00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.280]   but having a high metabolism,
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.000]   provided it's not too high, is great.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.960]   It means that you will have more lean tissue,
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.520]   more bone and muscle and less adipose tissue, fat,
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.060]   and we know that that's healthy.
[00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.520]   There are neurons in your brain
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.000]   in an area called the hypothalamus,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.160]   which just means it's below the thalamus, hypo.
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.000]   It sits at the base of your brain in the front,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.320]   it's part of the forebrain.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.160]   So it's more or less above the roof of your mouth,
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.960]   maybe about a centimeter or so,
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.020]   and then about a centimeter forward in most people.
[00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.020]   And neurons in the hypothalamus release hormones
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.180]   that are called releasing hormones.
[00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.180]   So anytime you hear releasing,
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.540]   chances are those are neurons that are in your brain
[00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.860]   and they extend little wires,
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.980]   we call axons into your pituitary,
[00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.820]   and the pituitary releases a bunch of hormones
[00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.980]   into the bloodstream,
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.820]   and the pituitary releases things
[00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.980]   that most often have the name of stimulating hormone
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.120]   because they stimulate organs.
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.860]   So in keeping with the theme of thyroid hormone,
[00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.960]   you have thyroid releasing hormone in the brain,
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.060]   tells the pituitary to release thyroid stimulating hormone,
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.980]   and then the thyroid, which we'll talk about in a moment,
[00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.620]   releases thyroid hormones.
[00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.860]   And the thyroid is a little butterfly shaped gland
[00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.920]   that's right around the Adam's apple,
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.880]   and it's got four little bumps behind it
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.340]   called the parathyroid gland,
[00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.820]   and it releases two hormones into the blood
[00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.140]   to stimulate different tissues and their metabolism,
[00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.760]   and those hormones are called T4 and T3.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.100]   So if this is already sounding like a lot of information,
[00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.380]   it's really easy, I promise.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.860]   Releasing hormone comes to the brain,
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:05.900]   stimulating hormone comes from the pituitary,
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.580]   and in this case, we're talking about the thyroid
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.020]   binding up that stimulating hormone and saying,
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.300]   "Oh, I need to release something,"
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:13.740]   and it releases T4 and T3.
[00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:14.580]   And guess what?
[00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.300]   You can basically forget about T4.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.460]   T4, it's not completely inactive, it has some roles,
[00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.200]   but T3 is the one that's more or less active.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.140]   Now, what does thyroid hormone do?
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.740]   The main role of thyroid hormone of T3
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.100]   is to promote metabolism,
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.140]   and that doesn't just mean the consumption of energy,
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.100]   it means the utilization of energy,
[00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.500]   including the buildup of tissues.
[00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.900]   So it acts on all sorts of target tissues in the body.
[00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.580]   It acts on muscle, it acts on the liver,
[00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.340]   it acts on the cartilage, it acts on the bone.
[00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.340]   It's involved in taking fats
[00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.580]   and breaking them down into fatty acids
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.040]   and converting those into ATP,
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.360]   which is an important thing for cells to use energy.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.780]   It's also involved in taking sugars
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.720]   and turning those into energy.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.160]   And yes, it goes to adipose tissue, to fat.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.060]   We have different kinds of fat that we'll talk about today,
[00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.740]   but it goes to white fat and it liberates
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:17.660]   or helps liberate some of the fats from those fat cells
[00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:19.220]   and use them for energy.
[00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:20.580]   And this is why higher thyroid
[00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.940]   is associated with leaner bodies.
[00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:26.860]   Lower thyroid is associated with less lean bodies.
[00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.220]   One thing that's absolutely key and is actionable,
[00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.180]   we're right there already in discussing tools, is iodine.
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:39.220]   Iodine is most common in sea salt, in kelp, and in seaweed.
[00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.120]   And most people can get enough iodine
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.880]   from the food they eat and/or the table salt they consume.
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.760]   Almost all table salt from all over the world,
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.540]   regardless of where you are, contains iodine.
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.900]   The thyroid needs iodine
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.140]   in order to produce thyroid hormone.
[00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:01.740]   Iodine combines with an amino acid
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:04.820]   that we've talked about before called L-tyrosine.
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.100]   L-tyrosine comes from meat, from nuts.
[00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.300]   There are some plant-based sources as well.
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.160]   It is the precursor to dopamine.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.160]   But in the thyroid, iodine combines or works with L-tyrosine
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.660]   to produce T3 and T4, the thyroid hormone.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.860]   So you absolutely need sufficient iodine.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:26.300]   You need sufficient L-tyrosine.
[00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:27.620]   And then you also need something else,
[00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:28.860]   which is called selenium.
[00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.280]   Selenium is important in order for thyroid hormone
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.340]   to be made because of the way that it allows L-tyrosine
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.860]   and iodine to interact.
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.500]   And the thing is, most people aren't getting enough selenium
[00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.420]   because they don't eat foods that are high in selenium.
[00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.980]   Now, how much selenium you need
[00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.260]   will depend on where you live.
[00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.300]   It actually varies country by country.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:52.780]   Some countries, I found,
[00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.500]   say that you should get 100 micrograms.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.940]   Some say 200, some say 155.
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.100]   The average was about 155 micrograms,
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:02.720]   the countries I looked at.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.100]   People who are trying to increase thyroid levels
[00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.340]   might want to consume more selenium.
[00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.860]   And if you consume a vitamin, of course,
[00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.700]   you want to make sure if it has selenium
[00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.620]   that you're not overdoing it
[00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.540]   by consuming a lot of selenium-rich foods either.
[00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:18.080]   Brazil nuts are the heavyweight champion of foods
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.780]   to get selenium from.
[00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.980]   It has very high concentrations of selenium.
[00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.020]   In just six or eight,
[00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.740]   Brazil nuts contain something like 550 micrograms
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:29.720]   of selenium.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.460]   It's also present in fish.
[00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:35.700]   Ham, of all things, contains a lot of selenium.
[00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:37.380]   For whatever reason, pork does.
[00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.140]   I'm not a big consumer of pork.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:40.740]   Beef has some selenium.
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.820]   But what's interesting, if you look at the sources,
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:45.260]   you know, pork, beef, turkey, chicken,
[00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:48.500]   cottage cheese, eggs, brown rice,
[00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:50.900]   what you want to understand
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.220]   is that they have something
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.060]   like 30 to 50 micrograms of selenium.
[00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.340]   So if you're not eating Brazil nuts,
[00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.140]   and I'm guessing most people aren't,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.660]   and you're not eating a lot of animal-based foods,
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.240]   which I know many of you aren't,
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:06.400]   then you're probably not getting enough selenium.
[00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.840]   And again, you can have these levels measured,
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.900]   or you can just check what you're consuming
[00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.880]   and figure out whether or not you're meeting the ration
[00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.520]   that you need in order to get healthy levels of thyroid.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.660]   I also want to mention that for children,
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.740]   their daily requirements of selenium are much lower,
[00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.080]   as low as, you know, 30 or 40 micrograms
[00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.940]   for kids 14 years or younger.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.560]   And again, that's micrograms, not milligrams.
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:32.880]   So again, look into what you need,
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.980]   but if you're somebody who's interested
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:39.980]   in keeping thyroid function healthy and productive,
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:42.060]   then you certainly want to make sure
[00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:43.180]   you're getting enough iodine,
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:45.060]   you're getting enough selenium,
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:46.860]   and you're getting enough L-tyrosine.
[00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:48.340]   And it's interesting when you start looking
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.220]   at the various foods, especially highly processed foods,
[00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:54.100]   then you start to realize that perhaps many people,
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:55.700]   maybe you, are not.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.040]   If you're curious how thyroid actually increases metabolism,
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.420]   allows you to eat more, et cetera,
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:02.660]   it relates to something we covered last issue,
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.140]   which is glucose.
[00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:06.340]   Remember, when you eat something, blood sugar goes up,
[00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.820]   insulin is secreted from the pancreas,
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:10.940]   and it makes sure that blood glucose doesn't go too high,
[00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.940]   which can damage tissues, or too low,
[00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.600]   which can make you hypoglycemic.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.580]   Thyroid increases glucose uptake by various tissues,
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.820]   in particular, muscle and bone.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.180]   It actually can increase bone mineral density,
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:26.180]   which is a really good thing as you get older.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.140]   When I say older, I mean basically 30 and older.
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:31.880]   The reason you can recover more quickly from injuries
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.360]   if you have a healthy thyroid and healthy thyroid pathways
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.780]   is because you can consume energy,
[00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.860]   that energy is diverted toward bone repair
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.100]   and muscle repair and cartilage repair.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:46.840]   And so the way it does this, again, is by increasing ATP,
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.420]   but the whole idea here is that iodine, selenium,
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.900]   L-tyrosine allow thyroid to be at healthy levels
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.220]   so that thyroid then can take glucose in the blood
[00:08:57.220 --> 00:08:59.780]   and divert it to tissues for it to be used,
[00:08:59.780 --> 00:09:01.060]   in particular, your brain.
[00:09:01.060 --> 00:09:03.840]   And that's why the ability of your brain to use glucose
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:05.180]   or ketones, for that matter,
[00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.540]   is going to be aided by having healthy thyroid.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:11.500]   So do the things, take the things, eat the things
[00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.000]   that are going to allow you to have healthy levels
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.460]   of thyroid hormone.
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.200]   If you're concerned about having excessively high
[00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.660]   or excessively low levels of thyroid hormone,
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.020]   absolutely look up what the symptoms are,
[00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:24.940]   talk to your physician.
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:26.640]   And there are a number of good treatments.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.420]   I didn't talk about prescription drugs
[00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.780]   that can improve symptoms related to hypo or hyperthyroid.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:36.260]   Of course, they have synthesized thyroid.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.780]   So if you don't make enough thyroid, you can take thyroid.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:40.220]   It's by prescription.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:42.260]   If you have too much thyroid,
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:44.700]   sometimes they'll take out the thyroid gland
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.880]   or they can administer drugs that will either block
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:51.180]   receptors or will interfere with some of the pathways
[00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:53.180]   from the brain to the pituitary
[00:09:53.180 --> 00:09:55.040]   or from the pituitary to the thyroid
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.780]   in order to adjust thyroid hormone that way.
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:02.180]   So there are the big guns in terms of the treatments
[00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:04.180]   for different thyroid disorders,
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.080]   but we're not talking about thyroid disorders.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.400]   We're talking about how to get and maintain thyroid levels
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.380]   in healthy ranges and some straightforward ways to do that
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:14.400]   through diet and supplementation.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.180]   Next, we're going to talk about growth hormone.
[00:10:17.180 --> 00:10:20.000]   Growth hormone is a pretty straightforward one
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   for you to understand now,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.800]   because it follows the exact same logic as thyroid hormone.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.400]   In fact, their functions are so closely overlapping
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:29.600]   that you're probably going to think,
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.240]   why do you have these two systems?
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:36.240]   So just very briefly, growth hormone releasing hormone.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.420]   So remember, releasing means it comes from the brain,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.680]   comes from the brain and tells the pituitary
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.200]   to release growth hormone.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:44.320]   And then growth hormone is released into the bloodstream
[00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.600]   where it goes and acts on a ton of tissues,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.960]   muscle, ligaments, bone, fat, et cetera.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.520]   To increase metabolism.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:56.020]   It sounds just like thyroid hormone
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.360]   and they do work in parallel.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.620]   And that's why we've lumped them together
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:10:59.460]   in the same episode.
[00:10:59.460 --> 00:11:03.440]   They increase metabolism and repair and growth of tissues.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.060]   Today, we're going to talk about the things
[00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.760]   that anyone can do to increase growth hormone.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.520]   And there are reasons why certain people
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:10.360]   would want to do that.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:13.600]   People that make normal, quote unquote,
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.320]   levels of growth hormone might want to do that as they age,
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.840]   because during puberty and development,
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.720]   the pituitary is churning out tons of growth hormone.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.700]   It's responsible for the growth, not surprising,
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:28.480]   of the body and all its features,
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:31.120]   height just being one of those.
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.940]   And so as we age, we make less growth hormone.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:38.000]   And that is one of the reasons why we recover more slowly
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.120]   from injuries.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.480]   It's one of the reasons why we accumulate body fat.
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.140]   And it's one of the reasons why our metabolism slows.
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:47.660]   And so growth hormone replacement therapy
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.560]   has been tremendously popular in the last 20 years,
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.660]   which is not to say it doesn't carry its problems.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.540]   It does.
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.140]   Here's one of the major problems
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:58.380]   with injecting growth hormone.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:59.820]   Not saying people shouldn't do this
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:01.240]   if the doctor has approved it,
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.900]   or it's in keeping with their particular life goals,
[00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:09.320]   but growth hormone, if it's in levels that are too high,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.440]   will cause growth of all tissues.
[00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:16.020]   So not just muscle, not just reduction in body fat
[00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:20.480]   by metabolizing, by allowing fatty acids
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:23.060]   to be pulled out of storage and used for ATP,
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.140]   but it will also cause increase in growth of the heart
[00:12:27.140 --> 00:12:29.540]   and the lungs and the liver and the spleen.
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:32.980]   And so this is the concern with abuse of growth hormone.
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.820]   So we're not going to be talking
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:35.020]   about abuse of growth hormone.
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.600]   We will, however, talk about tools that anyone can use
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:40.780]   to increase levels of growth hormone.
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:41.820]   Some of them are behavioral,
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:43.520]   some of them are supplement-based,
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:47.180]   and some of them interact with behaviors and supplements.
[00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:50.260]   And what's cool about the discussion about growth hormone
[00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:52.660]   is that the tools that exist out there
[00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.820]   to increase growth hormone are very actionable.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.900]   There are things that can increase growth hormone
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:02.020]   three, four, 500% or more.
[00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:05.140]   And even though that's a short-lived increase,
[00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:07.400]   they can have very powerful effects on metabolism
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.780]   and on repair of tissues.
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:10.020]   So let's talk about those.
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:11.660]   As always, I want to emphasize,
[00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:14.380]   talk to a doctor before you do anything,
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:16.900]   including remove any treatments.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:20.240]   Growth hormone is released every night when you go to sleep,
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.820]   and it's released in the early part of sleep
[00:13:22.820 --> 00:13:24.720]   during so-called slow-wave sleep.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.460]   So the two conditions that have to be met
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:31.860]   in order for growth hormone to be secreted regularly
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.300]   for tissue repair, et cetera,
[00:13:34.300 --> 00:13:37.260]   are you need to get into slow-wave sleep,
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.180]   the so-called deep sleep,
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:44.180]   and you need blood insulin and glucose to be relatively low.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.900]   So eating within two hours of going to sleep
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:48.780]   is going to suppress growth hormone release.
[00:13:48.780 --> 00:13:50.420]   That's very clear.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.580]   So what is special about this early phase of sleep?
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.420]   What in particular about slow-wave deep sleep
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:01.340]   allows the pituitary to release growth hormone?
[00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:05.700]   So the answer is it's a delta wave activity in the brain.
[00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:09.420]   Delta waves are these big, giant waves of activity
[00:14:09.420 --> 00:14:13.020]   in the brain that correlate with slow-wave sleep
[00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:14.620]   as opposed to faster waves of activity
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:17.140]   that associate with rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:14:17.140 --> 00:14:18.740]   It's the delta waves of activity,
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:20.940]   these sweeping big waves of activity in the neurons
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:23.660]   that stimulate the brain to stimulate the pituitary,
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:25.340]   'cause once you understand that,
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.860]   then you have something to anchor to in terms of thinking,
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.580]   what are the things I can do in waking
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.980]   that will allow me to release more growth hormone,
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.380]   which for most people is going to be a good thing.
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:37.100]   Now, the delta wave activity
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.700]   and the slow-wave activity in the brain
[00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.780]   being very important for growth hormone release
[00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:44.860]   and growth hormone release being so important
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.800]   for metabolic functions and peeling away unwanted body fat
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:52.300]   and repairing tissues, et cetera, forces us to ask,
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.820]   well, what other things can we do in waking
[00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.380]   in order to increase growth hormone release?
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:14:59.380]   So let's start with the ones that have
[00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:01.940]   a potentially big effect,
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:03.800]   but are a little bit harder to access.
[00:15:03.800 --> 00:15:06.620]   And for that, I want to point toward a book,
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.140]   which is really kind of interesting.
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:09.900]   It's not focused on growth hormone,
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.380]   but the book is called "Altered Traits."
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:13.880]   This is the book.
[00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.700]   It's an excellent book.
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:18.540]   "Altered Traits" by Goldman and Davidson.
[00:15:18.540 --> 00:15:21.420]   "Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind,
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:22.820]   Brain, and Body."
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.540]   Very interesting book.
[00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.980]   For those of you that are interested in meditation,
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.580]   and perhaps those of you who are not,
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.740]   but are considering it,
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:33.660]   what they talk about in this book is the fact
[00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:36.580]   that meditation has two separate lines of effects.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.820]   One of those lines of effects
[00:15:38.820 --> 00:15:40.660]   are things that change your state.
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:43.320]   So you're stressed, you sit down, you meditate,
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:45.300]   and you relax, and you go into a particular state.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:48.060]   The other are the changes that occur over time,
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.060]   and those are changes in trait.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:52.120]   So personality can actually change
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   with long bouts of TM meditation or repeated meditation.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:59.500]   In any case, the reason we're talking
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.700]   about altered traits today
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.300]   is because certain types of meditation
[00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:09.080]   can get people's brains into states
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.260]   that very closely mimic slow-wave sleep.
[00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.900]   So what this means is for people
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:17.900]   that are interested in increasing growth hormone,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.420]   a meditation practice that allows you to get
[00:16:20.420 --> 00:16:25.420]   into these slow-wave delta-type frequency activity
[00:16:25.420 --> 00:16:29.100]   in the brain may be very beneficial
[00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:30.220]   because, as I mentioned before,
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.380]   that's what's gating growth hormone release.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:34.220]   It's not just a circadian phenomenon.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:37.200]   It's actually controlled by these brain waves.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.860]   Now let's move to the things that one can do
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.380]   that have been shown to have, let's just be honest,
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.340]   pretty enormous effects on growth hormone release in waking,
[00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:49.860]   and these are things that are very actionable.
[00:16:49.860 --> 00:16:52.220]   One of the things that can have a dramatic effect
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:55.020]   on levels of growth hormone release in waking,
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:59.860]   as well as in sleep the following night, is exercise.
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.700]   There are hundreds, if not thousands,
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.140]   of studies measuring growth hormone,
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:08.420]   both during or sometimes after exercise
[00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:10.740]   or the following night.
[00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.180]   And the conclusion that one takes away from all of these
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.780]   is that exercise has to be of particular duration
[00:17:18.780 --> 00:17:21.780]   and intensity in order to get growth hormone release.
[00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.180]   So first, I'm just going to tell you what I found
[00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:26.880]   to be the maximum amount of growth hormone release
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.880]   as it relates to a particular form of exercise.
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:33.200]   The particular form of exercise is either weight training
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:36.800]   or it can be endurance training,
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.120]   but the endurance training and the weight training
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.400]   actually have to be limited to about 60 minutes,
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.420]   not much longer.
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.520]   A proper warmup seems to accelerate
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.380]   the release of growth hormone
[00:17:48.380 --> 00:17:50.760]   once the hard work phase starts.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:54.080]   So 10 minutes of warmup or so was the number
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.860]   that I extracted from all these studies.
[00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:56.840]   And when you say warmup,
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.540]   it doesn't mean just warm up the limbs and tissues
[00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:01.080]   that you're going to use so you don't get injured,
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.920]   actually warm the body.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.780]   Getting the body warm as a warmup seems to be important
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.760]   because temperature of the body
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.000]   seems to be an important condition
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   or prerequisite for certain patterns of exercise
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:14.840]   to maximize growth hormone release.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.760]   So if it's weight-bearing exercise,
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:19.800]   it would be getting close to that final repetitions
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:20.820]   where you can't complete them,
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:23.320]   but not pushing through those or even going to failure,
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:28.060]   but getting close leads to anywhere from 300 to 500%
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:30.620]   increases in resting growth hormone levels
[00:18:30.620 --> 00:18:34.720]   and 300 to 500% increases in growth hormone
[00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.980]   the following night when you go to sleep,
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.960]   which is incredible.
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.380]   One of the other conditions that seemed to be important
[00:18:41.380 --> 00:18:44.420]   again was to have relatively low blood glucose.
[00:18:44.420 --> 00:18:46.980]   So probably not eating too close to exercise
[00:18:46.980 --> 00:18:51.500]   or not ingesting a lot of sugars during the exercise.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:53.500]   That was supported by the fact that ingestion
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:56.560]   of a sports drink that contains caloric sugar
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.440]   immediately flatlined the growth hormone levels.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.400]   So really interesting relationship
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.480]   between insulin, glucose, and growth hormone.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:07.120]   And then the other interesting thing
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.800]   was that even after the exercise,
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.720]   taking body temperature back down to normal levels
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.360]   relatively quickly seemed to be associated
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.360]   with these big spikes in growth hormone.
[00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:20.280]   Otherwise what would happen is you get these big spikes
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:23.200]   in growth hormone, but if the exercise went too long
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:26.000]   or if body temperature remained too high for too long,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.960]   then you didn't get the second increase
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:29.840]   in growth hormone the following night.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:31.040]   Let's talk about supplements.
[00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.640]   So this has been known about for some time,
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.240]   but arginine, the amino acid arginine
[00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:40.980]   can increase growth hormone levels substantially.
[00:19:40.980 --> 00:19:44.520]   The levels and the amounts of arginine required
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:47.480]   to get big growth hormone release increases
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.600]   is pretty substantial.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:51.780]   So some people will take arginine before bedtime.
[00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.640]   Some people will take it before exercise.
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.320]   The prerequisite again is low blood glucose.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:20:01.720]   Blood glucose is high, it's going to quash the effect.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:04.620]   The amounts of arginine that people take
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:09.160]   are anywhere from three grams to 10 grams
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.560]   or sometimes even more.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.480]   Although this is definitely a case of more is not better.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.720]   There is a threshold at which growth hormone release
[00:20:17.720 --> 00:20:19.760]   is actually blunted by taking
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.760]   more than nine grams of arginine.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.600]   Now nine grams of arginine orally is a lot of pills.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:27.920]   It's at minimum nine pills
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:31.540]   and it can cause some GI disturbance, right?
[00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:32.680]   People can feel nauseous.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:34.040]   Some people will throw it up.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:35.480]   What's interesting, however,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:39.840]   is that whether or not it's by mouth or by vein,
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.080]   taking arginine can dramatically increase
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:46.640]   growth hormone release 400 to 600% above baselines.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:50.040]   These are huge increases in growth hormone.
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.120]   Now here is something really important
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.560]   and interesting to note,
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:57.700]   which is that increasing arginine levels
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:01.240]   with the specific goal of increasing growth hormone release
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   can actually short circuit the effects of exercise
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.140]   on growth hormone.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:08.720]   Several studies I looked at,
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.560]   looked at the interaction of taking arginine
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:16.160]   and the exercise or just the arginine
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.560]   or just the exercise alone.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:19.840]   And so you don't, unfortunately,
[00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:21.460]   if growth hormone increases your goal,
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:24.000]   you don't unfortunately get to increase growth hormone
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.640]   800% by taking arginine and exercising.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.440]   It always seems to be clamped at about 300 to 500% increases.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.840]   So hopefully that's clear.
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.520]   One thing that's particularly interesting to me
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:35.280]   as somebody who's in his forties
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:39.920]   is that it's actually between ages 30 and 40
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.400]   that the amount of growth hormone that you release
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.160]   each night is reduced by two to threefold.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.440]   And since everybody goes through
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.480]   this age-related decline very dramatically,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.960]   it seems to me that the things
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:53.440]   that we're supposed to be doing anyway,
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:55.760]   like exercising, like trying not to eat
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:57.680]   too close to bedtime, trying to optimize sleep,
[00:21:57.680 --> 00:21:59.080]   all of these are wonderful tools
[00:21:59.080 --> 00:22:03.520]   that we should be pursuing and perhaps using.
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.200]   And they can actually offset
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.320]   the two to threefold decrease, right?
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.080]   If we're talking about a two to threefold decrease
[00:22:10.080 --> 00:22:12.200]   for people that are in their thirties and forties
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:15.240]   and then we're talking about increases from exercise
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:17.160]   or from maybe from supplementation,
[00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.960]   but certainly from exercise of 300 to 500%,
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:22.960]   well then all of a sudden we're in a position
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:25.160]   to actually offset the age-related decline
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.760]   in growth hormone completely just through behaviors.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:30.960]   And I think that's quite interesting and quite powerful.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.200]   Now I'd like to discuss a way
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.960]   that anyone can increase their levels
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:35.960]   of growth hormone dramatically.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.320]   And when I say dramatically, I mean dramatically.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:40.200]   I'll get to the numbers in a couple minutes,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:44.220]   but we have to remember how growth hormone
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.280]   is released in the first place.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.800]   Remember, it all starts in the brain, in the hypothalamus.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.360]   The hypothalamus is a brain area that controls
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:56.200]   things like sexual behavior, temperature regulation,
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.600]   circadian behavior, meaning when you want to be awake
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.280]   and when you want to be asleep, aggression, all of that.
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.960]   There are other brain areas involved too,
[00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.000]   but it has a rich collection of different neurons
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.680]   involved in all these very basic functions.
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.380]   Now, as we talked about the releasing hormones,
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.720]   the growth hormone releasing hormone
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:19.120]   comes from neurons in the hypothalamus.
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:21.520]   Those then communicate with the pituitary
[00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:24.720]   and the pituitary releases growth hormone
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.000]   and then the growth hormone acts
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:27.120]   on all these different tissues,
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.200]   muscle, liver, cartilage, et cetera, body fat.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:33.040]   Makes them use energy.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.080]   That's why you lose body fat
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:35.680]   when growth hormone levels are high.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:39.280]   It makes you grow muscle, strengthens bones, et cetera.
[00:23:39.280 --> 00:23:45.480]   Now, one of the things that has a profound effect
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.640]   on growth hormone levels,
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:50.600]   growth hormone release is temperature.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.840]   Now, the data on this are very strong
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:55.040]   and the data come from both animal studies
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:56.680]   and human studies.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:00.240]   And if you're guessing which direction this is going to go,
[00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:03.160]   you can probably imagine that making animals
[00:24:03.160 --> 00:24:06.120]   or people warmer is the way to go
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:08.220]   if you want to increase growth hormone.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.960]   Now, anytime you're going to increase temperature
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.680]   of yourself or anyone else or an animal, it is risky.
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.200]   I want to be really clear about this.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.160]   Not everyone should engage in the behaviors
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.080]   I'm about to describe.
[00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:24.120]   But, and I should just say the reason it's risky
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:26.040]   is it doesn't take much of a temperature increase
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:28.800]   in the brain to cook the brain, to cook neurons.
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:31.640]   And after that point, neurons can't come back
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.360]   and people can die from hyperthermia.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:37.640]   However, there are really strong data
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:39.840]   pointing to the fact that sauna,
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:45.840]   aka deliberate hyperthermia, not too high, however,
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:49.260]   that sauna can increase the release of growth hormone
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:50.960]   and other hormones.
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.000]   And what's so dramatic about this literature
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.400]   is the size of the effects that are reported.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.560]   Entering environments where it's very hot
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.760]   for short periods of time,
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.580]   anywhere from 20 minutes to 30 minutes,
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:08.380]   where the temperature is 80 degrees Celsius
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:09.800]   to a hundred degrees Celsius,
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:14.800]   has been shown to increase growth hormone release 16 fold.
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.960]   That's right, 16 fold, that's 1,600%.
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:21.240]   Now, there are also effects on other hormones,
[00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:23.700]   prolactin, cortisol, et cetera.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.160]   So the pattern that was described in this study,
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.960]   and there've been many studies now,
[00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.040]   endocrine effects of repeated sauna
[00:25:32.040 --> 00:25:36.380]   were done in 17 humans.
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.440]   They actually had to do this three days in a row.
[00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:41.680]   And the pattern was to get into the sauna for 20 minutes,
[00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:43.280]   followed by 30 minutes of cooling,
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.760]   followed by 20 minutes sauna again,
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.820]   led to a five-fold increase in growth hormone.
[00:25:47.820 --> 00:25:52.280]   And then by doing that day after day after day,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:53.320]   on the third day,
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.600]   you would see these huge increases of like 16 fold,
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:57.760]   up to 16 fold.
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.080]   But these increases in growth hormone are tremendous.
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:02.280]   And what they probably stem from
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.920]   are increased activity of neurons within the hypothalamus
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:08.840]   that stimulate growth hormone release from the pituitary.
[00:26:08.840 --> 00:26:11.920]   And that's probably because the growth hormone
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:14.740]   releasing hormone neurons in the hypothalamus
[00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.120]   sit very closely and may even be intermixed
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:20.320]   with some of the neurons in the hypothalamus
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:22.800]   that regulate heat and body temperature.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.520]   Remember, metabolism is in part a heat.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.160]   It's like a furnace of how much energy you're consuming
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:33.100]   and using for building or for energy usage purposes.
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:35.640]   So sauna can be very, very interesting.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.140]   And again, it's 20 minutes, 30 minute cooling,
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:42.300]   20 minutes again, proceed with extreme caution.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.240]   But nonetheless, these are pretty extreme effects
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.100]   in terms of their abilities
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.160]   to increase growth hormone levels.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:52.220]   There's a kind of new area that's developing now
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:54.320]   that I think deserves our attention,
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.600]   not because I'm encouraging it,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.040]   but because it is happening.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.560]   And those are peptides.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.120]   So these days you hear a lot about peptides.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.160]   I'd like to clarify a little bit about what peptides are.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:08.980]   Peptides is a really huge category of biological compounds.
[00:27:08.980 --> 00:27:12.080]   Peptides are just strings of amino acids, right?
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.560]   So we've talked about l-tyrosine, arginine, ornithine.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:15.400]   Those are amino acids.
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:16.920]   Those are individual amino acids.
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:21.120]   And those are put together into little small peptides
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:23.380]   or they're what are called polypeptides,
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.180]   which are just longer peptides.
[00:27:25.180 --> 00:27:29.480]   Turns out that for any substance like growth hormone
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.080]   or growth hormone releasing hormone,
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:32.680]   it's made up of different amino acids
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:33.700]   in different sequences.
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:36.800]   Just like your genes are made up of A's and G's
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.200]   and C's and T's, nucleotides in different sequences.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.460]   It's like a recipe.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:46.240]   Peptides tend to be short sequences of amino acids
[00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.920]   that resemble a hormone enough
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:51.600]   or resemble some other peptide enough
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.120]   that it can lead to the similar or same effects
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:55.260]   when you inject them.
[00:27:55.260 --> 00:27:59.480]   So for example, we make growth hormone releasing hormone
[00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:00.320]   from our brain,
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.200]   which stimulates growth hormone from the pituitary.
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:06.680]   But people now will take things like sermorelin,
[00:28:06.680 --> 00:28:11.680]   S-E-R-M-O-R-E-L-I-N, sermorelin,
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.600]   which is not the entire peptide sequence
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.520]   of growth hormone releasing hormone,
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:18.320]   but it's a subset of those.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.880]   Then that stimulates the release of growth hormone
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.000]   from the pituitary.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.240]   So this is not taking growth hormone,
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:26.760]   this is taking the stimulating hormone
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:30.880]   or what's often called a secretagogue or a mimic, all right?
[00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.160]   It causes a secretion of the hormone that one wants.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:36.760]   Sermorelin is prescription.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.160]   Do they work? Yes.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.680]   Do they shut down your natural production
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:44.400]   of growth hormone releasing hormone?
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:47.000]   Well, the answer is yes,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.060]   but some of these peptides actually have the effect
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:52.120]   of changing gene expression.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.060]   Because as you recall,
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.420]   growth hormone in big increases in growth hormone
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:58.680]   that are short-lived like sauna,
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:29:02.200]   or I should say exercise or arginine or sauna,
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:04.160]   it seems like has these huge effects.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:05.960]   Those are transient,
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:09.520]   but when one is injecting over and over a constant level,
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:12.540]   you can put into action gene expression programs
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:13.640]   that can be long-lived.
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.640]   And let's say you have a particular tumor in the body.
[00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:18.800]   Tumors will grow when they see growth hormone,
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.580]   even if that tumor is unhealthy for you, right?
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:23.380]   You've got growth of tissues all over the body.
[00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:25.020]   So again, not promoting their use,
[00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:25.980]   but they're definitely out there.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:27.900]   And so now if you hear about them
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.380]   or if someone's talking to you about them,
[00:29:29.380 --> 00:29:30.940]   now hopefully you have a better understanding
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:32.340]   about their underlying biology,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.500]   and you can think rationally about whether or not
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:37.260]   they are the right decision for you.
[00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:41.540]   Okay, once again, covered an enormous amount of material.
[00:29:41.540 --> 00:29:43.820]   Hopefully now you understand thyroid hormone
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.220]   and what it does and a little bit about its mechanism,
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:47.060]   or maybe a lot,
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.760]   and growth hormone and what it does
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.400]   and how both of them take care of our metabolism.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:55.900]   They dictate how many nutrients we can eat and make use of.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:58.080]   They can pull from body fat stores,
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:29:59.940]   repair muscle, repair cartilage.
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:01.960]   They really are incredible compounds,
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:03.480]   and they're actionable.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:04.420]   There are things that we can do,
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.920]   like getting that early phase of sleep,
[00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:10.080]   perhaps supplementing with arginine, maybe not.
[00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.520]   Hopefully getting adequate exercise,
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.600]   warming up properly,
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:16.520]   not making the exercise too long or too intense will help,
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:18.760]   maybe sauna or things like it,
[00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.720]   you know, deliberate safe hyperthermia,
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:23.000]   with the emphasis on safe,
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:24.480]   might be things that are of use.
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:26.320]   And so now hopefully you understand
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:27.820]   not just thyroid and growth hormone,
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.520]   but the logic that underlies thyroid hormone,
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.140]   growth hormone, estrogen, testosterone,
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:35.240]   why we eat, why we stop eating,
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:37.340]   cholecystokinin, ghrelin.
[00:30:37.340 --> 00:30:39.200]   If these names don't mean anything to you,
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.280]   then perhaps go back and listen to those episodes.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:43.940]   But regardless, I hope that you come away from this
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.680]   with a deeper understanding about these hormones,
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.980]   which are so powerful in controlling
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:50.420]   the way our brain functions,
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:52.820]   and the interplay between the brain and hormones,
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.260]   because it is really a bi-directional conversation.
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:58.380]   The brain is telling the body what hormones to make,
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:00.620]   the hormones are influencing all the tissues of the body,
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.940]   but also telling the brain whether or not to eat more
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:06.100]   or grow more or think more, et cetera.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:08.940]   So I really appreciate your time and attention.
[00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.860]   If you like this podcast and you're finding it useful,
[00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:15.000]   please recommend it to other people.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:16.860]   And last but not least,
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:18.620]   I thank you for your time and attention,
[00:31:18.620 --> 00:31:20.940]   and above all, for your interest in science.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:23.520]   (upbeat music)
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.100]   (upbeat music)
