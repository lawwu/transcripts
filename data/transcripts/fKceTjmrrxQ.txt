[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.640]   - Have you been in a situation, something went wrong?
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.760]   You mentioned your bag got stolen,
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.680]   you've gotten mugged, something like that.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.640]   And like, why didn't that stop you from travel?
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.320]   When I think so many people,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.120]   that's their fear that something bad would happen.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.280]   And if it does happen, they might not wanna travel again.
[00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:23.960]   I have to assume it's happened to you
[00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.720]   and you've kept going.
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.920]   - Yeah, you know, I got stabbed in Columbia.
[00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.920]   Um, and my mother always sends me like,
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.660]   every State Department warning about Mexico.
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.880]   But it's like, hey, like we live in the States.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.460]   People get gunned down going to Walmart, right?
[00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.220]   There are mass shootings all the time in this country.
[00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.400]   Bad things happen, it's just part of life.
[00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:52.920]   It doesn't matter if you're home, or in Mexico,
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.920]   or in Thailand, or in Paris, or Japan, shit happens.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:05.200]   And so what, you know, you can live in fear and say,
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.080]   I'm just gonna never go anywhere.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.960]   But then you walk across the street to a movie theater
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.120]   and then, you know, make it out because it's a psychopath.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.660]   Or you get hit by a car on your way to work, you know?
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.040]   So it's like, are you really gonna live in the fear of a,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.400]   you know, every what if?
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.920]   If so, then like, never leave your house.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.120]   - If you're up for it,
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.280]   I'd love to hear the story in Columbia,
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.180]   and maybe from the perspective of,
[00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.160]   I think a lot of people don't really plan for that.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.120]   And so they don't know what they would do
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.120]   in that circumstance.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.880]   And I imagine, you know, you're here now,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.920]   so it all went well.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.120]   What kind of happened, and how did you know what to do,
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.520]   and where did you end up going,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.480]   and how did the trip unfold after that?
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.000]   - Yeah, I was in Bogota,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.280]   and I had my phone out,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.320]   and long story short,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.000]   you shouldn't have fancy electronics out.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.240]   And I just forgot to put it back in
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.380]   before I left this cafe.
[00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.480]   And so I tried to take it,
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.960]   and he jerked backwards instead of just going forward.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:12.280]   And so like, we started tussling.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.480]   And then, yeah, he had a small little knife.
[00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:16.780]   I thought he was just punching me.
[00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.200]   I mean, if he had like shown the knife,
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.280]   I would've been like, "Yo, take the phone."
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.720]   But afterwards, you know, I was like, "Oh, so sorry."
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.320]   And I was just covered in blood.
[00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.720]   It's 'cause like-
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.040]   - I assume you went to the hospital,
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.440]   and everything was fine?
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.720]   - Yeah, the whole thing cost me like 50 bucks.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.440]   Honestly, like I, you know,
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.680]   the flight home was like a thousand bucks,
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.480]   and I have to reimburse me for that.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.760]   But the, you know, the 50 bucks,
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.400]   I was like, "That's not worth the paperwork."
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.600]   I mean, they could've done it for the 50 bucks,
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.120]   but I did it for the flight.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.080]   - Would you go back to Bogota after that?
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.140]   - Oh, yeah, 100%.
[00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.640]   I love, love Bogota.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.840]   I was really sad to have to go home.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.440]   - Yeah, I've also been to Bogota,
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.880]   and I think especially, I mean, it's just a great place.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.960]   Like, I love the country of Columbia.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.120]   I've been there a few times.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.800]   Bogota is close enough, and no, you know,
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.720]   time zone good enough that I think you could even do it
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.560]   in a long weekend and have a great trip.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.520]   Not that, I don't wanna, you know, not do slow travel,
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.080]   but I think for those who don't have the time to do it,
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.840]   it's still a place that you can go
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.960]   in a short period of time because of the proximity.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.840]   - It's such a phenomenal place.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.120]   I was there for six weeks,
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.320]   and I'm gonna stay in another six weeks.
