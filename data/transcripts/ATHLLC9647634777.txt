[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.500]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks,
[00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.540]   a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.040]   Since it's the beginning of the year, I know many of you, myself included,
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.880]   are thinking a lot about how we can upgrade our health this year.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.300]   To help make that possible, I wanted to invite Dr. Jordan Schlain on the show.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.880]   Jordan is a physician, entrepreneur, publisher, and healthcare systems designer.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   He was one of the early pioneers of concierge medicine
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:32.500]   and is still a practicing primary care doctor through his practice, private medical.
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.960]   I heard Jordan talk about optimizing your health at a conference last year,
[00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.880]   and I have been so excited for this episode ever since he agreed to come on.
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.040]   He has such a wealth of knowledge on health and longevity,
[00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.960]   and we're going to try to cover as much of that as possible,
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.080]   including how you can start taking your health into your own hands,
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.580]   what to look for in a primary care doctor,
[00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.000]   what kinds of tests and diagnostics might make sense to consider,
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.660]   how to think about things like sleep, diet, and exercise, and a lot more,
[00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.920]   including some of his best health hacks.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.420]   So let's jump right in after this.
[00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.240]   (upbeat music)
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.920]   Jordan, welcome to the show.
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.960]   - Thank you, glad to be here.
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.380]   - So I'll kick it off.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.540]   What do you think the state of our current healthcare system is right now?
[00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.760]   - Oh, it's bad.
[00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.200]   It's as bad as it's ever been,
[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.280]   and I think there's a lot of hype that it's gonna get better sometime soon,
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.880]   but it's been 20 years that people have been saying
[00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.920]   we're just about to turn the corner,
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.000]   but we're dealing with a massive cruise liner
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that turns incredibly slow
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.080]   because there's so many vested interests.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.740]   The intellectually honest framing is this is a health insurance system.
[00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.620]   It's not a health care system.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.160]   It's 85% about money and 15% about care,
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.960]   and a lot of hospital CEOs will say,
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.420]   well, no margin, no mission,
[00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.740]   which is a great thing for a capitalist private market company to say,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.240]   'cause if they don't make money, then they do go out of business.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.740]   The thing is, is healthcare, unlike finance, unlike travel,
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.660]   unlike consumer electronics, you can map out the supply chains,
[00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.240]   you can map out the choke points and the efficiencies,
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.820]   and you can really streamline stuff,
[00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.660]   but healthcare was never designed for scale.
[00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.820]   It's always local.
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:10.900]   There's a local person.
[00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.620]   Very few hospitals have a national footprint,
[00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.620]   so fundamentally, they have different buyers,
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.360]   different supply chains, different plans,
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:17.740]   different states, different regulations,
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:18.900]   so it's not an ecosystem.
[00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.240]   It's a frico system, which is you can't peel back the onion
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.480]   and get other layers of an onion.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.200]   You may get a tomato in there, you may get a grapefruit.
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.660]   Like every time you peel something back,
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.280]   there's things in there that are legacy systems that were built upon.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.400]   They're not streamlined and thorough and simple
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.980]   in the way that most other industries are.
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.020]   So the state of the system today is it's kind of like an every person for themselves,
[00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.060]   and you're reliant on the insurance world.
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.780]   Everybody has insurance.
[00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.440]   But I'll say that if you're a person that wants to get good healthcare,
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:53.700]   well, it's local.
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.900]   You have to look around and what's there.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.360]   There's not a lot of choice in medicine.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.240]   You have free will when you have your wallet to go buy what you want,
[00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.280]   and healthcare, I call it tethered will.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.240]   If you have a big cut on your arm,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.560]   you don't get to go shopping to which store to go to.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.660]   You're going to go to the closest one.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.160]   You're not even paying for it.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.780]   So it's not even your resource.
[00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.440]   This is called in economics, the principal agent problem,
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.980]   where you pay a third party, they pay somebody else.
[00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.240]   So the person that you're receiving the good or service from, you didn't pay.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.820]   They don't feel aligned necessarily because you put your hardworking money into it.
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.060]   It may be your employer's money.
[00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.320]   I would say one of the biggest problems is this principal agent problem.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   But going back to the story with your headache,
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.780]   so then you see the doctor, they give you some morphine in the ER
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:37.820]   because it's a terrible headache.
[00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:39.520]   Then you go home and the morphine wears off.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.820]   You still have your headache.
[00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.520]   So you just went to go get something, and you came back, and it's not better.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.320]   Or it's 50% better.
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.780]   Now you have to figure out what to do.
[00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.580]   So you call your primary care doctor, that's a two-week wait.
[00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.060]   So then you ask Dr. Google and he or she basically comes back with that could be cancer.
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.380]   So now you're super anxious, right?
[00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.640]   And so the whole system is not designed.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.420]   There was no designer.
[00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:10.400]   It's a patch on top of a patch on top of a patch where the money continues to flow through
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.780]   multiple middle people that like take their sliver of the money.
[00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.680]   And it's not getting any better to answer the question.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.440]   I've been building my model outside of the existing system, trying to create a new design.
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.800]   Like I've designed this and we'll get into that later from scratch, which is how do you
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:33.680]   honor both the doctor and the patient and the data in an elegant way to try to achieve
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.580]   the best outcome the fastest.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.600]   And I should only get paid on that.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.400]   And I want the person to pay me for that.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:43.200]   Now if they need an MRI, that's what the insurance is for.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.280]   I should help them get the best MRI place.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.600]   I should be the one to be their quarterback around how to receive that care.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:56.200]   But really what the Affordable Care Act did, and I think this is lost on most people, is
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.680]   it set the incentive for the doctors or the medical groups or the people that own the
[00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.360]   medical groups to get a fixed amount of money per problem.
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.160]   For example, right now if you have a heart failure, and maybe we could take the guy Demar
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.040]   Hamlin as an example, right?
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:15.300]   He's a young healthy guy.
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.800]   He had a cardiac arrest.
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.800]   This is for those of you who don't know, NFL football, primetime Monday Night Football
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.840]   the other night, he fell down and they were doing CPR.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.640]   I'll use him as a quasi example, but this isn't gonna be exact.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.640]   The place that he gets taken care of says, "Hey, for everybody with a cardiac arrest,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:33.200]   you get $10,000 to get him out of the hospital and get him home."
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.720]   It used to be, "Hey, every day he stays there, you get $3,000 in the ICU, you get all the
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:42.320]   money you want, whatever prescription you write, you get paid for."
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.440]   So the sicker you get or the more transactions there are, the more money the system gets.
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.640]   So there's no incentive to get that guy out fast.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.440]   Now the doctors, my people, we of course are healers.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.920]   We want this guy to get better.
[00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.920]   We want him to get better fast.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.240]   We want to make all the right decisions at the right time for the right reason.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.600]   The truth is there's this overlay of, "Hey, if we keep him here a little bit longer,"
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   I'm not saying that...
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:07.080]   I think Cincinnati has got an amazing hospital system that they would do that, but in a lot
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.520]   of systems that you don't hear about where there's no oversight, they'll just keep somebody
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.300]   there for days and there's not a financial incentive to get them healthy as fast as possible.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.520]   So the Affordable Care Act created this thing called the Accountable Care Organization,
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:23.980]   which is we're gonna start going with specific conditions and saying, "This is the money
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:24.980]   you get."
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.960]   The incentives will be aligned around good outcomes yield good incomes.
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:35.080]   Right now, it's bad outcomes yield good incomes, sadly, for the healthcare industry.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:39.200]   And I think that is a fundamental problem.
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.960]   And there are so many middlemen, Chris, that make a little vig off of that dollar when
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.200]   you don't do well.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.560]   From the person that sells gloves to the person that has the billing software, there's so
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.580]   much waste and fraud.
[00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.260]   I would say train AI on fraud and you probably save a ton of money because it's just there
[00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:58.260]   in spades.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.840]   I would say one other thing is that with the advent of digital health, now you have fragmentation
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:06.680]   of medical specialty things.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.800]   So if you wanna go get a SIBO test 'cause you think you have bacterial overgrowth 'cause
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.800]   you have some bowel problems, you can go online and order a SIBO test, okay?
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.320]   You get the results, they'll tell you what to do and you're managing SIBO, which is like
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:20.760]   a condition of gas bloats and cramps and can cause fatigue.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:23.880]   So you have this fragment and no one's orchestrating everything.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:28.140]   So now you have little windows of things that you can solve.
[00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.160]   But John Muir, who is a famous explorer naturalist in America, and I'd say he said, "When you
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.640]   tug on a single thing in nature, you realize it's connected to everything else."
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.360]   And in medicine, what I can tell you is if you have SIBO or if you have migraines or
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:48.560]   if you have whatever, eczema, there are probably multiple factors that need to come together
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:54.280]   to help solve that without pills, without injections, without interacting with the medical
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.280]   system.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.840]   There's so much that you can do on your own.
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.200]   I like to say, how do you become independently healthy?
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:02.880]   And ultimately, health is what you can do for yourself.
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:08.280]   And what healthcare is, when you can't do it for yourself, you must reach out to somebody
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.760]   that can help you navigate the kind of the thicket of the healthcare system.
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:19.280]   It sounds like the providers are less incentivized financially to do whatever they think might
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.120]   be the best thing because the insurance company is the payer, you have this principal-agent
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.120]   problem.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:28.020]   There are certain treatments, by the way, that will most likely be covered and won't.
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:33.680]   So to recommend someone do something that they probably can't afford or won't get covered
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.600]   by their insurance is probably not going to happen.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.540]   But you don't even know that a priori.
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.680]   You can recommend something and only later do they find out it's not covered.
[00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:44.280]   And then that patient has to go back to the doctor and say, "That wasn't, again, no design,
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   no elegance.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   It's a shit show."
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:49.520]   And then kind of highlighted that the most important thing might be that everything in
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:50.600]   your health seems connected.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.680]   So this idea of your primary care physician seems as important as it ever was.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:00.120]   But at least in my personal experience, it's been tough to find someone in the conventional
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:06.360]   medical care system that's covered by my insurance that actually wants to play that role of discovering
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.020]   what's wrong and trying to figure it out and being aware of all the latest medical research
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.020]   and all that.
[00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:15.080]   So I guess maybe the question is, there's one end of the spectrum, which you've started
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:19.720]   your own practice, which is not accessible to everyone, but gives you that quarterback
[00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.880]   that can kind of go through that process.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:25.920]   What are people who are not at the point that's the right fit for them?
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   Where should they start?
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   Great question.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.320]   So my framework in general for every person is, first of all, do you know everything about
[00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:34.320]   yourself?
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   Biologically and physiologically?
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:36.320]   What do you know?
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.480]   Do you know what your blood pressure is?
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:39.040]   Do you know what your cholesterol is?
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:40.560]   Do you know what your family history is?
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:44.440]   Do you know what your genetic susceptibility to things are?
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:45.440]   What do you know?
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:46.440]   And what do you not know?
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.440]   A lot of people don't want to know.
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.720]   "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:49.720]   I don't see it.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:50.720]   I'm just going to live my life."
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.720]   And blah, blah, blah.
[00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:52.720]   Great.
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   They're gambling.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.200]   And if you're young and healthy and there's nothing wrong in your family, probably pretty
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.460]   safe bet nothing bad is going to happen to you.
[00:09:58.460 --> 00:10:01.440]   But then you always read in the paper about the sporadic person with nothing wrong and
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:04.200]   they just died of whatever, or they got cancer at 35.
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.540]   Those are the headlines that scare people, but they're true.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.740]   And why would you not, with not a lot of investment, learn everything you can about yourself to
[00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:18.300]   make informed, proactive decisions to keep yourself optimized and not have to use the
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:21.320]   healthcare system for the rest of your life, if you could?
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:24.980]   If you wanted to walk through someone who maybe is thinking right now, "I haven't really
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.020]   taken my health seriously.
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:30.620]   What should I go and either do myself or ask my doctor to help me do?"
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.140]   You could go to quest.com, which it's a lab.
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.740]   By the way, anything I mentioned here, no conflicts of interest for me.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.260]   I don't have any vested interest in anything.
[00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.660]   But Quest Labs and line up the 10 other competitors to them, you can go online and order blood
[00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:46.020]   tests and some states and cities will come to your house, they'll charge your insurance,
[00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:49.020]   they may charge you a convenience fee to do it online, who knows.
[00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:52.740]   By the way, just a thing that I found, I have no affiliation with this company, but I was
[00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.900]   looking at some tests that I wanted to run that weren't covered by insurance.
[00:10:55.900 --> 00:11:01.460]   And there's this site, ultalabtests.com, which basically sends the same order to Quest at
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.040]   like a third of the price.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.140]   So if someone doesn't find something covered, I just went to Quest and got the exact same
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.100]   test done, but it was just less expensive.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.580]   I'm not sure how that whole system works.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.180]   Well, look, I mean, the dirty little secret here is when I have a patient who like, let's
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:17.820]   say lost their insurance, doesn't have insurance.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:21.400]   And I say, go to Quest and order a cholesterol test, it could be $200.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:24.900]   But if I order it under my account, it's like $20.
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.980]   So like there's massive margin here because there's opacity and no transparency in this
[00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:30.980]   system, even MRIs.
[00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:35.300]   I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but let's just say you wanted to do the most thorough
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.140]   baseline understanding of who you are in the world, right?
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:42.220]   And you were willing to spend a chunk of change just to get to know yourself.
[00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:47.980]   Well, one of the things that you would consider is getting a brain MRI with a brain MRA.
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:50.220]   And I'll tell you a story about a guy that I did that on, and it turns out something
[00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.220]   happened to him.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:54.800]   So I'm so glad we had a baseline test to compare it to, because otherwise you're flying blind.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:58.900]   The problem with doing tests like that, a lot of doctors will say, well, you're going
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:01.700]   to find things on there that don't mean anything.
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.920]   Like if you did an MRI of a spine of every 50-year-old, they all look like shit.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:07.220]   And then everyone, oh my God, I'm falling apart.
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:11.700]   No, that's just natural aging, but we haven't calibrated normal to not normal yet.
[00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:14.060]   It's like everything's abnormal if it's not perfect.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:19.380]   But at age 24, it's perfect unless it isn't, but everything decays over time.
[00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:24.440]   So the MRI that I would order on somebody that really wanted - the MRA shows you the
[00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:28.940]   blood vessels, like three-dimensional blood vessels of your brain, because if you have
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.440]   an aneurysm in your brain, the typical way you find out about them is on autopsy.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.740]   Your aneurysm burst and then you fell down and unless you're close to a hospital, you're
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.740]   dead.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:39.740]   They're very rare, but you catch them on some people.
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:44.340]   But if you ordered that MRI and you walked into the place, it could be $10,000.
[00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:48.180]   If I order it through my system, like through the private pay, it's $400.
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:53.260]   You get the same outcome, you're just like getting hoodwinked by something you didn't
[00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:54.260]   even know.
[00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:57.340]   So that's the opacity factor that a lot of people have been trying to tackle, but there's
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:01.020]   a whole lot of people that don't want that opacity to be known because it's going to
[00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:06.160]   expose all these facets of the shenanigans and the chicanery that goes on behind the
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.500]   scenes to make the profits.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:11.740]   But to answer your question specifically, what would you do if you were a regular person
[00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:12.740]   that just wanted to know?
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:15.420]   So you do like what's called a CBC, a complete blood count.
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:17.580]   You want to know what your immune system looks like.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.480]   Do you have enough blood in the tank?
[00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:22.700]   There are some women that because they have heavy periods, they're anemic and they don't
[00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:24.500]   know it, but they have low energy and they don't know it.
[00:13:24.500 --> 00:13:28.000]   So you'd want to like get a baseline on where you are, whether you're anemic or not.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.340]   You'd want to get like a chemistry panel.
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:33.500]   And again, these are all like almost archaic, but they're the standard of care.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.560]   You'd want to get your cholesterol and there's like a basic cholesterol, then there's a cardio
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:42.700]   IQ test, which is a much more sophisticated cholesterol test that will tell you your APO
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.180]   and your LDL fractionations and all sorts of bits and pieces that will give you a little
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:48.140]   more color on should you be concerned or not.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:52.940]   From a blood work standpoint, I like to check at least once your Westergren sed rate, which
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:59.380]   it's a very nonspecific test, but it shows what level of inflammation there is in your
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.380]   body.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.860]   Again, it's a crude inflammatory marker.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.660]   And I'll just pause and talk about something called inflammation.
[00:14:05.660 --> 00:14:09.300]   The more inflammation you have in your body, chronic inflammation, the faster you age.
[00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:13.500]   So one's goal in life should be to have a body that's not inflamed inside.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.320]   Now when you cut your finger or you bang up your something, you see the inflammation visible.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:22.540]   But when your whole body's subclinically inflamed, which can be caused by great stress from a
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:27.940]   bad relationship, it could be caused by untreated subclinical Crohn's disease, or we could talk
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.940]   about a lot of things.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   You're just aging faster.
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:31.300]   You will have problems later in life.
[00:14:31.300 --> 00:14:33.780]   And so if you try to go to your future self, what would you want to know today?
[00:14:33.780 --> 00:14:38.180]   So the sed rates one, there's something called an HS, high-sensitivity CRP, cardioreactive
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.180]   protein.
[00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:40.840]   Again, another measure of inflammation.
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:43.820]   These are all, I'll call blood test 1.0.
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:48.400]   There's a whole new set of tests, Chris, we can talk about, metabolomics, proteomics.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:52.380]   There's all these new companies coming online that are creating much more sophisticated,
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:54.180]   much more sensitive tests.
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:59.100]   Those still cost 500 bucks because they're new startups and they don't have scale yet,
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:00.320]   but those will come down.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.900]   If you're over 50, there's a cancer test called GRAIL.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:05.880]   It's called gallery, checks for 42 types of cancers.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:11.380]   It's 960 bucks right now, but you have a family history of cancer, I recommend you probably
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:12.380]   do that every year.
[00:15:12.380 --> 00:15:15.940]   I just caught a 38-year-old guy with a mother and a grandmother with stomach cancer.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:20.200]   I checked him at 38, colon cancer, positive, stage two, surgery, chemo.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:24.260]   He just got his test back yesterday, cancer-free two years later, saved his life.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.500]   You don't normally get a colonoscopy until you're 45.
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:27.500]   So he's 38.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.400]   He would be dead by the time of his first colonoscopy.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.100]   So you have to like risk adjusting.
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.100]   Who are you?
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:33.260]   What are the tests that you should get?
[00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:34.740]   You should know what your blood pressure is.
[00:15:34.740 --> 00:15:37.180]   And by the way, checking your blood pressure one, does it count?
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:40.300]   The real way to understand what your blood pressure is, you have to check it 17 times
[00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:42.580]   at different times of the day in one month.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:45.620]   Put them on a spreadsheet, average them out, that's your blood pressure.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:46.620]   What should it be?
[00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:49.180]   It should be below 120/80 most of the time.
[00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:52.540]   If you just went on a run, had coffee, had sex, got in a fight, it can be higher.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:53.540]   That's normal.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:55.980]   Your blood pressure is supposed to get up to be high because we have a lot of resilience
[00:15:55.980 --> 00:15:56.980]   in our system.
[00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:01.080]   But at baseline, at regular, it should be like 120/80 or less.
[00:16:01.080 --> 00:16:02.700]   So those are some basic blood tests.
[00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:06.820]   A lot of this stuff has to do about what age you are and what your risk factors are.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:10.780]   So if you got a family history of heart disease, my mom had a heart attack or dad, something
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.180]   like that, then you're going to want to like start doing these tests earlier.
[00:16:13.180 --> 00:16:16.580]   And if you have high cholesterol and a family history, you should think about something
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:21.380]   called a calcium score, which is a CAT scan that gives you a lot more data on whether
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.580]   the cholesterol - because remember, there's different genetic types of people.
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.660]   Some people can have high cholesterol all their life and never have a heart problem.
[00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:31.820]   Some people can have like moderately high cholesterol and have a heart problem.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.220]   So you have to identify which one are you in the world.
[00:16:34.220 --> 00:16:35.940]   Like you're not like everybody else.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.940]   You're unique.
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:39.780]   Part of it's your family history, part of it's your genetics and part of it's your lifestyle
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:40.780]   or health style.
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.860]   And so, how you exist in the world depends on the probability that one of these things
[00:16:45.860 --> 00:16:47.260]   that could happen does happen.
[00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:51.020]   So those are some baseline testing, just simple blood tests, blood pressure.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:55.220]   I would say check thyroid, gland, a TSH, that's a basic blood test.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:57.180]   Just a good one time to know.
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.500]   Men should probably be getting PSA checks and prostate exams after the age of 50 on
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:03.180]   somewhat of a regular basis.
[00:17:03.180 --> 00:17:06.500]   If there's a family history of getting prostate cancer in their 50s, then you should start
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:07.500]   doing that much earlier.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.040]   Like again, the blood test.
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:12.020]   But a lot of these things require both experience and math.
[00:17:12.020 --> 00:17:15.220]   And the good news is with AI right now, pretty soon you'll be able to plug in all sorts of
[00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:17.340]   stuff about yourself and it'll tell you what tests you should do.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.700]   And if those tests say this, then you should do that.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:21.180]   So that's kind of this future.
[00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.740]   The question is, how do you execute that?
[00:17:22.740 --> 00:17:23.780]   I'll share one example.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.860]   So I used and now partnered with this company InsideTracker.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:33.940]   And it's basically do blood work and they go in and share you a lot of the data about
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:38.240]   where's the standard range, what's your range, what are recommendations from our team of
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:41.860]   researchers that say what you should do, link out to the research.
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:46.820]   But that's one thing I did and I did the genetic profile there so they can kind of adjust things
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:48.420]   based on what they learn about your genetics.
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:52.020]   So that's one option that I've used and we partnered with.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:55.660]   So you're talking about genetics vis-a-vis like a health problem.
[00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:57.460]   There's another set of genetics coming online.
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:17:58.980]   And by the way, there's a company called Invitae.
[00:17:58.980 --> 00:17:59.980]   They're one of the bigger ones.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:04.420]   They do the panel of I don't know how many genes, but they check for genes that like
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:07.660]   tell you what your probability of getting something is, which then can inform what your
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.040]   surveillance program should be.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.540]   So they've got a good panel.
[00:18:10.540 --> 00:18:16.860]   But then there's a company, again, I'm just gonna name various companies, called Oneome,
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.460]   that does pharmacogenetics.
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.460]   So what's that?
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:22.980]   Because of COVID and because a lot of mental health issues, a lot of people are taking
[00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.540]   antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs.
[00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.140]   We can talk about psychedelics later because a lot of people are doing that too.
[00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:34.860]   But we can tell you through, again, this science is, I'll say 75%, but it's better than 0%.
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.980]   So a lot of doctors will say, "I'm not gonna do that test because it's not 98%."
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:42.660]   I'm like, "Well, would you take 75% over zero?
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:45.540]   Right now, when someone is depressed, I'll try this drug.
[00:18:45.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   Oh, that doesn't work.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.540]   I'll try that drug.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:48.540]   Oh, that doesn't work.
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:49.540]   I'll try that drug."
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:52.220]   Well, with pharmacogenetics, they can kind of look at the processing power of your enzymes
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:57.220]   with respect to certain genes, and they can tell you, "Hey, this drug is probably not
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.860]   gonna work as well because it's cleared so fast," or, "This drug will work better."
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:07.180]   So if you're gonna embark on a kind of pharmacologic adventure to try to solve a problem, this
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:11.580]   is called precision medicine, we're getting better at being able to pick the right drug
[00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:12.940]   the first time.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:17.560]   And that's through this venue called pharmacogenomics, which is, again, still new.
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:21.140]   The existing medical system is very slow to move, like I said at the beginning at the
[00:19:21.140 --> 00:19:23.700]   top of the podcast, and a lot of doctors won't do it.
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.100]   A lot of insurance companies won't pay for it because the proof isn't there yet.
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:31.820]   And so, they usually require five years of proof and data to do the analysis to show
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.300]   that this cost has a future cost benefit.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:36.300]   And that's kind of the...
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.820]   Which by the way, you want that science and you want that rigor.
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.260]   In technology, it's move fast and break things.
[00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:44.700]   And in medicine, it's move slow and don't hurt people.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.900]   So we do want it to move slow a little bit, but every 120 days, Chris, there's a new major
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:53.220]   breakthrough in medicine that like most of the medical field won't like know about for
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:57.080]   10 years because they're so busy with the innovations from the last five years.
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:03.180]   There's this natural lag that any doctor has, or any clinic has.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.460]   I hold myself out and we hold ourselves out as there's no lag.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:09.220]   All these companies are presenting to me.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:13.660]   Every other week, I've got kind of a speed dating type of companies present to my group
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:17.500]   of six of our doctors and we kind of like, "Does it pass the sniff test?
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:18.780]   Is it valuable to patients?
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:21.220]   Is it not like super expensive?
[00:20:21.220 --> 00:20:22.220]   Does it work?
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:23.220]   And then what is the science?
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:24.220]   And is it peer-reviewed?
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:25.220]   Is it validated?"
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:28.420]   There's a lot of people hawking a lot of stuff that's like super on the margin and on the
[00:20:28.420 --> 00:20:29.420]   bubble.
[00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:32.900]   And there's a ton of gurus, especially in the longevity space, talking about how if
[00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:35.540]   you just take this or do that, like off you go.
[00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:36.900]   But there's no proof.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:37.900]   There's just no proof.
[00:20:37.900 --> 00:20:41.820]   So I generally think about just to go to that place really quick, everything should be looked
[00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:44.620]   at through the lens of safety and efficacy.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:48.420]   And if it's safe and it's proven safe and there's ways to prove that things are safe
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:55.180]   or not, and it's not yet proven to be efficacious, thinking longevity, well, take a flyer.
[00:20:55.180 --> 00:20:56.980]   You're just gambling with your money, right?
[00:20:56.980 --> 00:20:57.980]   Why not?
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:58.980]   Like maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.860]   But if you are going to do something that doesn't have a safety profile that is like
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:06.360]   really robust, I mean, this is your body, this is your health asset, this is your life.
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:10.980]   If you're going to take a flyer and gamble on the safety piece, because by the way, if
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:13.900]   we're not sure it's safe, we're not sure if it's effective, then you're gambling with
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:14.900]   your health.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.460]   I call that short brevity or long brevity.
[00:21:17.460 --> 00:21:19.740]   It's not longevity, it's long brevity.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:22.820]   You are just kind of hoping that it works.
[00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:26.900]   My philosophy is, hey, wait a couple of years, let the science tell you the story.
[00:21:26.900 --> 00:21:30.960]   Don't rush into gambling with your health because if it does work and you missed it
[00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:36.740]   by two years, okay, that's two extra weeks when you're like 99 to 99 and two weeks old.
[00:21:36.740 --> 00:21:42.060]   Like right now, you don't want to be mucking up with your system that can make it 99 to
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:46.380]   like maybe you make it to 82 because you created all this other problems.
[00:21:46.380 --> 00:21:50.180]   My job is to look at the science and I'm not well loved by a lot of people because I'm
[00:21:50.180 --> 00:21:52.340]   not making money on anything.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.220]   Everyone else is making money on the things that they're pitching.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:59.540]   So it puts me in opposition in some ways to things that are being pitched.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:04.060]   So I am quite comfortable right now, which is actually true almost every day and that's
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:08.040]   thanks to Viore and I'm excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:11.620]   They make performance apparel that's incredibly versatile.
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:15.540]   Everything is designed to work out in, but it doesn't look or feel like it at all and
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:17.260]   it's so freaking comfortable.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.980]   You will want to wear it all the time.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:23.300]   Seriously, I am pretty sure it's more comfortable than whatever you're wearing right now, unless
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:26.300]   you're wearing Viore, in which case you already know what I mean.
[00:22:26.300 --> 00:22:27.980]   And it's not just for men.
[00:22:27.980 --> 00:22:30.800]   My wife is as obsessed with Viore as I am.
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:33.300]   My favorite is the Sunday performance joggers.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:38.020]   I think I have three pairs and they are probably the most comfortable pants I've ever owned.
[00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:42.340]   Their products can be used for just about any activity, whether it's running, training,
[00:22:42.340 --> 00:22:43.340]   or yoga.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:47.460]   They're also great for lounging, running around town, or their MetaPants can even work for
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.460]   a night out.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.860]   Honestly, I think Viore is an investment in your happiness.
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:56.260]   And for all the Hacks listeners, they are offering 20% off your first purchase, as well

[00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:19.820]   versatile clothing on the planet.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.300]   I wish I could say that I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality is
[00:23:24.300 --> 00:23:26.100]   that I am definitely not.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:31.140]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why I kickstart
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:35.980]   my day with Athletic Greens, and I am excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:39.900]   I started taking it because I wanted to see what all the hype was about, and I've kept
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.740]   it in my daily routine for months.
[00:23:42.740 --> 00:23:47.100]   Every morning, I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes, it tastes so good
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:51.820]   when it's cold, and I head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day, which is
[00:23:51.820 --> 00:23:54.340]   a feeling I absolutely love.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:59.860]   I also love that it's made from 75 high-quality vitamins, minerals, and superfoods, and contains
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.100]   less than one gram of sugar.
[00:24:02.100 --> 00:24:06.260]   It also has no GMOs, nasty chemicals, or artificial anything.
[00:24:06.260 --> 00:24:11.420]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:16.920]   of immune-supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:19.860]   All you have to do is visit allthehacks.com/athleticgreens.
[00:24:19.860 --> 00:24:28.180]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/athleticgreens to take ownership over your health and pick
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.380]   up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:35.500]   Let's run through a couple of the lifespan things and just get your take on them.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:39.920]   One of the most well-proven and well-known things for longevity is social integration,
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:44.340]   is having healthy relationships that are repeated in long-term.
[00:24:44.340 --> 00:24:45.340]   Are you in a book club?
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.540]   Do you go on walks with the same people?
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:51.620]   We often think that the body and the mind are different things, but they're the same
[00:24:51.620 --> 00:24:52.620]   thing.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:56.820]   That's like saying my computer screen and my computer chip in the thing are different.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:25:01.160]   Well, they are, but the output is like one breaks, the other one - you need both.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:06.380]   And so the brain is what can cause inflammation in the body by stress or by angst or by not
[00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.980]   sleeping well or by having bad eating habits or by drinking too much because you're stressed.
[00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:14.980]   So this level of stress kind of goes down with social integration because your people,
[00:25:14.980 --> 00:25:19.500]   they call your bullshit in a way that you've kind of come to tolerate and realize that
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:23.380]   you need people to guide you and to be sounding boards so that you're not just looking for
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:27.100]   more likes on Twitter or getting super bummed out when you get like a criticism somewhere.
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:32.220]   I just also did a podcast with Eric Verdon, who's the CEO of the Buck Institute on how
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.940]   to live to 95 super healthy, and we go through a number of different strategies to do that.
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:40.020]   Spoiler alert, it's not rocket science right now.
[00:25:40.020 --> 00:25:45.820]   He's doing a lot of research on stuff molecularly, cellular senescence, mitochondrial decay,
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:48.040]   telomeres, oxidative stress.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.980]   They're doing a lot of that research, but he'll even tell you we're not there yet.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:52.180]   And then there's stem cells.
[00:25:52.180 --> 00:25:55.960]   And I think when we think of longevity, we have to think about like, well, my eyes may
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.500]   age faster than my heart.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:25:59.980]   My liver may age faster than my kidneys.
[00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:03.660]   So longevity is like almost organ-specific and most people don't think like that.
[00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:07.180]   But the spoiler alert is, and a study came out literally, I think it was yesterday.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:14.140]   A big study over lots of years and lots of people that water, hydration - by the way,
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.820]   we all know this.
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:19.060]   Everybody knows that like, as my father used to say, the solution to pollution - I see
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:22.300]   you drinking now - the solution to pollution is dilution.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.940]   Water is a critical aspect of life and if you stop drinking for three days, you're dead.
[00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:26.940]   Let me just put a really fine point.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.860]   If you stop drinking for three days, you're dead.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:32.940]   If you stop eating, you can go on a hunger strike for a month or longer before you're
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.940]   dead.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.660]   Without water, you're dead in three days, which is why all these people in the hospital
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:39.180]   are getting IVs and they never die.
[00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:41.060]   You stop the water, they're dead.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.980]   You go out in the forest, there's all these animals out there that you can't see and can't
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:47.220]   hear if you're camping and there's animals dying everywhere.
[00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:48.220]   You don't hear screams.
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:49.220]   You don't hear moans.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:50.220]   They're not in pain.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.220]   Why?
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.200]   Because the body has come up with a very elegant mechanism for death by no water.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.220]   As soon as you start not drinking, what happens is your kidneys which filter all the stuff
[00:27:01.220 --> 00:27:04.740]   in your body, the level of nitrogen in your body which normally gets filtered, the more
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.340]   you drink, the more nitrogen goes out.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:09.420]   I mean, sodium and chloride, there's all sorts of things the kidney does, I'm being simplistic
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:10.420]   here.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:14.180]   But the levels of nitrogen start to go up in your body, they get more concentrated.
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:16.540]   They're not being diluted, they're being concentrated.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:20.540]   So, the higher the nitrogen is, if you've ever had nitrous oxide, you kind of get whoa,
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:21.820]   kind of numb and happy.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:22.820]   It's the same thing.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:27.820]   So, when you stop drinking, you start to get like kind of - it's like a morphine-like state
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:31.120]   where you kind of get happy and numb and things are kind of gleeful.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:34.820]   Now, not to suggest that if you've got like terrible pain and stop drinking, like that's
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.820]   a solution.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:41.020]   But people at the end of life that aren't like suffering with any painful thing, like
[00:27:41.020 --> 00:27:42.500]   they stop drinking and then they die.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:48.300]   And it's a very kind of dignified biological process that like biology has figured out
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:49.300]   for a long time.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:51.060]   They don't want death to be super painful.
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:53.780]   I say they, I don't know who they is, but like nature, biology.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.020]   So, hydration is like a really important thing.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:57.700]   And so, how do you know if you're drinking enough?
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:00.380]   They've got smart cups, they've got like all this new gadgets.
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:01.660]   Hey, real simple.
[00:28:01.660 --> 00:28:05.720]   If you're not going to the bathroom three times a day or more while you're awake, you're
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720]   not drinking enough.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.860]   And you don't need to overdo it.
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:10.700]   I think you should always have a glass of water around, you know, you shouldn't be chugging,
[00:28:10.700 --> 00:28:11.700]   you should be drinking.
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.660]   And I think the part two to that is alcohol.
[00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:15.780]   Like we know alcohol is a pro-aging substance.
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:19.340]   So, if you're one of these anti-aging people and you drink alcohol, well, then you're going
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:24.140]   to take some silver bullet pill that you heard about from somebody and then you're going
[00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.740]   to go out and have like a bunch of cocktails and go to Vegas.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:31.100]   You actually have to like think long-term and what these episodes of alcohol does.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:35.180]   But if you are going to drink alcohol, which most people do, glass of wine, put a glass
[00:28:35.180 --> 00:28:38.880]   of water in front of it and put a glass of water after it because then you're diluting
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:41.860]   the alcohol's impact because alcohol dehydrates you.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:45.700]   So, the concentration of alcohol molecules in your body is higher an hour after you drink
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:46.700]   it than it was before.
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.020]   So, if you drink lots of water before and after, it doesn't get a chance to concentrate
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:51.380]   and cause problems.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.100]   Sleep, super important one.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:55.820]   I wear an Oura ring and I see you do too.
[00:28:55.820 --> 00:28:57.220]   I measure my sleep every day.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:02.500]   I've been getting 90s scores on both ends since January 1st when I stopped traveling
[00:29:02.500 --> 00:29:05.220]   and my goal is to keep above 90 like all the time.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:08.740]   I have patients that are like, "Yeah, I'm in the 60s, I think it's great because I was
[00:29:08.740 --> 00:29:09.740]   in the 40s."
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:11.780]   And I was like, "Holy moly, 40s?"
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.580]   I think a lot of people think that like I'll sleep when I'm dead, I'll have plenty of time
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.580]   for that but the truth is if you don't sleep now, you're going to die much sooner and so
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:20.580]   you'll have less time.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.220]   And one of the hacks for me is I need eight hours of sleep.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:26.540]   In fact, I got like almost nine last night but you should figure out when you want to
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:29.260]   wake up and you should set your alarm clock to go to bed.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.260]   You should never set your alarm clock to wake up because when you set your alarm clock to
[00:29:33.260 --> 00:29:38.380]   wake up, in that last hour while you're waking up naturally, your cortisol levels which is
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:43.460]   an inflammatory stress molecule is going down and right before you wake up naturally, it's
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:46.920]   at the lowest point before you wake up and when you wake up, the world turned on and
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.920]   it spikes.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:51.900]   So, your cortisol level always does this huge jump when you wake up because the world just
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:54.740]   turned on and now you have to like figure stuff out.
[00:29:54.740 --> 00:29:59.060]   So, ultimately, you want that cortisol level to be at the lowest before you wake up because
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:02.740]   if it's high before you wake up and it spikes, it just got much higher, the upper magnitude
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:03.740]   got higher.
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.380]   So, I like to let people wake up naturally.
[00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:10.360]   Humans are the only biological species on the planet that artificially interrupt a critical
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:12.420]   biological process, no bueno.
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.620]   And also, there's something called the glymphatic system in the brain which clears out all the
[00:30:15.620 --> 00:30:19.380]   metabolic junk from all the activity from the day before.
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:21.380]   You want that to go through its entire process.
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:25.960]   I think waking up is a multifactorial process which the brain feels like it cleared out
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   enough stuff.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:30.260]   Your cortisol level is nice and low, your circadian rhythms are this, it's time to wake
[00:30:30.260 --> 00:30:31.260]   up.
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:32.260]   So, sleep is critical.
[00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:33.980]   Diet is obviously super critical.
[00:30:33.980 --> 00:30:34.980]   What does that mean?
[00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:36.900]   Michael Pollan said, "Eat real food, not that much."
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.700]   And there's a big study on time-restricted eating today that came out.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:41.920]   I generally don't eat breakfast.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:42.920]   I've never eaten breakfast.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:45.980]   If I have a breakfast meeting, I will, but I generally - I'm not hungry in the morning,
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:49.260]   my coffee kills my appetite, I have one cup of coffee and then I may have a cup of green
[00:30:49.260 --> 00:30:54.860]   tea throughout the day, I'll generally eat at 1 or 2, have a relatively small lunch,
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:30:59.540]   mostly vegetables, maybe a little fish and then I'll have my dinner which, you know,
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:01.260]   and stop eating at 8.30.
[00:31:01.260 --> 00:31:03.600]   But the truth is you should not eat things in a package.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.820]   If it's in a package, it's probably processed and probably not the greatest thing for you.
[00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:09.980]   It's almost impossible to do that.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:14.620]   So, I think if you are eating things in a package, look at the ingredient list.
[00:31:14.620 --> 00:31:16.900]   If it's a lot of ingredients, probably not good.
[00:31:16.900 --> 00:31:20.700]   If they're ingredients you can't pronounce or know, probably not good.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:25.900]   And in general, the hack I have is like one apple is 70 to 90 calories depending on the
[00:31:25.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   size.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.820]   It represents 50% of the dietary fiber you need in a day and your microbiome which lives
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:36.340]   in your intestine which is a separate organ that we have, feeds off of fiber.
[00:31:36.340 --> 00:31:41.420]   So, you'd rather give your microbiome, your friend that helps you live because it makes
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:46.380]   80% of the serotonin in your body or 90% which is the happiness molecule.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:48.820]   So, if you don't feed your gut, it's hard to be happy.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.740]   If you don't - I mean, if you put a bunch of chemicals and crap in your gut and cause
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.240]   it to get angry, you're probably not creating an environment for your best self to emerge
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.220]   through more serotonin, less dopamine environment.
[00:31:59.220 --> 00:32:04.180]   So, I like to tell people apple, like if you want dessert or if you're hungry and you see
[00:32:04.180 --> 00:32:06.900]   a snack, eat an apple, eat two.
[00:32:06.900 --> 00:32:08.080]   You will not be hungry afterwards.
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:11.800]   You will not want to eat anything after two apples, you're just full because fiber slows
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:12.800]   everything down.
[00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:13.800]   So, diet is really important.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.500]   I think there's a lot of movement towards no wheat, gluten-free.
[00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.080]   I think there's going to be some science that comes out about that in the next couple years
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.420]   that that's probably better for you, but probably based on genetics and then exercise.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:30.600]   Exercise is also the other pillar of longevity and by the way, exercising outdoors, much
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:31.920]   better than indoors.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:36.240]   Even taking walks outside, the pheromones from trees lower your cortisol level, lower
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:38.280]   your kind of inflammating process.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.120]   So, people that have Pelotons and they do their one hour of hardcore inside and then
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.920]   they go work, better than nothing, but I would encourage you to get on a bike and go outside.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:46.920]   Just take a walk or a jog.
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:50.300]   Obviously, if you live in a big city and it's freezing outside, do the Peloton.
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.280]   I do push-ups in the morning, I do sit-ups.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.340]   My exercises, I don't have a one-hour intensive thing, I just do micro things and studies
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:33:00.980]   have shown that three to five minutes of intense exercise a couple times a day is as good as
[00:33:00.980 --> 00:33:06.680]   anything else in terms of what it does to your body in terms of resilience and restorative
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:07.680]   function and longevity.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.900]   So, those are the shortcuts on the longevity thing.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:12.360]   Then there's of course, all these supplements that people can take.
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.300]   There's people doing NAD drips.
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:18.160]   There's companies that do those all over the country, not proven.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   There's IV drips.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.760]   I'm like, does your stomach work?
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:21.760]   Drink.
[00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:26.920]   If you're hungover and you just can't drink a lot, then sure, IVs are going to restore
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:29.460]   your fluid balance probably a little bit faster.
[00:33:29.460 --> 00:33:32.340]   But if you actually drank water while you were drinking your cocktails, you wouldn't
[00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:33.340]   need the IV drip.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:35.660]   So, do you want to be proactive or reactive?
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:36.660]   What is the approach that you want to take?
[00:33:36.660 --> 00:33:39.660]   Who do you want to be in this world and how do you want to think about your long-term
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:40.660]   health?
[00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:42.380]   - So, I want to go back quickly to diet.
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:46.100]   I think we all know that processed foods, not good for you.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.900]   Sugar, I assume you would say, is not a great thing to be consuming a lot of.
[00:33:49.900 --> 00:33:51.420]   Does that mean there's no place for it?
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:52.420]   - Great question.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.940]   So, my rule is, you think the 80/20 rule, the Pareto thing, I think it's probably 95/5
[00:33:56.940 --> 00:33:58.300]   or 90/10.
[00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.500]   I have a total sweet tooth.
[00:33:59.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   You know, when I was growing up, I had Twinkies.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:04.660]   I was growing up in the '70s in California and my mom, before she got like all natural
[00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:08.380]   and stuff, it was like, "Yeah, have one of these and Froot Loops and Captain Crunch,"
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:10.220]   but I had my apples and bananas and everything else.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:14.580]   So, in general, and I started a non-profit called Eat Real, which is all about preventing
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:15.580]   kids from getting sugar.
[00:34:15.580 --> 00:34:18.540]   We're changing the menu of the largest fast food chain in the United States, which is
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:20.140]   our public school system.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:24.780]   And by the way, by removing chocolate milk out of school, and we did this in the East
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:30.980]   Bay in the Bay Area, we eliminated 10 pounds of sugar in one child's body per semester.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:33.420]   Now, just think about that.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.140]   Just making chocolate milk to milk.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:39.340]   So, 10 pounds of sugar in a kid is doing absolutely no bueno.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:45.900]   So, like sugar should be, to me, for dessert, but you can't have dessert at every meal.
[00:34:45.900 --> 00:34:50.340]   Like dessert can't be your main course, your appetizer, and by the way, bread is sugar,
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.100]   but it's not processed refined sugar.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:53.100]   It is a carbohydrate.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:34:57.860]   It will go through an oxidative process that looks like sugar, but just not as corrosive
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:00.980]   as fructose and all these other high fructose things.
[00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.540]   So, for dessert last night, my wife made this amazing pasta squash soup, and I was like,
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:06.540]   "I need my dessert."
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.540]   So, what did I do?
[00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:10.220]   I got raw coconut shavings, no sugar added.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.460]   I got some dark chocolate chips, which are almost little sugar, and I got some peanuts
[00:35:14.460 --> 00:35:15.460]   and a fig.
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:18.140]   I chopped it all up, put it in a little bowl, and that was my dessert.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:19.140]   And it was all natural.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:20.140]   It was a very sweet.
[00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:23.420]   It was incredibly sweet, but it was tons of fiber in there.
[00:35:23.420 --> 00:35:25.420]   And I love my sorbets, so don't get me wrong.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:26.420]   I will cheat.
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:28.460]   If someone's got a great sorbet, I'll have it.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:31.380]   If there's an amazing chocolate fudge thing, I'll have it.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:34.780]   If there's an amazing cookie, there's a restaurant called Spruce around here.
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.540]   The Spruce cookies, oatmeal cookies are amazing.
[00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:39.180]   I think they're like 1,500 calories per cookie though.
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.420]   So, I think you just have to be mindful of like - and by the way, I used to eat whole
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:45.580]   Spruce cookies like 10 years ago, and now I realize, "Holy shit, those are loaded."
[00:35:45.580 --> 00:35:47.380]   I'll just have a few bites.
[00:35:47.380 --> 00:35:49.860]   So, have your dessert, but you'll still have it.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:54.300]   But yeah, I'll still have it from time to time, but I'm much more mindful of - let me
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:55.300]   eat it.
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.800]   If I have a sweet tooth, let me eat an apple.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:02.660]   That will kill my desire for more sweets because apples are pretty sweet, but all that sugar
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:03.940]   is attached to fiber.
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:08.660]   To illustrate one point, which I think is fascinating, one of my buddies is a researcher
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:11.660]   did a study in Oakland, California.
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:16.260]   He went to an inner city school, got two 14-year-old African-American kids, both like six feet
[00:36:16.260 --> 00:36:19.140]   tall, told them not to eat dinner.
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.420]   Show up to school and we were going to experiment with food.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:27.900]   They showed up at 9 AM and one of them was told, "Drink this 16-ounce glass of orange
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:28.900]   juice.
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:29.900]   Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.
[00:36:29.900 --> 00:36:30.900]   Drink it."
[00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:31.900]   He's hungry, grown guy, growing boy.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:36.100]   Now, here's a Big Mac, the large fries and a big milkshake.
[00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.940]   Ate the whole thing, all of it, no problem.
[00:36:38.940 --> 00:36:43.820]   The second kid came in and we gave him six gigantic oranges - not I, he gave them - and
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.540]   said, "Peel them and eat them."
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:48.340]   He couldn't eat the sixth one, he was full.
[00:36:48.340 --> 00:36:49.340]   Six big oranges.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.460]   Those six oranges is what made that orange juice for the other guy.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:55.260]   So, by eating sugar with fiber, you fill up.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:57.780]   Your stomach's a bag and when you wake up in the morning, your bag is like a paper bag
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:58.780]   that's not opened.
[00:36:58.780 --> 00:37:02.140]   As soon as you start filling up the bag with food, there are stretch receptors in the stomach
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:04.260]   that send signals to the brain, "Hey, we're filling up here.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.260]   Slow down."
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:09.820]   So, just stretch will signal slow down, not hungry, kill appetite, in addition to the
[00:37:09.820 --> 00:37:11.500]   quality of the food.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.140]   But six oranges is a ton of mass.
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:18.660]   So, I'm in the habit lately of when I'm hungry or for something sweet, I'll have an apple
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.340]   and an orange and then I am no longer hungry.
[00:37:21.340 --> 00:37:25.260]   And so, it's my hack to get all the sugar I want and you can't eat enough fruit.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:29.380]   By the way, one other story is Dole pineapple in Hawaii.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:32.980]   You've seen these big Polynesian Hawaiians, they're massive, they're like sumo wrestlers.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:39.020]   Before Dole came in, those people ate pineapples naturally in Hawaii, no diabetes anywhere.
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:43.220]   As soon as Dole came in and made pineapple juice, diabetes pandemic amongst the Hawaiians
[00:37:43.220 --> 00:37:46.100]   because they took the fiber out of it and they just made it the juice.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.380]   So, I say no juice, juice of no bueno.
[00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.900]   I mean, there's all these green juices now, okay, whatever.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.100]   Like why don't you just eat the food that the juice is made of?
[00:37:54.100 --> 00:37:59.500]   Like you could do that if you wanted to, but if you just know the time, take the juice.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:05.260]   But all those juices have honey, cane juice, it might as well be a Coke without all the
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.260]   hardcore chemicals.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:09.580]   You got like the kale and you got all these things that look bueno and feel good about,
[00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:12.380]   but it's still got tons of sugar that's not connected to fiber.
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:13.380]   Okay.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:17.620]   Let's say you got 12 cookies sitting in front of you and you know you're going to eat them.
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:22.380]   It's better to eat one a day or 12 on one day and nothing for the next 11 days?
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.780]   It's much better to eat one a day.
[00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.820]   Imagine you're in your car and you want to go fast.
[00:38:27.820 --> 00:38:33.800]   You could go first gear to 4,000 RPM, second gear to 4,000 RPM when cars had stick shifts.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.280]   But the 12 cookies is taking your car in first gear to like the red line all the way to the
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.960]   end and it just stresses the system.
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:44.520]   Because once your blood sugar goes up with all those cookies, what happens is there's
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:49.400]   so much sugar in your blood that your body goes, "Okay, the red lights start flashing.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:51.280]   We need to lower that sugar."
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.320]   So in order to lower that sugar, we're going to make a bunch of insulin.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   Insulin then your pancreas makes insulin and your insulin shoots up.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:03.520]   And when insulin shoots up, insulin is the key that unlocks the little holes in your
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:08.140]   blood vessels to let sugar out of the bloodstream and go into cells.
[00:39:08.140 --> 00:39:12.160]   So when your insulin spikes, insulin is an inflammatory thing.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.760]   It's like creating inflammation for your whole body.
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:19.160]   So by going to 12 cookies, you've just caused this huge glucose spike.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:22.160]   That's the other thing I would recommend people who are curious and you've probably done this
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.360]   is the continuous glucose monitor.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:26.120]   What causes your sugar to spike?
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.240]   And everyone's slightly different.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:30.200]   I found that when I ate kimchi, my blood sugars went down.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   I love kimchi.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:33.560]   By the way, fermented foods are always good for you.
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:35.800]   Pretty much good for your gut, good for your health.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:39.360]   People underestimate and they don't eat enough fermented foods, pickles, all these things.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:43.080]   But a continuous glucose monitor will tell you the truth about what's going on when you
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   do things.
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:46.720]   So some people work glucose monitors for long periods of time.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:51.520]   My thesis is wear it for a month, eat lots of things, try lots of challenges.
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:54.840]   But if you see a big spike in something, you should try to avoid that food.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   Or eat an apple before you eat that food and eat it again and see if the spike happens.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.600]   The apple will slow down the absorption because the fiber just slows down absorption of sugar.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:07.400]   I say an apple or some other high fiber thing.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:11.080]   I signed up for Levels Health and used it for a month, which is a continuous glucose
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:12.560]   monitor startup that has an app.
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.560]   I use Levels too.
[00:40:13.560 --> 00:40:14.560]   I did it for a month.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:16.720]   The thing about Levels and all these companies, they want you to wear them forever.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:17.960]   And it's just like, yeah, no.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   If you don't do enough challenges over a month, then maybe you need to wear it longer.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.640]   I think every minute that you're focused on your health obsessively, you're not focused
[00:40:25.640 --> 00:40:27.640]   on your life.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.720]   And the reason we're here is to enjoy our life.
[00:40:29.720 --> 00:40:31.080]   Health is freedom.
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:35.280]   And if we're focusing on something for a long period of time, we lose sight of like the
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.640]   broader purpose.
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:41.640]   I like to get people who are like hyper freak, quantified self people to like step back from
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.280]   the ledge and stop trying to measure things.
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:48.440]   There's a control freak component to that, I must know everything so I can control everything.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.440]   Guess what?
[00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:52.160]   Get the heuristic, get it and then change your behavior and then go maybe do it again
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.040]   in a year, see if it helped.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.640]   But you're not going to notice any material difference month to month or year to year
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:01.360]   by continuing to do this stuff.
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:05.520]   Is there anything on the supplement side or things people should be taking every day that
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:08.360]   have nothing to do with specific health concerns?
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:10.840]   So supplements are an interesting category.
[00:41:10.840 --> 00:41:13.880]   They're called supplements because they are supplementing something, right?
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:16.600]   So let's look at the word itself.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:21.560]   If you know that you're deficient in vitamin D, then you should take vitamin D. And a lot
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   of people are.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:24.080]   They think they get a lot of sun, doesn't matter.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:29.120]   If you're deficient in vitamin B12 or folate or iron, you should supplement things that
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:30.440]   you're deficient for.
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:35.560]   In general, the human body is really good at taking the food that you eat, assuming
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:42.560]   it's not chemicals and it's food, and processing all the nutrients, micronutrients, metals,
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.160]   everything, and incorporating them into the body.
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:49.480]   If you take something on a daily basis - so I take vitamin D on a daily basis, but my
[00:41:49.480 --> 00:41:52.680]   vitamin D, it's on the bubble of like 30 if I do nothing.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.840]   I want it to be 50.
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.160]   There's just a lot of evidence that there's a lot of benefits to having your vitamin D
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   a little bit higher.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.340]   So I'll take it every day, even though mine's ostensibly normal.
[00:42:01.340 --> 00:42:05.080]   There are people that take all sorts of vitamins every day, but as soon as you take those vitamins,
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.640]   your pee is really yellow or your pee changes color.
[00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:09.740]   It's because that's the color of money.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:13.400]   That's the green dollar that you paid for, it just turned into yellow pee.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.640]   And so like you're just peeing money out.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:21.240]   So there's not a real benefit of taking vitamins every day, but because it's under the category
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.760]   of generally recognized as safe and the marketing machine there is amazing and the vitamin and
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.960]   supplement business, I don't think there's a lot of high value in it if you have an amazing
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.440]   healthy plant real food-based diet.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:35.640]   You will get everything if you eat healthy food.
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:39.120]   If you don't and your diet is kind of crappy, then you should probably go get tested and
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.720]   see what you're deficient in and where you need help and then try to tailor your supplementation
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   to that.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.920]   But I don't think there's any good fundamental use case for taking something just because.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:53.280]   There's a lot of religion around this, people like believe, "Oh, my aunt takes like 20 vitamins
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   every day.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.480]   She's been doing it for 50 years".
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.480]   No evidence there.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:43:00.040]   There's literally no data to support taking that.
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:04.160]   On the longevity side, there's this thing called NAD, which a lot of people are taking
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:08.880]   and going back to safety and efficacy, there's lots of brands out there.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.120]   One of them is TruNiagen and I'll only surface that one and not all the other ones because
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:15.080]   they've done the safety profiles.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:18.280]   They know that it's safe, they've done the homework.
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.960]   They'll tell you like they can't prove to you that's going to make you live longer,
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:27.840]   but theoretically in mouse and in worms and maybe in dogs, like they seem to have a less
[00:43:27.840 --> 00:43:31.000]   oxidative stress on their mitochondria.
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.240]   So if it's safe and we don't know if it's effective, well, we're just spending money
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.240]   and dealer's choice.
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.840]   Then there are other ones that haven't have a safety profile and claim the same things
[00:43:38.840 --> 00:43:43.200]   based on the same studies, no safety, then you're kind of gambling with your health.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.120]   Like why would you do that?
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:49.040]   The vitamins are generally recognized as safe, so that's just spending your money on something.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:53.160]   I would say if you're spending money on supplements, you should take that money and find a doctor
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:56.720]   that's going to be in your corner to prevent things from happening or when the shit hits
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:43:57.720]   the proverbial fan.
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:01.040]   Unless you have a medical condition, then yes, sure, there are supplements you should
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   take.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:05.000]   But if you're a healthy person, there's no real data.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.800]   - You did mention in Hawaii something about a toothpaste.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:11.280]   - There's lots of organs in your body that require some attention and if you have any
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:16.560]   gum disease, like some people have, some people don't, your dentist should tell you if you
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.520]   have some recession.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:23.640]   Because gum disease, by the way, leads to inflammation and endotoxins in your teeth,
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:26.600]   which can make your heart problems worse faster.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.080]   So if you have a calcium score of two and really bad teeth, your calcium score will
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.080]   go up.
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:34.960]   If you have gum disease, your calcium score will likely go up faster than if you didn't.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:39.160]   So I sadly, I don't know why, my buddy who was a dental guy said, "Hey, just floss the
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   ones you want to keep."
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:46.680]   And 15 years ago, I kind of laughed at him and now I regret not flossing regularly because
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:47.680]   it matters.
[00:44:47.680 --> 00:44:51.960]   So there's something called MyPaste, M-I-P-A-S-T, which is kind of a special toothpaste that
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.500]   you use after your toothpaste that helps with gum health.
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:56.500]   We just talked about gum health.
[00:44:56.500 --> 00:44:57.500]   We could go to iHealth.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:02.560]   There's 99 other versions of things that you could do depending on what the issue is, if
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.560]   there's a problem.
[00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:06.280]   And then of course, if I just flossed, I wouldn't have that problem.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.320]   Then there's the proactive things you can do to prevent things.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.680]   But these are investments you have to make.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:12.160]   They're investments in time, investments in all these different things.
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:17.000]   So a lot of people, they'd rather treat the problem when it happens than spend all this
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.420]   time preventing something that they can't imagine could happen.
[00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:25.080]   So that's kind of a psychological pretzel people have to like engage in, imagining their
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.360]   future selves.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.640]   So we started with this, "Who are you?" where you ran through a bunch of tests, a lot of
[00:45:30.640 --> 00:45:32.400]   blood work, a few other things.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.600]   I think the next one that you talk about is, "How are you?"
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.120]   So, "How are you?" is really, "What does your life look like?"
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.200]   I mean, you wake up in the morning and then you go to bed, right?
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:47.000]   And absent those moments when you're sleeping, what does your life look like?
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   What are your relationships?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.960]   I've come up with this concept called vitality signs, which is not vital signs and vitality
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:58.400]   signs are measures of your relationship with things in the world.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.200]   So the relationship, so "How are you?" is like how is your relationship with your parents?
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:07.040]   How is your relationship with your children if you have them?
[00:46:07.040 --> 00:46:12.940]   How is your relationship with your primary relationship, your spouse or girlfriend, boyfriend?
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.480]   And if you don't have a spouse, girlfriend or boyfriend, how's your relationship with
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.640]   the absence of that?
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:19.640]   Does that cause you anxiety?
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:20.640]   Are you cool with it?
[00:46:20.640 --> 00:46:23.000]   Like because all these things are going to inform a bigger picture.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:24.760]   What is your relationship with money?
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:26.040]   Are you obsessively trying to get more?
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.240]   Are you super happy with what you got?
[00:46:27.240 --> 00:46:29.980]   Like what is your relationship with it?
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.360]   What is your relationship with time?
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.400]   What is your relationship with your past?
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.640]   What is your relationship with your vanity?
[00:46:36.640 --> 00:46:39.160]   Are you obsessively concerned about how you look or do you not give a shit?
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.340]   Like it's somewhere in between.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.160]   What is your relationship with sex and love?
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:46.400]   So there's all these different components and ultimately, based on these things, we'll
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.760]   start to get a framework of - like if someone doesn't talk to their parents anymore, "Oh
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:53.120]   yeah, I don't talk to my parents anymore" or "Me and my sister haven't talked for years",
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.720]   that person's got a - there's a problem there.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:55.840]   There's a real problem there.
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:01.040]   Now, there's a hole in that person's life in some way or there's some deficit whether
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.320]   they blow it off or not, it's true.
[00:47:03.320 --> 00:47:04.760]   You can't skip it.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.160]   You have to like acknowledge what that is.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:11.720]   So the "how are you" is like all those things I just said from the vitality signs but more
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:16.400]   importantly is what do you do, what are your habits, what do you do that you should do
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:20.960]   more of and what are the things that you should do less of and what are the things that you're
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:23.920]   not doing at all that you should be doing.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.220]   So you have to examine your habits.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.520]   So that's the "how are you" and it's your mental health.
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:29.520]   Like are you in a good state?
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:30.520]   Do you wake up happy?
[00:47:30.520 --> 00:47:31.520]   Do you wake up upset?
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:38.160]   All of these things kind of ladder up to your overall - I'll call it the happiness or contentedness
[00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:42.360]   quotient with your existence, your existential quotient.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:43.360]   Where are you?
[00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.360]   How are you?
[00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:46.680]   If I run through that thing, I'll tell you like "Oh yeah, that guy drinks a lot, doesn't
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:47.720]   sleep enough.
[00:47:47.720 --> 00:47:50.700]   That person over indexes on sex versus love".
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:56.280]   Whatever these things are, who you are and how you are, then set you on a trajectory.
[00:47:56.280 --> 00:47:59.520]   And so, the third bucket is what is your trajectory.
[00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:03.600]   I have a slide that I generally show people which shows like "Here you are when you're
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.780]   born and here's you are when you're dead".
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:09.600]   You can go between the ages of 0 and 24, you're growing and between the age of 24 and death,
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   you're aging.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:12.920]   So what is the slope of the curve of aging?
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.300]   Are you above normal?
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.300]   Are you below normal?
[00:48:15.300 --> 00:48:16.880]   Are you a super ager?
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:18.620]   Meaning do you age super fast?
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:21.580]   Those things can be measured based on who you are and how you are.
[00:48:21.580 --> 00:48:25.060]   So if you're constantly doing like a check-in on who you are and you're doing a check-in
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:29.580]   on how you are, you can kind of look at this trajectory and kind of know which one you're
[00:48:29.580 --> 00:48:30.580]   going to be.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:32.420]   You control your destiny.
[00:48:32.420 --> 00:48:35.860]   No one's making you do the things you're doing that you shouldn't and no one's not making
[00:48:35.860 --> 00:48:36.860]   you not do.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:41.260]   It's just you get in the way of yourself and nothing screws up a great story like data,
[00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:44.780]   which is why I'm super happy that there's all these devices that can measure things
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:45.780]   now.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:50.060]   For example, there's a blood test from a company called SomaLogic proteomic test and it can
[00:48:50.060 --> 00:48:54.340]   tell you with like a high degree of accuracy what your four-year risk of a heart attack
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:55.340]   is.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:56.340]   It's like a $600 test.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.340]   It's a blood test.
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:58.340]   You don't need a calcium score.
[00:48:58.340 --> 00:49:00.140]   The world's moving to blood not scans.
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:04.820]   So all these fancy full body scan places are like I don't see their future much and they're
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:08.340]   expensive and the technology is getting so much better with AI and blood and breath.
[00:49:08.340 --> 00:49:11.740]   And there's a company called Owlstone that you can breathe into and it'll tell you how
[00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:16.820]   your liver, your kidneys are, your intestines, the health of them through volatile organic
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.820]   compounds.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.260]   So, the cadence of check-ins, who am I?
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:26.940]   And then the intellectual honesty of how am I and what am I doing is what leads you on
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:28.060]   this trajectory.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:31.020]   And if you really want to live a long and healthy life, which I think people call health
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:33.100]   span, just have to look at these things.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:34.100]   You can't look away.
[00:49:34.100 --> 00:49:37.380]   You just need to be honest about what you're doing and who you are and what you should
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:41.060]   be doing more of and whether that's diagnostic, therapeutic.
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:43.740]   Like I have a friend who's a chef who had Crohn's disease.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:45.940]   He was on methotrexate and all these hardcore drugs.
[00:49:45.940 --> 00:49:46.940]   And then one day he said, "You know what?
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:49.620]   I'm going to like radically change everything about my life."
[00:49:49.620 --> 00:49:50.780]   He's now off everything.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:55.340]   All symptoms are gone and he just eats whole foods and he got off the pharmaceutical train.
[00:49:55.340 --> 00:49:59.220]   And Nestle, by the way, they make sugar foods and then they make diabetes pills.
[00:49:59.220 --> 00:50:00.580]   So, they've got the whole ecosystem.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:01.900]   They get you sick and then they treat you.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.420]   But that's like a vicious cycle of whatever.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:05.500]   I mean, a lot of companies do that too.
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:10.660]   For people that want to optimize their health, they just have to look at what they're - like
[00:50:10.660 --> 00:50:13.060]   your fork is a weapon.
[00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.980]   This year, I'm excited to learn as much as possible from the world's best minds and an
[00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:21.620]   amazing way I do that is with Masterclass, where you can learn anytime, anywhere and
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.620]   at your own pace.
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:25.740]   And I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:50:25.740 --> 00:50:30.860]   With over 2,500 classes from a range of world-class instructors, that thing you always wanted
[00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:32.700]   to do is closer than you think.
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:36.540]   Seriously, I feel like every time I want to learn something new, I can find a class on
[00:50:36.540 --> 00:50:39.060]   the topic from one of the best in the world.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:40.060]   Want to negotiate better?
[00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.540]   FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss's class is amazing.
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.540]   Want to be funnier?
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:49.020]   Steve Martin and Judd Apatow both have great classes teaching comedy.
[00:50:49.020 --> 00:50:51.340]   Or maybe you just want to dive into the science of better sleep?
[00:50:51.340 --> 00:50:54.980]   Well, Matt Walker is the best in the world and he has a class as well.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:58.780]   I could go on and on, so you'll just have to take a look yourself because the depth
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:02.640]   of knowledge the instructors have and the quality of the experience on Masterclass is
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:03.640]   so good.
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:05.860]   I highly recommend you check it out.

[00:51:23.540 --> 00:51:27.860]   I wish I could say I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality is that I'm
[00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:28.860]   not.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:33.140]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why I kick
[00:51:33.140 --> 00:51:37.580]   start every day with AG1 from Athletic Greens and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:38.580]   for this episode.
[00:51:38.580 --> 00:51:43.700]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months because I think it's the best option
[00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.800]   for easy, optimal nutrition out there.
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:52.060]   You take one scoop of AG1 and you're absorbing 75 high quality vitamins, minerals, whole
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:56.640]   food source superfoods, probiotics and adaptogens to help you start your day right.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:01.260]   Every morning I mix it up with some cold water, add a few ice cubes because it tastes so good
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:06.300]   cold and head to my office feeling focused and energized for the day, which is a feeling
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:08.140]   I absolutely love.
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:13.780]   I also love that it has less than one gram of sugar and no GMOs, nasty chemicals or artificial
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:15.020]   anything.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:19.760]   To make giving it a try easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.260]   of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.

[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:04.460]   had high cholesterol.
[00:53:04.460 --> 00:53:05.460]   How high?
[00:53:05.460 --> 00:53:07.300]   HDL 48, LDL 155.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.660]   LDL 155, that's high.
[00:53:10.660 --> 00:53:11.660]   And how old are you?
[00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:12.660]   I'm 38.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:13.660]   Okay.
[00:53:13.660 --> 00:53:17.900]   So over the last few years, LDL range 138 to 155.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:23.740]   So I got a test, had a doctor at Sutter and it wasn't because I picked this person, turns
[00:53:23.740 --> 00:53:26.980]   out I had shingles and I just needed a doctor to prescribe something.
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:28.540]   They were like, "Go see your primary care physician."
[00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:29.540]   I didn't have one.
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:31.700]   I picked whoever had the next open appointment.
[00:53:31.700 --> 00:53:34.020]   They went in, they were like, "Let's review your blood work."
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:38.300]   And they went through and the advice was, and I'm reading this quote because she sent
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.900]   me a note after the blood work was done for my cholesterol, she said, "Your cholesterol
[00:53:41.900 --> 00:53:44.780]   is 206 with HDL 48 and LDL 155.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:47.060]   Advise, low fat, high fiber diet.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:48.060]   Let's repeat in a year.
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:49.060]   Take care."
[00:53:49.060 --> 00:53:50.100]   That was the message.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:53.460]   My reaction to that after talking to a few friends was like, "I feel like maybe there
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.500]   should be more going on in this process."
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.580]   There's a lot more information that needs to be, yeah.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:01.460]   And so a couple of friends said, "Oh, you should probably go get your ApoB tested.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:03.820]   You should go look at more data."
[00:54:03.820 --> 00:54:09.260]   What ended up happening, and this took two or three years because it just did, finally
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.660]   I found a doctor who was like, "Oh, you should go get a calcium score."
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:12.660]   I did.
[00:54:12.660 --> 00:54:14.140]   Was that covered by insurance?
[00:54:14.140 --> 00:54:15.140]   I don't know.
[00:54:15.140 --> 00:54:16.140]   It was two weeks ago.
[00:54:16.140 --> 00:54:17.140]   So I don't know yet.
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:20.500]   The hospital that did it told me they pre-cleared it with insurance and I wasn't gonna have
[00:54:20.500 --> 00:54:21.500]   to pay for it.
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:22.500]   Great.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:23.500]   But unclear.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.500]   I haven't seen the payment come through.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:29.660]   But the calcium score came back a two on one artery, zero on everything else.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:31.300]   So two is a real number, by the way.
[00:54:31.300 --> 00:54:32.300]   It's not zero.
[00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:33.300]   Two is a real number.
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:36.340]   You have early evidence of coronary artery disease.
[00:54:36.340 --> 00:54:37.340]   Yes.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:41.340]   Now, I'm not saying that three years could have prevented any of it, but the idea that
[00:54:41.340 --> 00:54:45.660]   three years ago I was messaging with a doctor whose advice was like, "Hey, just kind of
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:48.060]   eat healthy and we'll talk in a year."
[00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:52.300]   Seems like if I were someone going through a lot of the process that you mentioned of
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:55.500]   looking at some of your data, trying to take some of these tests, trying to figure out
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:55:02.420]   where you're at, how do you evaluate and analyze it when you don't have access to someone like
[00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:04.500]   you who's maybe done a lot more of the research?
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:06.820]   What does the average person do when they see a number?
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:07.820]   It seems high.
[00:55:07.820 --> 00:55:10.240]   They talk to their doctors like, "Eh, we'll deal with it later."
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:13.860]   Going back to the beginning of the conversation, a lot of the medical system we have is like,
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.660]   "Let's treat it when it's a problem."
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:19.380]   Like high cholesterol, young person, maybe it's not a problem yet.
[00:55:19.380 --> 00:55:22.980]   But clearly, if I've had high cholesterol for five, six years and I had...
[00:55:22.980 --> 00:55:24.700]   Or maybe all your life.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:25.700]   All my life.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:26.700]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.700 --> 00:55:28.340]   Like, maybe we could have been doing something different.
[00:55:28.340 --> 00:55:32.020]   So I guess one question is just, how do you interpret these?
[00:55:32.020 --> 00:55:34.700]   How should someone try to find the right person?
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:39.820]   Could you find the right primary care physician at any hospital medical practice that could
[00:55:39.820 --> 00:55:40.980]   be a partner here?
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:42.940]   And I just happened to have the wrong one.
[00:55:42.940 --> 00:55:44.140]   I don't know.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:49.340]   So I think it starts with, if your LDL is greater than a hundred, let's just use that
[00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:50.340]   as a marker.
[00:55:50.340 --> 00:55:53.740]   Forget about all the rest of the APO and all the rest of the everything else.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.820]   If it's greater than a hundred, then you say, "How long has it been that way?"
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:02.860]   We're not starting to test kids, teenagers, because we know the parents' cholesterols
[00:56:02.860 --> 00:56:03.860]   are off the map.
[00:56:03.860 --> 00:56:06.820]   When we get new members and the parents are off, we go check the kids.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:08.900]   And if the kids are off, that's never been done before.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:11.820]   Just a way to think about it before I answer the question specifically, because I think
[00:56:11.820 --> 00:56:13.240]   it's important.
[00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:18.000]   When people smoke cigarettes, we as doctors ask them, "How many years have you been smoking
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.640]   cigarettes and how many packs a day?"
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:22.740]   And we call them pack years.
[00:56:22.740 --> 00:56:27.420]   So if you've smoked one pack a day for 10 years, you have a 10-pack year history.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:32.340]   If you smoked two packs a day for 10 years, you have a 20-pack year history.
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:35.340]   That's the same as smoking one pack a day for 20 years.
[00:56:35.340 --> 00:56:40.860]   So it's what is the load of this chemical, which ultimately ladders up to risk of heart
[00:56:40.860 --> 00:56:43.420]   disease, diabetes, and lung cancer.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.780]   So we call them pack years.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:50.780]   So now the more sophisticated libidologists are talking about LDL years.
[00:56:50.780 --> 00:56:55.520]   How long has your LDL been high circulating through your body?
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:56:56.520]   So there's LDL years.
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:00.220]   So if your LDL is high and you have a calcium score of 2 and you're 38, you probably had
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:03.660]   a high LDL for a long time, and you don't have the genetic subtype that doesn't care.
[00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:07.220]   I don't know if you smoke or there's other things that you do, but the first thing is
[00:57:07.220 --> 00:57:10.220]   get to some answer of, "Do I need to do something else?"
[00:57:10.220 --> 00:57:13.720]   And you can go deep into the weeds of LDL.
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:16.500]   I have patients that want to optimize their LDLs and stuff.
[00:57:16.500 --> 00:57:21.620]   They'll pay some doctors that like hold themselves out for $100,000 to optimize their LDL.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:27.180]   And it's just like, you're optimizing 0.001% of your body, it's already pretty good.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:31.980]   So the question is, if you did her diet, like, let's just say you followed her diet and said,
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:33.700]   "Okay, doc, I'm going to do that.
[00:57:33.700 --> 00:57:35.140]   When do we check it again?"
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.400]   And she said, "A year."
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:43.100]   My answer would be, "Well, I want to know if the diet story works sooner than later
[00:57:43.100 --> 00:57:47.100]   because I don't want to hold another LDL year to go by that high.
[00:57:47.100 --> 00:57:49.500]   So can we please check it in four to six months?"
[00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:52.540]   But you actually have to do an honest change of your diet.
[00:57:52.540 --> 00:57:57.820]   And if it goes down to like 100, you know the answer.
[00:57:57.820 --> 00:57:58.820]   You know the answer.
[00:57:58.820 --> 00:58:00.460]   Keep your diet like that.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:06.220]   And even if you knew your calcium score was a two now, and you knew that you could lower
[00:58:06.220 --> 00:58:11.580]   it with diet down to like 80, and to give you a calcium score of greater than zero,
[00:58:11.580 --> 00:58:13.140]   you got to get your LDL below 80.
[00:58:13.140 --> 00:58:14.940]   That's what kind of our guidelines are here.
[00:58:14.940 --> 00:58:17.580]   If you can't do that with diet, then you need to be on something.
[00:58:17.580 --> 00:58:19.340]   You need to be on a statin, sadly.
[00:58:19.340 --> 00:58:24.580]   And if you are so adamant about taking statins, which is basically there's different kinds,
[00:58:24.580 --> 00:58:29.060]   but there's an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, but that's a fancy name for the molecule.
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:33.740]   Then you can eat red yeast rice every day because that's what is a statin.
[00:58:33.740 --> 00:58:37.300]   If you can find a way to put that in a soup and eat it every day, like, you could lower
[00:58:37.300 --> 00:58:39.500]   your cholesterol and your LDL that way.
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:44.540]   So I think that whenever you find out something's abnormal, you have to think about, okay, intervention
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:51.300]   retesting, how quickly can I find out if I can make a difference without pills?
[00:58:51.300 --> 00:58:54.560]   And if I can't, what pill do I go on?
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.460]   Because once you get a calcium score that's positive, you just know now that you're committed
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:01.020]   to not having that number go up.
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:04.500]   That number goes up with the LDL staying at 155, but then you have a heart attack at some
[00:59:04.500 --> 00:59:06.780]   point in your life and that sucks.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.780]   So you don't want that.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.580]   And I didn't mean, by the way, to make this about me.
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:10.580]   No, no, no.
[00:59:10.580 --> 00:59:14.100]   But I think if people get into your head, like hear me talk to you as though this is
[00:59:14.100 --> 00:59:18.260]   them, I think everybody can take something away from, like, if you get something that
[00:59:18.260 --> 00:59:20.700]   doesn't look right and doesn't feel right, then dig in.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.660]   Don't let that doctor get away with eat fiber, let's check in a year.
[00:59:24.660 --> 00:59:28.740]   By the way, one thing that I realize in hindsight, a lot of people moving around a lot, I've
[00:59:28.740 --> 00:59:33.300]   probably had five primary care doctors since I graduated college.
[00:59:33.300 --> 00:59:37.660]   And I went back and looked and it's like, I don't have my blood tests too far back,
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:41.660]   but I've got them about seven years back and I've had high cholesterol for seven years
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:43.100]   at least.
[00:59:43.100 --> 00:59:46.980]   But I had one doctor and then I had another doctor, then I had another doctor, but I had
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:51.660]   one doctor for three or four years at that cholesterol, but never really pushed back,
[00:59:51.660 --> 00:59:52.660]   said to do anything.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.980]   But part of that's because going back to what I was talking about earlier about like the
[00:59:56.980 --> 00:59:58.660]   medical system moves slowly.
[00:59:58.660 --> 01:00:03.380]   We never thought ever of treating a 20 to 30 year old or a 30 to 40 year old with statins
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:05.540]   unless they had like a credible family history.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:07.820]   I mean, there are people that have heart attacks in their 30s.
[01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:12.420]   Like they have crazy genetic cholesterol problems, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia,
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.300]   they can get these problems.
[01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:18.540]   But the medical field, like we're not aggressive with younger people because like you said,
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:19.580]   the system's reactive.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:22.380]   It waits for you to get sick and then they make a lot of money.
[01:00:22.380 --> 01:00:26.740]   Pharmaceutical companies make a lot of money on preventing the heart attack, but the hospitals
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:30.660]   and the doctors and the surgeons and the cardiologists and everybody in the food chain doesn't make
[01:00:30.660 --> 01:00:35.660]   that much money from you not having a heart attack, not to be hyper perverse about it,
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.500]   but it's just the way the system's designed.
[01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:41.900]   And oh, by the way, that doctor that saw you, they're not accountable to your future outcome
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:42.900]   at all.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.900]   And they don't know you because you're moving around.
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:47.340]   You're just another kid in the mix coming through their system, which is why I really
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:49.780]   believe that these long-term relationships matter.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:52.640]   I think that everyone's trying to find the quick fix, the transactional, where's the
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:56.260]   chat bot for healthcare so I can blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:00:56.260 --> 01:01:00.460]   I think at some point, but you really want someone that knows you, gets you and is going
[01:01:00.460 --> 01:01:03.820]   to like tell you the truth and like double check on things.
[01:01:03.820 --> 01:01:05.580]   Is there a way you'd tell someone to interview?
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.940]   Like if I'm like, okay, obviously this one wasn't a good fit, I need a new primary care
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:09.940]   physician.
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:13.740]   There's not like an easy way to find someone that I know of.
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:16.580]   Are there questions you would ask them to try to figure out if they're the right fit
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   for you?
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.460]   I would ask everybody, what is their perspective on prevention?
[01:01:20.460 --> 01:01:24.980]   I would ask them, what is their perspective on productivity?
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:28.620]   I would ask them how they hold themselves accountable to your outcome, because a lot
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:32.780]   of doctors feel like, "Once you leave my office, how am I going to enforce anything?
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:33.780]   It's your life."
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:37.720]   So, I would say, "Hey, look, I sometimes am my own worst enemy and I'm busy.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:41.340]   How can we do this together so that you hold me accountable and I hold you accountable?
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:43.060]   Can we both hold ourselves accountable here?"
[01:01:43.060 --> 01:01:45.100]   And if the answer is like, "I don't have time for that.
[01:01:45.100 --> 01:01:46.100]   Like I'm just too busy."
[01:01:46.100 --> 01:01:47.340]   Probably not the right one.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:51.300]   And this goes to the meta theme here, which is the rise of what I'll call concierge medicine
[01:01:51.300 --> 01:01:54.300]   or what I'll call membership-based medicine.
[01:01:54.300 --> 01:01:58.620]   So, in primary care, I'm probably one of the grandfathers of the field, because I started
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:02.740]   a kind of a concierge practice when it wasn't really a thing in 1998.
[01:02:02.740 --> 01:02:03.740]   I gave out my cell phone.
[01:02:03.740 --> 01:02:05.140]   I said people can call me whenever they wanted.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.500]   I would follow up with people.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:11.580]   I would use email and text in the late 90s and early 2000s, because I wanted communication
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:15.800]   to be the most important thing, because you'll get the good outcome if you have communication.
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:18.660]   You won't get a good outcome if you don't have communication, because like communication
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.960]   is like more than just data.
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:24.060]   It's holding people accountable and building trust.
[01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:29.540]   So one medical, didn't start off as one, they're like a freshman version of a concierge practice,
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.900]   meaning that I think they charge $159 a year, but they take insurance.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:37.780]   Then you have companies like MDVIP that charge $3,000 a year.
[01:02:37.780 --> 01:02:40.380]   There's a group called Roamed, R-O-A-M-D.
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:44.600]   It's an association that I'm part of that has doctors all around the country that like
[01:02:44.600 --> 01:02:46.980]   have doctors that are membership-based.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:52.060]   And they can charge anywhere between, I don't know, $50 a month to $500 or $1,000 a month
[01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:53.420]   or $2,000 a month.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:58.860]   It all depends on what level of investment you want to make based on what you think exists
[01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.860]   out there.
[01:02:59.860 --> 01:03:01.900]   So there are these practices out there.
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.940]   Some people call them direct primary care, DPC, direct primary care.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:07.340]   Some people call it membership-based medicine.
[01:03:07.340 --> 01:03:08.620]   Some people call it concierge medicine.
[01:03:08.620 --> 01:03:10.300]   Some people call it private medicine.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:15.380]   But I think that one has to look at their - if you make $100,000 a year and you say,
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:17.580]   "Okay, I want to invest in my health."
[01:03:17.580 --> 01:03:23.000]   What percentage of your $100,000 will you invest in your health?
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.980]   So we know that you invest a certain amount in a cell phone and a Wi-Fi package.
[01:03:26.980 --> 01:03:30.500]   And we can talk about what you invest in technology, got their own personal budget.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:32.300]   I know that you talk about this a lot.
[01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:36.460]   But a lot of people will say, "Well, I have a membership to Equinox or pick the gym and
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:38.720]   that's, I don't know, $60 a month.
[01:03:38.720 --> 01:03:40.520]   So that's $500 a year.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.340]   So I invest - so $500 a year is 0.5% of your income."
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:46.900]   I don't have a membership to Equinox, but I'm guessing you don't either because I'm
[01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:49.380]   pretty sure it's like more like $100 or $200 a month.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.380]   There you go.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.380]   I'm not a member of a gym.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:53.420]   I have four kids and that I've got a gym in my house.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:54.920]   Like I'm running around all the time.
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.780]   So even if it's $100, let's say $100, that's $1,200 a month, that's 1.2% of your budget.
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:01.100]   But that's not investing in your health.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:02.480]   That's investing in your fitness.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.780]   So I just want to be really clear.
[01:04:03.780 --> 01:04:05.900]   I mean, which is a subset of your health.
[01:04:05.900 --> 01:04:09.780]   But if you really want to make the big investment on a doctor to have a relationship with that
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.700]   you can go back and forth with and really build up a rapport and then kind of a bilateral
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:19.860]   mutual transparent accountability quotient, you should ask yourself if it's all invest
[01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:20.860]   4%.
[01:04:20.860 --> 01:04:25.500]   If it's $4,000, you can find a lot of doctors in the membership-based world for $4,000 a
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:31.020]   year and they'll use your insurance to do the blood test, to get the MRI, the CAT scan,
[01:04:31.020 --> 01:04:32.020]   to send you to the specialist.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:34.460]   So you're only paying for a quarterback.
[01:04:34.460 --> 01:04:38.340]   You're investing in someone to oversee it, to be your partner.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:41.100]   Your insurance will still be used for everything else.
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:43.860]   So that's how I would think about - and by the way, this field is growing.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:49.060]   There was a report by Grandview where the concierge medical market is like the fastest
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.780]   growing field in medicine.
[01:04:50.780 --> 01:04:54.380]   It's the fastest growing sector in all of health and biotech and everything.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.940]   It's expected to double or triple in the next eight years.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:58.060]   So why is that?
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:02.620]   Because doctors want to help people and they want that principal agent problem gone.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.040]   They want to be accountable to you.
[01:05:04.040 --> 01:05:06.680]   So if you don't like me, if I'm not doing my job, guess what?
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.780]   You fire me, I just lost revenue.
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:12.420]   If I'm an insurance taking doctor and you fire me, it doesn't matter.
[01:05:12.420 --> 01:05:15.680]   Someone will fill that spot in a nanosecond because I've got a three-month waiting list.
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:20.260]   So I don't have to care if people like me or don't like my outcome.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:24.780]   Someone's going to fill that insurance-based principal agent problem slot because there's
[01:05:24.780 --> 01:05:25.820]   no accountability.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:28.060]   There's no true straight line.
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:29.300]   There are dotted lines everywhere.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.380]   There's no straight lines.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:32.740]   The straight line is between the doctor and the insurance company because the insurance
[01:05:32.740 --> 01:05:35.860]   company can call the doctor and say, "Hey, we're not paying you that much because you're
[01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:36.860]   not whatever.
[01:05:36.860 --> 01:05:37.860]   We don't like you."
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:41.100]   And one doctor against an insurance company or the hospital system will say or the employer,
[01:05:41.100 --> 01:05:44.620]   the one medicals, not to knock on them, they'll tell their doctors, "Hey, we need more revenue.
[01:05:44.620 --> 01:05:48.060]   So instead of seeing 14 patients a day, please see 15 patients a day."
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.300]   So if you're seeing 15 patients a day, that means each patient gets one less minute, which
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:54.980]   means that's one more email, one less minute, one more person.
[01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:57.900]   Like quality just starts to exponentially erode.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:06:02.260]   I know that Roamed is going to be building a physician finder for somebody that wants
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:07.020]   high-quality private membership-based physicians this quarter or next quarter.
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:08.020]   That's where I'd start.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:12.060]   I don't think Yelp reviews or any of these health grades reviews are useful at all.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:16.000]   I don't buy them because people want to go to the Apple store, not the doctor store.
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.400]   So when you go to a doctor store to rate somebody, like unless you're like a professional rater,
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.020]   you're usually there to complain.
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:26.260]   I wasn't thinking about it when you started your practice, but it seemed like early on
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:28.020]   it was two things.
[01:06:28.020 --> 01:06:34.720]   It was the quarterback and the like 24/7 access, we'll come to your house kind of stuff.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:38.920]   And what I've been looking for since is I want someone who charges enough that they
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:43.240]   have free time in their day to read some research or have someone on their staff to read research.
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:44.240]   100%.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:48.220]   Someone who's thinking proactively about my health, but like I can wait for someone to
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.480]   respond tomorrow or on Monday.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.480]   That's right.
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:53.920]   So it's like that middle ground is the company that I want to see.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.180]   And there are tons of them.
[01:06:55.180 --> 01:07:00.600]   There's nothing at scale because all the ones at scale, One, Forward, Parsley, pick the
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.720]   brand, they've all raised money.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:04.160]   So they have investors.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:08.840]   So it becomes a profitability story versus a great healthcare story.
[01:07:08.840 --> 01:07:13.320]   Most of the onesie-twosie small versions of concierge medicine, it's somebody that's like,
[01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:14.640]   this is my business.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:19.520]   My revenue depends on me doing a great job for you, not on somebody telling me to do
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:21.880]   more or faster or whatever.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:25.440]   So I think there's some consolidation in that space, but I think you have to be really clear
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:29.640]   on what drives this doctor and you want a doctor that's thinking about you when they're
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   not in front of you, right?
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:34.400]   Doing that research, I read an article about multiple sclerosis this morning.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.480]   I have a multiple sclerosis patient and I'm like, "Hey, guess what?
[01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.760]   There's this new research, just heads up and tracking this."
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.480]   Nothing to do here, but like maybe in a year or two, there'll be some interesting developments.
[01:07:42.480 --> 01:07:44.560]   And by the way, we talked about all these costs.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:50.160]   If your company has an FSA plan, you could put money in pre-tax each year and be able
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.800]   to use that for your medical expenses.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.280]   So one way, and I haven't really thought through this completely before.
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   I'm not going to recommend it.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:57.880]   I'm just going to throw it out there.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:59.120]   You can't change it mid-year.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.560]   So one way to force yourself to have a health budget is to just commit to put a little bit
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.080]   more in your FSA each year.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.120]   So maybe say, "This year, I'm going to put two grand," and obviously we're recording
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:10.120]   this in January.
[01:08:10.120 --> 01:08:11.120]   So it's a little late for this year.
[01:08:11.120 --> 01:08:14.000]   But next year, you could say, "I'm going to put two grand or three grand in my FSA."
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.440]   You do have to use it or lose it.
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:18.400]   Usually, maybe you could roll over, I think this year, $650.
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:22.460]   But it'll kind of force you to try to get more serious about these things.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.480]   Because if you're listening to this and you're like me, at least, it's really hard to be
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:27.720]   like, "Oh, do I want to do this test?
[01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:29.200]   It costs $500."
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:33.800]   For some reason, there are things in life that it just seems like, "I grew up, medical
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:34.800]   treatment should be free.
[01:08:34.800 --> 01:08:37.480]   If it's not free, it seems harder to spend."
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:40.940]   It's not hard for me to buy a new iPhone, but it's really hard for me to spend $200
[01:08:40.940 --> 01:08:41.940]   on my health.
[01:08:41.940 --> 01:08:46.080]   That goes back to this concept of there are no consumers in healthcare.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:49.080]   I've never seen a consumer in the ICU type of a thing.
[01:08:49.080 --> 01:08:52.720]   Consumers have a profile that when you want to go to the iPhone, you have all the agency,
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:56.840]   all the free will, all the power, all the resources, those decisions are yours.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:58.760]   When you go to the healthcare system, they're not.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.840]   You've lost it all.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:04.220]   So that's why getting a concierge doctor or a membership-based doctor is you're investing
[01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:09.520]   in somebody that's got your back, that's going to work with you, that's going to be co-piloting
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.900]   your care with you, and that's going to actually care about you and care about your outcomes.
[01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:16.340]   I believe you don't go to eight years of medical school and college and residency because you
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:17.340]   want to make money.
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.340]   Like you're a healer.
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.900]   There are some people that go into finance and want to be hedge fund guys or some people
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:24.820]   that want to be artists and architects and like everybody wants to make a good living,
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:29.060]   but you don't go into medicine unless you're maybe a plastic surgeon or a cosmetic dentist
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.300]   or whatever, because that's where big money is, vanity.
[01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.380]   That's healing like some psychological wound somewhere deep in your past.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380]   And so, I'll give it to them.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:41.560]   There's some healing components there, but our world is like this is the everything person.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:45.520]   This is like all facets of your existence and health need to be under my umbrella and
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.880]   I'm a healer and I want to help you and like we're naturally empathic.
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:50.140]   We're naturally long-term.
[01:09:50.140 --> 01:09:52.840]   We feel bad when something bad happens, there's a bad outcome.
[01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:57.000]   Empathy and compassion I think are part of the frameworks for going into medicine in
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.440]   the first place.
[01:09:58.440 --> 01:10:00.680]   And I think a lot of these doctors are getting burned out.
[01:10:00.680 --> 01:10:04.700]   There's a huge physician burnout because these big companies, the medical industrial complex
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:09.500]   is forcing them to see more faster, check more emails, like Kaiser doctors have to check
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:11.320]   their emails in 48 hours.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:14.680]   They have 2,500 patients per doctor.
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:20.360]   So imagine the amount of emails with no barrier to email and they don't get paid for email.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.520]   Like the Cleveland Clinic or the Mayo Clinic, I can't remember which one, they just announced
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:27.760]   a program that every email to your doctor is going to cost you 50 bucks.
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:28.760]   So now you have to be really thoughtful.
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.440]   You can't just like - which I think is good for doctors because then at least there's
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:35.720]   some barrier to someone posing some crazy question with three articles to read and look
[01:10:35.720 --> 01:10:41.540]   at what my brother said and like Kaiser will make you respond to that, which is bananas.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:42.920]   These are the ways to really think about it.
[01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:46.560]   I think having someone in your corner is important even when you're young and healthy because
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:48.320]   you don't want to wait until you're sick.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:49.320]   That's a hope strategy.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.400]   I hope I get a good one when I'm in the ditch.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:56.880]   You want to have somebody on your team because they can see the ditch coming.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:58.560]   Healthcare is super predictable.
[01:10:58.560 --> 01:11:01.960]   We know you were going to have a heart attack if you didn't get on top of your lipids.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.920]   So now you're not going to have a heart attack.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.880]   Now let's work on everything else type of thing.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:07.480]   There's lots of ways to think about medicine.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:11.320]   I'm optimistic about a lot of the changes that are coming.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:13.420]   I'm not optimistic that they're going to happen fast.
[01:11:13.420 --> 01:11:17.080]   I hope that I can be kind of a guiding principle.
[01:11:17.080 --> 01:11:22.680]   I hope people copy what I do all day long to create different versions of it and I'll
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.320]   say private concierge medicine, whatever.
[01:11:25.320 --> 01:11:26.320]   That's the way it used to be.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:29.720]   I used to be your primary care doctor until the HMOs came in and they saw that it was
[01:11:29.720 --> 01:11:32.400]   a trillion dollar market and now it's got a financial boondoggle.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:35.960]   You gave us some good tips on what we can do to try to take some of this into our own
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.440]   hands, find someone that might be a better partner.
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:40.000]   I think that's really helpful.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   But you write about stuff.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   You have podcasts.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:46.160]   Where can people stay on top of what you're learning in your practice and online?
[01:11:46.160 --> 01:11:49.320]   So if you want to see what I'm reading and you want to get my point of view on what I
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:54.880]   think about the latest science because I read about five to ten articles a day is on LinkedIn.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:57.000]   For now, I'm Jordan Schlein at LinkedIn.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   There's not a lot of those.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   No C in Schlein.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.640]   It's just S-H-L-A-I-N.
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:07.200]   I post one or two things a day on longevity and/or science that I think is compelling
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:09.400]   and interesting that people need to pay attention to.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.920]   And if you want to go subscribe to our podcast, it's Inside Medicine, you can find it on Spotify
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   and Apple.
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:17.120]   - Or wherever you're listening to this.
[01:12:17.120 --> 01:12:18.120]   Right now.
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.120]   - Yeah.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.120]   - Awesome.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   Jordan, thank you so much for being here.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:22.120]   - Awesome, Chris.
[01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:23.120]   I am super excited.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:27.120]   If you want to do this on the regular and pick a health topic and go deep, I'm in.
[01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:28.120]   - Awesome.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.120]   Okay.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:33.560]   We're definitely going to have to get Jordan back on the show because there were so many
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:35.400]   topics we just scraped the surface up.
[01:12:35.400 --> 01:12:39.200]   And I think it could be really cool to do a bit of a health Q&A with him next time.
[01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:42.800]   So email me any questions you want me to ask for that episode.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:45.720]   Or if you have any questions on any topic, send me those as well.
[01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:46.720]   I'm Chris@allthehacks.com.
[01:12:46.720 --> 01:12:51.480]   And to all the amazing people who've been leaving five-star reviews for the podcast
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.240]   on Apple, thank you so much.
[01:12:53.240 --> 01:12:58.280]   I had a goal to get to a thousand reviews in 2022, but I came up a few short.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:03.120]   So if you're on an iPhone and you find this show valuable, I'd be so grateful if you could
[01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:06.160]   just spend a few minutes to leave a five-star rating.
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:09.640]   If you have time to write a few words in a review as well, that'd be great.
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:13.040]   But even just the quick rating would be so appreciated.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:15.180]   Okay, that's all for this week.
[01:13:15.180 --> 01:13:15.800]   See you next week.
[01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:20.800]   [music]
