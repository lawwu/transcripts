[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.140]   Hello and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life,
[00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.600]   money and travel.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.600]   Since it's the beginning of the year, I know many of you, myself included, are thinking
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.880]   a lot about how we can upgrade our health this year.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.300]   To help make that possible, I wanted to invite Dr. Jordan Schlein on the show.
[00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.880]   Jordan is a physician, entrepreneur, publisher and healthcare systems designer.
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.580]   He was one of the early pioneers of concierge medicine and is still a practicing primary
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.520]   care doctor through his practice, Private Medical.
[00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.240]   I heard Jordan talk about optimizing your health at a conference last year and I have
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.980]   been so excited for this episode ever since he agreed to come on.
[00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.940]   He has such a wealth of knowledge on health and longevity and we're going to try to cover
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.100]   as much of that as possible, including how you can start taking your health into your
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.340]   own hands, what to look for in a primary care doctor, what kinds of tests and diagnostics
[00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.520]   might make sense to consider, how to think about things like sleep, diet and exercise
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.040]   and a lot more, including some of his best health hacks.
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.840]   So let's jump right in after this.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.380]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money and so much more,
[00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.880]   but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which actually gets
[00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.000]   harder as you build your wealth.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.320]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.140]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in everything
[00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.660]   from technology, finance, medicine to real estate, law, manufacturing and more.
[00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.080]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.580]   I've loved being a part of the community and I've even had one of the founders, Tad Fallows,
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.960]   join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative investments.
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.760]   Now the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly successful
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.120]   individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn from each other in a confidential,
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.600]   unbiased setting.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.320]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment opportunities.
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.080]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community because you're
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.040]   getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to you on everything from
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.480]   your investment portfolio to your children's education to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.060]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their minimum for membership,
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.920]   I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally free to join.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.100]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more and if you choose to apply, be sure to let them
[00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.640]   know you heard about it here.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.640]   Again that's longangle.com.
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.600]   Jordan, welcome to the show.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.600]   Thank you.
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   Glad to be here.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   So I'll kick it off.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.760]   What do you think the state of our current healthcare system is right now?
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.400]   Oh, it's bad.
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.760]   It's as bad as it's ever been and I think there's a lot of hype that it's going to get
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.980]   better sometime soon.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.520]   But it's been 20 years that people have been saying we're just about to turn the corner,
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.160]   but we're dealing with a massive cruise liner that turns incredibly slow because there's
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.660]   so many vested interests.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.340]   The intellectually honest framing is this is a health insurance system.
[00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.240]   It's not a health care system.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.720]   It's 85% about money and 15% about care.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.880]   And a lot of hospital CEOs will say, "Well, no margin, no mission."
[00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.880]   Which is a great thing for a capitalist private market company to say because if they don't
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.800]   make money, then they do go out of business.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:32.440]   The thing is, is healthcare, unlike finance, unlike travel, unlike consumer electronics,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.600]   you can map out the supply chains, you can map out the choke points and the efficiencies
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.320]   and you can really streamline stuff.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.180]   But healthcare was never designed for scale.
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.180]   It's always local.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.160]   There's a local person, very few hospitals have a national footprint.
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.000]   So fundamentally, they have different buyers, different supply chains, different plans,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.200]   different states, different regulations.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.800]   So it's not an ecosystem, it's a freeco system, which is you can't peel back the onion and
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.000]   get other layers of an onion.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   You may get a tomato in there, you may get a grapefruit.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.360]   Every time you peel something back, there's things in there that are legacy systems that
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.200]   were built upon.
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:12.520]   They're not streamlined and thorough and simple in the way that most other industries are.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.460]   So the state of the system today is, it's kind of like an every person for themselves
[00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.920]   and you're reliant on the insurance world.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.320]   Everybody has insurance.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.240]   But I'll say that if you're a person that wants to get good healthcare, well, it's local.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.520]   You have to look around and what's there.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:31.880]   There's not a lot of choice in medicine.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.480]   You have free will when you have your wallet to go buy what you want and healthcare, I
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.880]   call it tethered will.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.140]   If you have a big cut on your arm, you don't get to go shopping to which store to go to.
[00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.760]   You're going to go to the closest one, you're not even paying for it.
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.360]   So it's not even your resource.
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:50.280]   This is called in economics, the principal agent problem, where you pay a third party,
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.540]   they pay somebody else.
[00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:55.760]   So the person that you're receiving the good or service from, you didn't pay.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.360]   They don't feel aligned necessarily because you put your hardworking money into it.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:02.480]   It may be your employer's money.
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.880]   I would say one of the biggest problems is this principal agent problem.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.120]   But going back to the story with your headache, so then you see the doctor, they give you
[00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.400]   some morphine in the ER because it's a terrible headache.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.420]   Then you go home and the morphine wears off, you still have your headache.
[00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:19.040]   So you just went to go get something and you came back and it's not better or it's 50%
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.040]   better.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.240]   Now you have to figure out what to do.
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:25.040]   So you call your primary care doctor, that's a two-week wait.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.520]   So then you ask Dr. Google and he or she basically comes back with that could be cancer.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.840]   So now you're super anxious, right?
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.100]   And so the whole system is not designed.
[00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.880]   There was no designer.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.880]   It's a patch on top of a patch on top of a patch where the money continues to flow through
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:48.880]   multiple middle people that like take their sliver of the money and it's not getting any
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.160]   better to answer the question.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.920]   I've been building my model outside of the existing system trying to create a new design.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.280]   Like I've designed this and we'll get into that later from scratch, which is how do you
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.160]   honor both the doctor and the patient and the data in an elegant way to try to achieve
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.040]   the best outcome the fastest.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.880]   And I should only get paid on that and I want the person to pay me for that.
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.680]   Now if they need an MRI, that's what the insurance is for.
[00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.760]   I should help them get the best MRI place.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.060]   I should be the one to be their quarterback around how to receive that care.
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.520]   But really what the Affordable Care Act did and I think this is lost on most people is
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.120]   it set the incentive for the doctors or the medical groups or the people that own the
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:40.840]   medical groups to get a fixed amount of money per problem.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:45.600]   For example, right now if you have a heart failure and maybe we could take the guy Demar
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.520]   Hamlin as an example, right?
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.760]   He's a young healthy guy.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.280]   He had a cardiac arrest.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.280]   This is for those of you who don't know NFL football, primetime Monday Night Football
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   the other night.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.320]   He fell down and they were doing CPR.
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.120]   I'll use him as a quasi example but this isn't going to be exact.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:03.120]   The place that he gets taken care of says, "Hey, for everybody with a cardiac arrest,
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:06.680]   you get $10,000 to get him out of the hospital and get him home."
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:11.360]   It used to be, "Hey, every day he stays there, you get $3,000 in the ICU.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:13.200]   You get all the money you want.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.760]   Whatever prescription you write, you get paid for."
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:20.900]   So the sicker you get or the more transactions there are, the more money the system gets.
[00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:23.080]   So there's no incentive to get that guy out fast.
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.900]   Now the doctors, my people, we of course are healers.
[00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:27.400]   We want this guy to get better.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.400]   We want him to get better fast.
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.720]   We want to make all the right decisions at the right time for the right reason.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:36.080]   The truth is there's this overlay of, "Hey, if we keep him here a little bit longer..."
[00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   I'm not saying that I think Cincinnati has got an amazing hospital system that they would
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.080]   do that.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.240]   But in a lot of systems that you don't hear about where there's no oversight, they'll
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:47.960]   just keep somebody there for days and there's not a financial incentive to get them healthy
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:49.760]   as fast as possible.
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.040]   So the Affordable Care Act created this thing called the Accountable Care Organization which
[00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.440]   is we're going to start going with specific conditions and saying, "This is the money
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.440]   you get."
[00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:03.440]   And the incentives will be aligned around good outcomes yield good incomes.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:08.800]   Right now, it's bad outcomes yield good incomes, sadly, for the healthcare industry.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.660]   And I think that is a fundamental problem.
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:17.440]   And there are so many middlemen, Chris, that make a little vig off of that dollar when
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.660]   you don't do well.
[00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:23.040]   From the person that sells gloves to the person that has the billing software, there's so
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   much waste and fraud.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.720]   I would say train AI on fraud and you probably save a ton of money because it's just there
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.720]   in spades.
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.960]   And I'll say one other thing is that with the advent of digital health, now you have
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.160]   fragmentation of medical specialty things.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:44.240]   So if you want to go get a SIBO test because you think you have bacterial overgrowth because
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:47.280]   you have some bowel problems, you can go online and order a SIBO test.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:49.480]   You get the results, they'll tell you what to do.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:54.240]   And you're managing SIBO which is like a condition of gas bloats and cramps and can cause fatigue.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:57.340]   So you have this fragment and no one's orchestrating everything.
[00:08:57.340 --> 00:09:01.600]   So now you have little windows of things that you can solve.
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:06.620]   But John Muir, who is a famous explorer naturalist in America, and I'd say he said, "When you
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:12.120]   tug on a single thing in nature, you realize it's connected to everything else."
[00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:16.820]   And in medicine, what I can tell you is if you have SIBO or if you have migraines or
[00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:22.000]   if you have whatever, eczema, there are probably multiple factors that need to come together
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.840]   to help solve that without pills, without injections, without interacting with the medical
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   system.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   There's so much that you can do on your own.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.680]   I'd like to say, "How do you become independently healthy?"
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.360]   And ultimately, health is what you can do for yourself.
[00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.760]   And what healthcare is, when you can't do it for yourself, you must reach out to somebody
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:46.220]   that can help you navigate the kind of the thicket of the healthcare system.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:52.740]   It sounds like the providers are less incentivized financially to do whatever they think might
[00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:56.620]   be the best thing because the insurance company is the payer, you have this principal agent
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:57.620]   problem.
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:01.480]   There are certain treatments, by the way, that will most likely be covered and won't.
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.140]   So to recommend someone do something that they probably can't afford or won't get covered
[00:10:07.140 --> 00:10:09.060]   by their insurance is probably not going to happen.
[00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.000]   But you don't even know that a priori.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.140]   You can recommend something and only later do they find out it's not covered.
[00:10:14.140 --> 00:10:17.740]   And then that patient has to go back to the doctor and say, "That wasn't, again, no design,
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:18.740]   no elegance.
[00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:19.740]   It's a shit show."
[00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:22.980]   And then kind of highlighted that the most important thing might be that everything in
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.060]   your health seems connected.
[00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:29.140]   So this idea of your primary care physician seems as important as it ever was.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:33.580]   But at least in my personal experience, it's been tough to find someone in the conventional
[00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.820]   medical care system that's covered by my insurance that actually wants to play that role of discovering
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:43.480]   what's wrong and trying to figure it out and being aware of all the latest medical research
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.480]   and all that.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:48.540]   So I guess maybe the question is, there's one end of the spectrum, which you've started
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:53.160]   your own practice, which is not accessible to everyone, but gives you that quarterback
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:55.340]   that can kind of go through that process.
[00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:59.380]   What are people who are not at the point that's the right fit for them?
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.380]   Where should they start?
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.380]   Great question.
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:06.780]   So my framework in general for every person is, first of all, do you know everything about
[00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:07.780]   yourself?
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:08.780]   Biologically and physiologically?
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:09.780]   What do you know?
[00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.180]   Do you know what your blood pressure is?
[00:11:11.180 --> 00:11:12.500]   Do you know what your cholesterol is?
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.020]   Do you know what your family history is?
[00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.900]   Do you know what your genetic susceptibility to things are?
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.900]   What do you know?
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.900]   And what do you not know?
[00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:20.900]   A lot of people don't want to know.
[00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:22.180]   "No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.180]   Like I don't see it.
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.060]   I'm just going to live my life and blah, blah, blah."
[00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.060]   Great.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.060]   They're gambling.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.480]   And if you're young and healthy and there's nothing wrong in your family, like probably
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:31.920]   pretty safe bet nothing bad's going to happen to you.
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:34.900]   But then you always read in the paper about the sporadic person with nothing wrong and
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:37.660]   they just died of a whatever, or they got cancer at 35.
[00:11:37.660 --> 00:11:40.020]   Those are the headlines that scare people, but they're true.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:45.200]   And why would you not, with not a lot of investment, learn everything you can about yourself to
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:51.780]   make informed, proactive decisions to keep yourself optimized and not have to use the
[00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:53.660]   healthcare system for the rest of your life?
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:54.780]   If you could.
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.460]   If you wanted to walk through someone who maybe is thinking right now, "I haven't really
[00:11:58.460 --> 00:11:59.460]   taken my health seriously.
[00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:04.080]   What should I go and either do myself or ask my doctor to help me do?"
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:06.620]   You could go to quest.com, which it's a lab.
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.220]   By the way, anything I mentioned here, no conflicts of interest for me.
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:10.720]   I don't have any vested interest in anything.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.140]   But Quest Labs and line up the 10 other competitors to them, you can go online and order blood
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:18.540]   tests and some states and cities will come to your house.
[00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:19.540]   They'll charge your insurance.
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.580]   They may charge you a convenience fee to do it online.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.580]   Who knows?
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:24.260]   By the way, just a thing that I found.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:27.300]   I have no affiliation with this company, but I was looking at some tests that I wanted
[00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.380]   to run that weren't covered by insurance.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.900]   And there's this site, ultalabtests.com, which basically sends the same order to Quest at
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.500]   like a third of the price.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.620]   So if someone doesn't find something covered, I just went to Quest and got the exact same
[00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.580]   test done, but it was just less expensive.
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.060]   I'm not sure how that whole system works.
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.660]   Well, look, I mean, the dirty little secret here is when I have a patient who like, let's
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:51.300]   say lost their insurance, doesn't have insurance.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.540]   And I say, "Go to Quest and order a cholesterol test."
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.860]   It could be $200.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:58.360]   But if I order it under my account, it's like $20.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.420]   So like there's massive margin here because there's opacity and no transparency in this
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.420]   system.
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:07.780]   So, you know, MRIs, I don't want to get ahead of ourselves, but let's just say you wanted
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:12.580]   to do the most thorough baseline understanding of who you are in the world, right?
[00:13:12.580 --> 00:13:15.740]   And you were willing to spend a chunk of change just to get to know yourself.
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:21.420]   Well, one of the things that you would consider is getting a brain MRI with a brain MRA.
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.940]   And I'll tell you a story about a guy that I did that on and it turns out something happened
[00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:24.940]   to him.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:27.580]   So, I'm so glad we had a baseline test to compare it to because otherwise you're flying
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:28.580]   blind.
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.380]   The problem with doing tests like that, a lot of doctors will say, "Well, you're going
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:35.180]   to find things on there that don't mean anything."
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:39.380]   Like if you did an MRI of a spine of every 50-year-old, they all look like shit.
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:40.700]   And then, "Oh my God, I'm falling apart."
[00:13:40.700 --> 00:13:41.980]   No, that's just natural aging.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.180]   But we haven't calibrated normal to not normal yet.
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.500]   It's like everything's abnormal if it's not perfect.
[00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:52.820]   But at age 24, it's perfect unless it isn't, but everything decays over time.
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:57.900]   So the MRI that I would order on somebody that really wanted - the MRA shows you the
[00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:02.420]   blood vessels, like three-dimensional blood vessels of your brain because if you have
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:06.900]   an aneurysm in your brain, the typical way you find out about them is on autopsy.
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:10.220]   Your aneurysm burst and then you fell down and unless you're close to a hospital, you're
[00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:11.220]   dead.
[00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:13.220]   They're very rare, but you catch them on some people.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:17.820]   But if you order that MRI and you walked into the place, it could be $10,000.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.660]   If I order it through my system, like through the private pay, it's $400.
[00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:26.740]   You get the same outcome, you're just like getting hoodwinked by something you didn't
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.740]   even know.
[00:14:27.740 --> 00:14:30.780]   So that's the opacity factor that a lot of people have been trying to tackle, but there's
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:34.500]   a whole lot of people that don't want that opacity to be known because it's going to
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:39.620]   expose all these facets of the shenanigans and the chicanery that goes on behind the
[00:14:39.620 --> 00:14:40.980]   scenes to make the profits.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:45.260]   But to answer your question specifically, what would you do if you were a regular person
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:46.260]   that just wanted to know?
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.860]   So you do like what's called a CBC, a complete blood count.
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:51.020]   You want to know what your immune system looks like.
[00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.940]   Do you have enough blood in the tank?
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.140]   There are some women that because they have heavy periods, they're anemic and they don't
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.980]   know it, but they have low energy and they don't know it.
[00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:01.460]   So you'd want to like get a baseline on where you are, whether you're anemic or not.
[00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:02.900]   You'd want to get like a chemistry panel.
[00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:06.980]   And again, these are all like almost archaic, but they're the standard of care.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.020]   You'd want to get your cholesterol and there's like a basic cholesterol, then there's a cardio
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.180]   IQ test, which is a much more sophisticated cholesterol test that will tell you your APO
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:19.580]   and your LDL fractionations and all sorts of bits and pieces that will give you a little
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.620]   more color on should you be concerned or not.
[00:15:21.620 --> 00:15:26.420]   From a blood work standpoint, I like to check at least once your Westergren sed rate, which
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:32.860]   it's a very nonspecific test, but it shows what level of inflammation there is in your
[00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:33.860]   body.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:36.340]   Again, it's a crude inflammatory marker.
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.120]   And I'll just pause and talk about something called inflammation.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.780]   The more inflammation you have in your body, chronic inflammation, the faster you age.
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.980]   So one's goal in life should be to have a body that's not inflamed inside.
[00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.800]   Now when you cut your finger or you bang up your something, you see the inflammation visible.
[00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.020]   But when your whole body's subclinically inflamed, which can be caused by great stress from a
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.420]   bad relationship, it could be caused by untreated subclinical Crohn's disease, or we could talk
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:03.340]   about a lot of things, you're just aging faster.
[00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:04.780]   You will have problems later in life.
[00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:07.260]   And so, if you try to go to your future self, what would you want to know today?
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:11.660]   So the sed rates one, there's something called an HS, high sensitivity CRP, cardio reactive
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:12.660]   protein.
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.300]   Again, another measure of inflammation.
[00:16:14.300 --> 00:16:17.280]   These are all called blood test 1.0.
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:19.940]   There's a whole new set of tests, Chris, we can talk about.
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:24.220]   Metabolomics, proteomics, there's all these new companies coming online that are creating
[00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.660]   much more sophisticated, much more sensitive tests.
[00:16:27.660 --> 00:16:32.580]   Those still cost 500 bucks because they're new startups and they don't have scale yet,
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:33.780]   but those will come down.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.380]   If you're over 50, there's a cancer test called GRAIL.
[00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:39.340]   It's called GALORIE, checks for 42 types of cancers.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:43.300]   It's 960 bucks right now, but you have a family history of cancer.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.780]   I recommend you probably do that every year.
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:49.660]   I just caught a 38-year-old guy with a mother and a grandmother with stomach cancer.
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:53.660]   I checked him at 38, colon cancer, positive, stage two, surgery, chemo.
[00:16:53.660 --> 00:16:57.740]   He just got his test back yesterday, cancer-free two years later, saved his life.
[00:16:57.740 --> 00:16:59.980]   You don't normally get a colonoscopy until you're 45.
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:02.860]   So he's 38, he would be dead by the time of his first colonoscopy.
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:05.460]   So you have to like risk adjusting, who are you?
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.740]   What are the tests that you should get?
[00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.220]   You should know what your blood pressure is.
[00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:10.640]   And by the way, checking your blood pressure one, does it count?
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.780]   The real way to understand what your blood pressure is, you have to check it 17 times
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.020]   at different times of the day in one month.
[00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.060]   Put them on a spreadsheet, average them out, that's your blood pressure.
[00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:20.060]   What should it be?
[00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.620]   It should be below 120/80 most of the time.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:26.020]   If you just went on a run, had coffee, had sex, got in a fight, it can be higher.
[00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:27.020]   That's normal.
[00:17:27.020 --> 00:17:29.420]   Your blood pressure is supposed to get up to be high because we have a lot of resilience
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.420]   in our system.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:34.540]   But at baseline, at regular, it should be like 120/80 or less.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.140]   So those are some basic blood tests.
[00:17:36.140 --> 00:17:40.300]   A lot of this stuff has to do about what age you are and what your risk factors are.
[00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:44.020]   So if you've got a family history of heart disease, my mom had a heart attack or dad,
[00:17:44.020 --> 00:17:46.660]   something like that, then you're going to want to like start doing these tests earlier.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:50.060]   And if you have high cholesterol and a family history, you should think about something
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.840]   called a calcium score, which is a CAT scan that gives you a lot more data on whether
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.060]   the cholesterol - because remember, there's different genetic types of people.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:02.140]   Some people can have high cholesterol all their life and never have a heart problem.
[00:18:02.140 --> 00:18:05.300]   Some people can have like moderately high cholesterol and have a heart problem.
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:07.660]   So you have to identify which one are you in the world.
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:09.420]   Like you're not like everybody else.
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:10.420]   You're unique.
[00:18:10.420 --> 00:18:12.500]   Part of it's your family history, part of it's your genetics, and part of it's your
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:14.100]   lifestyle or health style.
[00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:19.300]   And so how you exist in the world depends on the probability that one of these things
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.740]   that could happen does happen.
[00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:24.500]   So those are some baseline testing, just simple blood tests, blood pressure.
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:27.540]   I would say check thyroid, gland, TSH.
[00:18:27.540 --> 00:18:28.700]   That's a basic blood test.
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.660]   Just a good one time to know.
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:34.980]   Men should probably be getting PSA checks and prostate exams after the age of 50 on
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.640]   somewhat of a regular basis.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.960]   If there's a family history of getting prostate cancer in their 50s, then you should start
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   doing that much earlier.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.500]   Like again, the blood test.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.480]   But a lot of these things require both experience and math.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.680]   And the good news is with AI right now, pretty soon you'll be able to plug in all sorts of
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:50.800]   stuff about yourself and it'll tell you what tests you should do.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:53.180]   And if those tests say this, then you should do that.
[00:18:53.180 --> 00:18:54.640]   So that's kind of this future.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.200]   The question is how do you execute that?
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.240]   I'll share one example.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:19:02.320]   So I used and now partnered with this company, InsideTracker.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:07.400]   And it's basically do blood work and they go in and share you a lot of the data about
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:11.700]   where's the standard range, what's your range, what are recommendations from our team of
[00:19:11.700 --> 00:19:15.320]   researchers that say what you should do, link out to the research.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:20.280]   But that's one thing I did and I did the genetic profile there so they can kind of adjust things
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:21.880]   based on what they learn about your genetics.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.480]   So that's one option that I've used and we partnered with.
[00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:29.120]   So you're talking about genetics vis-a-vis like a health problem.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:30.960]   There's another set of genetics coming online.
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.480]   And by the way, there's a company called Invitae.
[00:19:32.480 --> 00:19:33.480]   They're one of the bigger ones.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.880]   They do the panel of I don't know how many genes, but they check for genes that like
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:41.120]   tell you what your probability of getting something is, which then can inform what your
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:42.520]   surveillance program should be.
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:44.020]   So they've got a good panel.
[00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:50.320]   But then there's a company, again, I'm just gonna name various companies called Oneome
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:52.920]   that does pharmacogenetics.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:53.920]   So what's that?
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.480]   Because of COVID and because a lot of mental health issues, a lot of people are taking
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:59.000]   antidepressants or anti-anxiety drugs.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.600]   We can talk about psychedelics later because a lot of people are doing that too.
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:08.320]   But we can tell you through, again, this science is I'll say 75%, but it's better than 0%.
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:11.560]   So a lot of doctors will say, "I'm not gonna do that test because it's not 98%."
[00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:16.120]   I'm like, "Well, would you take 75% over 0?
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.040]   Right now when someone is depressed, I'll try this drug.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:20.040]   Oh, that doesn't work.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:21.040]   I'll try that drug.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   Oh, that doesn't work.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   I'll try that drug."
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.680]   Well, with pharmacogenetics, they can kind of look at the processing power of your enzymes
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.680]   with respect to certain genes and they can tell you, "Hey, this drug is probably not
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.320]   gonna work as well because it's cleared so fast or this drug will work better."
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.000]   So if you're gonna go embark on a kind of pharmacologic adventure to try to solve a
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.160]   problem, this is called precision medicine, we're getting better at like being able to
[00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:46.400]   pick the right drug the first time.
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:51.020]   And that's through this venue called pharmacogenomics, which is, again, still new.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.700]   The existing medical system is very slow to move.
[00:20:53.700 --> 00:20:57.160]   Like I said at the beginning at the top of the podcast, and a lot of doctors won't do
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.560]   it, a lot of insurance companies won't pay for it because the proof isn't there yet.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.280]   And so they usually require five years of proof and data to do the analysis to show
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:08.760]   that this cost has a future cost benefit.
[00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:09.760]   And that's kind of the...
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:13.280]   Which by the way, you want that science and you want that rigor.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:15.720]   In technology, it's move fast and break things.
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.160]   And in medicine, it's move slow and don't hurt people.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:22.360]   So we do want it to move slow a little bit, but every 120 days, Chris, there's a new major
[00:21:22.360 --> 00:21:26.680]   breakthrough in medicine that like most of the medical field won't like know about for
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:30.540]   10 years because they're so busy with the innovations from the last five years.
[00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:36.640]   There's this natural lag that any doctor has or any clinic has.
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:40.920]   I hold myself out and we hold ourselves out as there's no lag.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:45.280]   All these companies are presenting to me every other week, I've got kind of a speed dating
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.000]   type of companies present to my group of six of our doctors and we kind of like, does it
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.080]   pass the sniff test, is it valuable to patients, is it not like super expensive, does it work
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.360]   and then what is the science?
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:21:58.080]   And is it peer reviewed, is it validated?
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:01.920]   There's a lot of people hawking a lot of stuff that's like super on the margin and on the
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:02.920]   bubble.
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:06.440]   And there's a ton of gurus, especially in the longevity space, talking about how if
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.360]   you just take this or do that, like off you go, but there's no proof.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.360]   There's just no proof.
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:15.280]   So I generally think about just to go to that place really quick, everything should be looked
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:18.080]   at through the lens of safety and efficacy.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.880]   And if it's safe and it's proven safe and there's ways to prove that things are safe
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:28.640]   or not and it's not yet proven to be efficacious, thinking longevity, well, take a flyer, you're
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.440]   just gambling with your money, right?
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:31.440]   Why not?
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:32.440]   Like maybe it works, maybe it doesn't.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.360]   But if you are going to do something that doesn't have a safety profile that is like
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:39.840]   really robust, I mean, this is your body, this is your health asset, this is your life.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.440]   If you're going to take a flyer and gamble on the safety piece, because by the way, if
[00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.380]   we're not sure it's safe, we're not sure if it's effective, then you're gambling with
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.380]   your health.
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:50.920]   I call that short brevity or long brevity.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:53.220]   It's not longevity, it's long brevity.
[00:22:53.220 --> 00:22:56.300]   You are just kind of hoping that it works.
[00:22:56.300 --> 00:23:00.360]   My philosophy is, "Hey, wait a couple of years, let the science tell you the story.
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.440]   Don't rush into gambling with your health because if it does work and you missed it
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:10.240]   by two years, okay, that's two extra weeks when you're like 99 to 99 and two weeks old.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:15.440]   Like right now, you don't want to be mucking up with your system that can make it 99 to
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.840]   like maybe you make it to 82 because you created all these other problems."
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:23.680]   My job is to look at the science and I'm not well loved by a lot of people because I'm
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.800]   not making money on anything.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.680]   Everyone else is making money on the things that they're pitching.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:33.400]   So it puts me in opposition in some ways to things that are being pitched.
[00:23:33.400 --> 00:23:38.900]   Do you all remember episode 122 where I spoke with chef David Chang about leveling up your
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:40.120]   cooking at home?
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:43.120]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.880]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave a lot more.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:52.360]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first, but after getting a full set of microwave cookware from
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:58.440]   AnyDay, I am a total convert and I am so excited to be partnering with them for this episode.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:03.880]   AnyDay is glass cookware specially designed to make delicious food from scratch in the
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.880]   microwave.
[00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:09.980]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code because it speeds up and simplifies
[00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:11.960]   the process so much.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:17.880]   The cookware is 100% plastic free and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat all in
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:23.240]   the same dish that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:27.680]   And just last week, they worked with David Chang to launch the beautiful matte black
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:28.680]   IO collection.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.040]   So you should definitely check that out.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:38.240]   To get 15% off our new favorite cookware, go to allthehacks.com/anyday or use the code
[00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:40.280]   HACKS15 at checkout.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:48.200]   Again, that's allthehacks.com/anyday for 15% off.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:52.540]   This holiday season, I want to give gifts to my loved ones that make them feel special
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:55.800]   and unique, just like the relationships we share.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:00.120]   If you feel the same way, you should be giving them StoryWorth, which is an incredible gift
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.720]   I've given to the people I care about and I'm excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:08.140]   StoryWorth is an online service that helps you and your loved ones preserve precious
[00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:10.920]   memories and stories for years to come.
[00:25:10.920 --> 00:25:15.160]   It's a thoughtful and meaningful gift that connects you to those who matter most.
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:19.040]   Each week, StoryWorth emails your relative or friend a thought-provoking question of
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.220]   your choice from a vast pool of options.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:26.100]   Each unique prompt asks a question you've never thought about, like what's the bravest
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:30.080]   thing you've ever done, or if you could see into the future, what would you want to find
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   out?
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:36.040]   After a year, StoryWorth will compile all your loved one's stories, including photos,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:40.360]   into a beautiful keepsake book that you'll be able to share and revisit for generations
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.720]   to come, which now that we have kids, I couldn't be more excited to start collecting these
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.680]   books to share with them.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.920]   Reading the weekly stories helps connect you with loved ones no matter how near or far
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:55.640]   apart you are, and you'll be surprised at the things you learn, like how my dad might
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:00.520]   have gotten into trouble for landing a helicopter at Denny's back when he was in the military.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.440]   With StoryWorth, I'm giving those I love most a thoughtful, personal gift from the
[00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:08.400]   heart and preserving their memories and stories for years to come.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:14.080]   Go to allthehacks.com/storyworth to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:21.360]   That's allthehacks.com/storyworth to save $10 on your first purchase.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.460]   Let's run through a couple of the lifespan things and just get your take on them.
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:29.880]   One of the most well-proven and well-known things for longevity is social integration,
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.280]   is having healthy relationships that are repeated and long-term.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.280]   Are you in a book club?
[00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:37.520]   Do you go on walks with the same people?
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:41.640]   We often think that the body and the mind are different things, but they're the same
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:42.640]   thing.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.800]   That's like saying my computer screen and my computer chip in the thing are different.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:51.160]   Well, they are, but the output is that one breaks, the other one - you need both.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.360]   And so, the brain is what can cause inflammation in the body by stress or by angst or by not
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:27:00.680]   sleeping well or by having bad eating habits or by drinking too much because you're stressed.
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.200]   So, this level of stress goes down with social integration because you're people, they call
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:10.200]   your bullshit in a way that you've come to tolerate and realize that you need people
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:13.840]   to guide you and to be sounding boards so that you're not just looking for more likes
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:17.120]   on Twitter or getting super bummed out when you get a criticism somewhere.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.200]   I just also did a podcast with Eric Verdin, who's the CEO of the Buck Institute on how
[00:27:22.200 --> 00:27:24.320]   to live to 95 super healthy.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.920]   We go through a number of different strategies to do that.
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:30.000]   Spoiler alert, it's not rocket science right now.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:36.440]   He's doing a lot of research on stuff molecularly, cellular senescence, mitochondrial decay,
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:38.040]   telomeres, oxidative stress.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:41.000]   They're doing a lot of that research, but he'll even tell you we're not there yet.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.200]   And then there's stem cells.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.960]   And I think when we think of longevity, we have to think about like, "Well, my eyes may
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:47.520]   age faster than my heart.
[00:27:47.520 --> 00:27:49.840]   My liver may age faster than my kidneys."
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:53.680]   So, longevity is like almost organ-specific and most people don't think like that.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:57.360]   But the spoiler alert is - and a study came out literally, I think it was yesterday, a
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:04.360]   big study over lots of years and lots of people that water, hydration - by the way, we all
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:05.820]   know this.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.040]   Everybody knows that like, as my father used to say, "The solution to pollution" - I see
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:11.920]   you drinking now - "The solution to pollution is dilution."
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.000]   Water is a critical aspect of life.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:15.920]   And if you stop drinking for three days, you're dead.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:16.920]   Let me just put a really fine point.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:18.880]   If you stop drinking for three days, you're dead.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:22.840]   If you stop eating, you can go on a hunger strike for a month or longer before you're
[00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:23.840]   dead.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.680]   Without water, you're dead in three days, which is why all these people in the hospital
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:29.200]   are getting IVs and they never die.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.080]   You stop the water, they're dead.
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:34.000]   You go out in the forest, there's all these animals out there that you can't see and can't
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.240]   hear if you're camping and there's animals dying everywhere.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.000]   You don't hear screams, you don't hear moans, they're not in pain.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Why?
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.200]   Because the body has come up with a very elegant mechanism for death by no water.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   As soon as you start not drinking, what happens is your kidneys which filter all the stuff
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.800]   in your body, the level of nitrogen in your body which normally gets filtered, the more
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:56.360]   water you drink, the more nitrogen goes out.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.480]   I mean, sodium and chloride, there's all sorts of things the kidney does.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:00.320]   I'm being simplistic here.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:04.200]   But the levels of nitrogen start to go up in your body, they get more concentrated,
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:07.040]   they're not being diluted, they're being concentrated.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.640]   So the higher the nitrogen is, if you've ever had nitrous oxide, you kind of get, whoa,
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.800]   kind of numb and happy.
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:13.060]   It's the same thing.
[00:29:13.060 --> 00:29:17.840]   So when you stop drinking, you start to get like kind of - it's like a morphine-like state
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:21.040]   where you kind of get happy and numb and things are kind of gleeful.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:24.800]   Now, not to suggest that if you've got like terrible pain and stop drinking, like that's
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   a solution.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.120]   But people at the end of life that aren't like suffering with any painful thing, they
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.520]   stop drinking and then they die.
[00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:38.280]   And it's a very kind of dignified biological process that like biology has figured out
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.280]   for a long time.
[00:29:39.280 --> 00:29:41.080]   They don't want death to be super painful.
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:43.960]   I say they, I don't know who they is, but like nature, biology.
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.000]   So hydration is like a really important thing.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.720]   And so, how do you know if you're drinking enough?
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.320]   They've got smart cups, they've got like all this new gadgets.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:54.680]   Like, real simple, if you're not going to the bathroom three times a day or more while
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:56.560]   you're awake, you're not drinking enough.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:57.840]   And you don't need to overdo it.
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.720]   I think you should always have a glass of water around.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:01.320]   You know, you shouldn't be chugging, you should be drinking.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.680]   And I think the part two to that is alcohol.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:06.080]   Like we know alcohol is a pro-aging substance.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.360]   So if you're one of these anti-aging people and you drink alcohol, well then you're going
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:14.160]   to take some silver bullet pill that you heard about from somebody and then you're going
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:16.760]   to go out and have like a bunch of cocktails and go to Vegas.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.120]   You actually have to like think long-term and what these episodes of alcohol does.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:25.200]   But if you are going to drink alcohol, which most people do, glass of wine, put a glass
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:28.880]   of water in front of it and put a glass of water after it because then you're diluting
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   the alcohol's impact because alcohol dehydrates you.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:35.720]   So the concentration of alcohol molecules in your body is higher an hour after you drink
[00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   it than it was before.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.000]   But if you drink lots of water before and after, it doesn't get a chance to concentrate
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:41.520]   and cause problems.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:43.080]   Sleep, super important one.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.840]   I wear an Oura ring and I see you do too.
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:47.240]   I measure my sleep every day.
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:52.480]   I've been getting 90s scores on both ends since January 1st when I stopped traveling
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:55.200]   and my goal is to keep above 90 like all the time.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.800]   I have patients that are like, "Yeah, I'm in the 60s.
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:59.440]   I think it's great because I was in the 40s."
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.800]   And I was like, "Holy moly, 40s?"
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:04.600]   I think a lot of people think that like I'll sleep when I'm dead, I'll have plenty of time
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   for that.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:09.760]   But the truth is if you don't sleep now, you're going to die much sooner and so you'll have
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   less time.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:13.200]   And one of the hacks for me is I need eight hours of sleep.
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:16.560]   In fact, I got like almost nine last night, but you should figure out when you want to
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:19.240]   wake up and you should set your alarm clock to go to bed.
[00:31:19.240 --> 00:31:23.280]   You should never set your alarm clock to wake up because when you set your alarm clock to
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:28.280]   wake up, in that last hour while you're waking up naturally, your cortisol levels, which
[00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:31.880]   is an inflammatory stress molecule, is going down.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:35.320]   And right before you wake up naturally, it's at the lowest point before you wake up.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:37.840]   And when you wake up, the world turned on and it spikes.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.880]   So, your cortisol level always does this huge jump when you wake up because the world just
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:44.680]   turned on and now you have to like figure stuff out.
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:49.040]   So ultimately, you want that cortisol level to be at the lowest before you wake up because
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.840]   if it's high before you wake up and it spikes, it just got much higher.
[00:31:51.840 --> 00:31:53.640]   The upper magnitude got higher.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:56.360]   So, I like to let people wake up naturally.
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.360]   Humans are the only biological species on the planet that artificially interrupt a critical
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   biological process.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   No bueno.
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.640]   And also, there's something called the glymphatic system in the brain which clears out all the
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:09.400]   metabolic junk from all the activity from the day before.
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   You want that to go through its entire process.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:15.960]   I think waking up is a multifactorial process which the brain feels like it cleared out
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   enough stuff.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.640]   Your cortisol level is nice and low.
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:19.840]   Your circadian rhythms are this.
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:20.840]   It's time to wake up.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.400]   So, sleep is critical.
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.000]   Diet is obviously super critical.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   What does that mean?
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.920]   Michael Pollan said, "Eat real food, not that much."
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.680]   And there's a big study on time-restricted eating today that came out.
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:31.920]   I generally don't eat breakfast.
[00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:32.920]   I've never eaten breakfast.
[00:32:32.920 --> 00:32:35.960]   If I have a breakfast meeting, I will, but I generally am not hungry in the morning.
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   My coffee kills my appetite.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:40.560]   I have one cup of coffee and then I may have a cup of green tea throughout the day.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:47.040]   I'll generally eat at 1 or 2, have a relatively small lunch, mostly vegetables, maybe a little
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.240]   fish, and then I'll have my dinner and stop eating at 8.30.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.600]   But the truth is you should not eat things in a package.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:58.800]   If it's in a package, it's probably processed and probably not the greatest thing for you.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:33:00.040]   Almost impossible to do that.
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.640]   So, I think if you are eating things in a package, look at the ingredient list.
[00:33:04.640 --> 00:33:06.880]   If it's a lot of ingredients, probably not good.
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.680]   If there are ingredients you can't pronounce or know, probably not good.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:15.880]   And in general, the hack I have is like one apple is 70 to 90 calories depending on the
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:16.880]   size.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.800]   It represents 50% of the dietary fiber you need in a day and your microbiome which lives
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:26.320]   in your intestine which is a separate organ that we have, feeds off of fiber.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:31.400]   So, you'd rather give your microbiome, your friend that helps you live because it makes
[00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:36.240]   80% of the serotonin in your body or 90% which is the happiness molecule.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.800]   So, if you don't feed your gut, it's hard to be happy.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:43.640]   If you put a bunch of chemicals and crap in your gut and cause it to get angry, you're
[00:33:43.640 --> 00:33:47.840]   probably not creating an environment for your best self to emerge through more serotonin,
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:49.160]   less dopamine environment.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:54.160]   So, I like to tell people apple, like if you want dessert or if you're hungry and you see
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.960]   a snack, eat an apple.
[00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   Eat two.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.080]   You will not be hungry afterwards.
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:00.160]   You will not want to eat anything after two apples.
[00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:02.600]   You're just full because fiber slows everything down.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.800]   So, diet is really important.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:07.480]   I think there's a lot of movement towards no wheat, gluten-free.
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:11.080]   I think there's going to be some science that comes out about that in the next couple years
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:14.120]   that's probably better for you, but probably based on genetics.
[00:34:14.120 --> 00:34:15.420]   And then exercise.
[00:34:15.420 --> 00:34:18.800]   Exercise is also the other pillar of longevity.
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:21.920]   And by the way, exercising outdoors, much better than indoors.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:26.240]   Even taking walks outside, the pheromones from trees lower your cortisol level, lower
[00:34:26.240 --> 00:34:28.280]   your kind of inflammation process.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.080]   So, people that have Pelotons and they do their one hour of hardcore inside and then
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:35.920]   they go work, better than nothing, but I would encourage you to get on a bike and go outside.
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:36.920]   Just take a walk or a jog.
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:40.320]   Obviously, if you live in a big city and it's freezing outside, do the Peloton.
[00:34:40.320 --> 00:34:41.440]   I do push-ups in the morning.
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.440]   I do sit-ups.
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.760]   So, my exercises, I don't have a one-hour intensive thing.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:49.640]   I just do micro things and studies have shown that three to five minutes of intense exercise
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:54.780]   a couple times a day is as good as anything else in terms of what it does to your body
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:34:57.600]   in terms of resilience and restorative function and longevity.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:59.880]   So, those are the shortcuts on the longevity thing.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.360]   Then there's of course all these supplements that people can take.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.320]   There's people doing NAD drips.
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:07.400]   There's companies that do those all over the country.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   Not proven.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   There's IV drips.
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.720]   I'm like, "Does your stomach work?
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:11.720]   Drink."
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.920]   If you're hungover and you just can't drink a lot, then sure, IVs are going to restore
[00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:19.460]   your fluid balance probably a little bit faster.
[00:35:19.460 --> 00:35:22.320]   But if you actually drink water while you were drinking your cocktails, you wouldn't
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:23.320]   need the IV drip.
[00:35:23.320 --> 00:35:25.640]   So, like, do you want to be proactive or reactive?
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:26.800]   What is the approach that you want to take?
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:29.680]   Who do you want to be in this world and how do you want to think about your long-term
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:30.680]   health?
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:32.360]   So, I want to go back quickly to diet.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:36.000]   I think we all know that processed foods, not good for you.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.920]   Sugar, I assume you would say, is not a great thing to be consuming a lot of.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:41.480]   Does that mean there's no place for it?
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.480]   Great question.
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:46.920]   So, my rule is, you think the 80/20 rule, the Pareto thing, I think it's probably 95/5
[00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:48.280]   or 90/10.
[00:35:48.280 --> 00:35:49.560]   I have a total sweet tooth.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   You know, when I was growing up, I ate Twinkies.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:54.920]   I was growing up in the 70s, California and my mom, before she got like all natural and
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:58.560]   stuff, it was like, "Yeah, have one of these and Fruit Loops and Captain Crunch", but I
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:00.280]   had my apples and bananas and everything else.
[00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:04.560]   So, in general, and I started a non-profit called Eat Real, which is all about preventing
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:05.600]   kids from getting sugar.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:08.560]   We're changing the menu of the largest fast food chain in the United States, which is
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:10.160]   our public school system.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:14.800]   And by the way, by removing chocolate milk out of school, and we did this in the East
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:21.160]   Bay in the Bay Area, we eliminated 10 pounds of sugar in one child's body per semester.
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:25.160]   Now, just think about that, just making chocolate milk to milk.
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:29.320]   So, 10 pounds of sugar in a kid is doing as like absolutely no bueno.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:35.920]   So, like sugar should be to me for dessert, but you can't have dessert at every meal.
[00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:38.400]   Like dessert can't be your main course, your appetizer.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.120]   And by the way, bread is sugar, but it's not processed refined sugar.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   It is a carbohydrate.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.880]   It will go through an oxidative process that looks like sugar, but just not as corrosive
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:51.120]   as fructose and all these other high fructose things.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:55.480]   So, for dessert last night, my wife made this amazing pasta squash soup and I was like,
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.480]   "I need my dessert."
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.480]   So, what did I do?
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:00.080]   I got raw coconut shavings, no sugar added.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.440]   I got some dark chocolate chips, which are almost little sugar, and I got some peanuts
[00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.440]   and a fig.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:08.120]   I chopped it all up, put it in a little bowl and that was my dessert.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   And it was all natural.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   It was a very sweet.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:13.440]   It was incredibly sweet, but it was tons of fiber in there.
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:16.680]   And I love my sorbets, so don't get me wrong, like I will cheat.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:17.680]   Who's got a great sorbet?
[00:37:17.680 --> 00:37:18.680]   I'll have it.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:21.480]   If there's an amazing chocolate fudge thing, I'll have it.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:24.760]   If there's an amazing cookie, there's a restaurant called Spruce around here.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:26.560]   The Spruce cookies, oatmeal cookies are amazing.
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:29.120]   I think they're like 1500 calories per cookie though.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:31.440]   So, I think you just have to be mindful of like...
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.160]   And by the way, I used to eat whole Spruce cookies like 10 years ago and then I realized,
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   "Holy shit, those are loaded."
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.400]   I'll just have a few bites.
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:39.840]   So, have your dessert, but you'll still have it.
[00:37:39.840 --> 00:37:44.280]   But yeah, I'll still have it from time to time, but I'm much more mindful of, "Let me
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   eat it.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.800]   Let me eat an apple.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:50.280]   That will kill my desire for more sweets."
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:53.920]   Because apples are pretty sweet, but all that sugar is attached to fiber.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:58.640]   To illustrate one point, which I think is fascinating, one of my buddies is a researcher
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:01.640]   did a study in Oakland, California.
[00:38:01.640 --> 00:38:06.360]   He went to an inner city school, got two 14-year-old African-American kids, both like six feet
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:09.120]   tall, told them not to eat dinner.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:12.400]   Show up to school and we were going to do an experiment with food.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:17.760]   They showed up at 9 AM and one of them was told, "Drink this 16-ounce glass of orange
[00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.760]   juice.
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.760]   Glug, glug, glug, glug, glug.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.760]   Drink it."
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   He's hungry, grown guy, growing boy.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.120]   Now, here's a Big Mac, the large fries and a big milkshake.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:28.960]   Ate the whole thing, all of it, no problem.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.840]   The second kid came in and we gave him six gigantic oranges, not I, he gave them and
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.560]   said, "Peel them and eat them."
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:36.960]   He couldn't eat the six one.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.320]   He was full.
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.560]   Six big oranges.
[00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:42.560]   Those six oranges is what made that orange juice for the other guy.
[00:38:42.560 --> 00:38:45.280]   So, by eating sugar with fiber, you fill up.
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.800]   Your stomach's a bag and when you wake up in the morning, your bag is like a paper bag
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.800]   that's not opened.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:52.160]   As soon as you start filling up the bag with food, there are stretch receptors in the stomach
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:55.160]   that send signals to the brain, "Hey, we're filling up here, slow down."
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:00.320]   So, just stretch will signal slow down, not hungry, kill appetite in addition to the quality
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:01.480]   of the food.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.000]   But six oranges is a ton of mass.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.640]   So, I'm in the habit lately of when I'm hungry or for something sweet, I'll have an apple
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.320]   and an orange and then I am no longer hungry.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:15.240]   And so, it's my hack to get all the sugar I want and you can't eat enough fruit.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:19.360]   By the way, one other story is Dole pineapple in Hawaii.
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:22.960]   You've seen these big Polynesian Hawaiians, they're massive, they're like sumo wrestlers.
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:29.000]   Before Dole came in, those people ate pineapples naturally in Hawaii, no diabetes anywhere.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.640]   Soon as Dole came in and made pineapple juice, diabetes pandemic amongst the Hawaiians because
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.080]   they took the fiber out of it and they just made it the juice.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.560]   So, I say no juice, juice of no bueno.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.880]   I mean, there's all these green juices now, okay, whatever.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:44.080]   Like why don't you just eat the food that the juice is made of?
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:49.200]   Like you could do that if you wanted to, but if you just don't have the time, take the
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.200]   juice.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:55.280]   But all those juices have honey, cane juice, it might as well be a Coke without all the
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.280]   hardcore chemicals.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:59.200]   You've got like the kale and you've got all these things that look bueno and feel good
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:02.280]   about but it's still got tons of sugar that's not connected to fiber.
[00:40:02.280 --> 00:40:03.280]   - Okay.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.600]   Let's say you got 12 cookies sitting in front of you and you know you're going to eat them.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:12.360]   Is it better to eat one a day or 12 on one day and nothing for the next 11 days?
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.760]   - It's much better to eat one a day.
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:17.820]   Imagine you're in your car and you want to go fast.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.800]   You could go first gear to 4,000 RPM, second gear to 4,000 RPM when cars had stick shifts.
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:28.280]   But the 12 cookies is taking your car in first gear to like the red line all the way to the
[00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.960]   end and it just stresses the system.
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.560]   Because once your blood sugar goes up with all those cookies, what happens is there's
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:39.400]   so much sugar in your blood that your body goes "Okay, the red light start flashing,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.280]   we need to lower that sugar".
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:44.320]   So in order to lower that sugar, we're going to make a bunch of insulin.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:49.080]   Insulin then your pancreas makes insulin and your insulin shoots up and when insulin shoots
[00:40:49.080 --> 00:40:56.000]   up - insulin is the key that unlocks the little holes in your blood vessels to let sugar out
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.160]   of the bloodstream and go into cells.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:02.180]   So when your insulin spikes, insulin is an inflammatory thing.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:05.760]   It's like creating inflammation for your whole body.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:09.180]   So by going to 12 cookies, you've just caused this huge glucose spike.
[00:41:09.180 --> 00:41:12.160]   That's the other thing I would recommend people who are curious and you've probably done this
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.360]   is the continuous glucose monitor.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:16.120]   What causes your sugar to spike?
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.240]   And everyone's slightly different.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:20.200]   I found that when I eat kimchi, my blood sugars went down.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   I love kimchi.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:24.560]   And by the way, fermented foods are always good for you, pretty much good for your gut,
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.760]   good for your health.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:29.320]   People underestimate and they don't eat enough fermented foods, pickles, all these things.
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:33.040]   But a continuous glucose monitor will tell you the truth about what's going on when you
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:34.040]   do things.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:36.700]   So some people work glucose monitors for long periods of time.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:41.480]   My thesis is wear it for a month, eat lots of things, try lots of challenges.
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:46.680]   But if you see a big spike in something, you should try to avoid that food or eat an apple
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.160]   before you eat that food and eat it again and see if the spike happens because the apple
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.600]   will slow down the absorption because the fiber just slows down absorption of sugar.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.400]   I say an apple or some other high fiber thing.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.080]   I signed up for Levels Health and used it for a month, which is a continuous glucose
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:02.560]   monitor startup that has an app.
[00:42:02.560 --> 00:42:03.560]   I use Levels too.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:04.560]   I did it for a month.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.720]   The thing about Levels and all these companies, they want you to wear them forever.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.960]   And it's just like, yeah, no.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   If you don't do enough challenges over a month, then maybe you need to wear it longer.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:15.640]   I think every minute that you're focused on your health obsessively, you're not focused
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.640]   on your life.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:19.680]   And the reason we're here is to enjoy our life.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.060]   Health is freedom.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.280]   And if we're focusing on something for a long period of time, we lose sight of like the
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:26.600]   broader purpose.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:31.600]   I like to get people who are like hyper freak quantified self people to like step back from
[00:42:31.600 --> 00:42:34.280]   the ledge and stop trying to measure things.
[00:42:34.280 --> 00:42:35.720]   There's a control freak component to that.
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:38.440]   I must know everything so I can control everything.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.440]   Guess what?
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:42.120]   Get the heuristic, get it and then change your behavior and then go maybe do it again
[00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:44.000]   in a year, see if it helped.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.600]   But you're not going to notice any material difference month to month or year to year
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.360]   by continuing to do this stuff.
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.520]   Is there anything on the supplement side or things people should be taking every day that
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:58.400]   have nothing to do with specific health concerns?
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.840]   So supplements are an interesting category.
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:04.200]   They're called supplements because they are supplementing something, right?
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.620]   So let's look at the word itself.
[00:43:06.620 --> 00:43:11.560]   If you know that you're deficient in vitamin D, then you should take vitamin D and a lot
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.560]   of people are.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.100]   They think they get a lot of sun, doesn't matter.
[00:43:14.100 --> 00:43:19.160]   If you're deficient in vitamin B12 or folate or iron, you should supplement things that
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.440]   you're deficient for.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:25.560]   In general, the human body is really good at taking the food that you eat, assuming
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:32.600]   it's not chemicals and it's food and processing all the nutrients, micronutrients, metals,
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.160]   everything and incorporating them into the body.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:39.480]   If you take something on a daily basis - so I take vitamin D on a daily basis, but my
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.680]   vitamin D, it's on the bubble of like 30 if I do nothing.
[00:43:42.680 --> 00:43:43.840]   I want it to be 50.
[00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.080]   There's just a lot of evidence that there's a lot of benefits to having your vitamin D
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:48.080]   a little bit higher.
[00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:51.360]   I take it every day, even though mine's ostensibly normal.
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:53.920]   There are people that take all sorts of vitamins every day.
[00:43:53.920 --> 00:43:57.680]   As soon as you take those vitamins, your pee is really yellow or your pee changes color.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.760]   It's because that's the color of money.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:03.420]   That's the green dollar that you paid for, it just turned into yellow pee.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:06.680]   And so like you're just peeing money out.
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:11.280]   So there's not a real benefit of taking vitamins every day, but because it's under the category
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:15.760]   of generally recognized as safe and the marketing machine there is amazing in the vitamin and
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.980]   supplement business, I don't think there's a lot of high value in it if you have an amazing
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:22.440]   healthy plant real food-based diet.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.640]   You will get everything if you eat healthy food.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.120]   If you don't and your diet is kind of crappy, then you should probably go get tested and
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.720]   see what you're deficient in and where you need help and then try to tailor your supplementation
[00:44:32.720 --> 00:44:33.720]   to that.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:38.920]   But I don't think there's any good fundamental use case for taking something just because.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:40.240]   There's a lot of religion around this.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.720]   People like believe, "Oh, my aunt takes like 20 vitamins every day.
[00:44:43.720 --> 00:44:45.440]   She's been doing it for 50 years."
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:46.440]   No evidence there.
[00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:50.020]   There's literally no data to support taking that.
[00:44:50.020 --> 00:44:54.120]   On the longevity side, there's this thing called NAD, which a lot of people are taking
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.860]   and going back to safety and efficacy, there's lots of brands out there.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.120]   One of them is TruNiagen and I'll only surface that one and not all the other ones because
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:05.080]   they've done the safety profiles.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.840]   They know that it's safe.
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.240]   They've done the homework.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:11.960]   They'll tell you like they can't prove to you that's going to make you live longer,
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:17.840]   but theoretically in mouse and in worms and maybe in dogs, like they seem to have a less
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:20.640]   oxidative stress on their mitochondria.
[00:45:20.640 --> 00:45:24.240]   So, if it's safe and we don't know if it's effective, well, we're just spending money
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.240]   and dealer's choice.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:28.820]   Then there are other ones that haven't have a safety profile and claim the same things
[00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:33.200]   based on the same studies, no safety, then you're kind of gambling with your health.
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:35.120]   Like why would you do that?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.040]   But vitamins are generally recognized as safe, so that's just spending your money on something.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:43.160]   I would say if you're spending money on supplements, you should take that money and find a doctor
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:46.720]   that's going to be in your corner to prevent things from happening or when the shit hits
[00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:47.720]   the proverbial fan.
[00:45:47.720 --> 00:45:51.040]   Unless you have a medical condition, then yes, sure, there are supplements you should
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.040]   take.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:55.000]   But if you're a healthy person, there's no real data.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.800]   - You did mention in Hawaii something about a toothpaste.
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.280]   - There's lots of organs in your body that require some attention and if you have any
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:06.560]   gum disease, like some people have, some people don't, your dentist should tell you if you
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:12.680]   have some recession because gum disease, by the way, leads to inflammation and endotoxins
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.580]   in your teeth, which can make your heart problems worse faster.
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:20.040]   So if you have a calcium score of two and really bad teeth, your calcium score will
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   go up.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.960]   If you have gum disease, your calcium score will likely go up faster than if you didn't.
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:29.160]   So I sadly, I don't know why, my buddy who was a dental guy said, "Hey, just floss the
[00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.160]   ones you want to keep."
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:35.880]   10, 15 years ago, I kind of laughed at him and now I like regret not flossing regularly
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:37.760]   because it matters.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:41.960]   So there's something called MyPaste, M-I-P-A-S-T, which is kind of a special toothpaste that
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:45.500]   you use after your toothpaste that helps with gum health.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:46.500]   We just talked about gum health.
[00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:47.500]   We could go to eye health.
[00:46:47.500 --> 00:46:52.560]   There's 99 other versions of things that you could do depending on what the issue is, if
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   there's a problem.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:56.240]   And then of course, if I had just flossed, I wouldn't have that problem.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:58.320]   Then there's the proactive things you can do to prevent things.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.640]   But these are investments you have to make.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:02.160]   They're investments in time, investments in all these different things.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:07.000]   So a lot of people, they'd rather treat the problem when it happens than spend all this
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.420]   time preventing something that they can't imagine could happen.
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:15.080]   So that's kind of a psychological pretzel people have to like engage in, imagining their
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.360]   future selves.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:18.480]   So we started with this, who are you?
[00:47:18.480 --> 00:47:22.560]   Where you ran through a bunch of tests, a lot of blood work, a few other things.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.560]   I think the next one that you talk about is how are you?
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:30.160]   So how are you is really, what does your life look like?
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.240]   I mean, you wake up in the morning and then you go to bed, right?
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.000]   And absent those moments when you're sleeping, what does your life look like?
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   What are your relationships?
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:42.360]   I've come up with this concept called vitality signs, which is not vital signs.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:48.400]   And vitality signs are measures of your relationship with things in the world.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:54.200]   So the relationship, so how are you is like, how is your relationship with your parents?
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:57.040]   How is your relationship with your children if you have them?
[00:47:57.040 --> 00:48:02.940]   How is your relationship with your primary relationship, your spouse or girlfriend, boyfriend?
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.800]   And if you don't have a spouse, girlfriend, boyfriend, how's your relationship with the
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:08.280]   absence of that?
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.560]   Does that cause you anxiety?
[00:48:09.560 --> 00:48:10.560]   Are you cool with it?
[00:48:10.560 --> 00:48:13.000]   Like, because all these things are going to inform a bigger picture.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.760]   What is your relationship with money?
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.040]   Are you obsessively trying to get more?
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.240]   Are you super happy with what you got?
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:20.000]   Like what is your relationship with it?
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.360]   What is your relationship with time?
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.400]   What is your relationship with your past?
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.640]   What is your relationship with your vanity?
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.200]   Are you obsessively concerned about how you look or do you not give a shit?
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:30.360]   Like somewhere in between.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:33.200]   What is your relationship with sex and love?
[00:48:33.200 --> 00:48:36.440]   So, there's all these different components and ultimately, based on these things, we'll
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:39.760]   start to get a framework of - like if someone doesn't talk to their parents anymore, "Oh
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:43.120]   yeah, I don't talk to my parents anymore" or "Me and my sister haven't talked for years",
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:44.720]   that person's got a - there's a problem there.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:45.840]   There's a real problem there.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:51.040]   Now, there's a hole in that person's life in some way or there's some deficit, whether
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:54.760]   they blow it off or not, it's true, you can't skip it.
[00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.960]   You have to like acknowledge what that is.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:49:01.720]   So, the "how are you" is like all those things I just said from the vitality signs, but more
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.800]   importantly is what do you do?
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.800]   What are your habits?
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:08.840]   What do you do that you should do more of and what are the things that you should do
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.080]   less of?
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.640]   And what are the things that you're not doing at all that you should be doing?
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:15.720]   So, you have to examine your habits.
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:18.520]   So, that's the "how are you" and it's your mental health.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   Like are you in a good state?
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   Do you wake up happy?
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:21.520]   Do you wake up sad?
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:28.160]   So, these kind of ladder up to your overall - I'll call it the happiness or contentedness
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:32.360]   quotient with your existence, your existential quotient.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   Where are you?
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   How are you?
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.680]   If I run through that thing, I'll tell you like "oh yeah, that guy drinks a lot, doesn't
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:37.720]   sleep enough.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:40.720]   That person over indexes on sex versus love".
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:46.280]   Whatever these things are, who you are and how you are, then set you on a trajectory.
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:49.520]   And so, the third bucket is what is your trajectory?
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:53.600]   I have a slide that I generally show people which shows like here you are when you're
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.780]   born and here's you are when you're dead.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:59.600]   You can go between the ages of 0 and 24, you're growing and between the age of 24 and death,
[00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:00.600]   you're aging.
[00:50:00.600 --> 00:50:02.920]   So, what is the slope of the curve of aging?
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:04.300]   Are you above normal?
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.300]   Are you below normal?
[00:50:05.300 --> 00:50:06.880]   Are you a super ager?
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:08.620]   Meaning are you age super fast?
[00:50:08.620 --> 00:50:11.400]   Those things can be measured based on who you are and how you are.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:15.060]   So, if you're constantly doing like a check-in on who you are and you're doing a check-in
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.580]   on how you are, you can kind of look at this trajectory and kind of know which one you're
[00:50:19.580 --> 00:50:20.580]   going to be.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:22.420]   You control your destiny.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.880]   No one's making you do the things you're doing that you shouldn't and no one's not making
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:26.880]   you not do.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:31.260]   It's just you get in the way of yourself and nothing screws up a great story like data,
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.780]   which is why I'm super happy that there's all these devices that can measure things
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:35.780]   now.
[00:50:35.780 --> 00:50:40.080]   For example, there's a blood test from a company called Soma Logic proteomic test and it can
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:44.140]   tell you with like a high degree of accuracy what your four-year risk of a heart attack
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:45.140]   is.
[00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:46.140]   It's like a $600 test.
[00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:47.140]   It's a blood test.
[00:50:47.140 --> 00:50:48.140]   You don't need a calcium score.
[00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:49.860]   The world's moving to blood, not scans.
[00:50:49.860 --> 00:50:54.740]   So, all these fancy full body scan places are like I don't see their future much and
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:58.300]   they're expensive and the technology is getting so much better with AI and blood and breath.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:01.740]   And there's a company called Owlstone that you can breathe into and it'll tell you how
[00:51:01.740 --> 00:51:06.820]   your liver, your kidneys are, your intestines, the health of them through volatile organic
[00:51:06.820 --> 00:51:07.820]   compounds.
[00:51:07.820 --> 00:51:11.260]   So, the cadence of check-ins, who am I?
[00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:16.980]   And then the intellectual honesty of how am I and what am I doing is what leads you on
[00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:18.080]   this trajectory.
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:21.060]   And if you really want to live a long and healthy life, which I think people call health
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:23.140]   span, just have to look at these things.
[00:51:23.140 --> 00:51:24.140]   You can't look away.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:27.380]   You just need to be honest about what you're doing and who you are and what you should
[00:51:27.380 --> 00:51:31.060]   be doing more of and whether that's diagnostic, therapeutic.
[00:51:31.060 --> 00:51:33.740]   Like I have a friend who's a chef who had Crohn's disease.
[00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:35.940]   He was on methotrexate and all these hardcore drugs.
[00:51:35.940 --> 00:51:36.940]   And then one day he said, "You know what?
[00:51:36.940 --> 00:51:39.620]   I'm going to like radically change everything about my life."
[00:51:39.620 --> 00:51:43.660]   He's now off everything, all symptoms are gone and he just eats whole foods and he got
[00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:45.340]   off the pharmaceutical train.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:49.220]   And Nestle, by the way, they make sugar foods and then they make diabetes pills.
[00:51:49.220 --> 00:51:50.580]   So, they've got the whole ecosystem.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.900]   They get you sick and then they treat you.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:53.460]   But that's like a vicious cycle of whatever.
[00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:55.520]   I mean, a lot of companies do that too.
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.660]   For people that want to optimize their health, they just have to look at what they're - like
[00:52:00.660 --> 00:52:03.100]   your fork is a weapon.
[00:52:03.100 --> 00:52:06.780]   This year, I'm excited to learn as much as possible from the world's best minds.
[00:52:06.780 --> 00:52:11.660]   And an amazing way I do that is with Masterclass, where you can learn anytime, anywhere and
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.660]   at your own pace.
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:15.780]   And I'm so excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.900]   With over 2,500 classes from a range of world-class instructors, that thing you always wanted
[00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:22.740]   to do is closer than you think.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:26.580]   Seriously, I feel like every time I want to learn something new, I can find a class on
[00:52:26.580 --> 00:52:29.100]   the topic from one of the best in the world.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:30.100]   Want to negotiate better?
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:33.580]   FBI hostage negotiator Chris Voss's class is amazing.
[00:52:33.580 --> 00:52:34.580]   Want to be funnier?
[00:52:34.580 --> 00:52:39.060]   Steve Martin and Judd Apatow both have great classes teaching comedy.
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:41.380]   Or maybe you just want to dive into the science of better sleep?
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.020]   Well, Matt Walker is the best in the world and he has a class as well.
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:48.320]   I could go on and on, so you'll just have to take a look yourself.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.860]   Because the depth of knowledge the instructors have and the quality of the experience on
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:53.660]   Masterclass is so good.
[00:52:53.660 --> 00:52:55.900]   I highly recommend you check it out.

[00:53:13.580 --> 00:53:17.900]   I wish I could say I'm eating a fully balanced diet every day, but the reality is that I'm
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:18.900]   not.
[00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:23.180]   So I love having an easy way to get my daily nutritional insurance, which is why I kick
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:27.620]   start every day with AG1 from Athletic Greens and I'm excited to be partnering with them
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.620]   for this episode.
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:33.740]   AG1 has been in my routine for the past six months because I think it's the best option

[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:53.460]   So I want to take an example from this whole process, which is personal to me, which is
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.460]   had high cholesterol.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.460]   How high?
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.460]   HDL 48, LDL 155.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   LDL 155, that's high.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.460]   And how old are you?
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.460]   I'm 38.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.460]   Okay.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:07.860]   So over the last few years, LDL range 138 to 155.
[00:55:07.860 --> 00:55:13.700]   So I got a test, had a doctor at Sutter and it wasn't because I picked this person.
[00:55:13.700 --> 00:55:17.100]   Turns out I had shingles and I just needed a doctor to prescribe something.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:18.540]   They were like, go see your primary care physician.
[00:55:18.540 --> 00:55:19.540]   I didn't have one.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.700]   I picked whoever had the next open appointment.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:24.020]   They went in, they were like, let's review your blood work.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:28.300]   And they went through and the advice was, and I'm reading this quote because she sent
[00:55:28.300 --> 00:55:30.340]   me a note after the blood work was done for my cholesterol.
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:34.900]   She said, your cholesterol is 206 with HDL 48 and LDL 155.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:37.080]   Advise low fat, high fiber diet.
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:38.080]   Let's repeat in a year.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.080]   Take care.
[00:55:39.080 --> 00:55:40.100]   That was the message.
[00:55:40.100 --> 00:55:43.460]   My reaction to that after talking to a few friends was like, I feel like maybe there
[00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:45.180]   should be more going on in this process.
[00:55:45.180 --> 00:55:47.860]   There's a lot more information that needs to be, yeah.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:51.460]   And so a couple of friends said, oh, you should probably go get your ApoB tested.
[00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:53.820]   You should go look at more data.
[00:55:53.820 --> 00:55:58.660]   What ended up happening, and this took two or three years because it just did.
[00:55:58.660 --> 00:56:01.660]   Finally, I found a doctor who was like, oh, you should go get a calcium score.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:02.660]   I did.
[00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:04.140]   Was that covered by insurance?
[00:56:04.140 --> 00:56:05.140]   I don't know.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.380]   It was two weeks ago, so I don't know yet.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:10.380]   The hospital that did it told me they pre-cleared it with insurance and I wasn't gonna have
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.900]   to pay for it, but unclear.
[00:56:11.900 --> 00:56:13.980]   I haven't seen the payment come through.
[00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:19.660]   But calcium score came back a two on one artery, zero on everything else.
[00:56:19.660 --> 00:56:21.300]   So two is a real number, by the way.
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.300]   It's not zero.
[00:56:22.300 --> 00:56:23.300]   Two is a real number.
[00:56:23.300 --> 00:56:26.340]   You have early evidence of coronary artery disease.
[00:56:26.340 --> 00:56:27.340]   Yes.
[00:56:27.340 --> 00:56:31.340]   Now, I'm not saying that three years could have prevented any of it, but the idea that
[00:56:31.340 --> 00:56:35.620]   three years ago I was messaging with a doctor whose advice was like, hey, just like kind
[00:56:35.620 --> 00:56:38.060]   of eat healthy and we'll talk in a year.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:42.320]   Seems like if I were someone going through a lot of the process that you mentioned of
[00:56:42.320 --> 00:56:45.500]   looking at some of your data, trying to take some of these tests, trying to figure out
[00:56:45.500 --> 00:56:46.780]   where you're at.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:53.040]   How do you evaluate and analyze it when you don't have access to someone like you who's
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:54.500]   maybe done a lot more of the research?
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.840]   What does the average person do when they see a number?
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:57.840]   It seems high.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:00.260]   They talk to their doctors like, we'll deal with it later.
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:04.020]   Going back to the beginning of the conversation, a lot of the medical system we have is like,
[00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:05.700]   let's treat it when it's a problem.
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:09.400]   Like high cholesterol, young person, maybe it's not a problem yet.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:12.980]   But clearly, if I've had high cholesterol for five, six years, and I had...
[00:57:12.980 --> 00:57:14.700]   Or maybe all your life.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:15.700]   All my life.
[00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:16.700]   Yeah.
[00:57:16.700 --> 00:57:18.340]   Like, maybe we could have been doing something different.
[00:57:18.340 --> 00:57:22.020]   So I guess one question is just, how do you interpret these?
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:24.700]   How should someone try to find the right person?
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:29.820]   Could you find the right primary care physician at any hospital medical practice that could
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:30.980]   be a partner here?
[00:57:30.980 --> 00:57:32.940]   And I just happened to have the wrong one.
[00:57:32.940 --> 00:57:34.140]   I don't know.
[00:57:34.140 --> 00:57:38.900]   So I think it starts with, if your LDL is greater than 100.
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:40.540]   Let's just use that as a marker.
[00:57:40.540 --> 00:57:43.740]   Forget about all the rest of the APO and all the rest of the everything else.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.860]   If it's greater than 100, then you say, how long has it been that way?
[00:57:46.860 --> 00:57:52.860]   We're not starting to test kids, teenagers, because we know the parents' cholesterols
[00:57:52.860 --> 00:57:53.860]   are off the map.
[00:57:53.860 --> 00:57:56.820]   When we get new members and the parents are off, we go check the kids.
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:57:58.920]   And if the kids are up, that's never been done before.
[00:57:58.920 --> 00:58:01.780]   Just a way to think about it before I answer the question specifically, because I think
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:03.260]   it's important.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:08.000]   When people smoke cigarettes, we as doctors ask them, how many years have you been smoking
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:10.660]   cigarettes and how many packs a day?
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:12.760]   And we call them pack years.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:17.420]   So if you've smoked one pack a day for 10 years, you have a 10-pack year history.
[00:58:17.420 --> 00:58:22.340]   If you smoked two packs a day for 10 years, you have a 20-pack year history.
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:25.340]   That's the same as smoking one pack a day for 20 years.
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:30.860]   So it's what is the load of this chemical, which ultimately ladders up to risk of heart
[00:58:30.860 --> 00:58:33.420]   disease, diabetes, and lung cancer.
[00:58:33.420 --> 00:58:35.780]   So we call them pack years.
[00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.780]   So now, the more sophisticated lipidologists are talking about LDL years.
[00:58:40.780 --> 00:58:45.500]   How long has your LDL been high circulating through your body?
[00:58:45.500 --> 00:58:46.500]   So there's LDL years.
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:50.220]   So if your LDL is high and you have a calcium square of 2 and you're 38, you probably had
[00:58:50.220 --> 00:58:53.660]   a high LDL for a long time and you don't have the genetic subtype that doesn't care.
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:57.220]   I don't know if you smoke or there's other things that you do, but the first thing is
[00:58:57.220 --> 00:59:00.180]   get to some answer of, do I need to do something else?
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:03.700]   And you can go deep into the weeds of LDL.
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:06.500]   I have patients that want to optimize their LDLs and stuff.
[00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:11.580]   They'll pay some doctors that like hold themselves out for $100,000 to optimize their LDL.
[00:59:11.580 --> 00:59:15.860]   And it's just like, you're optimizing 0.001% of your body.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:17.180]   It's already pretty good.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:21.940]   So the question is, if you did her diet, like let's just say you followed her diet and said,
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.700]   "Okay, doc, I'm going to do that.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.140]   When do we check it again?"
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:26.400]   And she said, "A year."
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:32.940]   My answer would be, "Well, I want to know if the diet story works sooner than later,
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:37.100]   because I don't want a whole another LDL year to go by that high.
[00:59:37.100 --> 00:59:39.500]   So can we please check it in four to six months?"
[00:59:39.500 --> 00:59:42.540]   But you actually have to do an honest change of your diet.
[00:59:42.540 --> 00:59:47.820]   And if it goes down to like a hundred, you know the answer.
[00:59:47.820 --> 00:59:48.820]   You know the answer.
[00:59:48.820 --> 00:59:50.480]   Keep your diet like that.
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:56.220]   And even if you knew your calcium score was a two now, and you knew that you could lower
[00:59:56.220 --> 01:00:01.580]   it with diet down to like 80, and to give you a calcium score of greater than zero,
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:03.140]   you've got to get your LDL below 80.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:04.940]   That's what kind of our guidelines are here.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:07.580]   If you can't do that with diet, then you need to be on something.
[01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.340]   You need to be on a statin, sadly.
[01:00:09.340 --> 01:00:14.220]   And if you are so adamant about taking statins, which is basically there's a lot of different
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:19.060]   kinds, but there's an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, but that's a fancy name for the molecule.
[01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:23.740]   Then you can eat red yeast rice every day, because that's what is a statin.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:27.460]   If you can find a way to put that in a soup and eat it every day, you could lower your
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:29.500]   cholesterol and your LDL that way.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:34.540]   So I think that whenever you find out something's abnormal, you have to think about, okay, intervention
[01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.300]   retesting, prevention retest.
[01:00:36.300 --> 01:00:41.300]   How quickly can I find out if I can make a difference without pills?
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.560]   And if I can't, what pill do I go on?
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.460]   Because once you get a calcium score that's positive, you just know now that you're committed
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.020]   to not having that number go up.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:54.500]   That number goes up with the LDL staying at 155, but then you have a heart attack at some
[01:00:54.500 --> 01:00:56.780]   point in your life and that sucks.
[01:00:56.780 --> 01:00:57.780]   So you don't want that.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.580]   And I didn't mean, by the way, to make this about me.
[01:00:59.580 --> 01:01:00.580]   No, no, no.
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:05.220]   But I think if people get into your head and hear me talk to you as though this is them,
[01:01:05.220 --> 01:01:07.580]   I think everybody can take something away from.
[01:01:07.580 --> 01:01:10.700]   If you get something that doesn't look right and doesn't feel right, then dig in.
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.660]   Don't let that doctor get away with "eat fiber, let's check in a year."
[01:01:14.660 --> 01:01:18.740]   By the way, one thing that I realize in hindsight, a lot of people moving around a lot, I've
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:23.300]   probably had five primary care doctors since I graduated college.
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:27.660]   And I went back and looked and it's like, I don't have my blood tests too far back,
[01:01:27.660 --> 01:01:31.660]   but I've got them about seven years back and I've had high cholesterol for seven years
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.100]   at least.
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:36.780]   But I had one doctor and then I had another doctor, then I had another doctor.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:41.220]   But I had one doctor for three or four years at that cholesterol, but never really pushed
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:42.600]   back, said to do anything.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.260]   But part of that's because going back to what I was talking about earlier about the medical
[01:01:47.260 --> 01:01:48.660]   system moves slowly.
[01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:53.380]   We never thought ever of treating a 20 to 30 year old or a 30 to 40 year old with statins
[01:01:53.380 --> 01:01:55.860]   unless they had a credible family history.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.820]   There are people that have heart attacks in their 30s, like they have crazy genetic cholesterol
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.300]   problems, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, they can get these problems.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:08.540]   But the medical field, like we're not aggressive with younger people because like you said,
[01:02:08.540 --> 01:02:09.580]   the system's reactive.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:12.380]   It waits for you to get sick and then they make a lot of money.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.740]   Pharmaceutical companies make a lot of money on preventing the heart attack, but the hospitals
[01:02:16.740 --> 01:02:20.660]   and the doctors and the surgeons and the cardiologists and everybody in the food chain doesn't make
[01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:22.980]   that much money from you not having a heart attack.
[01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:27.500]   Not to be hyper perverse about it, but it's just the way the system's designed.
[01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:31.900]   And oh, by the way, that doctor that saw you, they're not accountable to your future outcome
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:32.900]   at all.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.340]   And they don't know you because you're moving around, just another kid in the mix coming
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:39.460]   through their system, which is why I really believe that these long-term relationships
[01:02:39.460 --> 01:02:40.460]   matter.
[01:02:40.460 --> 01:02:42.660]   I think that everyone's trying to find the quick fix, the transactional, where's the
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:46.300]   chat bot for healthcare so I can blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:50.500]   I think at some point, but you really want someone that knows you, gets you and is going
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:53.820]   to tell you the truth and double check on things.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:55.660]   Is there a way you'd tell someone to interview?
[01:02:55.660 --> 01:02:58.140]   If I'm like, "Okay, obviously this one wasn't a good fit.
[01:02:58.140 --> 01:02:59.660]   I need a new primary care physician."
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:03.740]   There's not an easy way to find someone that I know of.
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:06.580]   Are there questions you would ask them to try to figure out if they're the right fit
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   for you?
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:10.460]   I would ask everybody what is their perspective on prevention?
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:14.980]   I would ask them what is their perspective on productivity?
[01:03:14.980 --> 01:03:18.020]   I would ask them how they hold themselves accountable to your outcome?
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:22.420]   Because a lot of doctors feel like, "Once you leave my office, how am I going to enforce
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:23.420]   anything?
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:24.420]   It's your life."
[01:03:24.420 --> 01:03:27.700]   I would say, "Hey, look, I sometimes am my own worst enemy and I'm busy.
[01:03:27.700 --> 01:03:31.320]   How can we do this together so that you hold me accountable and I hold you accountable?
[01:03:31.320 --> 01:03:33.140]   Can we both hold ourselves accountable here?"
[01:03:33.140 --> 01:03:35.140]   If the answer is like, "I don't have time for that.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:36.140]   I'm just too busy."
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:37.460]   Probably not the right one.
[01:03:37.460 --> 01:03:41.300]   This goes to a meta theme here, which is the rise of what I'll call concierge medicine
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:44.860]   or what I'll call membership-based medicine.
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:48.620]   In primary care, I'm probably one of the grandfathers of the field because I started
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:52.700]   a kind of a concierge practice when it wasn't really a thing in 1998.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:53.700]   I gave out my cell phone.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:55.140]   I said people can call me whenever they wanted.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.500]   I would follow up with people.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:01.580]   I would use email and text in the late 90s and early 2000s because I wanted communication
[01:04:01.580 --> 01:04:03.820]   to be the most important thing.
[01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:05.800]   Because you'll get the good outcome if you have communication.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:08.060]   You won't get a good outcome if you don't have communication.
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.940]   Because like communication is like more than just data.
[01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:14.060]   It's holding people accountable and building trust.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.420]   So one medical didn't start off as one.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.620]   They're like a freshman version of a concierge practice, meaning that I think they charge
[01:04:20.620 --> 01:04:22.900]   $159 a year, but they take insurance.
[01:04:22.900 --> 01:04:27.780]   Then you have companies like MDVIP that charge $3,000 a year.
[01:04:27.780 --> 01:04:30.380]   There's a group called Roamed, R-O-A-M-D.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:34.620]   It's an association that I'm part of that has doctors all around the country that like
[01:04:34.620 --> 01:04:36.980]   have doctors that are membership-based.
[01:04:36.980 --> 01:04:42.060]   And they can charge anywhere between, I don't know, $50 a month to $500 or $1,000 a month
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:43.440]   or $2,000 a month.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:48.900]   It all depends on what level of investment you want to make based on what you think exists
[01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.900]   out there.
[01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.900]   So there are these practices out there.
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:55.940]   Some people call them direct primary care, DPC, direct primary care.
[01:04:55.940 --> 01:04:57.340]   Some people call it membership-based medicine.
[01:04:57.340 --> 01:04:58.620]   Some people call it concierge medicine.
[01:04:58.620 --> 01:05:00.300]   Some people call it private medicine.
[01:05:00.300 --> 01:05:05.380]   But I think that one has to look at their - if you make $100,000 a year and you say,
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:07.580]   "Okay, I want to invest in my health."
[01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:13.000]   What percentage of your $100,000 will you invest in your health?
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.980]   So we know that you invest a certain amount in a cell phone and a Wi-Fi package.
[01:05:16.980 --> 01:05:18.900]   And we can talk about what you invest in technology.
[01:05:18.900 --> 01:05:20.500]   You've got their own personal budget.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.300]   I know that you talk about this a lot.
[01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:26.780]   But a lot of people say, "Well, I have a membership to Equinox or pick the gym and that's, I don't
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:28.720]   know, $60 a month.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.520]   So that's $500 a year.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:34.340]   So I invest - so $500 a year is 0.5% of your income.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.900]   I don't have a membership to Equinox, but I'm guessing you don't either because I'm
[01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.980]   pretty sure it's like more like $100 or $200.
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:39.980]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.160]   I'm not a member of a gym.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.420]   I have four kids and I've got a gym in my house.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:44.920]   Like I'm running around all the time.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.800]   So even if it's $100, let's say $100, that's $1,200 a month, that's 1.2% of your budget.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:51.100]   But that's not investing in your health.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:52.480]   That's investing in your fitness.
[01:05:52.480 --> 01:05:53.800]   So I just want to be really clear.
[01:05:53.800 --> 01:05:55.900]   I mean, which is a subset of your health.
[01:05:55.900 --> 01:05:59.780]   But if you really want to make the big investment on a doctor to have a relationship with that
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:04.700]   you can go back and forth with and really build up a rapport and then kind of a bilateral
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:09.860]   mutual transparent accountability quotient, you should ask yourself if it's all invest
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.860]   4%.
[01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:14.460]   So if it's $4,000, you can find a lot of doctors in the membership-based world for
[01:06:14.460 --> 01:06:20.300]   $4,000 a year and they'll use your insurance to do the blood test, to get the MRI, the
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:21.980]   CAT scan, to send you to the specialist.
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.460]   So you're only paying for a quarterback.
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:28.340]   You're investing in someone to oversee it, to be your partner.
[01:06:28.340 --> 01:06:31.100]   Your insurance will still be used for everything else.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.860]   So that's how I would think about - and by the way, this field is growing.
[01:06:33.860 --> 01:06:39.060]   There was a report by Grandview where the concierge medical market is like the fastest
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.780]   growing field in medicine.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:44.380]   It's the fastest growing sector in all of health and biotech and everything.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.940]   It's expected to double or triple in the next eight years.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:48.060]   So why is that?
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:52.620]   Because doctors want to help people and they want that principal agent problem gone.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:54.040]   They want to be accountable to you.
[01:06:54.040 --> 01:06:56.680]   So if you don't like me, if I'm not doing my job, guess what?
[01:06:56.680 --> 01:06:58.780]   You fire me, I just lost revenue.
[01:06:58.780 --> 01:07:02.420]   If I'm an insurance taking doctor and you fire me, it doesn't matter.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.680]   Someone will fill that spot in a nanosecond because I've got a three-month waiting list.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:10.260]   So I don't have to care if people like me or don't like my outcome.
[01:07:10.260 --> 01:07:14.780]   Someone's going to fill that insurance-based principal agent problem slot because there's
[01:07:14.780 --> 01:07:15.820]   no accountability.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:18.060]   There's no true straight line.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:19.300]   There are dotted lines everywhere.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.380]   There's no straight lines.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:22.700]   The straight line is between the doctor and the insurance company because the insurance
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:25.860]   company can call the doctor and say, "Hey, we're not paying you that much because you're
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:26.860]   not whatever.
[01:07:26.860 --> 01:07:27.860]   We don't like you."
[01:07:27.860 --> 01:07:31.100]   And one doctor against an insurance company or the hospital system will say or the employer,
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:34.620]   the one medicals, not to knock on them, they'll tell their doctors, "Hey, we need more revenue.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:38.060]   So instead of seeing 14 patients a day, please see 15 patients a day."
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:41.300]   So if you're seeing 15 patients a day, that means each patient gets one less minute, which
[01:07:41.300 --> 01:07:44.980]   means that's one more email, one less minute, one more person.
[01:07:44.980 --> 01:07:47.900]   Like quality just starts to exponentially erode.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:52.260]   I know that Roamed is going to be building a physician finder for somebody that wants
[01:07:52.260 --> 01:07:57.020]   high-quality private membership-based physicians this quarter or next quarter.
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.020]   That's where I'd start.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:02.060]   I don't think Yelp reviews or any of these health grades reviews are useful at all.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:06.000]   I don't buy them because people want to go to the Apple store, not the doctor store.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.060]   So when you go to a doctor's store to rate somebody, like unless you're like a professional
[01:08:10.060 --> 01:08:12.020]   rater, you're usually there to complain.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:16.260]   I wasn't thinking about it when you started your practice, but it seemed like early on
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:18.020]   it was two things.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:24.740]   It was the quarterback and the like 24/7 access, we'll come to your house kind of stuff.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:28.920]   And what I've been looking for since is I want someone who charges enough that they
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.220]   have free time in their day to read some research or have someone on their staff to read research.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.220]   100%.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:38.180]   I want someone who's thinking proactively about my health, but like I can wait for someone
[01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:40.500]   to respond tomorrow or on Monday.
[01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.500]   That's right.
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:43.940]   So it's like that middle ground is the company that I want to see.
[01:08:43.940 --> 01:08:45.200]   And there are tons of them.
[01:08:45.200 --> 01:08:50.580]   There's nothing at scale because all the ones at scale, one forward, partially pick the
[01:08:50.580 --> 01:08:52.720]   brand, they've all raised money.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.140]   So they have investors.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.860]   So it becomes a profitability story versus a great healthcare story.
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:03.320]   Most of the onesie-twosie small versions of concierge medicine, it's somebody that's like,
[01:09:03.320 --> 01:09:04.620]   this is my business.
[01:09:04.620 --> 01:09:09.500]   My revenue depends on me doing a great job for you, not on somebody telling me to do
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.860]   more or faster or whatever.
[01:09:11.860 --> 01:09:15.440]   So I think there's some consolidation in that space, but I think you have to be really clear
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:17.620]   on what drives this doctor.
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:21.620]   And you want a doctor that's thinking about you when they're not in front of you, right?
[01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.380]   Doing that research, I read an article about multiple sclerosis this morning.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:26.460]   I have a multiple sclerosis patient and I'm like, "Hey, guess what?
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:27.460]   There's this new research."
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.460]   Just heads up and tracking this.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:32.460]   Nothing to do here, but like maybe in a year or two, there'll be some interesting developments.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.560]   And by the way, we talked about all these costs.
[01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:40.180]   If your company has an FSA plan, you could put money in pre-tax each year and be able
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:41.820]   to use that for your medical expenses.
[01:09:41.820 --> 01:09:45.280]   So one way, and I haven't really thought through this completely before.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:46.280]   I'm not going to recommend it.
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.880]   I'm just going to throw it out there.
[01:09:47.880 --> 01:09:49.120]   You can't change it mid-year.
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:54.580]   So one way to force yourself to have a health budget is to just commit to put a little bit
[01:09:54.580 --> 01:09:56.100]   more in your FSA each year.
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:09:58.380]   So maybe say, "This year, I'm going to put two grand."
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:01.060]   And obviously, we're recording this in January, so it's a little late for this year.
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.980]   But next year, you could say, "I'm going to put two grand or three grand in my FSA."
[01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:05.460]   You do have to use it or lose it.
[01:10:05.460 --> 01:10:08.400]   Usually, maybe you could roll over, I think this year, $650.
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.460]   But it'll kind of force you to try to get more serious about these things.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:16.500]   Because if you're listening to this and you're like me, at least, it's really hard to be
[01:10:16.500 --> 01:10:17.740]   like, "Oh, do I want to do this test?
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:19.200]   It costs $500."
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:23.800]   For some reason, there are things in life that it just seems like, "I grew up, medical
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:24.800]   treatment should be free.
[01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:27.480]   If it's not free, it seems harder to spend."
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:30.940]   It's not hard for me to buy a new iPhone, but it's really hard for me to spend $200
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   on my health.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:36.060]   That goes back to this concept of there are no consumers in healthcare.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:39.060]   I've never seen a consumer in the ICU type of a thing.
[01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.700]   Consumers have a profile that when you want to go to the iPhone, you have all the agency,
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:46.860]   all the free will, all the power, all the resources, those decisions are yours.
[01:10:46.860 --> 01:10:48.780]   When you go to the healthcare system, they're not.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:49.820]   You've lost it all.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:54.220]   So that's why getting a concierge doctor or a membership-based doctor is you're investing
[01:10:54.220 --> 01:10:59.500]   in somebody that's got your back, that's going to work with you, that's going to be co-piloting
[01:10:59.500 --> 01:11:02.900]   your care with you, and that's going to actually care about you and care about your outcomes.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:06.340]   I believe you don't go to eight years of medical school and college and residency because you
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.340]   want to make money.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.340]   You're a healer.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:10.380]   There are some people that go into finance and want to be hedge fund guys.
[01:11:10.380 --> 01:11:13.700]   There are some people that want to be artists and architects and everybody wants to make
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:14.820]   a good living.
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:19.060]   But you don't go into medicine unless you're maybe a plastic surgeon or a cosmetic dentist
[01:11:19.060 --> 01:11:21.660]   or whatever, because that's where big money is.
[01:11:21.660 --> 01:11:26.380]   Vanity, that's healing some psychological wound somewhere deep in your past.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380]   And so, I'll give it to them.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.780]   There are some healing components there.
[01:11:28.780 --> 01:11:31.580]   But our world is like, this is the everything person.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:35.540]   This is like all facets of your existence and health need to be under my umbrella and
[01:11:35.540 --> 01:11:37.460]   I'm a healer and I want to help you.
[01:11:37.460 --> 01:11:40.140]   And like, we're naturally empathic, we're naturally long-term.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.820]   We feel bad when something bad happens, there's a bad outcome.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:46.900]   Empathy and compassion, I think, are part of the frameworks for going into medicine
[01:11:46.900 --> 01:11:48.460]   in the first place.
[01:11:48.460 --> 01:11:50.660]   And I think a lot of these doctors are getting burned out.
[01:11:50.660 --> 01:11:54.700]   There's a huge physician burnout because these big companies, the medical industrial complex
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:58.700]   is forcing them to see more faster, check more emails.
[01:11:58.700 --> 01:12:01.300]   Kaiser doctors have to check their emails in 48 hours.
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:04.060]   They have 2,500 patients per doctor.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:10.380]   So, imagine the amount of emails with no barrier to email and they don't get paid for email.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:13.540]   Like the Cleveland Clinic or the Mayo Clinic, I can't remember which one, they just announced
[01:12:13.540 --> 01:12:16.980]   a program that every email to your doctor is going to cost you 50 bucks.
[01:12:16.980 --> 01:12:18.740]   So, now you have to be really thoughtful.
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:21.420]   You can't just like - which I think is good for doctors because then at least there's
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.740]   some barrier to someone posing some crazy question with three articles to read and look
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:27.260]   at what my brother said.
[01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:31.540]   Like Kaiser will make you respond to that, which is bananas.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:32.900]   These are the ways to really think about it.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:36.540]   I think having someone in your corner is important, even when you're young and healthy because
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:38.320]   you don't want to wait until you're sick.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:39.320]   That's a hope strategy.
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:42.380]   I hope I get a good one when I'm in the ditch.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:46.900]   You want to have somebody on your team because they can see the ditch coming.
[01:12:46.900 --> 01:12:48.540]   Healthcare is super predictable.
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:51.980]   We know you were gonna have a heart attack if you didn't get on top of your lipids.
[01:12:51.980 --> 01:12:53.940]   So now, you're not gonna have a heart attack.
[01:12:53.940 --> 01:12:55.900]   Now let's work on everything else type of thing.
[01:12:55.900 --> 01:12:57.500]   There's lots of ways to think about medicine.
[01:12:57.500 --> 01:13:01.300]   I'm optimistic about a lot of the changes that are coming.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:03.420]   I'm not optimistic that they're gonna happen fast.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:07.100]   I hope that I can be kind of a guiding principle.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:12.660]   I hope people copy what I do all day long to create different versions of it and I'll
[01:13:12.660 --> 01:13:15.300]   say private concierge medicine, whatever.
[01:13:15.300 --> 01:13:16.300]   That's the way it used to be.
[01:13:16.300 --> 01:13:20.020]   You'd pay your primary care doctor until the HMOs came in and they saw that it was a trillion
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.380]   dollar market and now it's got a financial boondoggle.
[01:13:22.380 --> 01:13:25.780]   You gave us some good tips on what we can do to try to take some of this into our own
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.440]   hands, find someone that might be a better partner.
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.000]   I think that's really helpful.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   But you write about stuff.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   You have podcasts.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:36.160]   Where can people stay on top of what you're learning in your practice and online?
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:39.340]   So if you want to see what I'm reading and you want to get my point of view on what I
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:44.880]   think about the latest science because I read about five to ten articles a day is on LinkedIn.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:46.980]   For now, I'm Jordan Schlein at LinkedIn.
[01:13:46.980 --> 01:13:47.980]   There's not a lot of those.
[01:13:47.980 --> 01:13:48.980]   No C in Schlein.
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:49.980]   It's just S-H-L-A-I-N.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:57.200]   I post one or two things a day on longevity and/or science that I think is compelling
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:13:59.420]   and interesting that people need to pay attention to.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:03.900]   And if you want to go subscribe to our podcast, it's Inside Medicine.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.540]   You can find it on Spotify and Apple.
[01:14:05.540 --> 01:14:07.900]   - Or wherever you're listening to this right now.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900]   Awesome.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:10.860]   Jordan, thank you so much for being here.
[01:14:10.860 --> 01:14:11.860]   - Awesome, Chris.
[01:14:11.860 --> 01:14:12.860]   I am super excited.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.420]   And listen, if you want to do this on the regular and pick a health topic and go deep,
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   I'm in.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.420]   - Awesome.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.860]   Okay, we're definitely going to have to get Jordan back on the show because there were
[01:14:22.860 --> 01:14:25.380]   so many topics we just scraped the surface up.
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:29.220]   And I think it could be really cool to do a bit of a health Q&A with him next time.
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.820]   So email me any questions you want me to ask for that episode.
[01:14:32.820 --> 01:14:35.740]   Or if you have any questions on any topic, send me those as well.
[01:14:35.740 --> 01:14:38.100]   I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com.
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:41.460]   And to all the amazing people who've been leaving five-star reviews for the podcast
[01:14:41.460 --> 01:14:43.140]   on Apple, thank you so much.
[01:14:43.140 --> 01:14:48.300]   I had a goal to get to 1000 reviews in 2022, but I came up a few short.
[01:14:48.300 --> 01:14:53.140]   So if you're on an iPhone and you find this show valuable, I'd be so grateful if you could
[01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:56.180]   just spend a few minutes to leave a five-star rating.
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:59.660]   If you have time to write a few words in a review as well, that'd be great.
[01:14:59.660 --> 01:15:03.060]   But even just the quick rating would be so appreciated.
[01:15:03.060 --> 01:15:05.180]   Okay, that's all for this week.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.180]   See you next week.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:06.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:11.180]   (crickets chirping)
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:16.180]   (crickets chirping)
