[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   If the Lord hears our prayers, why do we find it necessary to pray for the same
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.720]   things over and over and over again, Pastor John? Is it not enough just to
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.480]   pray once, and why do we pray repetitively for the same things?
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.640]   Well there's an obedience in it. We'll start there, because Jesus gave at least
[00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:29.960]   two parables in which the point of the parable was "keep on knocking." And so in
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.320]   the parable he said the knocking of this widow, "Give me vindication, give me
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.920]   vindication," wore the judge out. So he yielded and gave her vindication, and
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.160]   then he said, "If that evil judge is willing to yield, then you know your God
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.680]   in heaven is going to yield." And yet the point was, I think the chapter begins, he
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:54.000]   told in this parable to the effect that they ought always to pray and not lose
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:01.320]   heart. So clearly, "Vindicate us, hallowed be your name, bring your kingdom," or "Save
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.700]   my lost loved one," is to be repeated. Now that does raise the question, what's the
[00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.000]   difference between that and the vain repetitions of Matthew 6, where it says,
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.880]   "Don't pile up your words like the Gentiles who think that they will be
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.000]   heard for their many words." And I think the difference is, drawing out long
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.480]   prayers in the hopes that multiplied clauses and sentences will somehow make
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.920]   our prayers more appealing to God is what he's opposed to. A very simple,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.400]   "Father, please have mercy, heal Joe." That's the sense. You don't need to say it ten
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.200]   different ways to make it sound good to the prayer meeting. The question is, how
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.200]   do you keep that from becoming vain and meaningless day in and day out? Here's
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.640]   the way I've done it. I have some things that I pray for, I have some people that
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.440]   I care about who are not spiritually where they ought to be, and I name them
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.240]   before God every single day. Here are two things that I do that I think keep it
[00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:17.080]   from being empty repetition. One, I try to mingle into the prayer the kinds of
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.160]   things I'm seeing about God and learning from God in my personal devotions, so
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.680]   that the way I see God this morning because of what I saw in his word fills
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:34.360]   out the longings that I have for those loved ones, so that the words I use and
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:41.040]   the ways I express myself are adjusted daily by the kinds of things I'm
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.680]   seeing in the scriptures. That's number one. Number two, and this is really
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   significant, I think, suppose your wife has cancer. She's had it for a month
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.680]   and now you're praying. You're praying every day, "God, please don't take my wife.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.880]   Don't take my wife. I need her. The children need her. Glorify your..." Now,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.000]   that's going to be a simple prayer for healing every single day. Not a lot
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.240]   of different ways to say "healer," right? But here's what you can say,
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:19.280]   and it's made a big difference. You can say, "Lord, today is Friday. Would you do
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:26.840]   Friday's unique work for my wife? Do Friday's work. Do the work appointed for
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.440]   today. Do the healing work, the sustaining work, the faith-giving work that turns
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.680]   all this for your glory today." So that you don't speak generically every day,
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.280]   you speak specifically for that day's unique challenge and that day's
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.680]   unique work. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for listening to this podcast.
