[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.400]   - We love books at Desiring God, obviously.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.360]   We love to read them and write them
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.560]   and publish them and promote them.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.800]   And Pastor John, you've authored over 60 titles by yourself.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.720]   In light of all those books, though,
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.160]   Steve writes in to ask this,
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.160]   Pastor John, as I view the wonderful books
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.360]   at DesiringGod.org, which books would you recommend
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.160]   reading first as a new believer?
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.320]   - Well, when I read that question,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.880]   I went to the website just to see,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.320]   'cause I haven't done this for a long time,
[00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.600]   just to click on the Books tab.
[00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.600]   And I thought, oh my goodness, I counted almost 80 titles.
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.240]   And I thought, oh, that is overwhelming.
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.480]   What would you do if somebody said,
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.000]   yeah, go check out Desiring God
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.220]   and read one of those books?
[00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.480]   You'd stare at those 80 titles and say,
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.580]   what in the world?
[00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:58.300]   How am I supposed to make any headway in this at all?
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.320]   So that's a good question.
[00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.060]   And I hadn't been thinking about it at all.
[00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.280]   What an overwhelming thing that would be
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.620]   to look at all those.
[00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.180]   So let me give two answers.
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.560]   One for the ordinary person,
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.580]   and I mean a really good, happy, normal, ordinary person
[00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.860]   who wants to grow in his faith,
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.460]   new faith, not knowing much about the Bible.
[00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.020]   And the other answer I'm gonna give,
[00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.200]   just real briefly, is for a non-ordinary person,
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.940]   like a really deep, critical, thinker type
[00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.380]   who asks a lot of questions
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.060]   and likes a lot of systematization and all that stuff.
[00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.180]   So the first answer,
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.340]   which I think is probably the more important one,
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.400]   is what about the ordinary, new believer?
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.860]   Doesn't have a lot of Bible knowledge,
[00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.720]   has recently been converted
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.020]   and brought to trust Jesus as his Savior and Lord,
[00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.940]   wants to start reading and going deeper
[00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.200]   in relation to Christ and through the Scriptures.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.580]   What is my recommendation with regard to these books?
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.500]   And it would be really wrong and a dishonor to the Lord
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.740]   and to the Bible not to say,
[00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.140]   "Look, we don't sell Bibles,
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.180]   but that's the most important book.
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.420]   So read it every day.
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.620]   Read the Bible every day.
[00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.300]   Don't ever let any pipe book replace the Bible.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.940]   My books are only valuable if they reflect the Bible.
[00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.060]   Therefore, why not go to the source
[00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.820]   and get it straight from the horse's mouth, as it were?"
[00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.620]   So yes, Bible every day.
[00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.580]   And all we're trying to do at Desiring God
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.820]   is explain parts of the Bible
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.060]   and apply parts of the Bible to our real life.
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.420]   So here's my answer.
[00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.460]   I'm gonna give you a package of six
[00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.760]   in the order that I would take them, okay?
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.640]   Number one, seeing and savoring Jesus Christ.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.260]   This is the one book I aimed intentionally to write
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:59.260]   for unbelievers to introduce them to who Jesus is
[00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.100]   and how faith happens.
[00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.620]   And even though we're talking right now about a new believer,
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.780]   I think it would be a great starting place
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.620]   for a new believer because everything hangs on Jesus.
[00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.660]   Who is He?
[00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.720]   What did He do?
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.900]   What's He like?
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.260]   Who have I hooked my life up to?
[00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.680]   And of all of my own books,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.260]   that's the one I would go back to most often
[00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.180]   just to get a fresh glimpse of who I love.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.600]   Number two, 50 reasons why Jesus came to die.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:31.400]   Short, two-page chapters
[00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.420]   on what Christ accomplished for us when He died.
[00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.420]   The new believer has seen maybe one or two or three things
[00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.400]   about the death of Christ that has persuaded them
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.140]   they need Him and they're gonna trust Him
[00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.520]   as their Savior to forgive their sins
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.320]   and to get them to heaven and to get them out of hell
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.620]   and to change their lives.
[00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.480]   And there are at least 50 things Jesus accomplished
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.600]   for the new believer
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   and oh, how they need to know these things.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.400]   So just read two pages a day
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.360]   like we did as a family one time with that book
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.060]   and you'll know the glories
[00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.080]   of what Christ accomplished for you.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.920]   Better.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:20.420]   Number three, Finally Alive.
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.060]   This is a book about what it means to be born again.
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.600]   In other words, 50 reasons why Jesus came to die
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   describes the objective historical accomplishment
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.040]   that Christ performed for you as a new believer
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.800]   outside of you.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.540]   Finally Alive focuses on what He did in you.
[00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.540]   And new believers need to know both these things.
[00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.600]   They need to know what God did in history to save them
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.780]   and they need to know what God did in their souls
[00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:53.620]   to save them.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.600]   There's a lot of misunderstanding
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:59.240]   about how God saves people both externally,
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.520]   what happened in the cross
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.460]   and internally what happens in regeneration.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:06.360]   So that's the reason those two books come
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.720]   after seeing and savoring.
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.640]   One, we need to know the cross and what He did there
[00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:12.240]   and we need to know by the Spirit,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.880]   what did He do inside of me?
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.660]   Why did I come to believe?
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.000]   Why do I love Him now when I didn't used to love Him?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.920]   Number four, Battling Unbelief.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.400]   This is a very practical set of chapters
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.440]   that were pulled out of another book,
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.440]   A Future Grace, and it's intended really practically
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.560]   from the get-go to teach you how to fight sin.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.200]   Every new believer has remaining sin
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.080]   and you will until the day you die
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.720]   and the Christian life is a fight.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.760]   Paul said, "I've fought the good fight.
[00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.280]   I've been faithful to the end of my life."
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:54.680]   And this book is intended to help you know how to do that
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:56.900]   so that you don't become a legalist in the fight
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.100]   or lackadaisical in the fight.
[00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.760]   Everybody needs to know how to do Romans 8:13,
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.600]   "Put to death the deeds of the body,"
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:07.800]   and that's what this book is intended to do.
[00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.940]   Number five, The Dangerous Duty of Delight.
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.680]   Now, this takes the turn and gets at the heart
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.160]   of what makes Desiring God, Desiring God.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.400]   What is this website about?
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.800]   Well, we are about helping brand new believers
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.080]   simply be Christian.
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:29.200]   And we're also about pushing on a few special Bible truths
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:31.700]   that help them be happy in God
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.100]   because God gets so much glory
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.880]   when His people are happy in Him.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.760]   And The Dangerous Duty of Delight
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   is the lightweight version of the main book, Desiring God.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:44.620]   So I'm putting it here instead of Desiring God
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.180]   because we're talking about people who are normal.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.560]   Because a lot of people tell me even Desiring God,
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.540]   which I thought was pretty easy to read,
[00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:54.380]   is heavy sledding for some.
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:58.580]   And one more, number six, When I Don't Desire God.
[00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:01.420]   The reason I add When I Don't Desire God
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:05.140]   to the package of six is because every believer
[00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.140]   struggles with discouragement of having read Desiring God
[00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.500]   or The Dangerous Duty of Delight
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.300]   and knowing that being happy in God gives him glory
[00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:15.900]   and then not being happy in God.
[00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.740]   What do I do if I'm not happy in God?
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:19.980]   I get up in the morning, every morning I'm not happy in God.
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.980]   I have to work so hard to be happy in God.
[00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:24.060]   And this book, When I Don't Desire God,
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.220]   is all about that battle.
[00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:28.800]   So that's my answer to the normal person.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:31.220]   Just a brief answer to the non-normal person,
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.220]   and a lot of people probably like to put themselves
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.180]   in a non-normal category of,
[00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:38.100]   no, I am a questioning person.
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:39.420]   I am a systematic lover.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:41.760]   I like to go a little deeper,
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   and here's my answer for them.
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:49.980]   I'm still assuming very little Bible knowledge
[00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.100]   in the Christian faith at this point,
[00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:58.100]   and I would make just a few changes in that list.
[00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.620]   I would keep seeing and savoring, number one,
[00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.620]   and I would keep 50 reasons, number two,
[00:08:04.620 --> 00:08:06.980]   and I would keep finally alive, number three,
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.700]   and then I would make shifts.
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.380]   There's a quadrivium, a four-package book
[00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.580]   that in my mind all are one big package
[00:08:18.580 --> 00:08:20.660]   for the reader ready to take a challenge.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.300]   Desiring God, pleasures of God, future grace,
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.340]   and When I Don't Desire God.
[00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:30.200]   And Desiring God replaces dangerous duty in the simple list.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:32.300]   Future grace replaces battling unbelief
[00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:34.680]   because that book is in that book,
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.500]   and then I keep When I Don't Desire God.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.620]   So really, the change I'm making is
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.140]   desiring God for dangerous duty and pleasures of God.
[00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:46.860]   Oh, I left that out, pleasures of God as the foundation,
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:48.540]   deeper foundation for desiring God,
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:52.380]   and then future grace replaces battling unbelief.
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:57.380]   So both lists end with When I Don't Desire God
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:08:59.920]   because we all struggle and we need help,
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.020]   but everyone is different, Tony,
[00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:06.340]   and I would say read what works for you.
[00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.980]   Excellent starter list, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:11.460]   Did I hear you right that Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ
[00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.500]   is the book of yours that you most often return to?
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:15.340]   I did.
[00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:20.140]   When I'm looking for a fresh sight of the glory of Christ,
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.920]   I just need to see him.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:24.980]   Sometimes I just read the chapter titles
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:29.200]   to remind me what I saw and what I wrote
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.420]   because I just think the way Christian life works
[00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:36.400]   is that we're changed from one degree of glory to the next,
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.980]   beholding the glory of the Lord,
[00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.380]   and where do you turn if you're just feeling
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.040]   like my vision is dim?
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.940]   And so that helps me.
[00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.780]   Wonderful, yes and amen.
[00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.540]   It's a gem, maybe a great book
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.780]   to launch your new year of reading.
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:56.900]   Download Seeing and Savoring at desiringgod.org
[00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.880]   free of charge and begin reading it immediately
[00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.120]   for that title and for all the other books we have.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.680]   Go to desiringgod.org and click on the Books tab.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.980]   You'll see this book and every other title we have too,
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:09.820]   a lot of niche books for all sorts of needs.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:11.260]   And some people ask,
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.620]   how can you make all these books available online for free?
[00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:15.700]   You can't do that, nobody does that.
[00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:17.480]   Well, we do and we can
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:19.520]   because we work with some great publishers
[00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.040]   and because we're supported by generous financial donors
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.340]   behind the scenes like you, so thank you.
[00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:26.740]   You make it possible for us to put all those books
[00:10:26.740 --> 00:10:29.220]   out there, so feel free to take some time
[00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.260]   and to go and sift through all the books we have
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:34.920]   and maybe, just maybe begin your 2015 reading
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.100]   with Seeing and Savoring Jesus Christ.
[00:10:38.100 --> 00:10:40.060]   Speaking of Jesus, tomorrow we will talk about
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.020]   his compassionate, aggressive, surgical,
[00:10:43.020 --> 00:10:44.900]   and relentless love.
[00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.220]   I'm your host Tony Rehnke, we'll see you tomorrow.
[00:10:47.220 --> 00:10:49.380]   (silence)
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.540]   (silence)
[00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:53.700]   (silence)
[00:10:53.700 --> 00:10:57.280]   (Session concluded at 4pm)
