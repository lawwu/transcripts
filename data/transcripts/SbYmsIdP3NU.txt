[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.780]   I've been spouting off on social media and podcasts for a while now that any big inflection
[00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.980]   in dopamine that isn't preceded by a lot of effort to generate that dopamine inflection
[00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.780]   is very dangerous.
[00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.580]   Think drugs, think pornography, think highly processed foods, think anything that, you
[00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.100]   know, creates this big sense of indulgence and pleasure without any effort is running
[00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.780]   countercurrent to our evolutionary wiring.
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.940]   Now, you could say, well, okay, so what are we supposed to do, move into caves?
[00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.480]   No reward without commensurate sacrifice.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:35.480]   That's right.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:36.480]   Of some sort.
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.480]   Yep.
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480]   Yep.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.480]   Yep.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.140]   And the other issue, and it's coming up again and again today, and I love that it is, is
[00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.340]   this notion of the temporal domain of rewards that exist over multiple timescales or broader
[00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.340]   timescales.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.900]   One of the things that I feel truly lucky for is the fact that I went the path of science
[00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.500]   where we were chuckling about this earlier, you know, a project could take a year, then
[00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.260]   you have to restart because that project went nowhere.
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.660]   And then you finish the project, you submit a paper, the review, I mean, the reward schedule
[00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.780]   in science could take four years.
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.100]   It's not just about getting a degree, like getting papers through sometimes took a year,
[00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.140]   sometimes took two years, you know, sometimes things didn't go well and you had to publish
[00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.700]   in a journal that you wouldn't have wanted to, or sometimes you had to abandon projects
[00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.100]   altogether.
[00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.980]   So my reward system was trained up on lots of timescales, short, medium, long timescales.
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:35.260]   As I've moved into podcasting, the temporal loops are shorter, they're faster.
[00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.380]   But you know, nonetheless, you know, we do long form content.
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.340]   But you know, I think platforms like X I think are wonderful if used appropriately.
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.420]   I think it's especially great nowadays, frankly, and Instagram, et cetera, they're very useful.
[00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.300]   But they train us and I imagine they've trained the young brains that were weaned on them,
[00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.540]   because I wasn't, but that were weaned on them for fast temporal timescales.
[00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.580]   This isn't like playing a long poker game, this is like playing the slot machine over
[00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.220]   and over and over, right?
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.520]   It's not like a four-day tournament.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.100]   - Complete with intermittent random reinforcement, which is what happens when something goes
[00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.100]   viral, unpredictably.
[00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.100]   - Right.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.100]   - Right, right.
[00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.100]   It's really, yeah.
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.380]   - And then of course, we have this notion in this country that, you know, in any moment
[00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.780]   it could be a rags to riches or a, you know, some, you know, overnight fame type thing
[00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.020]   that exists as a possibility in our culture that in a way that it hadn't prior.
[00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.880]   So I think that one of the things that could be useful, just venturing a hypothesis here
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:38.540]   is that young and older people could take a look at their life and ask, you know, over
[00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.940]   what variation of timescales do I derive reward?
[00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.940]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.540]   - You know, training for a marathon is a longer timescale of reward and death.
[00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.180]   - Well, that's also a hallmark of maturity.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.180]   - Yeah.
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.180]   - Right?
[00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.620]   - Yeah, school, a degree, et cetera.
[00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.020]   In business, the timescales are sometimes fast, sometimes short.
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.180]   - I think you can ask even a better question than that.
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.220]   The better question would be, and this is kind of what's referred to in the Sermon on
[00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:07.380]   the Mount is, how could I optimize my long-term view while maximizing my focus on the moment?
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.620]   'Cause then you get both.
[00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.300]   That's a really, that's a really good deal, right?
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.340]   Because now you're conducting yourself in a manner that works in an iterated way that's
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.900]   socially productive, right, and maybe intergenerationally socially productive, that would be the best
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.860]   thing to establish, that's kind of what you're doing as a good father, but you're doing that
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:33.180]   in a manner that enables you to also derive maximal impact from each step you take forward
[00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.180]   in the present.
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:42.500]   So Carl Friston told me, we were talking about entropy and emotion, that I'd figured out
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.500]   a few years ago with a couple of my students that anxiety signifies the emergence of entropy,
[00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.940]   like technically, which I was really thrilled about because it gives emotion a physical
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.180]   grounding, like a real physical grounding.
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.160]   And Friston surprised me because he said he has a theory of positive emotion that's analogous.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.060]   He also knew the negative emotion.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.340]   He'd also been working in that domain.
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.140]   He said that you get a dopamine kick when you reduce the entropy in relationship to
[00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140]   a goal.
[00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.180]   And I thought, oh my God, that's so cool because it means that uncertainty is entropy.
[00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.100]   When it emerges, you get anxious, but when you see yourself stepping towards a goal,
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.340]   you get a dopamine kick, and the reason that's related to entropy is because with each successful
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:33.780]   step you take towards a goal, you reduce the uncertainty of the pursuit, which is manifested
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.700]   in that phenomena you described, which is when you see the finish line, you start running
[00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:38.700]   faster.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.100]   Right, so they're both related to entropy.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.660]   - Well, to have goals at multiple timescales, you need to be able to, I love this entropy
[00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.660]   argument.
[00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:56.060]   It makes total sense that you want to be able to withstand the periods of time when you
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.900]   don't know whether or not things are becoming more or less uncertain.
[00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.820]   This is part of becoming an adult, if you will.
[00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.740]   - Okay, so that was exactly the thread.
[00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.620]   So there's two corollaries of that.
[00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:12.620]   One is that the more valuable the goal towards which you're progressing, the higher the dopamine
[00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.020]   kick per unit of advancement.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:21.680]   So what that means is you want an ultimate goal operating in the domain of each proximal
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.180]   sub-goal, and that's what happens with this upward orientation.
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.060]   It's like what you're trying to do is to make things as good as they could be, whatever
[00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.680]   that means, over the longest possible span of time for the largest number of people,
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.680]   you included.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.820]   You're not going to know exactly how to do that, but that could be your goal.
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.900]   Okay, now that's going to inform your perceptions and your perceptions of pathway, but it's
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:49.980]   also going to modify your reward system, because now every proximal step forward is an indicator
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.660]   of entropy reduction in regard to that meta-goal.
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.260]   Well, there isn't any, by definition, there isn't anything you can do that's more exciting
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:58.260]   than that.
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.900]   See, that kind of explains why your friend was able to pop out of his addictive frame,
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:08.460]   because now he's doing something that's so worthwhile that the temptation of alcohol,
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.640]   let's say, pales in comparison.
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.780]   It's a rewriting of the reward contingencies.
[00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.580]   Yeah, right, exactly.
[00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:23.720]   And now you can imagine a situation where a culture explores across time to find out
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:30.800]   how to characterize that goal such that if that goal is pursued, people integrate psychologically
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   in a manner that integrates them socially across large spans of time.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:39.880]   I think that's what happens when the monotheistic revelation emerges.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:45.440]   That's what's happening from a biological perspective, is that we're starting to characterize
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.160]   the longest-term goal.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.480]   Yeah, something like that.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:56.800]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
