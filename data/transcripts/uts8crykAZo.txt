[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.080]   It is Monday, and although it may come as a surprise to our non-pastor listeners,
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.360]   many pastors will know that Mondays can be some of the darkest days of the week
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.880]   for them. Steve, a pastor, writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, how do you cope,
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.200]   battle, and overcome post-sermon depression? Every Monday seems like a
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.600]   dark cloud of depression looming over my head." Pastor John, what would you have to
[00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.760]   say to Steve? I don't want to give the impression that there are simple and
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.600]   quick fixes for deep and complex emotional conditions. I don't know what
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.380]   Steve is dealing with in any depth or complexity, but we are deep people, and we
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:50.020]   are complex people, and there probably are a hundred streams feeding into the
[00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:57.160]   slew of despond, as John Bunyan calls it for Steve. So I would be
[00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.160]   hesitant to make decisive pronouncements about all of his therapies. It would be
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.920]   good for him to talk to somebody who knows him better, but having said that,
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.340]   there are things that we share in common. I am one of those, right? I know what he's
[00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.760]   talking about. I think I mentioned in one of the chapters in Desiring God that,
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.760]   well, I wrote that book when I was approaching my 40s, and in those days
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.280]   there were days of discouragement so deep my mind could scarcely recall my
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.160]   children's names. I think I wrote that. So I have a little bit of empathy at least
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.280]   with Steve's struggle. He doesn't tell me his age, by the way. I wish I knew, but I
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.880]   did want to say there is something about midlife issues for men that's real,
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.560]   and the turning point of 40, you know, those years on either side of 40, can be
[00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.120]   a crisis for men for reasons I don't think we fully understand physically and
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.200]   psychologically. Certainly was for me. So beware, all you men between 35 and 45,
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.600]   that you're in a season that you will get through, and don't leave your
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.120]   wife and buy a sailboat or a motorcycle and find another woman. That's a stupid way
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.960]   to solve the problem. Stay faithful to your ministry. Stay faithful to her. So
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.440]   here are some of my warfare strategies for Mondays when the plague of
[00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.800]   discouragement descends on a pastor. Number one, go out to pasture.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.760]   Every pastor is a sheep on Monday. He needs green grass, still water. He needs a
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.840]   shepherd, and when I say he needs a shepherd, I mean Jesus ministering
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.440]   through a dead shepherd. I'm talking about Puritans. I mean, it may not be
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.800]   Puritans for Steve, but it was for me, and what I mean is find the kinds of
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.840]   books, poems, whatever. Find the kind that feed your weary soul. This is different
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.120]   from wrestling with some exegetical issue. This is lounging in a field of
[00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:08.400]   incredibly nourishing grass and lounging by a stream of crystal pure refreshing
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:15.440]   water with a veteran lover of God and knower of men, and there aren't any
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.680]   better than Burroughs, Owen, Boston, Brooks, Bunyan, Sibbs, Edwards. I mean, they're
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   just--these brothers, or I'll add Newton since I'm talking to Tony Rankine.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.960]   There are nourishing writers who aren't into controversy. They're into soul food.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:39.120]   So that's number one. Go out to pasture. Know who your shepherds are, your dead
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.400]   shepherds, and let them feed you. And secondly, recall the words of Jesus, "Do
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.000]   not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.240]   names are written in heaven," because we can put so much of our emotional stakes
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.480]   in the success of our ministry that we forget that Jesus said, "Look, even if demons
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.440]   are coming out every Sunday morning, don't get up on Monday and feel great
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:12.600]   about that, mainly. Get up Monday morning and feel great. My name is written there.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   My name is written there," which means you're safe with Jesus. Cultivate an
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:24.760]   amazement that he knows you and you know him, and make that relationship the place
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.680]   of wonder and the place of joy, and let ministry successes rise and fall
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.920]   as they will, but keep your heart staked right in Jesus and your name being
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.000]   written there. Here's a third one. Get a prayer team to support you and put
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.200]   them to work on Monday morning. We required a prayer team support team for
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.120]   all the pastors. These are lay people in the church who love their pastor, maybe
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.720]   five or ten of them, and they are committed to pray for you every time you
[00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.240]   write to them or any other time. My prayer team has been with me for years,
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:06.560]   and I credit them with many rescues and much fruit and much joy and a lot of
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.960]   survival, and so get one of those teams. Find those who you know would
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.880]   pray for you. Get them a list. Put them on a group mailing address, and
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:21.200]   Sunday night, as you feel it coming on, write to them and say, "Fight for me
[00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.360]   tomorrow morning. Fight for me tomorrow morning in prayer," and I think he will
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.400]   feel the difference. And the fourth thing I would say is hammer your body with
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.160]   whatever exercise works for you. Don't become a couch potato. It is deadly. God
[00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:42.280]   made muscles for work, and he made the heart to sustain it, and he made the
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.800]   brain to produce antidepressants in response to vigorous exercise. Don't
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.840]   spare yourself in this. Get a bike. Ride 20 miles as hard as you can on Monday
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:56.520]   morning, or run or swim or do weights or dig in the garden, but don't fool
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:01.200]   yourself that you are exercising when you're not panting. I mean, a lot of
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.240]   people think, "I'm exercising." You're not exercising. You are lolling. Make it
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.120]   happen. You will be surprised. You will be surprised how closely connected are the
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:20.200]   body and the soul. One last thing. Trust the promises of God relating to your
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.520]   Sunday work just passed. Your preaching was not in vain. Isaiah 55, 10 to 11. It's
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.720]   not gonna come back vain. It is not going to be in vain. Your suffering on Monday
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.120]   is not in vain. All pastors suffer because God ordains to turn their
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.960]   suffering and their comfort into the good of his people, 2 Corinthians 1.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.920]   Your darkness is not too dark for God, Psalm 139. "Surely the darkness shall
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.640]   not shall cover me." If you say, "Surely the darkness shall cover me and the light
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.400]   about me be night," even the darkness is not dark to you. The night is bright as
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:01.120]   the day, for the darkness is light with you. So no darkness is dark to God, and
[00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:11.680]   your season of weeping will change. Stay at it. Psalm 126, "He who goes out weeping,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:19.120]   bearing the seed for sowing, will come home with shouts of joy, bringing his
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.280]   sheaves with him." What that says pretty plainly is farming is just plain hard
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:31.200]   work, and you can't not go to the field when you feel miserable. You got to go
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.160]   plant the seed while your heart is breaking, and the promise is it won't
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:41.640]   stay broken. It won't stay broken. There will come another season, so I want to
[00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.280]   say don't give up, stay with it, fight the good fight, finish your course, keep the faith.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.160]   Thank you, Pastor John. And perhaps you're not a pastor, but you have one, a
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:54.600]   pastor who expends himself for you every Sunday. Please consider taking time today
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:58.200]   on this Monday to pray for him and his heart and for his rest and restoration
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:02.560]   today. Also, this discussion reminds me of two episodes we recorded for pastors
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:06.560]   in the past, for pastors who are faced with a darkness that will not lift on
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.280]   Tuesday. Episode number 27, "Fighting for Joy in Pastoral Ministry," and episode
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:15.440]   number 28, "Should a Joyless Pastor Preach Joy in God?" Check those episodes
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:19.400]   out in the podcast archive. Well, we have recently been talking a lot about
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:23.160]   Burger King and what to do with retailers who openly support the sin of
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:28.120]   homosexual practice. We talked about this in episode number 394, but Burger King is
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:32.880]   not alone. Apple, Subaru, and Target have all done virtually the same thing
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:37.040]   recently. So should we buy products from these companies? Tomorrow a podcast
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.760]   listener named Joe will ask Pastor John. I'm your host Tony Reinke, thanks for
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:43.760]   listening to the podcast.
