[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.720]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:08.760]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.960]   about upgrading your life, money and travel all while spending
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.240]   less and saving more. I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I'm
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.300]   excited to have you joining us today for a conversation about
[00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.320]   dating, love, relationships and more. If you're thinking, well,
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.160]   I'm happily married, maybe this isn't for me. Well, I really
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.440]   hope that's not the case, because I am also happily
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.560]   married. And I'm incredibly excited to talk to our guest
[00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.720]   Logan Urie. Logan is a behavioral scientist turned
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.480]   dating coach and the author of the fantastic book How to Not
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.720]   Die Alone. She is also the Director of Relationship
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.280]   Science at the dating app Hinge, where she leads a research team
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.640]   dedicated to helping people find love. Before that she ran
[00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.720]   Google's behavioral science team, the Irrational Lab. Her
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   works appeared in the New York Times, the Atlantic, the
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.680]   Washington Post and so many more places. While I might not be
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.760]   looking for love anymore, I'm so fascinated about everything
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.560]   she's learned from her research, especially because it seems like
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.240]   the internet has changed the dating landscape so much since I
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.160]   was in the game. I'm also curious to hear everything she's
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.760]   learned about building long lasting relationships, and
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.360]   everything she's learned about how dating might apply to other
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.640]   areas of life. Oh, and of course, I'm excited to learn
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.920]   what I might be able to share with a few of the friends of
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.320]   mine who are still on the hunt for their future spouse. So I
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.480]   hope you'll enjoy this conversation with Logan Urie.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.560]   Let's jump in. Logan, thank you for being here.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.120]   Hi, Chris, I'm really excited to join you.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.920]   So the book is How to Not Die Alone, which is a really bold
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.200]   statement and one that I think speaks to a lot of people. Can
[00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.240]   you talk about coming up with a title, what it means and, and
[00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.120]   why that's something that's really important to people?
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.880]   Yeah, so the whole frame of my book is how can you apply
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.280]   behavioral science to decisions around dating and relationships.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.200]   And so a lot of us have these cognitive biases or these blind
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.800]   spots that fuel faulty decision making. And so a big one that
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.800]   I'm sure you're familiar with is loss aversion, right? We have
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.680]   this huge urge to avoid loss at any cost. And so what I wanted
[00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:14.040]   to do with the title, How to Not Die Alone, is really put you in
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.440]   this mindset of oh, I could die alone. And that's something that
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.560]   I really want to avoid. And so I've absolutely heard the
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.800]   negative feedback, right? Therapists write me and they're
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.160]   like, I love your book, but it's hard to recommend because my
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.040]   patients are going to be offended by the title. But you
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.200]   know what, it's memorable. And it really gets to the truth of
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.960]   the matter, which is if you're on a path towards dying alone,
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.160]   and you don't want to be read this book, and let's do
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.960]   something about it.
[00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.360]   Yeah. Are people better off being with partners in their
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.240]   lives? Is there data to support that?
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.080]   Yeah. So I absolutely understand that there are people who are
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.400]   single and love it and more power to them. But many people
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.200]   want to find a partner and people who are single and have
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.560]   been looking, let's say for a decade are very frustrated by
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.960]   not being able to find someone. And there is a lot of research
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.200]   around how being in a relationship can help you earn
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   more money, be happier, be healthier, live longer. And
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.960]   those results are especially true for men who are in
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.840]   relationships.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.640]   What what led you to jump into this field? It's it's not a
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.280]   title that I think most people have. It's not an area most
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.120]   people dig into.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.040]   I've always been interested in love and dating and
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.960]   relationships, which I imagine many people are right like that
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.880]   is the core of most Sunday brunch conversations is talking
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.440]   about dating or complaining about your relationship. I also
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.680]   have this interest in psychology and how people make decisions.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.400]   So let's see around seven or eight years ago, when I was
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:48.040]   working at Google, leading this behavioral science team, I was
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.280]   also single, and I was also using Tinder and other dating
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.680]   apps. And I was working at Google. And I was like, Okay,
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.800]   these are some of the smartest people in the world. These are
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.840]   the wizards who created the internet. And we all seem to be
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.720]   struggling with dating, what's going on here. And so I was able
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.800]   to combine these two interests, how people make decisions, and
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.840]   sex, dating and relationships and combine them to really forge
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.240]   my own career and my own direction, bridging the two. And
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.960]   so what I've been doing since then is finding ways to say,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.520]   Alright, people are unhappy, they're not finding the
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.480]   relationships they want. In many ways, it's because of these
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.560]   cognitive biases or blind spots, how can I break dating down into
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.240]   a series of micro decisions and help you make better choices
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.120]   along the way?
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.000]   Yeah, that makes so much sense. And this has to be a problem
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.560]   that's existed forever, right? Is this is, is this kind of the
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.280]   oldest problem people have faced? And how has it evolved?
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.760]   Yeah, great question. So dating is actually a relatively new
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.240]   phenomenon. According to the book, labor of love by Maura
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.680]   Weigel, which is a great book on the history of dating, dating,
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.120]   as we think about it now didn't really emerge on the scene into
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.400]   until around 1890. And so what happened before then was
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:07.120]   depending on your social status in life, you might have an
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.520]   arranged marriage, right with the Prince of Sweden, or maybe
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:13.920]   just your father would negotiate with the person whose land
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:18.360]   touched the land next to next to his right, the per the person
[00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.880]   with the parcel of land next to his and, and they would
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.440]   negotiate your hand in marriage for, let's say, 12 camels or a
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.560]   certain amount of rice. And so for a long time, you were not in
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:31.680]   charge of finding your long term partner, this was something
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.200]   that your community, your family, a matchmaker did for
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.160]   you. And so one of the big themes that we see in modern
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:43.200]   dating, is that it feels like it's just up to us. And that can
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.120]   be very hard, because yes, we have more freedom to find
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.160]   someone. But it also means that if we fail, the failure is
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.400]   completely on our shoulders.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:56.000]   Yeah, I took a psychology of sex and relationships class in
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.880]   college. And we actually talked a bit about arranged marriages
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.480]   and their cultures where that's still a thing. What do you think
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.200]   of keeping that kind of pre 1890 tradition? Is that a process
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:08.400]   that works? Well, is that something you address at all in
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.800]   the book?
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.800]   So the research on arranged marriage shows that arranged
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.520]   marriages start less happy than what's called love marriages or
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.440]   non arranged marriages. But after the four year mark, they
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.400]   actually overlap love marriages in terms of happiness. So you
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.960]   start off in a lower place, but then over time, you grow to love
[00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.520]   this person. And so it's really interesting is, we can't have an
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.720]   experiment where we assign this person and arranged marriage and
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.320]   this person to love marriage, right? There's obviously a lot
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.120]   of cultural reasons why this happens. If you're in a culture
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.560]   where divorce is not really an option, then when you get into
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.240]   that marriage, your mindset isn't I'm going to stay until
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:53.160]   I'm no longer happy. It's this is forever. And so I'm going to
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.520]   find a way to make it work. And so there's something
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.200]   psychologically in that commitment where you say to
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.400]   yourself, this is what the rest of my life looks like. So I'm
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.640]   going to commit and do everything I can to make it
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:08.760]   work. But I have had plenty of millennials and even some people
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.080]   who are in Gen Z, who've said to me, why should I pick the
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.080]   person I have no idea what I'm doing, I would be happy if
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.480]   somebody set up an arranged marriage for me, because they
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:20.520]   can't do any worse than I have in choosing my person.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.360]   Yeah. And I think there's probably a middle ground there,
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.400]   too, which isn't just, it doesn't have to be an arranged
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.840]   marriage. But I have a friend and I have two friends that we
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.960]   set them up on a date, and they knew each other, they actually
[00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.280]   worked with each other, but they never thought they should date.
[00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.720]   And we're like, why don't you guys just go on a date. And so I
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.960]   like to think there's a middle ground of telling people, hey,
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.320]   maybe you should go on a date, but you don't have to necessarily
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.880]   get married. Like we don't have to commit you to this this grand
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.800]   thing. So I don't know if that's that's played a role in helping
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.240]   people try things they wouldn't try, which I have to assume
[00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:51.480]   people aren't the most rational when it comes to dating.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.480]   Yeah, it's really interesting. I do feel like now with the
[00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.840]   position that I'm in, if I set people up on a date, they're
[00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:02.600]   likely to say yes. And then they're likely to think, well,
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:05.440]   Logan really thought that I would get along well with this
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:08.560]   person. And so I think that's only a positive because they
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:11.640]   walk into the date thinking, all right, I'm going to try to
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.040]   discover what Logan had in mind for me about this person, or I'm
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:18.240]   going to walk in with a really positive frame, and I'm
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.040]   expecting to like them. And what we know is that so much of our
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:26.280]   experience in life, including dating is all about our mindset.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:29.720]   So there's that quote, whether you think things will go well,
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.960]   or you think things will go poorly, you're right. And so
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.680]   when I think about that with dating, it's like if you walk
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.600]   in with a mindset of it hasn't worked for the last 10 years,
[00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:43.560]   this is my 100th first date in a long time. It's not going to
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:46.080]   work out. Yeah, it probably won't. But if you walk in with
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:50.240]   the mindset of I'm going to create the experience I want to
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.480]   have, it only takes one person that has a huge impact on how
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.360]   you show up and how well the date goes.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:09:00.200]   Yeah, it's interesting. I, I was talking to Patrick McGinnis,
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:03.320]   who's this guy who created the term FOMO. And I think you were
[00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:07.360]   on his podcast, actually. And he brought up in conversation that
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.800]   people who make kind of quicker, less research decisions are
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.200]   often happier with the outcome. And people who take more time
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.840]   actually might make a better decision, but are less happy
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:20.040]   because they're aware of the alternatives. So a question I
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:22.760]   have is, I feel like and I totally missed this boat, right?
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:26.720]   I haven't really dated anyone since the late 90s, maybe the
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.880]   early 2000s. So I missed the boat on online dating. But I
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.160]   feel like now there's it feels like there's a lot of options in
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:37.080]   front of you versus before it was kind of who you met. Does do
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.520]   more options make it harder for people to date?
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.160]   Yeah, so I love everything Patrick said, and I'm sure we'll
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:47.640]   get into this. But one of my contributions to the field is
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:51.320]   this idea of the three dating tendencies, this framework for
[00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:54.400]   how people have unrealistic expectations and how it holds
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.960]   them back. And one of those tendencies is the maximizer. And
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:01.000]   the maximizer is all about, I want to see every possible
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.160]   option, I want to turn over every stone, and then and only
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.760]   then can I make the perfect decision. And there's this
[00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.560]   obsession with optimizing and making the perfect decision. But
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.720]   what we know is that there's another group called
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.880]   satisficers. And these are people who instead of trying to
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:21.560]   find the perfect thing, say, I have a bar, I'm going to stop
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.960]   looking once I achieve that benchmark. And what we see is
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.360]   that satisficers are happier than maximizers, because in
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:33.320]   life, it's not about making the perfect decision. It's about how
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:37.320]   you feel about your decision. And so in dating, and in many
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.480]   things, it's not about seeing everything that's out there and
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:43.600]   choosing, it's about choosing something great, committing to
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.400]   it, building it and making it work. And going back to what we
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:50.320]   said about arranged marriages, there's an element of
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:53.640]   satisficing in arranged marriages, you're not saying who
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.760]   are the 10 other people I could have married and what they've
[00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:59.200]   been better, it's, I'm going to make what I have in front of me
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.360]   work, because I'm committed. And that's how I'm going to be
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.440]   happiest long term.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:06.240]   It seems somewhat in conflict with the concept of there being
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.120]   the one. So would it be fair to say that's not not something
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:10.480]   that you kind of believe in?
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.960]   Absolutely, yes, I think the one is a harmful idea. The same
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.040]   thing with soulmates, because it gives people permission to leave
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.960]   relationships that are perfectly good enough, but that they're
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:25.200]   struggling in. And so there might be a situation where you
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.240]   expect that you're going to meet your soulmate, that everything
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.240]   is going to be easy. And then you're dating them, and you hit
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.040]   an inevitable rough patch. And instead of saying, Yep, this is
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.920]   what relationships look like you say, well, this person must not
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:41.120]   be my soulmate. Because if they were my soulmate, this would be
[00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.880]   so much easier. So then you leave the relationship. So if
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.000]   you remove the concept of the soulmate, and you say there are
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.360]   many people in the world with whom you could get along, you
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:53.920]   can write different love stories and different life stories with
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.920]   different people, then you no longer put that pressure on
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.840]   yourself to find that one person. And you instead are
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:03.520]   empowered to build a great relationship instead of focusing
[00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.200]   on finding that perfect person.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:08.920]   Yeah, that sounds like the kind of maximizer to satisficer
[00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.240]   transition. I don't know where I am in dating. But I know in a
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:15.040]   lot of things in life, I'm definitely feel like that
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:19.040]   maximizer personality and, and certainly my optimizing
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:24.000]   attitude falls in that. Are there tricks or tips to help
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.600]   someone kind of make that transition more easy?
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:30.240]   Yeah, absolutely. And this is something that Patrick and I
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.920]   have talked a lot about in terms of FOMO. So for example, I am
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.160]   absolutely a maximizer. And in all the research that I did for
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:42.520]   my book, one of the clear things that came out for me is that
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.320]   some things are just not worth maximizing. So somebody might
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.760]   say, Oh, I don't use Instacart, because I want to be able to
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.920]   choose the right tomato and somebody else can't choose the
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:55.840]   perfect tomato for me. Then when you think about it, it's like in
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:58.400]   the scheme of life, how important is it that you be the
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.600]   one to choose the tomato? And could your time be better spent
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.840]   elsewhere? Another thing is, I used to spend multiple days
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.880]   researching airline flights, trying to get the perfect
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:12.240]   arrival time and the perfect airline and maximizing my
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.720]   points. And then at the end of the day, it was just a waste of
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:18.480]   time. So now I'll say something to myself, like, I'm giving
[00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:22.200]   myself one hour to research flights. And at the end of that,
[00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.160]   I'm going to choose the best possible flight. And so part of
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.080]   it is understanding, does this decision matter enough matter or
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.840]   not? Another one is giving yourself a time limit. And I
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:36.680]   think another one is just a psychological shift to say, it
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.000]   matters how I feel about the decision, not if it's the
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:43.720]   perfect decision. And I'm actually more likely to be happy
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.120]   with my decision. If I set a benchmark, stop looking once
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.160]   I've achieved it, and then embrace what I bought, instead
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:55.240]   of the maximizer thing, which is you research for days or months
[00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:58.920]   or years, you buy the thing and then you have this pro con
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.480]   list in your head of all the other things you could have
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:03.840]   bought, and could this have been better? And actually, that
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:07.160]   experience is more likely to just make you regret your choice
[00:14:07.160 --> 00:14:08.040]   in the first place.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:12.160]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. And so that's the maximizer. We
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:15.480]   didn't really describe it in the context of dating as much, but
[00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.920]   maybe be interesting to walk through the three tendencies
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:22.160]   that you've identified and kind of talk a little bit about each.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.960]   Yeah, I do a lot of one on one dating coaching. And so that
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.320]   means that I'm meeting people around the world, they're
[00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:31.920]   telling me their life story, their relationship history,
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.320]   we're talking about who they've been, who they are now where
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.880]   they want to go. And I found that talking to a lot of
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:40.840]   different people are from different countries and
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:45.440]   cultures. They all seem to have the same thing in common, which
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:49.320]   is that they had unrealistic expectations of certain parts of
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.240]   dating and relationships. And so from that, I created the three
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:59.480]   dating tendencies. The first one is the romanticizer. And this is
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.760]   the person who we talked about the soulmate and the one they
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.120]   have unrealistic expectations of relationships in general. So this
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.240]   is the person who loves love, and they don't want to use a
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.400]   dating app because it's quote unquote, not romantic. And they
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:15.320]   have this very clear vision of their in their head of what
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.400]   their future partner will look like. They're focused on the we
[00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:21.720]   met story. And they think that once you meet the right person,
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:24.920]   everything's going to be easy. And the issue with the
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.560]   romanticizer is that they're not willing to put in effort to
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.360]   make the relationship great. And they're not even willing
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.480]   necessarily to be strategic about how to meet someone
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:38.320]   because they think that everything will happen to them.
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.600]   And so for the romanticizer, it's about overcoming some of
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.040]   this Prince charming stuff, and really understanding that who
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:47.360]   cares how you met, that's such a tiny percentage of the
[00:15:47.360 --> 00:15:49.880]   relationship, what actually matters is building a
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.200]   relationship with someone. The second type, which we talked
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:56.840]   about a bunch is the maximizer. And their whole thing is, is
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:00.040]   there somebody better out there. And so I meet a lot of people
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:04.440]   who say, I like my girlfriend, but could she be 10% hotter, or
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.920]   5% more ambitious? Or could she push me more to think about big
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.080]   ideas. And I have lots of conversations with people who
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:15.160]   are either single, or deciding if they should get married or
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:18.600]   deciding they should break up. And I hear the maximizer come
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:21.720]   out of them where they're really weighing, is this the best that
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:25.200]   I could get? Or is there somebody better out there. And
[00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:28.840]   the third type is the hesitator. And they have unrealistic
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:32.000]   expectations of themselves. And they're just not even dating at
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:36.240]   all. So the story in their head is something like, I'll be ready
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:41.320]   to date when I lose 10 pounds, when I have a more impressive
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.160]   job, when I move and get settled in my new city. And so they're
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:49.360]   always coming up with these reasons, really excuses, why
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:52.760]   they're not ready to date. And the thing in their head is that
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:55.600]   they're not lovable yet. And only when they're lovable,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.880]   should they put themselves out there. But the truth is that
[00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:02.400]   nobody's perfect, not you, not the person you're going to wind
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:06.400]   up with. And you're only going to get better at dating by
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.120]   dating. And you're only going to figure out what kind of person
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:12.200]   you want to be with, by dating a bunch of different people. And
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.320]   so for hesitators, it's really about overcoming this fear of
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.520]   starting and just really getting themselves out there getting
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.680]   better at dating and learning who they should be with.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:24.840]   It's fascinating that you break this down. I can't remember, but
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.720]   I feel like I was probably a maximizer given my personality.
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:30.960]   But show is called all the hacks. Yeah, so it's always
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:34.720]   looking for that extra 5%. I've started learning in my life how
[00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:38.760]   to realize that that extra 5% for something really big is more
[00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:41.480]   important than the extra 5% for something small. So I'm no
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:45.440]   longer, I'm no longer picking out my own tomatoes, though. The
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:48.280]   last two orders from Amazon Fresh have brought me green
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:52.560]   bananas that have taken three to four weeks to ripen. So I'm
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:56.720]   currently have a big gripe with Amazon because we just like each
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.400]   week it's new green bananas that just won't ever ripen. But I
[00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.480]   feel like something interesting. We talked a lot about money on
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.960]   the show. And people seem to want to find love and build
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.320]   their wealth. They're kind of similar big aspirations in in
[00:18:09.320 --> 00:18:12.760]   people's lives. And we don't talk about them either in
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:14.840]   school, it's not like you learn how to date in school, or you
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:17.840]   learn how to manage your money in school. But it does seem like
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.920]   there's a lot more data and research on what people should
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:22.680]   do with their money. So then there is about their
[00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:26.120]   relationships, at least in terms of dating versus you know how
[00:18:26.120 --> 00:18:29.920]   to handle a marriage. Is that true? Do you feel similarly
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:32.560]   about dating being kind of this taboo thing we never learned
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.440]   about but should?
[00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:37.880]   One thing I would say is there are definitely a lot of books
[00:18:37.880 --> 00:18:41.680]   that people read about money, right? So many people read, I
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.760]   will teach you to be rich. So many people read the millionaire
[00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.600]   next door, rich dad, poor dad, I do feel like there's really a
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.760]   tradition of a lot of personal finance books and people feeling
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:55.360]   really comfortable about saying, Hey, how much are you invested
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:59.080]   in crypto? And am I too late to buy Dogecoin and all of these
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.720]   different things, right? I feel like people are really
[00:19:00.720 --> 00:19:05.120]   comfortable with that. There's less of a tradition of self
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.760]   help books around dating that people are really comfortable
[00:19:07.760 --> 00:19:10.440]   talking about. And there's sort of a shame around it. There's a
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:14.600]   feeling, oh, love is natural. And you should be born knowing
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.960]   how to love. And so that I would say yes, love is natural. But
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.480]   dating is not dating, as we talked about is relatively new
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.760]   in the span of human history. Dating apps are a decade old, of
[00:19:25.760 --> 00:19:28.800]   course, you need to be taught how to date. It's not something
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.760]   that you are just born knowing it's actually pretty
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.840]   complicated. You're making a decision. If you're going to be
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.400]   in a monogamous long term relationship, you're choosing
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:39.440]   one person out of billions to spend your life with that.
[00:19:39.440 --> 00:19:42.560]   That's that's a huge amount of pressure in terms of how much
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.640]   research there is. So there is a field called relationship
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:49.280]   science, which is a field in academia. So one of my mentors,
[00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:53.280]   Eli Finkel, is a relationship scientist out of Northwestern.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.280]   He does incredible research there. And they talk about
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.400]   things like what makes people attracted to each other? Does
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:02.720]   that last long term? What are the things that matter more and
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:06.280]   less than we think they do for long term relationships? There's
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:11.760]   also doctors john and Julie Gottman, who are out of Seattle
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:15.440]   who have been working in the field for over 40 years. And
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:18.680]   they have done some really seminal research in the field of
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:22.080]   relationship science. So they have this concept called bids
[00:20:22.080 --> 00:20:26.000]   that you may have come across, which is that this is kind of a
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:29.480]   long story, but I think it's worth telling. So what they used
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:37.200]   to do is they used to have this apartment. And it was kind of
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:40.080]   like a room at an inn, and they would have couples stay there
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:45.440]   for the weekend. And they decked it out with cameras, microphones,
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.880]   they measured the urine in the toilet, they even had something
[00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.960]   under the chair called a gigalometer that measured how
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:54.640]   much you were moving your chair while you sat in it. And they
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.760]   would observe couples for the weekend. And they would look at
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:21:01.080]   how they talk to each other and different things like that. Six
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:04.440]   years later, they checked in with these couples. And they saw
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:07.480]   that some were together happily, they call these these
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:11.200]   relationship masters, and some were together unhappily
[00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:15.720]   relationship disasters, or some people had broken up. And what
[00:21:15.720 --> 00:21:18.600]   they found was that the number one predictor of who would
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:22.000]   become a relationship master versus a relationship disaster
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:26.520]   is how the couples treated each other in these micro moments.
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.880]   And so they call them bids. So Chris, an example would be
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:34.720]   you're staying in this in with your wife, and she stands up and
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:37.680]   looks out the window and says, Oh, there's a sailboat going by.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:41.960]   And you're sitting in the chair. How do you respond? Do you a
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:45.480]   stand up and walk next to her and say, Oh, that's a beautiful
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.000]   sailboat. Maybe we should go sailing while we're in town. Do
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.880]   you ignore her? Or do you say, wife, I'm trying to read the
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:57.280]   paper? Why are you interrupting me? And this might seem really
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:59.280]   small, it's just a small moment where she's talking about a
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.640]   boat, but how you respond to those bids for connection
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.800]   determines how you'll do long term. And so successful couples
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:10.520]   turn towards each other, which is being positive being
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.520]   affirming, asking a follow up question, they turn towards
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:18.880]   each other 86% of the time. And the couples that break up or
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.960]   unhappily married, they only turn towards each other 33% of
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.280]   the time. And so what they found is that relationships are not
[00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:31.720]   about the once a year trip to Hawaii, or the romantic dinner,
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   once in a while, it's about on a daily basis, when your partner
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.880]   tries to connect with you, do you choose to connect back. And
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:41.840]   that's really what determines how happy and successful we are
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:43.080]   in relationships long term.
[00:22:43.080 --> 00:22:48.280]   Getting the crew together isn't as easy as it used to be. I get
[00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:52.120]   it. Life comes at you fast. But trust me, your friends are
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:56.600]   probably desperate for a good hang. So kick 2024 off right by
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.000]   finally hosting that event. Just make sure you do it the easy
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.760]   way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go to app for drink
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   delivery, take care of the supplies. All you need to come
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:09.640]   up with is the excuse to get together. It doesn't even have
[00:23:09.640 --> 00:23:12.760]   to be a good one. It could be your dog's birthday that the sun
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.760]   finally came out. Or maybe you just want to celebrate that you
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.280]   got through another week. With Drizzly, you can make hosting
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.920]   easy by taking the drink run off your to do list, which means you
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:26.400]   can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.600]   yours. And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:32.200]   prices on their massive selection of beer, wine and
[00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:35.480]   spirits across multiple stores. So when I really wanted to make
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:38.440]   a few cocktails while we were hosting family last week, not
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:41.280]   only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:45.160]   hour, but I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:23:45.160 --> 00:23:48.720]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:55.120]   to drizzly.com. That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today. Must be 21
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.440]   plus not available in all locations.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:02.920]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about
[00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:06.600]   life, money and so much more. But sometimes it's helpful to
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.840]   talk to other people in your situation, which actually gets
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.960]   harder as you build your wealth. So I want to introduce you to
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:16.840]   today's sponsor Long Angle. Long Angle is a community of high
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:19.360]   net worth individuals with backgrounds in everything from
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.600]   technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:26.760]   manufacturing, and more. I'm a member of Long Angle. I've loved
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:29.120]   being a part of the community. And I've even had one of the
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:32.560]   founders Tad Fallows join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.680]   talk about alternative investments. Now the majority of
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:39.200]   Long Angle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.520]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge
[00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:46.160]   and learn from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:50.040]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:53.640]   market investment opportunities. Like I said, I'm a member and
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.040]   I've gotten so much value from the community because you're
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.480]   getting advice and feedback from people in a similar situation to
[00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:02.800]   you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.760]   children's education to finding a concierge doctor. So many of
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:09.720]   these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:13.520]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets,
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:16.280]   which is their minimum for membership, I encourage you to
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:20.120]   check out Long Angle, and it's totally free to join. Just go to
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.640]   longangle.com to learn more. And if you choose to apply, be sure
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.880]   to let them know you heard about it here. Again, that's
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.200]   longangle.com.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:35.840]   Now, I know there's sometimes things that are causation or not.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:38.720]   Do you think that this is something it sounds like something
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:40.960]   you could learn? It's like, oh, if I want to have a long term
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.040]   relationship, I could just make sure that I put more of an
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:48.040]   effort in to respond positively to these bids? Or is it more the
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:51.240]   kinds of people who by default respond to those bids are more
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:52.720]   successful? Is it one or the other?
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:57.000]   So yeah, it's a great question. And this is definitely something
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.360]   that can be taught. And it's why I find the work of the Gottman
[00:25:59.360 --> 00:26:04.680]   so inspiring. Because since I first went to their workshop
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:08.600]   with my then boyfriend, now husband in 2015, I've been
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.240]   applying this lesson all the time. And I can see the periods
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.840]   of my life where I was more focused on work, and less
[00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:16.360]   invested in the relationship, which meant I wasn't making as
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.720]   many bids or I wasn't responding to bids, our relationship did
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:23.640]   worse. And now I'm constantly reminding myself, if he walks
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.600]   into the room and talks about his day, and I'm in the middle
[00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:30.000]   of an email, the most important thing I can do is look away
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.640]   from my computer and talk to him. Because that's the stuff
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:35.480]   that really matters. And so yes, there are people who are
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:38.800]   naturally inclined to be good at relationships, right? If you
[00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.760]   are more open, if you are less neurotic, if you are more
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:47.560]   conscientious, those personality traits are correlated with
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.440]   relationship success, just because it might be easier for
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:53.720]   you to connect with people, or for you to follow through or be
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.840]   reliable. But in general, the concept of bids is pretty
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:27:00.680]   simple. It's make efforts to connect with your partner. And
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:04.800]   when your partner makes efforts to connect with you, choose to
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.600]   turn towards those bids.
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.400]   Yeah, this is great. I feel like that's something that everyone
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.920]   could apply to any relationship there. And do you think it
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:16.840]   applies to other relationships? Like even at work, if someone
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.200]   brings something up at work, do you build deeper relationships
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.560]   with colleagues by responding to maybe they're not bids, but
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.000]   similar similar aspect?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.760]   Absolutely. Yes, I just recently gave a talk at Google applying
[00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:30.160]   some of these concepts from relationship science to
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:33.120]   relationships at work. And bids was one of the main things I
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:36.160]   talked about, which is that relationships are really built
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:39.520]   in these small moments. So if your colleague just came back
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:43.240]   from a trip, spend 30 seconds saying, Hey, how was your trip?
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:46.440]   What was it like to be there? How did you choose just make an
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.720]   effort to connect with that person? Or if somebody mentions
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:52.360]   that they haven't been feeling well, the next time you talk to
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:54.840]   them say, Hey, how are you feeling? And it's these small
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:56.960]   things that we think, oh, those are so small, they probably
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:28:01.080]   don't matter. But the reframe is, they are so small. And in
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:03.360]   some ways, they are the only things that matter.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:06.840]   Yeah. And so you said you did this talk, that was a big piece
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:09.920]   of it. Were there other lessons from relationships and dating
[00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:12.880]   that apply outside of that world?
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.560]   So one of the big things I talked about in terms of
[00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:19.480]   applying relationship science to relationships at work, is what I
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:22.600]   just mentioned in terms of bids and what the Gottman's call
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   small things often. And so some of my key takeaways there, one
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:30.520]   of them was make bids to new team members turn towards bids
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:34.000]   from your colleagues, assume positive intent in digital
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.360]   communication, that's a really big one. It's just so easy in a
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:41.080]   remote world to not have that foundation of friendship, and
[00:28:41.080 --> 00:28:44.040]   intimacy to fall back on. And so when somebody says something
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:46.720]   that feels kind of sharp in a Google Doc, you might just
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.040]   assume that they're criticizing you, but how can you really
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:52.680]   assume positive intent. And then another one, which I got from my
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.640]   friend, Liz Fosley, and who if you're not aware of her work,
[00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:58.640]   she would be a great guest on your podcast. She has an
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:03.200]   Instagram account, called Liz and Molly, and she does these
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.800]   amazing illustrations about things at work. And so this is a
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:10.520]   concept from her called assign a meeting monitor, which is that
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:13.920]   on a rotating basis, you have somebody in a meeting who makes
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:16.880]   sure to this person raise their hand, but not have a chance to
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:21.840]   speak, or has this person not expressed their feedback in a
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:24.600]   while? And should you reach out to them one on one is somebody
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.200]   consistently being interrupted and just monitoring those micro
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:31.040]   moments in a meeting can actually have a big impact on
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:33.920]   whether or not somebody feels heard, whether or not somebody
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.240]   feels respected at work. And so really, the overall concept here
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:40.960]   is that a lot of what matters to us in relationships, which is
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:45.440]   how we feel in small moments also affects us at work. And
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:48.600]   then the other concept that I applied is called decide don't
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.080]   slide. And so there's tons of research in relationship science
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:56.280]   that shows that couples who make conscious decisions to either
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:30:00.640]   move forward or break up, are happier, more successful, and
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.360]   even have more passionate sex than couples who do the
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.080]   opposite, what's called sliding. So sliding would be, Chris, you
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.960]   and I have been dating for a while, my lease is up, I guess I
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:13.000]   should just move in with you, as opposed to us sitting down and
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:15.640]   saying, what is moving in together mean to you? Does it
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:19.160]   mean we're giving our relationship a try? Does it mean
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:21.520]   we're going to get married, things like that. And so you
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.640]   want to decide your way into a decision not slide. And the same
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.160]   thing is true at work, you want to be constantly checking in
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:32.120]   about, are we on the same page about priorities? Have we talked
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.800]   about okay, our planning? Do I understand if the company's
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.400]   initiatives have changed, you really want to make sure that
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:42.440]   people are super clear on their roles, responsibilities,
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.880]   priorities, and not just making assumptions and sliding your way
[00:30:45.880 --> 00:30:47.120]   into the next project.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:51.640]   Yeah, if I apply some of these lessons back to relationships,
[00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:54.240]   which which is, I guess, where they started, it seems like some
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.560]   of the biggest things people get wrong, are thinking it's all
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:31:01.640]   about the big moments, and kind of not taking the time to maybe
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:05.640]   be more intentional about major points in a relationship. Are
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:08.520]   there any other big things you think people get wrong about
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.880]   relationships with partners?
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:13.680]   Yeah, there's a ton. So starting with dating, one of the biggest
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.440]   mistakes that I see people making is this idea of
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:21.600]   optimizing for the spark. And so so often, I will set somebody up
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.520]   on a date, or my dating coaching client will call me and they'll
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.840]   say, I met this woman, she was perfectly nice, she was great,
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.240]   we had a great conversation, she was attractive, dynamic, I'm not
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:35.520]   going to see her again. I'll say, that's surprising. Why? And
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:39.360]   the person will say, well, I just didn't feel the spark. And
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:42.240]   so the spark has become this all encompassing word that means I
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.960]   didn't feel instant chemistry, I didn't feel fireworks. And it's
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.840]   just such a mistake, because many of the happiest couples I
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.920]   know, knew each other for a long time, before they started
[00:31:52.920 --> 00:31:55.760]   dating, maybe they work together, maybe they were
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.400]   roommates, maybe they orbited each other in a mutual friend
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.600]   group. And over time, that person becomes more attractive
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.280]   to you, you see how kind they are, you see how talented they
[00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:11.480]   are. And that affection and appreciation grows. And so I say
[00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:15.800]   to my clients, fuck the spark, which is stop expecting instant
[00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:19.200]   chemistry and instead say, what side of me does this person
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:23.200]   bring out? Am I curious about them? Do they make me feel
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:27.400]   relaxed? Do they make me feel confident? Do I feel attracted
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:30.280]   to them and really just tuning into different sides of the
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.120]   experience instead of optimizing for this immediate fireworks or
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:34.800]   chemistry?
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:39.560]   Yeah, I like that my wife and I met in a co-ed business
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:43.560]   fraternity. And she was my little my little brother. So he
[00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:46.880]   certainly did not start with a spark. In fact, it was through
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.160]   these like, planned activities that we were supposed to do with
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   each other that we ended up falling for each other. And at
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:56.680]   the end of the semester, they were like, which big little
[00:32:56.680 --> 00:32:59.320]   brother combo had kind of done the most activities. And we were
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:02.160]   like, let's withdraw from this competition, because now we're
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.560]   dating. And I feel like we just ticked off a lot of boxes that
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:06.840]   people don't need to know about.
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:09.960]   That's so funny. I rarely does somebody tell me my wife was my
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.200]   little brother in college.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:14.480]   Yeah, yeah, that might be a first. It's, it's, it's not a
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.760]   typical way to open a conversation, but it usually
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.240]   leads to some fun, fun stories. I noticed the longest chapter, I
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:22.760]   think, in the entire book was about looking for a life
[00:33:22.760 --> 00:33:26.280]   partner, not a prom date. And I'm curious if the length of
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.760]   that chapter could interpret that that's kind of the biggest
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.800]   problem that people face or, or how you think about that
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.280]   challenge of people looking for something that's different than
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:35.200]   what they actually need.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:37.960]   That's so funny that you brought that up. I don't think anyone
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.000]   else has mentioned that. And Chris, I do hope we get a chance
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.520]   to talk about the book writing process. But honestly, like
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.920]   writing a book is so hard, and especially your first one,
[00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:50.400]   you're just like, how long is a chapter to all chapters have to
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.280]   be the same length. And in a really early version of the
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:55.920]   book, I had some chapters that were, let's say, 10 pages, and
[00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:58.760]   some that were 50 pages was able to work with an editor who
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:01.800]   explained like, no, this needs to become like a sidebar in
[00:34:01.800 --> 00:34:04.000]   another chapter, and most chapters should be similar
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.800]   length. And so I didn't even realize off the top of my head
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:08.840]   that that was the longest chapter, but that does make
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:12.480]   sense. And so the premise there is that at a certain point in
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:16.440]   your life, you need to stop looking for the prom date. The
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:21.160]   prom date is somebody who's hot, you would love to dance the
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:23.320]   night away with them, maybe you'd want to sleep with them
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.000]   at the end of the night, but they're not really the person
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.400]   who's necessarily reliable and going to pick up your kids from
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:33.520]   the dentist. The life partner is the person who you want to
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.800]   align yourself with long term. This is a person who you can
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.200]   make hard decisions with, who you fight with well, who you
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:45.400]   respect, who you admire, who brings out a really happy,
[00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.040]   satisfied part of you. And all too often, I see that people
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:52.760]   start in their dating journeys by going after the prom date,
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.080]   and then they never make that really important shift to start
[00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.360]   looking for the life partner. And so for many of the people I
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:02.000]   work with, it's about saying, hey, you need to take yourself
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   seriously, stop dating this guy who doesn't call you back, who
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:11.680]   doesn't really care for himself or other people who doesn't
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:15.120]   seem to be passionate about anything. He's ambivalent about
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.280]   his job, and he's ambivalent about you, and start looking for
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:21.480]   someone who's actually serious about building a relationship.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.960]   And so there is this really critical point where hopefully
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:28.720]   sooner rather than later, people understand, okay, maybe I would
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:30.920]   have gone out with that person in the past, but they're more of
[00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:33.280]   a prom date. And now it's time to really find this life
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:33.800]   partner.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.440]   Unfortunately, for me, you know, I'm in a relationship, a lot of
[00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:42.160]   the chapters were more like curiosity filling than things
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.160]   that I can apply necessarily, though, I really appreciate you
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.960]   helping me apply them to work examples. But the last chapter
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:52.880]   was one of the shortest, and it you know about what to do after
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:56.480]   you decide to get married, and with your spouse, and I'm
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:58.560]   hoping that maybe that's because there's a second book in the
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.240]   works. Maybe not. But I'm curious where you would go with
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:05.480]   the things you've learned for people already in a relationship
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:08.760]   that want to make that relationship last longer. We
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.640]   talked about bids, but are there other things you think people
[00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:14.440]   should work into their practice of their marriage? I know you're
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:17.040]   married? Are there things you do specifically?
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:19.640]   I'm married. Yes, it's funny. One of the most common Google
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:24.080]   search terms is Logan Uri husband. Which I wonder if you
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:27.120]   have like Chris Hutchins wife, if people Google that I think
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.120]   it's a lot of people are like, All right, who's this Logan
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:32.120]   person? Is she even married? Is she even found love? So anyway,
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.600]   yes, I am married. In terms of why that chapter is there, just
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:40.720]   a little bit of behind the scenes with book writing. It
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:43.080]   felt very clear to me in terms of who would buy the book that
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.080]   it would be mostly people who are single and looking for a
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   relationship that expression, it's easier to sell medicine
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:52.800]   than a vitamin, right? It's when somebody has a problem, they
[00:36:52.800 --> 00:36:55.920]   want to pay to solve it versus somebody is less likely to pay
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:58.800]   money just to say like, Yeah, I should invest in my long term
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:01.720]   relationship. But for me, I was like, I really want to set
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:04.240]   somebody up for success, A to Z, I want you to start the book
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:06.640]   when you're single, and things aren't working out. I want to
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.400]   help you date, get into relationship, move in together,
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:12.760]   commit or get married. And then I wanted this last chapter that
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:17.480]   was like, go forth and do these things. I would say, perhaps
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.160]   that chapter hasn't landed as much as I hoped it would.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.560]   Because so many people reading it are single. And they're like,
[00:37:22.560 --> 00:37:24.960]   I'll come back to this later. But it does matter to me.
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:28.880]   Because I think the whole idea of my concept of the happily
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:32.520]   ever after fallacy is that people think, oh, the hard work
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:35.520]   of love is finding someone. And once I find someone, it's easy.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.400]   And that's just clearly not true. And so that last chapter
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.040]   is all about the things that you can do to keep your relationship
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:47.560]   going. So one is this concept from Daniel Gilbert, who's a
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:51.560]   Harvard psychologist called the end of history illusion. That's
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:55.320]   the idea that we always think that we're done growing. So if I
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:58.600]   said to you, Chris, how much have you changed in the last 10
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.920]   years, you would likely tell me a lot. And you would say, I'm in
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:05.320]   a completely different place than I thought I would be and x,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:08.360]   y, z has changed. And then if I said, how much do you expect to
[00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.640]   change in the next 10 years, most likely, if you're like the
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.920]   average person who Dan Gilbert surveyed, you will say, oh, not
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.160]   that much. And so we always think we're done growing, but
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:20.000]   that's just not true. So the same thing is true in
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.400]   relationships, we think I found my person, and we are who we
[00:38:23.400 --> 00:38:26.640]   are. But if you actually think about the fact that you and your
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:30.280]   partner are constantly growing and changing, how can you design
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:35.000]   a relationship that grows and changes with you. And so some of
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.520]   the hacks there, one of them is a weekly ritual that I call the
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:43.280]   check in ritual. john Gottman also has something he calls the
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:48.480]   state of the union, just basically conversations, where
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:52.000]   you and your partner check in and say, how are things going?
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.040]   How can I support you? What do you have coming up in your life?
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:58.600]   How are you feeling about our relationship and really just
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:03.920]   saving that time to stop problems before they start
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:07.160]   because once there's a lot of resentment or built up problems,
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:10.880]   it's hard to go back. But if you can actually deal with those
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.240]   problems before they boil over, you're in a much better
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:16.640]   position. And so for people listening to your podcast who
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:20.440]   are into hacks, I would say use the power of Google Calendar,
[00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:23.160]   right? It sucks when you have to be the person in relationship
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:25.560]   who's like, Hey, we should check in. Hey, can we talk about this?
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:27.960]   Hey, we haven't done this in a while. If you can just put it as
[00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:30.800]   a recurring event in your calendar, neither one of you has
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:34.160]   to quote unquote, hold space, the calendar does that for you.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:37.960]   And so this check in ritual is a really healthy way to stop a
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:41.520]   problem before it starts. The other one is a relationship
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:44.480]   contract. My husband likes to call this the relationship
[00:39:44.480 --> 00:39:47.560]   charter. It's really saying let's chart a course for where
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:51.000]   we want to go. And so we might say, what are the rituals in our
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:57.760]   life that we like and we want to keep? What are the who are the
[00:39:57.760 --> 00:40:01.120]   friends or family that you want me to get to know better? What
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:04.280]   are our financial goals? What are our emotional goals? Really,
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:07.560]   the relationship contract can be whatever you want it to be. But
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:10.240]   the really important thing is to just make sure that you and your
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:13.640]   partner are on the same page about where you are now and
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.440]   where you're headed. And then you can check in maybe in a year
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.200]   or maybe in two years, maybe every five years, it's really
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:23.320]   that chance to course correct, because people are living
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:26.680]   longer, they're going to be in relationships that are decades
[00:40:26.680 --> 00:40:31.240]   longer than marriages of the past. And how can you make sure
[00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:34.560]   that that relationship can really adapt to serve your
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:37.200]   changing needs as you change over time.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.840]   I couldn't help but think when you were talking about this
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.160]   relationship charter that there's so many websites where
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.280]   they're saying, Oh, put in your email address to download this
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:47.800]   PDF. I don't know if you have a template for it. If you do, I'll
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:50.760]   link it in the show notes. If you don't, I would totally sign
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:53.600]   up for any newsletter to download a copy of it because I
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.560]   think it's fascinating.
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:40:58.600]   Yes, I do have a relationship contract on my website that
[00:40:58.600 --> 00:41:03.000]   people can access. There's also one in the book. And in terms of
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.080]   downloads and things, if anyone was curious about that three
[00:41:06.080 --> 00:41:09.040]   dating tendencies framework, I have a great quiz on my website
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.840]   that will tell you what your tendency is.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.400]   Oh, that's awesome. So that is something I think is really
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:17.280]   cool. I just want to thank you quick for listening to and
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:20.720]   supporting the show. Your support is what keeps this show

[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:36.640]   things outside of relationships and dating in your life that
[00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.760]   are, you know, I always say like routines or tactics that you do
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.400]   that other people are often surprised about but want to try
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.840]   themselves that you've used to help your personal or
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:46.640]   professional life?
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.640]   Sure, yeah, I'll give one more that has to do with personal
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:55.600]   life and dating, which is this concept called OSOs or other
[00:41:55.600 --> 00:41:59.160]   significant others. So there's this really great research from
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:02.480]   Elaine Chung, who was at Northwestern and now actually
[00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:04.760]   works with me at Hinge by coincidence, and I love her
[00:42:04.760 --> 00:42:08.920]   research. And it's this idea that if you say to couples, who
[00:42:08.920 --> 00:42:11.680]   in your life do you go to to talk about work? Who do you go
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:14.880]   to to talk about drama? Who do you go to to talk about
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.640]   politics? If people can make a list with a lot of different
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:21.520]   names, which means they have a really extensive social network,
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:25.240]   those couples tend to be happier than people who have very few
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.920]   friends or only rely on each other. The reason for that is
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:33.120]   that we often expect too much from our partners, we expect
[00:42:33.120 --> 00:42:35.920]   them to be everything to us. And so Chris, in your
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:38.560]   relationship, I imagine there are topics that your wife's
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:41.520]   really excited to talk about, and topics that when you bring
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:45.160]   up, she her eyes glaze over what are some of those topics?
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:50.280]   Yeah, I mean, I think I could go deep on travel points and stuff.
[00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:53.080]   And I feel like sometimes I can get her reeled in and be like,
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.880]   let's engage. And sometimes she's like, why don't you just
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:58.440]   just find the hotel, send me to if you need me to pick between
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:43:01.080]   two, that's great. And then sometimes I call some of my
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:03.640]   other kind of nerdy travel hacking friends. And I'm like,
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:05.880]   where should we go in in Greece or something?
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:10.840]   100% Yeah, I totally relate to that. I once wrote an article
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:13.520]   about this concept where I said, my husband came home from work,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.240]   and I ran up to him at the door. And I was like, I moved this
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:19.480]   bank account around, and I opened up this credit card, and
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.960]   I saved $300. And it was this really long story. At the end,
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.840]   he said, I would have given you $300 to not tell me that story.
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:31.400]   He's very funny, and he's very nice. But anyway, I was like,
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:36.360]   oh, my husband is not my coupon person. And so I called my mom,
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:39.120]   and I told her that story, and she was thrilled. And so this
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:41.760]   whole concept of other significant others is that you
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.680]   should have people in your life who you go to for different
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:48.400]   things. I go to my husband to talk about health, working out,
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   eating, I go to my best friend from high school, if I want to
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.040]   talk about my emotions, I go to my sister, if I want to talk
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:57.760]   about work, and I have these different people in my life that
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:44:00.440]   play different roles. It takes the pressure off your
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:03.040]   relationship, your partner doesn't have to talk to you
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:06.200]   about travel points or coupons, you have someone else in your
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:10.280]   life. And it might sound simple, but it really allows your
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:13.720]   partner to serve the roles that they want to serve and not be
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:17.200]   forced into roles that really are not a good fit for them. And
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:20.200]   so in my personal life, I do have a big network of friends
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:24.760]   and community. But last year, during the pandemic, my husband
[00:44:24.760 --> 00:44:28.600]   and I went through this really horrific situation where he's
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:31.920]   super healthy, he's a vegan, and all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.800]   he was diagnosed with this rare form of bone cancer. And it was
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:39.320]   the beginning of the pandemic, just completely surprising,
[00:44:39.320 --> 00:44:41.680]   right? It felt like the world was falling apart, our world was
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.920]   falling apart. And so I was good at asking for help from
[00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.720]   different friends, but people couldn't travel, people couldn't
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:51.960]   visit us indoors, it's very isolating, alienating time. And
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:55.720]   so Chris, our mutual friend, Kristen, runs this communal
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:44:59.880]   living house called Radish. And so my husband and I happened to
[00:44:59.880 --> 00:45:03.720]   go there for dinner during the pandemic. And we were like, wow,
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.080]   these people are doing the pandemic correctly. They are 14
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.760]   people living together, they have dinner together every
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.000]   night, they are just really supporting each other, they were
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.720]   in one quarantine pod. And so we ended up moving into an
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.320]   apartment within Radish, and basically creating this really
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:25.840]   tight knit group of OSOs, other significant others, to get us
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:28.680]   through the pandemic to get us through his cancer treatment.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:32.720]   Really, they were incredible. And we even have our WhatsApp
[00:45:32.720 --> 00:45:36.560]   group is called OSOs. And so I feel like for anyone listening,
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.920]   whether you're going through a tragedy or not, just investing
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.360]   in those relationships in your life, to take pressure off your
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:46.960]   partnership and to invest in friendships and community and
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:49.480]   colleagues. That's really one of the secrets to a great
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.760]   relationship, because then it's kind of like a release valve
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:55.880]   that just allows the relationship to be what it can
[00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.520]   be and doesn't put too much pressure on it.
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.760]   Wow. Well, first off, I'm sorry to hear about your husband.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:05.160]   Oh, thank you. Okay. What one other kind of hack that I heard
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:08.520]   you talk about in the past, which I'd love to kind of
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:10.520]   explain a little bit about is how you ended up writing the
[00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:14.720]   book and forcing yourself to make progress on something that,
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:18.280]   you know, I'm definitely a procrastinator. And and you you
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.920]   found a way to do that, that I think is a little bit unique.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:24.360]   Sure. Yeah, I would love to talk about that. So I love the
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:27.800]   framework from Gretchen Rubin called the four tendencies. And
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:30.640]   that was some of the inspiration for my thing in the dating
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:35.080]   tendencies. And so I'm an obliger, which means that it's
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:39.360]   easy for me to hold. It's easy for me to show up for other
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.720]   people, but it's less easy for me to show up to myself. So you
[00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.240]   and I have this appointment to do a podcast, of course, I was
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.840]   going to be here, I wouldn't have missed it. But if I put on
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.360]   my calendar later, do Peloton at 330, there's a high percentage
[00:46:51.360 --> 00:46:54.320]   chance that I will not show up for myself. So knowing that I
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:58.440]   said, How can I tap into my obliger tendency to get this
[00:46:58.440 --> 00:47:03.640]   book written. And so what I did is I asked a number of people,
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:07.000]   can you host book dinners for me, I'm going to give you a
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.880]   certain amount of money towards food, you get to invite the
[00:47:09.880 --> 00:47:13.080]   people and what's going to happen is, I'm going to send two
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.920]   chapters of my book a few days before the dinner, then
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:20.000]   everyone will read the chapters in advance, come to the dinner
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:23.680]   and discuss them. And so the feedback at those dinners was
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:27.920]   priceless. I got a lot of great ideas, great terms, I understood
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.520]   where I was being offensive or not inclusive, or I thought a
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:35.400]   joke was funny, and it wasn't. But perhaps most important was
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:38.080]   that I wasn't going to let these people down. If people were
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.320]   throwing me a dinner party and come Thursday night to coming to
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:46.120]   this dinner, I was 100% going to send them those chapters. And so
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   I basically tapped into this obliger tendency. And I said, I
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:51.200]   might not show up for myself, but I'll show up for other
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:54.960]   people. I had a bunch of these dinners. And that was really how
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:59.200]   I was able to get my book done, stick to a schedule and not
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.400]   procrastinate. And I think it's really because of that hack that
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:06.120]   I didn't just have a mental breakdown and write my book four
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:09.240]   weeks before it was due. And in fact, I handed my book in on
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.720]   time, which based on the feedback from my editor, I think
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:15.640]   is actually pretty rare. But I was like, no, that deadline is
[00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.200]   there for a reason. Once you let the deadline pass, maybe you'll
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.960]   never hand it in. And it was super important to me to hit that
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.880]   deadline. Wow. Yeah. I only recently have ever even thought
[00:48:26.880 --> 00:48:29.760]   about a book because someone brought it up. They were like,
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:32.280]   Oh, I love the podcast. Is he ever gonna write the book? I'm
[00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:35.480]   curious, as someone who may be similarly, I'm not sure if you
[00:48:35.480 --> 00:48:37.440]   had aspirations to write a book, but you've gone through this
[00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:40.920]   process. Does that make you tell people? Yeah, you should? Or is
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.440]   that like, man, that was a process? I don't recommend it.
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:48.440]   It definitely was a life goal of mine. My big life goals for the
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:52.800]   last 10 years were give a TED talk, get published in modern
[00:48:52.800 --> 00:48:55.480]   love in the New York Times and write a book that my parents
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:58.720]   would read. And I've been really focused on those goals. And I
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:01.040]   now with the book coming out have achieved all three of them.
[00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:03.400]   And that's felt great. And I do think it's a good lesson that
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:05.600]   just having goals, whether or not you hit them exactly
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.600]   definitely helps you prioritize your time, take big risks,
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:13.200]   believe in yourself, things like that. Writing a book is so hard.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:16.200]   You're solo, you're sitting alone at a WeWork, you're
[00:49:16.200 --> 00:49:19.200]   editing the same sentence for the 10th time, you're sick of
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:22.800]   being by yourself, you're sick of staring at the screen,
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:25.680]   writing a book is really hard. And so when people call me
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:29.600]   saying, should I write a book, I usually say, only write a book
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.200]   if you can't imagine not writing it, because otherwise, there's
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:37.280]   just a lot of other media that you could explore. So with a
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:39.760]   podcast, it's like you and I are recording this now, I'm sure
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.560]   it'll come out pretty soon. And then you're going to get
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:44.360]   feedback on it. With a book, you might work on it for three
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:48.520]   years, not get any feedback. And then it comes out. And so I
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:51.000]   think there's a lot of things that are, there are a lot of
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.240]   easier ways to express your ideas than a book. And so you
[00:49:54.240 --> 00:49:57.960]   should really only write one if you can't imagine not writing
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:49:58.280]   one.
[00:49:58.280 --> 00:50:01.520]   I like that framework. So you hit your three goals. What are
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.640]   the next big three goals?
[00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:07.920]   I have to think about that. Yeah, I think it was a what,
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.440]   where are we? We're in November right now. Yeah, I really need
[00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:15.040]   to assess my for my 2022 goals. But I imagine that there'll be
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:19.160]   personal things around achieving work life balance. I also
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.640]   started a course on Maven. Are you familiar with Maven? Yeah,
[00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:25.840]   so I'm launching my first course next week in terms of teaching
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:28.960]   people more at scale, like moving from one on one coaching
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   to cohort based courses. I have a great person working with me
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:36.560]   on that. Yeah, I love the question. And I have to think
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:39.520]   about like, what are my next big goals? I think probably things
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:42.880]   around like having a TV show or having a podcast, things like
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:46.760]   that. But right now, I'm just really having fun seeing the
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:49.800]   impact of my book and getting these great emails about people
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:52.880]   who said, in the past, I would have rejected this person
[00:50:52.880 --> 00:50:57.000]   because of his job or because of his height. And now I'm in the
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.840]   happiest relationship I've ever been in. And so for now, I feel
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.720]   like I'm actually just really absorbing the impact of the book
[00:51:02.720 --> 00:51:03.560]   and that's been fun.
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:08.040]   Yeah, I mean, I, I get emails a lot. Sounds like you do too.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:11.200]   It's really rewarding, I think, to create content and know that
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:14.440]   people are listening and people are enjoying it. It's having an
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:18.240]   impact on their life. So keep it coming. I love it. We didn't
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.400]   talk about this at all. I know you work at Hinge. But what do
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.920]   you think of dating apps and how they've affected all of this?
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:27.520]   Yeah, so I'm a huge fan of Hinge and I was before I worked
[00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:31.240]   there. How I ended up working there was I interviewed Justin
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.800]   McLeod, the CEO of Hinge while I was writing my book. And I
[00:51:34.800 --> 00:51:38.800]   walked in very skeptically sort of saying, your tagline is
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:41.440]   designed to be deleted. That doesn't make any sense. I've
[00:51:41.440 --> 00:51:44.800]   worked in tech for a decade. Why would you want to have your
[00:51:44.800 --> 00:51:47.840]   user base leave when you have to get a bunch of new users? And
[00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:51.480]   his whole thing was ever since we adopted that tagline, and
[00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:56.080]   really adopted that ethos, we've grown exponentially. And that's
[00:51:56.080 --> 00:51:58.680]   because it's much more powerful if your friend through word of
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:02.200]   mouth says, Oh, I met someone on Hinge. It's a great place for
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:05.680]   people looking for relationships than just sort of gamifying it
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:10.080]   or doing whatever else. And so I feel like Hinge does a really
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:15.280]   good job at slowing people down. You have to comment on a photo
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:19.360]   or a written response, you can only send a certain number of
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.080]   likes per day. And so Hinge is really where people go when
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:25.720]   they're looking for a relationship. I think it's been
[00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.440]   fascinating to observe how dating has changed as people
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.600]   have more options. So there's certain groups that are really
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.160]   benefiting from it. So there's groups called thin markets,
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.840]   people over 50, the LGBTQ plus community, they really benefit
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:43.160]   from dating apps, because previously, it might have been
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.240]   very hard to identify singles in your area who are in that
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:50.360]   demographic. And with a dating app, it makes it really easy to
[00:52:50.360 --> 00:52:50.840]   do that.
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:55.400]   Yeah, an interesting question I have about dating apps. So I
[00:52:55.400 --> 00:52:58.240]   moved to Burlingame, which is, you know, south of San
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.760]   Francisco, and we have a 15 month old, and we're living in
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:04.960]   the suburbs, and a lot of our friends kind of moved farther
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:08.080]   away or places that aren't that convenient. And I realized that
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:10.360]   some of our closest friends now are people that we've met in the
[00:53:10.360 --> 00:53:13.720]   neighborhood, and that I don't have a lot of like close, I
[00:53:13.720 --> 00:53:18.400]   guess, OSOs in person. And so I was like, gosh, will there ever
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:22.920]   be an app that is commonplace for people to meet just people?
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.600]   And I thought it was so funny, because I my my quest on this
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:30.360]   led me to Bumble, which has a BFF feature, which I could never
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.120]   bring myself to actually use. But it was something that in my
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:37.880]   mind seemed like, well, if I want to meet someone, I could go
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:40.960]   randomly find them, but I can't because it's COVID. Like, what's
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.000]   the right way to apply everything about dating to
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.800]   meeting interesting people that could become close friends of
[00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.480]   yours, when we're no longer working in person, and there's
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:53.600]   less social events happening. Maybe that comes back sooner.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.920]   But it's something I've been thinking about a lot and didn't
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.840]   know if you had thoughts.
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:54:00.920]   One of my close friends, his name is Smiley Poswell ski, and
[00:54:00.920 --> 00:54:02.720]   he wrote a book called friendship in the age of
[00:54:02.720 --> 00:54:07.200]   loneliness. And his book is all about how do you meet friends in
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.720]   your late 20s and 30s and beyond. And I think it's just
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.400]   such an interesting premise. It's basically saying like, when
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.320]   you're in high school, when you're in college, there's all
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:16.880]   these people in the same stage of life as you everyone's
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:19.280]   looking to connect, but at a certain point, it becomes
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:22.400]   really hard. And so you might be surprised by the number of
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:25.640]   emails that I get saying, I'd love to have OSOs, but I don't
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:28.080]   have any friends, or I'd love to date one of my friends. But
[00:54:28.080 --> 00:54:30.680]   first, I'd have to make a friend. And so honestly, I think
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:35.200]   we are living in this loneliness pandemic. And one of the best
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:39.240]   ways to find a romantic relationship is to really expand
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:42.400]   your friendship community, because the more people you know,
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.280]   the more people they know. And so I just kind of want to
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:48.320]   validate and acknowledge that in general, when people move to the
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:50.920]   suburbs or move to a new city, it can be really hard to meet
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.080]   friends, and that there are some societally accepted ways to
[00:54:55.080 --> 00:55:01.320]   meet potential mates, like using hinge, but there isn't as
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.520]   necessarily such an easy way to meet friends. And yeah, I think
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:07.040]   that's a problem that people could solve.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.880]   Yeah. This has been so fascinating. Thank you so much
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.800]   for joining. Where should people find you online? And what are
[00:55:13.800 --> 00:55:15.720]   you working on right now that they can check out?
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:20.440]   Thanks, Chris. Yes. So people can find me at Logan Uri on
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:24.120]   Twitter and Instagram, they can go to my website, LoganUri.com.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:28.000]   I really encourage people to take that three tendencies quiz
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.800]   to find out what's holding them back from finding love. And if
[00:55:30.800 --> 00:55:34.200]   people are interested in working with me, they can email me about
[00:55:34.200 --> 00:55:37.320]   my cohort based course or about one on one coaching.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:40.080]   Awesome. Thank you so much for being here.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:42.040]   Thank you. It was so fun.
[00:55:42.040 --> 00:55:47.560]   What a fun conversation. Thank you so much for listening. I
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:49.720]   know many of you aren't currently dating, but I hope
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:53.200]   this was as interesting for you as it was for me. I am so
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:56.800]   curious about so many things and I always find it fascinating to
[00:55:56.800 --> 00:56:00.320]   dive deep into an area I know very little about. If there are
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:03.320]   any other topics or areas you think would be fun to dive into
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.080]   on the show, please send them my way. I'm Chris at AllTheHacks.com
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:11.160]   New issue of the newsletter all about holiday gifting and all
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:14.440]   the deals you can get shopping in person and online is coming
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:18.440]   tomorrow. It also has a few fun small gifts I'm really excited
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.600]   to be giving people this year. If you're not already subscribed,
