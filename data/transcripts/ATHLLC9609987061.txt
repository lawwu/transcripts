[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.160]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, LongAngle.
[00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   LongAngle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of LongAngle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on all the hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   Now, the majority of LongAngle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.280]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.680]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio to your children's
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.200]   education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.400]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.960]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out LongAngle and it's totally
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.760]   free to join.

[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.840]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   You heard about it here.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.840]   Hello, and welcome to another episode of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.520]   your life, money, and travel all while spending less and saving more.
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.800]   I'm your host, Chris Hutchins, and I am excited to have you joining us today for
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.240]   a conversation about dating, love, relationships, and more.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.640]   If you're thinking, "Well, I'm happily married.
[00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.720]   Maybe this isn't for me."
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.960]   Well, I really hope that's not the case because I am also happily married and I'm
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.760]   incredibly excited to talk to our guest, Logan Urie.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.000]   Logan is a behavioral scientist turned dating coach and the author of the
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.640]   fantastic book, How to Not Die Alone.
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.320]   She is also the Director of Relationship Science at the dating app, Hinge, where
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.520]   she leads a research team dedicated to helping people find love.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.600]   Before that, she ran Google's behavioral science team, the Irrational Lab.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.720]   Her works appeared in The New York Times, The Atlantic, The Washington Post, and so
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.600]   many more places.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.200]   While I might not be looking for love anymore, I'm so fascinated about everything
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.640]   she's learned from her research, especially because it seems like the internet has
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.360]   changed the dating landscape so much since I was in the game.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:43.000]   I'm also curious to hear everything she's learned about building long-lasting
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.800]   relationships and everything she's learned about how dating might apply to other
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.640]   areas of life.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.880]   Oh, and of course, I'm excited to learn what I might be able to share with a few
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.760]   of the friends of mine who are still on the hunt for their future spouse.
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.920]   So I hope you'll enjoy this conversation with Logan Urie.
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.000]   Let's jump in.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.960]   Logan, thank you for being here.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.200]   Hi, Chris.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.560]   I'm really excited to join you.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.320]   So the book is How to Not Die Alone, which is a really bold statement and one that I
[00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.480]   think speaks to a lot of people.
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.120]   Can you talk about coming up with the title, what it means and and why that's
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.560]   something that's really important to people?
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:24.800]   So the whole frame of my book is how can you apply behavioral science to decisions
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.680]   around dating and relationships?
[00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.520]   And so a lot of us have these cognitive biases or these blind spots that fuel
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.840]   faulty decision making.
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.920]   And so a big one that I'm sure you're familiar with is loss aversion, right?
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.000]   We have this huge urge to avoid loss at any cost.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.440]   And so what I wanted to do with the title, How to Not Die Alone, is really put you
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.120]   in this mindset of, oh, I could die alone.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.240]   And that's something that I really want to avoid.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.200]   And so I've absolutely heard the negative feedback, right?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.640]   Therapists write me and they're like, I love your book, but it's hard to recommend
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:01.880]   because my patients are going to be offended by the title.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:02.840]   But you know what?
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.080]   It's memorable and it really gets to the truth of the matter, which is if you're on
[00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:12.600]   a path towards dying alone and you don't want to be, read this book and let's do
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.360]   something about it.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.080]   Are people better off being with partners in their lives?
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.600]   Is there data to support that?
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.720]   Yeah, so I absolutely understand that there are people who are single and love it and
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.800]   more power to them.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.200]   But many people want to find a partner and people who are single and have been looking,
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.560]   let's say, for a decade are very frustrated by not being able to find someone.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:40.640]   And there is a lot of research around how being in a relationship can help you earn
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.440]   more money, be happier, be healthier, live longer.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.200]   And those results are especially true for men who are in relationships.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.000]   What what led you to jump into this field?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.880]   It's it's not a title that I think most people have.
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.560]   It's not an area most people dig into.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.800]   I've always been interested in love and dating and relationships, which I imagine
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.040]   many people are, right, like that is the core of most Sunday brunch conversations is
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.760]   talking about dating or complaining about your relationship.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.120]   I also have this interest in psychology and how people make decisions.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.160]   So let's see, around seven or eight years ago, when I was working at Google, leading
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.440]   this behavioral science team, I was also single and I was also using Tinder and other
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.840]   dating apps. And I was working at Google and I was like, OK, these are some of the
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:28.960]   smartest people in the world.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.280]   These are the wizards who created the Internet.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.400]   And we all seem to be struggling with dating.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:34.880]   What's going on here?
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.800]   And so I was able to combine these two interests, how people make decisions and sex,
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:46.560]   dating and relationships, and combine them to really forge my own career and my own
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.560]   direction, bridging the two.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.320]   And so what I've been doing since then is finding ways to say, all right, people are
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.080]   unhappy. They're not finding the relationships they want.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.720]   In many ways, it's because of these cognitive biases or blind spots.
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:05.240]   How can I break dating down into a series of micro decisions and help you make better
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.520]   choices along the way?
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.520]   Yeah, that makes so much sense.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.440]   And this has to be a problem that's existed forever, right?
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.720]   Is this kind of the oldest problem people have faced?
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.720]   And how has it evolved?
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:23.600]   Yeah, great question. So dating is actually a relatively new phenomenon, according to
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.320]   the book Labor of Love by Maura Weigel, which is a great book on the history of dating.
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:34.560]   Dating, as we think about it now, didn't really emerge on the scene until around 1890.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.120]   And so what happened before then was, depending on your social status in life, you
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.440]   might have an arranged marriage, right, with the prince of Sweden, or maybe just your
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:50.480]   father would negotiate with the person whose land touched the land next to next to his,
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.600]   right, the person with the parcel of land next to his.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:58.280]   And they would negotiate your hand in marriage for, let's say, 12 camels or a certain
[00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:04.040]   amount of rice. And so for a long time, you were not in charge of finding your long term
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.080]   partner. This was something that your community, your family, a matchmaker did for you.
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.440]   And so one of the big themes that we see in modern dating is that it feels like it's just
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.080]   up to us. And that can be very hard because, yes, we have more freedom to find someone.
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.840]   But it also means that if we fail, the failure is completely on our shoulders.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:30.680]   Yeah, I took a psychology of sex and relationships class in college, and we actually
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:32.400]   talked a bit about arranged marriages.
[00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:34.400]   And there are cultures where that's still a thing.
[00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:38.200]   What do you think of keeping that kind of pre 1890 tradition?
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:40.480]   Is that a process that works well?
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:42.280]   Is that something you address at all in the book?
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.120]   So the research on arranged marriage shows that arranged marriages start less happy than
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:52.320]   what's called love marriages or non-arranged marriages.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:58.960]   But after the four year mark, they actually overlap love marriages in terms of happiness.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:04.320]   So you start off in a lower place, but then over time you grow to love this person.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:09.720]   And so what's really interesting is we can't have an experiment where we assign this
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.400]   person an arranged marriage and this person a love marriage.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.600]   Right. There's obviously a lot of cultural reasons why this happens.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.280]   If you're in a culture where divorce is not really an option, then when you get into that
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   marriage, your mindset isn't I'm going to stay until I'm no longer happy.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.960]   It's this is forever.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:28.040]   And so I'm going to find a way to make it work.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:33.360]   And so there's something psychologically in that commitment where you say to yourself,
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.440]   this is what the rest of my life looks like.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:38.600]   So I'm going to commit and do everything I can to make it work.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.960]   But I have had plenty of millennials and even some people who are in Gen Z who've said
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.120]   to me, why should I pick the person?
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.640]   I have no idea what I'm doing.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.480]   I would be happy if somebody set up an arranged marriage for me because they can't do
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:54.040]   any worse than I have in choosing my person.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:58.120]   Yeah. And I think there's probably a middle ground there, too, which isn't just it
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:08:59.520]   doesn't have to be an arranged marriage.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.000]   But I have a friend and two friends that we set them up on a date and they knew each
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.840]   other. They actually worked with each other, but they never thought they should date.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.400]   And we're like, why don't you guys just go on a date?
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:12.320]   And so I like to think there's a middle ground of telling people, hey, maybe you should
[00:09:12.320 --> 00:09:14.400]   go on a date, but you don't have to necessarily get married.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.800]   Like we don't have to commit you to this this grand thing.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:21.160]   So I don't know if that's that's played a role in helping people try things they
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:24.760]   wouldn't try, which I have to assume people aren't the most rational when it comes to
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   dating. Yeah, it's really interesting.
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.440]   I do feel like now with the position that I'm in, if I set people up on a date, they're
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:37.640]   likely to say yes, and then they're likely to think, well, Logan really thought that I
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.760]   would get along well with this person.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.440]   And so I think that's only a positive because they walk into the date thinking, all
[00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:48.160]   right, I'm going to try to discover what Logan had in mind for me about this person,
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:53.240]   or I'm going to walk in with a really positive frame and I'm expecting to like them.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.840]   And what we know is that so much of our experience in life, including dating, is all
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:03.640]   about our mindset. So there's that quote, whether you think things will go well or you
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.480]   think things will go poorly, you're right.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:11.360]   And so when I think about that with dating, it's like if you walk in with a mindset of
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.520]   it hasn't worked for the last 10 years, this is my one hundredth first date in a long
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:18.800]   time, it's not going to work out, yeah, it probably won't.
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:23.880]   But if you walk in with the mindset of I'm going to create the experience I want to
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:28.200]   have, it only takes one person that has a huge impact on how you show up and how well
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:28.920]   the date goes.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:34.960]   Yeah, it's interesting, I was talking to Patrick McGinnis, who's this guy who created
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:39.920]   the term FOMO, and I think you were on his podcast, actually, and he brought up in
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.720]   conversation that people who make kind of quicker, less research decisions are often
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:45.720]   happier with the outcome.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.520]   And people who take more time actually might make a better decision but are less happy
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.000]   because they're aware of the alternatives.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.440]   So a question I have is I feel like and I totally miss this boat, right?
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:01.520]   I haven't really dated anyone since the late 90s, maybe the early 2000s.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.800]   So I miss the boat on online dating.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:08.240]   But I feel like now there's it feels like there's a lot of options in front of you
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.000]   versus before it was kind of who you met.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.160]   Does do more options make it harder for people to date?
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.440]   Yeah, so I love everything Patrick said, and I'm sure we'll get into this.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:23.320]   But one of my contributions to the field is this idea of the three dating tendencies,
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:28.520]   this framework for how people have unrealistic expectations and how it holds them back.
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.240]   And one of those tendencies is the maximizer.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.240]   And the maximizer is all about I want to see every possible option.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.960]   I want to turn over every stone.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.920]   And then and only then can I make the perfect decision.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.680]   And there's this obsession with optimizing and making the perfect decision.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:49.360]   But what we know is that there's another group called satisficers.
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:53.000]   And these are people who, instead of trying to find the perfect thing, say,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.320]   I have a bar, I'm going to stop looking once I achieve that benchmark.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:02.600]   And what we see is that satisficers are happier than maximizers,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:06.440]   because in life it's not about making the perfect decision.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.760]   It's about how you feel about your decision.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.640]   And so in dating and in many things,
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.920]   it's not about seeing everything that's out there and choosing.
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:19.240]   It's about choosing something great, committing to it, building it and making it work.
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.920]   And going back to what we said about arranged marriages,
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.240]   there's an element of satisficing in arranged marriages.
[00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:30.280]   You're not saying, who are the 10 other people I could have married and would they have been better?
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.000]   It's I'm going to make what I have in front of me work because I'm committed.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.160]   And that's how I'm going to be happiest long term.
[00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.680]   It seems somewhat in conflict with the concept of there being the one.
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:44.120]   So would it be fair to say that's not not something that you kind of believe in?
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.800]   Absolutely, yes.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:48.040]   I think the one is a harmful idea.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:49.400]   The same thing with soulmates,
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.360]   because it gives people permission to leave relationships that are perfectly good enough,
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.120]   but that they're struggling in.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:00.920]   And so there might be a situation where you expect that you're going to meet your soulmate,
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.160]   that everything is going to be easy.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.000]   And then you're dating them and you hit an inevitable rough patch.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.200]   And instead of saying, yep, this is what relationships look like, you say,
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:12.360]   well, this person must not be my soulmate,
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.320]   because if they were my soulmate, this would be so much easier.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:17.000]   So then you leave the relationship.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.040]   So if you remove the concept of the soulmate and you say,
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:23.560]   there are many people in the world with whom you could get along,
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.360]   you can write different love stories and different life stories with different people,
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.360]   then you no longer put that pressure on yourself to find that one person.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.960]   And you instead are empowered to build a great relationship
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.440]   instead of focusing on finding that perfect person.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:43.080]   Yeah, that sounds like the kind of maximizer to satisficer transition.
[00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:46.760]   I don't know where I am in dating, but I know in a lot of things in life,
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.280]   I definitely feel like that maximizer personality
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.440]   and certainly my optimizing attitude falls in that.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:59.880]   Are there tricks or tips to help someone kind of make that transition more easy?
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:01.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:06.280]   And this is something that Patrick and I have talked a lot about in terms of FOMO.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:09.960]   So for example, I am absolutely a maximizer.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.160]   And in all the research that I did for my book,
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.320]   one of the clear things that came out for me
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.920]   is that some things are just not worth maximizing.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.720]   So somebody might say, oh, I don't use Instacart
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:24.840]   because I want to be able to choose the right tomato
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:27.800]   and somebody else can't choose the perfect tomato for me.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.120]   Then when you think about it, it's like in the scheme of life,
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:33.080]   how important is it that you be the one to choose the tomato?
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.960]   And could your time be better spent elsewhere?
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.840]   Another thing is I used to spend multiple days researching airline flights,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:46.120]   trying to get the perfect arrival time and the perfect airline and maximizing my points.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:49.400]   And then at the end of the day, it was just a waste of time.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.400]   So now I'll say something to myself like,
[00:14:51.400 --> 00:14:54.680]   I'm giving myself one hour to research flights.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.640]   And at the end of that, I'm going to choose the best possible flight.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:59.800]   And so part of it is understanding,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.760]   does this decision matter enough, matter or not?
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.960]   Another one is giving yourself a time limit.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.320]   And I think another one is just a psychological shift to say,
[00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:14.680]   it matters how I feel about the decision, not if it's the perfect decision.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.960]   And I'm actually more likely to be happy with my decision
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:22.360]   if I set a benchmark, stop looking once I've achieved it,
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:25.720]   and then embrace what I bought instead of the maximizer thing,
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:30.680]   which is you research for days or months or years, you buy the thing,
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.560]   and then you have this pro-con list in your head of
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:35.240]   all the other things you could have bought.
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:36.520]   And could this have been better?
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.840]   And actually, that experience is more likely to
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.240]   just make you regret your choice in the first place.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:43.720]   Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:45.320]   And so that's the maximizer.
[00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:48.600]   We didn't really describe it in the context of dating as much,
[00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:51.320]   but maybe it'd be interesting to walk through the
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:55.400]   three tendencies that you've identified and kind of talk a little bit about each.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.920]   Yeah, I do a lot of one-on-one dating coaching.
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:01.480]   And so that means that I'm meeting people around the world.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:05.480]   They're telling me their life story, their relationship history.
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:09.880]   We're talking about who they've been, who they are now, where they want to go.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:13.000]   And I found that talking to a lot of different people
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:14.840]   from different countries and cultures,
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:18.520]   they all seem to have the same thing in common,
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.640]   which is that they had unrealistic expectations
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.440]   of certain parts of dating and relationships.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.640]   And so from that, I created the three dating tendencies.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.080]   The first one is the romanticizer.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:35.960]   And this is the person who we talked about, the soulmate and the one.
[00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:39.160]   They have unrealistic expectations of relationships in general.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.720]   So this is the person who loves love,
[00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:45.560]   and they don't want to use a dating app because it's "not romantic."
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.520]   And they have this very clear vision in their head of
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.200]   what their future partner will look like.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:52.600]   They're focused on the "we met" story.
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.360]   And they think that once you meet the right person, everything's going to be easy.
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:17:00.200]   And the issue with the romanticizer is that
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.760]   they're not willing to put in effort to make the relationship great,
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:08.920]   and they're not even willing necessarily to be strategic about how to meet someone
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.040]   because they think that everything will happen to them.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:17.000]   And so for the romanticizer, it's about overcoming some of this prince charming stuff
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.400]   and really understanding that who cares how you met?
[00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   That's such a tiny percentage of the relationship.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.440]   What actually matters is building a relationship with someone.
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.520]   The second type, which we talked about a bunch, is the maximizer.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:32.200]   And their whole thing is, "Is there somebody better out there?"
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.360]   And so I meet a lot of people who say,
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:39.640]   "I like my girlfriend, but could she be 10% hotter or 5% more ambitious?
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:43.000]   Or could she push me more to think about big ideas?"
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.680]   And I have lots of conversations with people who are either single
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.120]   or deciding if they should get married or deciding if they should break up.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:54.280]   And I hear the maximizer come out of them where they're really weighing,
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:57.480]   "Is this the best that I could get, or is there somebody better out there?"
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.840]   And the third type is the hesitator.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:04.040]   And they have unrealistic expectations of themselves.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.720]   And they're just not even dating at all.
[00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.640]   So the story in their head is something like,
[00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:12.040]   "I'll be ready to date when I lose 10 pounds,
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:15.800]   when I have a more impressive job,
[00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:18.200]   when I move and get settled in my new city."
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.400]   And so they're always coming up with these reasons, really excuses,
[00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.120]   why they're not ready to date.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.480]   And the thing in their head is that they're not lovable yet.
[00:18:27.480 --> 00:18:31.080]   And only when they're lovable should they put themselves out there.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:33.800]   But the truth is that nobody's perfect.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.200]   Not you, not the person you're going to wind up with.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.520]   And you're only going to get better at dating by dating.
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.720]   And you're only going to figure out what kind of person you want to be with
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:45.480]   by dating a bunch of different people.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:50.600]   And so for hesitators, it's really about overcoming this fear of starting
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   and just really getting themselves out there,
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.400]   getting better at dating and learning who they should be with.
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:57.160]   It's fascinating that you break this down.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:19:01.160]   I can't remember, but I feel like I was probably a maximizer given my personality.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.840]   The show is called "All the Hacks."
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.640]   Yeah, so it's always looking for that extra 5%.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:09.400]   I've started learning in my life how to realize that
[00:19:09.400 --> 00:19:11.720]   that extra 5% for something really big
[00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.280]   is more important than the extra 5% for something small.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:18.120]   So I'm no longer picking out my own tomatoes,
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:20.600]   though the last two orders from Amazon Fresh
[00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:24.280]   have brought me green bananas that have taken three to four weeks to ripen.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:28.200]   So I'm currently have a big gripe with Amazon
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:33.240]   because each week it's new green bananas that just won't ever ripen.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.920]   But I feel like something interesting,
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.280]   we talk a lot about money on the show,
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:40.120]   and people seem to want to find love and build their wealth.
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.040]   They're kind of similar big aspirations in people's lives.
[00:19:44.040 --> 00:19:46.440]   And we don't talk about them either in school.
[00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:48.040]   It's not like you learn how to date in school
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.960]   or you learn how to manage your money in school.
[00:19:49.960 --> 00:19:52.600]   But it does seem like there's a lot more data and research
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:54.600]   on what people should do with their money.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:56.920]   So then there is about their relationships,
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   at least in terms of dating versus how to handle a marriage.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:02.120]   Is that true?
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.400]   Do you feel similarly about dating being kind of this taboo thing
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.240]   we never learn about but should?
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:11.320]   One thing I would say is there are definitely a lot of books
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:13.800]   that people read about money, right?
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:16.520]   So many people read "I Will Teach You to Be Rich."
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.240]   So many people read "The Millionaire Next Door,"
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.440]   "Rich Dad, Poor Dad."
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.520]   I do feel like there's really a tradition
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:24.360]   of a lot of personal finance books
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.920]   and people feeling really comfortable about saying,
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:29.560]   "Hey, how much are you invested in crypto?"
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.960]   And "Am I too late to buy Dogecoin?"
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.240]   And all of these different things, right?
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.080]   I feel like people are really comfortable with that.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.720]   There's less of a tradition of self-help books around dating
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.120]   that people are really comfortable talking about.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.640]   And there's sort of a shame around it.
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:46.520]   There's a feeling, "Oh, love is natural
[00:20:46.520 --> 00:20:49.000]   and you should be born knowing how to love."
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.160]   And to that, I would say, yes, love is natural,
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.760]   but dating is not.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:54.920]   Dating, as we talked about, is relatively new
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.680]   in the span of human history.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.080]   Dating apps are a decade old.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:01.400]   Of course, you need to be taught how to date.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.480]   It's not something that you are just born knowing.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:04.760]   It's actually pretty complicated.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.520]   You're making a decision.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.240]   If you're gonna be in a monogamous long-term relationship,
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.560]   you're choosing one person out of billions
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.000]   to spend your life with.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.360]   That's a huge amount of pressure.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.920]   In terms of how much research there is,
[00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:19.560]   so there is a field called Relationship Science,
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.400]   which is a field in academia.
[00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:23.480]   So one of my mentors, Eli Finkel,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.920]   is a relationship scientist out of Northwestern.
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:28.840]   He does incredible research there.
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:30.760]   And they talk about things like
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.600]   what makes people attracted to each other?
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.520]   Does that last long-term?
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.920]   What are the things that matter more and less
[00:21:36.920 --> 00:21:39.400]   than we think they do for long-term relationships?
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.600]   There's also Doctors John and Julie Gottman,
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.160]   who are out of Seattle,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:48.680]   who have been working in the field for over 40 years.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:51.560]   And they have done some really seminal research
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:53.160]   in the field of Relationship Science.
[00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.560]   So they have this concept called Bids
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:56.840]   that you may have come across,
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:59.800]   which is that, this is kind of a long story,
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.080]   but I think it's worth telling.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:04.200]   So what they used to do is
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:08.280]   they used to have this apartment
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.960]   and it was kind of like a room at an inn,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.760]   and they would have couples stay there for the weekend.
[00:22:14.760 --> 00:22:19.000]   And they decked it out with cameras, microphones.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   They measured the urine in the toilet.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.160]   They even had something under the chair
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.600]   called a gigalometer
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:26.920]   that measured how much you were moving your chair
[00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:27.800]   while you sat in it.
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.360]   And they would observe couples for the weekend.
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:32.280]   And they would look at how they talk to each other
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.400]   and different things like that.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.240]   Six years later, they checked in with these couples
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:40.040]   and they saw that some were together happily,
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:42.680]   they call these relationship masters,
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.680]   and some were together unhappily,
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:46.440]   relationship disasters,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.120]   or some people had broken up.
[00:22:48.120 --> 00:22:51.560]   And what they found was that the number one predictor
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:53.560]   of who would become a relationship master
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.240]   versus a relationship disaster
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:58.520]   is how the couples treated each other
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:00.120]   in these micro moments.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.720]   And so they call them bids.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:03.480]   So Chris, an example would be,
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:05.560]   you're staying in this inn with your wife
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:09.400]   and she stands up and looks out the window and says,
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.000]   "Oh, there's a sailboat going by."
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.680]   And you're sitting in the chair.
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:13.960]   How do you respond?
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:18.040]   Do you A, stand up and walk next to her and say,
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.320]   "Oh, that's a beautiful sailboat.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.200]   Maybe we should go sailing while we're in town."
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.640]   Do you ignore her?
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:27.960]   Or do you say, "Wife, I'm trying to read the paper.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.800]   Why are you interrupting me?"
[00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:31.000]   And this might seem really small.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.960]   It's just a small moment
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:33.160]   where she's talking about a boat.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.360]   But how you respond to those bids for connection
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:38.280]   determines how you'll do long-term.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:41.800]   And so successful couples turn towards each other,
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.600]   which is being positive, being affirming,
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:46.600]   asking a follow-up question.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.040]   They turn towards each other 86% of the time.
[00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:53.720]   And the couples that break up or are unhappily married,
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.400]   they only turn towards each other 33% of the time.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:59.400]   And so what they found is that relationships
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.240]   are not about the once-a-year trip to Hawaii
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:06.600]   or the romantic dinner once in a while.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.440]   It's about on a daily basis,
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.600]   when your partner tries to connect with you,
[00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:12.200]   do you choose to connect back?
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:13.640]   And that's really what determines
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:16.520]   how happy and successful we are in relationships long-term.
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.120]   - It seems like with every business,
[00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:23.480]   you get to a certain size and the cracks start to emerge.
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.360]   Things that you used to do in a day are taking a week
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.680]   and you have too many manual processes
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:30.920]   and there's no one source of truth.
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.880]   If this is you, you should know these three numbers,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.160]   37,000, 25, one.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:39.400]   37,000, that's the number of businesses
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.720]   which have upgraded to NetSuite by Oracle.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.360]   And I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:46.920]   NetSuite is the number one cloud financial system,
[00:24:46.920 --> 00:24:49.160]   streamlining accounting, financial management,
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.840]   inventory, HR, and more.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.280]   25, NetSuite turns 25 this year.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:58.120]   That's 25 years of helping businesses do more with less,
[00:24:58.120 --> 00:25:01.640]   close their books in days, not weeks, and drive down costs.
[00:25:01.640 --> 00:25:05.480]   And one, because your business is one of a kind,
[00:25:05.480 --> 00:25:08.920]   so you get a customized solution for all your KPIs
[00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:12.120]   in one efficient system with one source of truth.
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:15.640]   Manage risk, get reliable forecasts, and improve margins.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.680]   Everything you need to grow all in one place,
[00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:21.080]   which I can tell you from all the companies I've run,
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.240]   makes everything so much better.

[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.840]   There is nothing I love more than learning
[00:25:48.840 --> 00:25:51.960]   that something I enjoy is actually so good for you,
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.760]   and nothing showcases that better than Pu-erh tea.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.360]   It has so many health benefits,
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.160]   and I think one of the best and easiest ways to consume it
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.640]   is from our sponsor today, Peak Tea.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.280]   Peak's Pu-erh teas are all cold-extracted,
[00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:06.280]   using only wild-harvested leaves
[00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:09.160]   from 250-year-old tea trees,
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.280]   rich in minerals, theraflavins, and catechins.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.680]   Then everything is triple-toxin screened
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.520]   for pesticides, heavy minerals,
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.400]   and toxic mold commonly found in plants.
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.600]   And Peak's products are so easy and zero-prep,
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.000]   because they're all in pre-measured quantities
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.960]   that dissolve in cold or hot water in seconds,
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.040]   and are so travel-friendly.
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:31.560]   They have so many products,
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:34.600]   but lately I've been alternating between the green Pu-erh
[00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.200]   for mental clarity and energy,
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.560]   and the black Pu-erh,
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:40.360]   which helps kickstart digestion and metabolism
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.160]   with a rich, earthy flavor that is so good,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:45.640]   and probably one of my favorite things to drink.
[00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.000]   And if you need another reason,
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.400]   search for all the amazing research-backed benefits
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.720]   of polyphenols for your gut microbiome,
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:53.240]   heart, blood sugar, and more,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:55.960]   and then be happy that Pu-erh is more concentrated
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:58.680]   in polyphenols than all other teas in the world.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:00.440]   But you don't even have to take my word,
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.480]   or do any research,
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.480]   because Peak offers free US shipping,
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:06.280]   free returns, and a money-backed guarantee.
[00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:07.480]   And for a limited time,
[00:27:07.480 --> 00:27:09.480]   you can get up to 15% off,
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.200]   and a free quiver with 12 tea samples
[00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.800]   at my link at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:17.960]   That's P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:21.880]   So check them out today at allthehacks.com/peak.
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.240]   P-I-Q-U-E.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.800]   Now, I know there are sometimes things
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.120]   that are causation or not.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.280]   Do you think that this is something,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.640]   it sounds like something you could learn?
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:34.200]   It's like, oh, if I want to have a long-term relationship,
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.840]   I could just make sure that I put more of an effort in
[00:27:36.840 --> 00:27:39.080]   to respond positively to these bids,
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.960]   or is it more the kinds of people who by default
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.040]   respond to those bids are more successful?
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:44.840]   Is it one or the other?
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.640]   - So yeah, it's a great question,
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:49.960]   and this is definitely something that can be taught,
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.840]   and it's why I find the work of the Gottmans so inspiring,
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:57.080]   because since I first went to their workshop
[00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.440]   with my then-boyfriend, now-husband in 2015,
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:02.280]   I've been applying this lesson all the time,
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.880]   and I can see the periods of my life
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:05.640]   where I was more focused on work
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.240]   and less invested in the relationship,
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:09.160]   which meant I wasn't making as many bids
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.920]   or I wasn't responding to bids.
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:12.360]   Our relationship did worse,
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:15.240]   and now I'm constantly reminding myself,
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:18.120]   if he walks into the room and talks about his day
[00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:19.640]   and I'm in the middle of an email,
[00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:21.320]   the most important thing I can do
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.800]   is look away from my computer and talk to him,
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.960]   because that's the stuff that really matters.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:28.760]   And so yes, there are people who are naturally inclined
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.600]   to be good at relationships, right?
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:35.240]   If you are more open, if you are less neurotic,
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.000]   if you are more conscientious,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.320]   those personality traits are correlated
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.000]   with relationship success,
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.440]   just because it might be easier
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.200]   for you to connect with people
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:46.760]   or for you to follow through or be reliable.
[00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:49.400]   But in general, the concept of bids is pretty simple.
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.680]   It's make efforts to connect with your partner.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:55.080]   And when your partner makes efforts to connect with you,
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.600]   choose to turn towards those bids.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.920]   - Yeah, this is great.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:03.480]   I feel like that's something that everyone could apply
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:05.640]   to any relationship they're in.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.720]   Do you think it applies to other relationships?
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:08.600]   Like even at work,
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:09.960]   if someone brings something up at work,
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:12.040]   do you build deeper relationships with colleagues
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.600]   by responding to maybe they're not bids,
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.120]   but similar aspect?
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.480]   - Absolutely, yes.
[00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:19.560]   I just recently gave a talk at Google
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:20.840]   applying some of these concepts
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.720]   from relationship science to relationships at work.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.960]   And bids was one of the main things I talked about,
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:28.360]   which is that relationships are really built
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.480]   in these small moments.
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.680]   So if your colleague just came back from a trip,
[00:29:32.680 --> 00:29:35.720]   spend 30 seconds saying, "Hey, how was your trip?
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.000]   "What was it like to be there?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.960]   "How did you choose?"
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.440]   Just make an effort to connect with that person.
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:41.960]   Or if somebody mentions
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.720]   that they haven't been feeling well,
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.000]   the next time you talk to them, say,
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.200]   "Hey, how are you feeling?"
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.800]   And it's these small things that we think,
[00:29:47.800 --> 00:29:50.200]   "Oh, those are so small, they probably don't matter."
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:53.000]   But the reframe is they are so small,
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:55.400]   and in some ways they are the only things that matter.
[00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:58.280]   - Yeah, and so you said you did this talk,
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.240]   that was a big piece of it.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:02.120]   Were there other lessons from relationships and dating
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:05.000]   that apply outside of that world?
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.240]   - So one of the big things I talked about
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.240]   in terms of applying relationship science
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:11.000]   to relationships at work
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.320]   is what I just mentioned in terms of bids
[00:30:13.320 --> 00:30:16.760]   and what the Gottmans call small things often.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.600]   And so some of my key takeaways there,
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.720]   one of them was make bids to new team members,
[00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:24.200]   turn towards bids from your colleagues,
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.920]   assume positive intent in digital communication.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.360]   That's a really big one.
[00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:30.280]   It's just so easy in a remote world
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.080]   to not have that foundation of friendship
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.840]   and intimacy to fall back on.
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:36.200]   And so when somebody says something
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.280]   that feels kind of sharp in a Google Doc,
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.440]   you might just assume that they're criticizing you.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:43.080]   But how can you really assume positive intent?
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:44.040]   And then another one,
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:46.440]   which I got from my friend, Liz Foslian,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.960]   who if you're not aware of her work,
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.280]   she would be a great guest on your podcast.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.680]   She has an Instagram account called Liz and Molly,
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:56.920]   and she does these amazing illustrations
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.440]   about things at work.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.040]   And so this is a concept from her
[00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:02.200]   called assign a meeting monitor,
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:04.520]   which is that on a rotating basis,
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:06.760]   you have somebody in a meeting who makes sure,
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.120]   did this person raise their hand,
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.040]   but not have a chance to speak?
[00:31:10.040 --> 00:31:14.440]   Or has this person not expressed their feedback in a while?
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:16.280]   And should you reach out to them one-on-one?
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.280]   Is somebody consistently being interrupted?
[00:31:18.280 --> 00:31:21.560]   And just monitoring those micro moments in a meeting
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:23.080]   can actually have a big impact
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.400]   on whether or not somebody feels heard,
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:27.640]   whether or not somebody feels respected at work.
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.560]   And so really the overall concept here
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:32.600]   is that a lot of what matters to us in relationships,
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.040]   which is how we feel in small moments
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.560]   also affects us at work.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.400]   And then the other concept that I applied
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:41.800]   is called decide don't slide.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.680]   And so there's tons of research in relationship science
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:48.200]   that shows that couples who make conscious decisions
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.520]   to either move forward or break up
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.840]   are happier, more successful,
[00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:54.840]   and even have more passionate sex
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.480]   than couples who do the opposite, what's called sliding.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:58.920]   So sliding would be,
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.080]   "Chris, you and I have been dating for a while.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:01.960]   My lease is up.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   I guess I should just move in with you."
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.880]   As opposed to us sitting down and saying,
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:07.720]   "What does moving in together mean to you?
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:11.080]   Does it mean we're giving our relationship a try?
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.600]   Does it mean we're gonna get married?"
[00:32:12.600 --> 00:32:13.400]   Things like that.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.400]   And so you wanna decide your way into a decision not slide.
[00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:18.920]   And the same thing is true at work.
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:21.160]   You wanna be constantly checking in about,
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.640]   "Are we on the same page about priorities?
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:25.880]   Have we talked about OKR planning?
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.280]   Do I understand if the company's initiatives have changed?"
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.480]   You really want to make sure
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.960]   that people are super clear on their roles,
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.720]   responsibilities, priorities,
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:37.080]   and not just making assumptions
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.320]   and sliding your way into the next project.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:42.680]   - Yeah, if I apply some of these lessons
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.200]   back to relationships,
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.800]   which is, I guess, where they started,
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.680]   it seems like some of the biggest things people get wrong
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.840]   are thinking it's all about the big moments
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.560]   and kind of not taking the time
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.080]   to maybe be more intentional
[00:32:55.080 --> 00:32:57.800]   about major points in a relationship.
[00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:00.360]   Are there any other big things you think people get wrong
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.120]   about relationships with partners?
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:03.960]   - Yeah, there's a ton.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.240]   So starting with dating,
[00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:07.960]   one of the biggest mistakes that I see people making
[00:33:07.960 --> 00:33:10.120]   is this idea of optimizing for the spark.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.440]   And so, so often I will set somebody up on a date
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.520]   or my dating coaching client will call me
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:18.200]   and they'll say, "I met this woman.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:19.400]   She was perfectly nice.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.120]   She was great.
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.320]   We had a great conversation.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.160]   She was attractive, dynamic.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.360]   I'm not gonna see her again."
[00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:27.480]   I'll say, "That's surprising, why?"
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.000]   And the person will say,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.840]   "Well, I just didn't feel the spark."
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:33.880]   And so the spark has become this all-encompassing word
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.960]   that means I didn't feel instant chemistry.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.320]   I didn't feel fireworks.
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:39.160]   And it's just such a mistake
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:41.400]   because many of the happiest couples I know
[00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:43.720]   knew each other for a long time
[00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:45.640]   before they started dating.
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.760]   Maybe they worked together.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:48.760]   Maybe they were roommates.
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:52.200]   Maybe they orbited each other in a mutual friend group.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:55.640]   And over time, that person becomes more attractive to you.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.240]   You see how kind they are.
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:33:59.240]   You see how talented they are.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.600]   And that affection and appreciation grows.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:05.720]   And so I say to my clients, "Fuck the spark,"
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.760]   which is stop expecting instant chemistry
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:10.840]   and instead say, "What side of me
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.440]   does this person bring out?
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.360]   Am I curious about them?
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:16.120]   Do they make me feel relaxed?
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.880]   Do they make me feel confident?
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.120]   Do I feel attracted to them?"
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.360]   And really just tuning in to different sides
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:24.680]   of the experience instead of optimizing
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.000]   for this immediate fireworks or chemistry.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.080]   - Yeah, I like that.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:32.680]   My wife and I met in a co-ed business fraternity
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:35.080]   and she was my little brother.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:38.040]   So we certainly did not start with a spark.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.480]   In fact, it was through these planned activities
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.840]   that we were supposed to do with each other
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.840]   that we ended up falling for each other.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.400]   And at the end of the semester,
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.720]   they were like, "Which big little brother combo
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.320]   had kind of done the most activities?"
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:52.760]   And we were like, "Well, let's withdraw
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:55.080]   from this competition because now we're dating."
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.640]   And I feel like we just ticked off a lot of boxes
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.000]   that people don't need to know about.
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:00.040]   - That's so funny.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:01.480]   Rarely does somebody tell me
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:03.400]   my wife was my little brother in college.
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:05.080]   - Yeah, yeah, that might be a first.
[00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:08.360]   It's not a typical way to open a conversation,
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.840]   but it usually leads to some fun stories.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:12.600]   I noticed the longest chapter, I think,
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:15.240]   in the entire book was about looking for a life partner,
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:16.120]   not a prom date.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.080]   And I'm curious if the length of that chapter
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:21.240]   could interpret that that's kind of the biggest problem
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:24.440]   that people face or how you think about that challenge
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.280]   of people looking for something that's different
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.320]   than what they actually need.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.400]   - That's so funny that you brought that up.
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:31.400]   I don't think anyone else has mentioned that.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.160]   And Chris, I do hope we get a chance
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.920]   to talk about the book writing process,
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:38.200]   but honestly, writing a book is so hard.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:40.520]   And especially your first one, you're just like,
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:41.640]   "How long is a chapter?
[00:35:41.640 --> 00:35:43.480]   Do all chapters have to be the same length?"
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.640]   And in a really early version of the book,
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.880]   I had some chapters that were, let's say, 10 pages
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.320]   and some that were 50 pages,
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.480]   was able to work with an editor who explained like,
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.680]   "No, this needs to become a sidebar in another chapter
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.440]   and most chapters should be similar length."
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:58.840]   And so I didn't even realize off the top of my head
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.120]   that that was the longest chapter,
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:01.720]   but that does make sense.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:03.640]   And so the premise there is that
[00:36:03.640 --> 00:36:05.400]   at a certain point in your life,
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:08.360]   you need to stop looking for the prom date.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:10.920]   The prom date is somebody who's hot.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:14.280]   You would love to dance the night away with them.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:16.280]   Maybe you'd wanna sleep with them at the end of the night,
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:18.040]   but they're not really the person
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.640]   who's necessarily reliable
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.200]   and gonna pick up your kids from the dentist.
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.840]   The life partner is the person
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:27.640]   who you want to align yourself with long-term.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.280]   This is a person who you can make hard decisions with,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:31.800]   who you fight with well,
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.160]   who you respect,
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.520]   who you admire,
[00:36:34.520 --> 00:36:39.160]   who brings out a really happy, satisfied part of you.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:40.280]   And all too often,
[00:36:40.280 --> 00:36:43.000]   I see that people start in their dating journeys
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   by going after the prom date
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.640]   and then they never make that really important shift
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.880]   to start looking for the life partner.
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:51.880]   And so for many of the people I work with,
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.000]   it's about saying, "Hey,
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:55.240]   you need to take yourself more seriously.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:58.920]   Stop dating this guy who doesn't call you back,
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:03.320]   who doesn't really care for himself or other people,
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:06.360]   who doesn't seem to be passionate about anything.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.880]   He's ambivalent about his job
[00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:09.560]   and he's ambivalent about you."
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:10.760]   And start looking for someone
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.960]   who's actually serious about building a relationship.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.360]   And so there is this really critical point
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:18.840]   where hopefully sooner rather than later,
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:19.960]   people understand,
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.400]   "Okay, maybe I would have gone out
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:22.440]   with that person in the past,
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:23.800]   but they're more of a prom date
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.960]   and now it's time to really find this life partner."
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:28.520]   - Unfortunately for me,
[00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:30.280]   I'm in a relationship,
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:33.720]   a lot of the chapters were more like curiosity filling
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:35.960]   than things that I can apply necessarily,
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.880]   though I really appreciate you helping me
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.800]   apply them to work examples.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:42.840]   But the last chapter was one of the shortest
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:46.440]   and about what to do after you decide to get married
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.800]   and with your spouse.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:49.640]   And I'm hoping that maybe that's
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:51.640]   because there's a second book in the works,
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:52.520]   maybe not,
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:54.120]   but I'm curious where you would go
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.720]   with the things you've learned
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.720]   for people already in a relationship
[00:37:57.720 --> 00:38:00.760]   that want to make that relationship last longer.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.040]   We talked about bids,
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.880]   but are there other things you think people
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:06.120]   should work into their practice of their marriage?
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:07.320]   I know you're married,
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:09.000]   are there things you do specifically?
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.600]   - I'm married, yes, it's funny.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:12.360]   One of the most common Google search terms
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:13.640]   is "Logan, you're a husband,"
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:17.960]   which I wonder if you have like Chris Hutchins' wife,
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.000]   if people Google that.
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.280]   I think it's a lot of people are like,
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.640]   "All right, who's this Logan person?
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:22.520]   "Is she even married?
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.640]   "Has she even found love?"
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   So anyway, yes, I am married.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:28.520]   In terms of why that chapter is there,
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:31.640]   just a little bit of behind the scenes with book writing.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:33.880]   It felt very clear to me
[00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.080]   in terms of who would buy the book
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.840]   that it would be mostly people
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:39.080]   who are single and looking for a relationship.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:39.880]   For that expression,
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:43.320]   it's easier to sell medicine than a vitamin, right?
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.840]   It's when somebody has a problem,
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:46.600]   they want to pay to solve it
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.360]   versus somebody is less likely to pay money
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.800]   just to say like, "Yeah, I should invest
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:51.880]   "in my long-term relationship."
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.920]   But for me, I was like,
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.400]   "I really want to set somebody up for success A to Z.
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:57.000]   "I want you to start the book when you're single
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.440]   "and things aren't working out.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.600]   "I want to help you date, get into a relationship,
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.400]   "move in together, commit, or get married."
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.720]   And then I wanted this last chapter that was like,
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:07.880]   "Go forth and do these things."
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.840]   I would say perhaps that chapter hasn't landed
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.520]   as much as I hoped it would
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:14.280]   because so many people reading it are single
[00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:15.880]   and they're like, "I'll come back to this later."
[00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.160]   But it does matter to me
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.200]   because I think the whole idea of my concept
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:22.760]   of the happily ever after fallacy
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:23.640]   is that people think,
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:25.960]   "Oh, the hard work of love is finding someone.
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:27.720]   "And once I find someone, it's easy."
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:29.400]   And that's just clearly not true.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.200]   And so that last chapter is all about the things
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.600]   that you can do to keep your relationship going.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:39.480]   So one is this concept from Daniel Gilbert,
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:40.920]   who's a Harvard psychologist
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.400]   called the end of history illusion.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:45.400]   That's the idea that we always think
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.000]   that we're done growing.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:48.120]   So if I said to you,
[00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:51.240]   "Chris, how much have you changed in the last 10 years?"
[00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.280]   You would likely tell me, "A lot."
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.040]   And you would say, "I'm in a completely different place
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.080]   "than I thought I would be.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:58.680]   "And X, Y, Z has changed."
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:39:59.480]   And then if I said,
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:02.040]   "How much do you expect to change in the next 10 years?"
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.600]   Most likely, if you're like the average person
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.200]   who Dan Gilbert surveyed,
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:07.560]   you will say, "Oh, not that much."
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:09.240]   And so we always think we're done growing,
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.440]   but that's just not true.
[00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:13.000]   So the same thing is true in relationships.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:15.880]   We think, "I found my person and we are who we are."
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:18.200]   But if you actually think about the fact
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:19.160]   that you and your partner
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:21.320]   are constantly growing and changing,
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.720]   how can you design a relationship
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.880]   that grows and changes with you?
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.960]   And so some of the hacks there,
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.000]   one of them is a weekly ritual
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.600]   that I call the check-in ritual.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.320]   John Gottman also has something he calls
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:36.680]   the state of the union.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:39.800]   Just basically conversations
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.360]   where you and your partner check in and say,
[00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:43.960]   "How are things going?
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.120]   "How can I support you?
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:48.440]   "What do you have coming up in your life?
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.200]   "How are you feeling about our relationship?"
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.440]   And really just saving that time to
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:56.120]   stop problems before they start.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:58.200]   Because once there's a lot of resentment
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:00.760]   or built-up problems, it's hard to go back.
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:03.560]   But if you can actually deal with those problems
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.560]   before they boil over,
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:07.080]   you're in a much better position.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:08.680]   And so for people listening to your podcast
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.880]   who are into hacks,
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.320]   I would say use the power of Google Calendar, right?
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:15.320]   It sucks when you have to be the person in a relationship
[00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.520]   who's like, "Hey, we should check in.
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:17.720]   "Hey, can we talk about this?
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:19.080]   "Hey, we haven't done this in a while."
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.920]   If you can just put it as a recurring event
[00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:21.960]   in your calendar,
[00:41:21.960 --> 00:41:24.760]   neither one of you has to "hold space."
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:26.280]   The calendar does that for you.
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.240]   And so this check-in ritual is a really healthy way
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:31.720]   to stop a problem before it starts.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.280]   The other one is a relationship contract.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.480]   My husband likes to call this the relationship charter.
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:38.360]   It's really saying,
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.760]   "Let's chart a course for where we wanna go."
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.040]   And so we might say,
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:44.280]   "What are the rituals in our life that we like
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.240]   "and we wanna keep?
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:51.000]   "Who are the friends or family
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.080]   "that you want me to get to know better?
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:54.760]   "What are our financial goals?
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.200]   "What are our emotional goals?"
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:57.560]   Really, the relationship contract
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:41:59.480]   can be whatever you want it to be,
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:00.920]   but the really important thing
[00:42:00.920 --> 00:42:03.240]   is to just make sure that you and your partner
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.640]   are on the same page about where you are now
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:06.920]   and where you're headed.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.640]   And then you can check in maybe in a year,
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:10.600]   maybe in two years,
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.800]   maybe every five years.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.880]   And it's really that chance to course correct
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:15.960]   because people are living longer.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:18.120]   They're going to be in relationships
[00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:22.200]   that are decades longer than marriages of the past.
[00:42:22.200 --> 00:42:24.440]   And how can you make sure that that relationship
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.720]   can really adapt to serve your changing needs
[00:42:27.720 --> 00:42:29.240]   as you change over time?
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:31.160]   - I couldn't help but think
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:33.000]   when you were talking about this relationship charter
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.680]   that there's so many websites where they're saying,
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:37.240]   "Oh, put in your email address to download this PDF.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.160]   "I don't know if you have a template for it.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.840]   "If you do, I'll link it in the show notes.
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:43.000]   "If you don't, I would totally sign up
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.480]   "for any newsletter to download a copy of it
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:46.680]   "'cause I think it's fascinating."
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:49.800]   - Yes, I do have a relationship contract
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:51.720]   on my website that people can access.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:53.800]   There's also one in the book.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:56.040]   And in terms of downloads and things,
[00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.960]   if anyone was curious about that
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:59.560]   three dating tendencies framework,
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.160]   I have a great quiz on my website
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.760]   that will tell you what your tendency is.
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:04.120]   - Oh, that's awesome.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.800]   So that is something I think is really cool.
[00:43:05.800 --> 00:43:09.400]   - Sometimes the smallest changes
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.000]   make the biggest impact
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.240]   and Trade Coffee is a great addition
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:14.760]   to your new year routine.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:17.240]   And I am so excited to be partnering with them today.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.840]   Trade is a subscription service
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.520]   we've been using for over a year
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:23.640]   that sources the best coffee across the country
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.960]   and brings it straight to your doorstep.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:28.840]   They've built relationships with over 50 local roasters
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.440]   so you can enjoy their craft
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:32.200]   from the comfort of your own home
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:35.400]   at a fraction of the cost of going out for coffee.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:38.360]   There's multiple ways to experience coffee with Trade.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:39.640]   Sign up for a subscription
[00:43:39.640 --> 00:43:42.280]   or try one of their starter packs today.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.440]   It's been so convenient for us to have coffee
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.760]   just show up exactly when we need it.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:47.880]   And over the past year,
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:50.680]   we've gotten so many great coffees from Trade.
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.120]   But this last bag of beans
[00:43:52.120 --> 00:43:54.840]   from Drink Coffee, Do Stuff in Tahoe,
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:57.400]   it's called Bark the Moon and it's so delicious.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:59.160]   So jumpstart this year
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:01.240]   by signing up for a Trade subscription.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:03.400]   Right now, Trade is offering a free bag
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.240]   with select subscription plans
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.920]   when you visit allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.640]   That's allthehacks.com/trade
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:14.360]   for a free bag with select subscription plans.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.680]   allthehacks.com/trade.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.920]   Do you all remember episode 122
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:22.920]   when I spoke to chef David Chang
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:25.080]   about leveling up your cooking at home?
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.400]   If not, definitely go back and give it a listen.
[00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:30.920]   But one of his top hacks was using the microwave more.
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.240]   I'll admit I was a skeptic at first,
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.960]   but after getting a full set of microwave cookware
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:38.280]   from AnyDay, I'm a total convert
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.600]   and I'm excited to partner with them for this episode.
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:43.320]   AnyDay is glass cookware specifically designed
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:46.520]   to make delicious food from scratch in the microwave.
[00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:49.720]   And honestly, using it feels like a kitchen cheat code
[00:44:49.720 --> 00:44:53.320]   because it speeds up and simplifies the process so much.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:55.800]   The cookware is 100% plastic free
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.600]   and you can cook, serve, store, and reheat
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:00.200]   all in the same dish
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:03.640]   that happens to be dishwasher, freezer, and oven safe too.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:05.320]   And if you need a recipe suggestion
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:07.160]   to kick off your AnyDay adventure,
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.960]   I highly recommend David Chang's Salmon Rice.
[00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:11.240]   It is so good.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:13.240]   And if you haven't checked out
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.520]   the Matte Black Ayo Collection they launched last year,
[00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:18.200]   you have to check it out.
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.640]   So to get 15% off our new favorite cookware,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:24.920]   go to allthehacks.com/anyday.

[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:31.720]   (air whooshing)
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:33.080]   I just want to thank you, Quick,
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:35.400]   for listening to and supporting the show.

[00:45:49.640 --> 00:45:51.960]   Are there things outside of relationships
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:53.960]   and dating in your life that are,
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.520]   you know, I always say like routines or tactics that you do
[00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:58.440]   that other people are often surprised about
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:00.760]   but want to try themselves that you've used
[00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:03.320]   to help your personal or professional life?
[00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:05.080]   - Sure, yeah.
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:07.560]   I'll give one more that has to do
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.960]   with personal life and dating,
[00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:11.960]   which is this concept called OSOs
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.960]   or Other Significant Others.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.080]   So there's this really great research from Elaine Chung,
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.440]   who was at Northwestern
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:21.000]   and now actually works with me at Hinge by coincidence,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.360]   and I love her research.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.480]   And it's this idea that if you say to couples,
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.880]   "Who in your life do you go to to talk about work?
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.360]   "Who do you go to to talk about drama?
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.280]   "Who do you go to to talk about politics?"
[00:46:32.280 --> 00:46:34.920]   If people can make a list with a lot of different names,
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:38.600]   which means they have a really extensive social network,
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   those couples tend to be happier
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:42.520]   than people who have very few friends
[00:46:42.520 --> 00:46:44.440]   or only rely on each other.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:46.280]   The reason for that is that
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:49.320]   we often expect too much from our partners.
[00:46:49.320 --> 00:46:51.560]   We expect them to be everything to us.
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:53.400]   And so, Chris, in your relationship,
[00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:54.760]   I imagine there are topics
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:57.080]   that your wife's really excited to talk about
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:58.520]   and topics that when you bring up,
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:00.360]   her eyes glaze over.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.720]   What are some of those topics?
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:05.080]   - Yeah, I mean, I think I could go deep
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   on travel points and stuff.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:09.560]   And I feel like sometimes I can get her reeled in
[00:47:09.560 --> 00:47:10.600]   and be like, "Let's engage."
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:13.400]   And sometimes she's like, "Why don't you just find the hotel,
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:15.720]   "send me to, if you need me to pick between two,
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:16.520]   "that's great."
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.200]   And then sometimes I call some of my other
[00:47:18.200 --> 00:47:19.960]   kind of nerdy travel hacking friends,
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:22.680]   and I'm like, "Where should we go in Greece or something?"
[00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:25.640]   - 100%, yeah, I totally relate to that.
[00:47:25.640 --> 00:47:28.520]   I once wrote an article about this concept
[00:47:28.520 --> 00:47:30.360]   where I said my husband came home from work
[00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.360]   and I ran up to him at the door and I was like,
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:34.440]   "I moved this bank account around
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:36.120]   "and I opened up this credit card
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:38.280]   "and I saved $300."
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:39.480]   And it was this really long story.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.960]   At the end, he said, "I would have given you $300
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.560]   "to not tell me that story."
[00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:47.400]   He's very funny and he's very nice.
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.280]   But anyway, I was like,
[00:47:48.280 --> 00:47:52.040]   "Oh, my husband is not my coupon person."
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.280]   And so I called my mom and I told her that story
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.560]   and she was thrilled.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:58.200]   And so this whole concept of other significant others
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.280]   is that you should have people in your life
[00:48:00.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   who you go to for different things.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:04.520]   I go to my husband to talk about health,
[00:48:04.520 --> 00:48:06.840]   working out, eating.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:08.840]   I go to my best friend from high school
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.360]   if I wanna talk about my emotions.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.600]   I go to my sister if I wanna talk about work.
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.440]   And I have these different people in my life
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.880]   that play different roles.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.960]   It takes the pressure off your relationship.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:19.960]   Your partner doesn't have to talk to you
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:21.960]   about travel points or coupons.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.400]   You have someone else in your life.
[00:48:23.400 --> 00:48:24.440]   And it might sound simple,
[00:48:24.440 --> 00:48:27.640]   but it really allows your partner
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:29.800]   to serve the roles that they wanna serve
[00:48:29.800 --> 00:48:31.720]   and not be forced into roles
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:33.880]   that really are not a good fit for them.
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.400]   And so in my personal life,
[00:48:35.400 --> 00:48:38.200]   I do have a big network of friends and community.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:41.080]   But last year, during the pandemic,
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:42.200]   my husband and I went through
[00:48:42.200 --> 00:48:44.760]   this really horrific situation
[00:48:44.760 --> 00:48:46.920]   where he's super healthy, he's a vegan.
[00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:49.000]   And all of a sudden, out of nowhere,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.280]   he was diagnosed with this rare form of bone cancer.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:54.360]   And it was the beginning of the pandemic,
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   just completely surprising, right?
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.880]   It felt like the world was falling apart.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:48:59.720]   Our world was falling apart.
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.640]   And so I was good at asking for help
[00:49:01.640 --> 00:49:04.040]   from different friends, but people couldn't travel.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.640]   People couldn't visit us indoors.
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.680]   It was very isolating, alienating time.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:11.000]   And so Chris, our mutual friend, Kristen,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.760]   runs this communal living house called Radish.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:17.720]   And so my husband and I happened to go there for dinner
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.880]   during the pandemic.
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:21.080]   And we were like, "Wow, these people
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:22.840]   are doing the pandemic correctly."
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.000]   They are 14 people living together.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.480]   They have dinner together every night.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.560]   They are just really supporting each other.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:31.560]   They were in one quarantine pod.
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:35.480]   And so we ended up moving into an apartment within Radish
[00:49:35.480 --> 00:49:39.640]   and basically creating this really tight-knit group
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:42.280]   of OSOs, other significant others,
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:43.640]   to get us through the pandemic,
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:45.720]   to get us through his cancer treatment.
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:47.080]   Really, they were incredible.
[00:49:47.640 --> 00:49:51.560]   And we even have our WhatsApp group is called OSOs.
[00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:53.560]   And so I feel like for anyone listening,
[00:49:53.560 --> 00:49:55.800]   whether you're going through a tragedy or not,
[00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:58.840]   just investing in those relationships in your life
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.920]   to take pressure off your partnership
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:04.440]   and to invest in friendships and community and colleagues,
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.000]   that's really one of the secrets to a great relationship
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.640]   because then it's kind of like a release valve
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.920]   that just allows the relationship to be what it can be
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:14.360]   and doesn't put too much pressure on it.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.560]   - Wow.
[00:50:15.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   Well, first off, I'm sorry to hear about your husband.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:18.840]   - Oh, thank you. - I hope he's doing okay.
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:23.720]   One other kind of hack that I heard you talk about in the past,
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:26.360]   which I'd love to kind of explain a little bit about,
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:28.200]   is how you ended up writing the book
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:31.880]   and forcing yourself to make progress on something that,
[00:50:31.880 --> 00:50:34.120]   you know, I'm definitely a procrastinator
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.280]   and you found a way to do that
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.640]   that I think is a little bit unique.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:40.040]   - Sure, yeah, I would love to talk about that.
[00:50:40.040 --> 00:50:43.080]   So I love the framework from Gretchen Rubin
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:44.600]   called the four tendencies.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:46.920]   And that was some of the inspiration for my thing
[00:50:46.920 --> 00:50:48.280]   in the dating tendencies.
[00:50:48.280 --> 00:50:50.840]   And so I'm an obliger,
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:53.240]   which means that it's easy for me to hold,
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:56.680]   it's easy for me to show up for other people,
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:59.000]   but it's less easy for me to show up to myself.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.480]   So you and I have this appointment to do a podcast.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.680]   Of course, I was going to be here.
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:03.800]   I wouldn't have missed it.
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   But if I put on my calendar later,
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.320]   do Peloton at 3.30,
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:08.520]   there's a high percentage chance
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:10.440]   that I will not show up for myself.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.560]   So knowing that, I said,
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:14.760]   how can I tap into my obliger tendency
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:16.360]   to get this book written?
[00:51:16.360 --> 00:51:20.600]   And so what I did is I asked a number of people,
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:23.000]   can you host book dinners for me?
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.680]   I'm going to give you a certain amount of money
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:25.800]   towards food.
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:27.240]   You get to invite the people.
[00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:28.840]   And what's going to happen is
[00:51:28.840 --> 00:51:31.480]   I'm going to send two chapters of my book
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:33.560]   a few days before the dinner.
[00:51:33.560 --> 00:51:36.040]   Then everyone will read the chapters in advance,
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:38.200]   come to the dinner and discuss them.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:41.480]   And so the feedback at those dinners was priceless.
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.200]   I got a lot of great ideas, great terms.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.680]   I understood where I was being offensive
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.880]   or not inclusive,
[00:51:47.880 --> 00:51:50.040]   or I thought a joke was funny and it wasn't.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:52.040]   But perhaps most important
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.360]   was that I wasn't going to let these people down.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.280]   If people were throwing me a dinner party
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.080]   and come Thursday night to coming to this dinner,
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:02.680]   I was 100% going to send them those chapters.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.480]   And so I basically tapped into this obliger tendency.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.160]   And I said, I might not show up for myself,
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.920]   but I'll show up for other people.
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:10.680]   I had a bunch of these dinners
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:14.520]   and that was really how I was able to get my book done,
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.920]   stick to a schedule and not procrastinate.
[00:52:16.920 --> 00:52:19.080]   And I think it's really because of that hack
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:21.400]   that I didn't just have a mental breakdown
[00:52:21.400 --> 00:52:24.120]   and write my book four weeks before it was due.
[00:52:24.120 --> 00:52:26.920]   And in fact, I handed my book in on time,
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:29.320]   which based on the feedback from my editor,
[00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:30.840]   I think is actually pretty rare.
[00:52:30.840 --> 00:52:31.720]   But I was like, no,
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   that deadline is there for a reason.
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:35.640]   Once you let the deadline pass,
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.920]   maybe you'll never hand it in.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.320]   And it was super important to me to hit that deadline.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:41.080]   - Wow, yeah.
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.160]   I only recently have ever even thought about a book
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:46.200]   because someone brought it up.
[00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:47.560]   They were like, "Oh, I love the podcast.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.920]   Are you ever going to write the book?"
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.800]   I'm curious as someone who maybe similarly,
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:53.400]   I'm not sure if you had aspirations to write a book,
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.000]   but you've gone through this process.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:56.840]   Does that make you tell people,
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.560]   "Yeah, you should."
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:59.400]   Or is that like, "Man, that was a process.
[00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:00.240]   I don't recommend it."
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.040]   - It definitely was a life goal of mine.
[00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:05.880]   My big life goals for the last 10 years
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.920]   were give a TED Talk,
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:10.840]   get published in Modern Love in the New York Times,
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.320]   and write a book that my parents would read.
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:15.080]   And I've been really focused on those goals.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:16.600]   And I, now with the book coming out,
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:17.880]   have achieved all three of them.
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:18.680]   And that's felt great.
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:19.960]   And I do think it's a good lesson
[00:53:19.960 --> 00:53:21.080]   that just having goals,
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.440]   whether or not you hit them exactly,
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:24.600]   definitely helps you prioritize your time,
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:26.920]   take big risks, believe in yourself, things like that.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:30.200]   Writing a book is so hard.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:32.840]   You're solo, you're sitting alone at a WeWork,
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.240]   you're editing the same sentence for the 10th time,
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:37.480]   you're sick of being by yourself,
[00:53:37.480 --> 00:53:39.640]   you're sick of staring at the screen,
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.320]   writing a book's really hard.
[00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:42.840]   And so when people call me saying,
[00:53:42.840 --> 00:53:43.720]   "Should I write a book?"
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:44.600]   I usually say,
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:48.840]   "Only write a book if you can't imagine not writing it,
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:52.280]   because otherwise there's just a lot of other media
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:53.320]   that you could explore."
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:54.680]   So with a podcast,
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:53:56.200]   it's like you and I are recording this now,
[00:53:56.200 --> 00:53:57.640]   I'm sure it'll come out pretty soon,
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:53:59.400]   and then you're gonna get feedback on it.
[00:53:59.400 --> 00:54:01.640]   With a book, you might work on it for three years,
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.160]   not get any feedback,
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:04.280]   and then it comes out.
[00:54:04.280 --> 00:54:07.080]   And so I think there's a lot of things that are,
[00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:08.520]   there are a lot of easier ways
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.600]   to express your ideas than a book.
[00:54:10.600 --> 00:54:12.920]   And so you should really only write one
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:15.000]   if you can't imagine not writing one.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:16.760]   - I like that framework.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.040]   So you hit your three goals,
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:19.320]   what are the next big three goals?
[00:54:19.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   - I have to think about that.
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.160]   Yeah, I think, so what, where are we?
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.360]   We're in November right now.
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:30.520]   Yeah, I really need to assess for my 2022 goals,
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   but I imagine that there'll be personal things
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:35.240]   around achieving work-life balance.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:37.320]   I also started a course on Maven.
[00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.520]   Are you familiar with Maven?
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:41.480]   Yeah, so I'm launching my first course next week
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:43.880]   in terms of teaching people more at scale,
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:45.720]   like moving from one-on-one coaching
[00:54:45.720 --> 00:54:48.120]   to cohort-based courses.
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.520]   I have a great person working with me on that.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.520]   Yeah, I love the question
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:54.040]   and I have to think about like,
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:55.320]   what are my next big goals?
[00:54:55.320 --> 00:54:57.720]   I think probably things around like having a TV show
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:54:59.880]   or having a podcast, things like that.
[00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:02.600]   But right now I'm just really having fun
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   seeing the impact of my book
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.000]   and getting these great emails about people who said,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.640]   in the past, I would have rejected this person
[00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:12.360]   because of his job or because of his height.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:15.640]   And now I'm in the happiest relationship I've ever been in.
[00:55:15.640 --> 00:55:17.800]   And so for now, I feel like I'm actually just really
[00:55:17.800 --> 00:55:20.600]   absorbing the impact of the book and that's been fun.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:23.800]   - Yeah, I mean, I get emails a lot.
[00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:24.760]   It sounds like you do too.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.400]   It's really rewarding, I think, to create content
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.080]   and know that people are listening
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:30.600]   and people are enjoying it
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:31.960]   and it's having an impact on their life.
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.600]   So keep it coming, I love it.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.640]   We didn't talk about this at all.
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:36.680]   I know you work at Hinge,
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.200]   but what do you think of dating apps
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:39.480]   and how they've affected all of this?
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.440]   - Yeah, so I'm a huge fan of Hinge
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:44.520]   and I was before I worked there.
[00:55:44.520 --> 00:55:46.440]   How I ended up working there was
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:49.720]   I interviewed Justin McLeod, the CEO of Hinge,
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:51.240]   while I was writing my book.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.560]   And I walked in very skeptically sort of saying,
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:56.680]   your tagline is designed to be deleted.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:57.960]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.880]   I've worked in tech for a decade.
[00:55:59.880 --> 00:56:02.520]   Why would you want to have your user base leave
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:04.360]   when you have to get a bunch of new users?
[00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:05.480]   And his whole thing was,
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.960]   ever since we adopted that tagline
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.560]   and really adopted that ethos,
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:12.360]   we've grown exponentially.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:14.280]   And that's because it's much more powerful
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:15.880]   if your friend through word of mouth says,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:17.800]   "Oh, I met someone on Hinge."
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:20.280]   It's a great place for people looking for relationships
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.640]   than just sort of gamifying it or doing whatever else.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:27.320]   And so I feel like Hinge does a really good job
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:28.920]   at slowing people down.
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:34.040]   You have to comment on a photo or a written response.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:37.480]   You can only send a certain number of likes per day.
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:39.640]   And so Hinge is really where people go
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:41.240]   when they're looking for a relationship.
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:44.120]   I think it's been fascinating to observe
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:47.560]   how dating has changed as people have more options.
[00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:48.520]   So there's certain groups
[00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.440]   that are really benefiting from it.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.080]   So there's groups called thin markets,
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:56.440]   people over 50, the LGBTQ+ community,
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.360]   they really benefit from dating apps
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:57:00.520]   because previously it might've been very hard
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.320]   to identify singles in your area
[00:57:03.320 --> 00:57:05.000]   who are in that demographic.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.040]   And with the dating app,
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:07.480]   it makes it really easy to do that.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.240]   - Yeah, an interesting question I have about dating apps.
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.720]   So I moved to Burlingame,
[00:57:13.720 --> 00:57:15.560]   which is South of San Francisco.
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:17.720]   And we have a 15 month old
[00:57:17.720 --> 00:57:19.080]   and we're living in the suburbs.
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:22.280]   And a lot of our friends kind of moved farther away
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:24.120]   or places that aren't that convenient.
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:26.200]   And I realized that some of our closest friends now
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:27.880]   are people that we've met in the neighborhood
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:30.360]   and that I don't have a lot of like close,
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:32.440]   I guess, OSOs in person.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:36.440]   And so I was like, "Gosh, will there ever be an app
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:39.720]   that is commonplace for people to meet just people?"
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.000]   And I thought it was so funny
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.600]   because my quest on this led me to Bumble,
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:46.280]   which has a BFF feature,
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.160]   which I could never bring myself to actually use,
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:52.120]   but it was something that in my mind seemed like,
[00:57:52.120 --> 00:57:54.200]   "Well, if I wanna meet someone,
[00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.640]   I could go randomly find them,
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:57.000]   but I can't 'cause it's COVID."
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:00.360]   Like what's the right way to apply everything about dating
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:01.960]   to meeting interesting people
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.440]   that could become close friends of yours
[00:58:04.440 --> 00:58:06.760]   when we're no longer working in person
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:09.000]   and there's less social events happening.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:10.440]   Maybe that comes back sooner,
[00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:12.440]   but it's something I've been thinking about a lot
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.560]   and didn't know if you had thoughts.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:17.560]   - One of my close friends, his name is Smiley Paswalski,
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:18.520]   and he wrote a book called
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.280]   "Friendship in the Age of Loneliness."
[00:58:20.280 --> 00:58:23.880]   And his book is all about how do you meet friends
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:25.880]   in your late 20s and 30s and beyond?
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:27.720]   And I think it's just such an interesting premise.
[00:58:27.720 --> 00:58:29.800]   It's basically saying like when you're in high school,
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:30.680]   when you're in college,
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:33.240]   there's all these people in the same stage of life as you,
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.440]   everyone's looking to connect,
[00:58:34.440 --> 00:58:37.160]   but at a certain point it becomes really hard.
[00:58:37.160 --> 00:58:38.680]   And so you might be surprised
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:40.680]   by the number of emails that I get saying,
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:43.320]   "I'd love to have OSOs, but I don't have any friends,"
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:44.760]   or "I'd love to date one of my friends,
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.440]   but first I'd have to make a friend."
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:48.200]   And so honestly, I think we are living
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:49.880]   in this loneliness pandemic.
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:54.440]   And one of the best ways to find a romantic relationship
[00:58:54.440 --> 00:58:57.320]   is to really expand your friendship community
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.160]   because the more people you know,
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:00.920]   the more people they know.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:02.600]   And so I just kind of want to validate
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:04.040]   and acknowledge that in general,
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.600]   when people move to the suburbs or move to a new city,
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:08.520]   it can be really hard to meet friends
[00:59:08.520 --> 00:59:11.640]   and that there are some societally accepted ways
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:17.000]   to meet potential mates like using Hinge,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:20.200]   but there isn't necessarily such an easy way
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:21.640]   to meet friends.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.840]   And yeah, I think that's a problem
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:23.720]   that people could solve.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.440]   - Yeah.
[00:59:24.440 --> 00:59:26.920]   This has been so fascinating.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:28.360]   Thank you so much for joining.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.040]   Where should people find you online
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.640]   and what are you working on right now
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:32.520]   that they can check out?
[00:59:32.520 --> 00:59:34.040]   - Thanks, Chris.
[00:59:34.040 --> 00:59:37.000]   Yes, so people can find me @loganyuri
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:38.360]   on Twitter and Instagram.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.760]   They can go to my website, loganyuri.com.
[00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.240]   I really encourage people to take
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:45.320]   that three tendencies quiz to find out
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.400]   what's holding them back from finding love.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:49.480]   And if people are interested in working with me,
[00:59:49.480 --> 00:59:52.760]   they can email me about my cohort-based course
[00:59:52.760 --> 00:59:54.120]   or about one-on-one coaching.
[00:59:54.120 --> 00:59:55.560]   - Awesome.
[00:59:55.560 --> 00:59:56.920]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:59:56.920 --> 00:59:57.960]   - Thank you.
[00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:58.720]   It was so fun.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:02.200]   - What a fun conversation.
[01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.280]   Thank you so much for listening.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:06.040]   I know many of you aren't currently dating,
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:08.200]   but I hope this was as interesting for you
[01:00:08.200 --> 01:00:09.480]   as it was for me.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.720]   I am so curious about so many things
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.480]   and I always find it fascinating
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.840]   to dive deep into an area I know very little about.
[01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.600]   If there are any other topics or areas
[01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:20.840]   you think would be fun to dive into on the show,
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:22.520]   please send them my way.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:24.520]   I'm Chris@allthehacks.com.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.280]   New issue of the newsletter,
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.440]   all about holiday gifting and all the deals
[01:00:28.440 --> 01:00:30.040]   you can get shopping in person
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.800]   and online is coming tomorrow.
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:34.360]   It also has a few fun, small gifts
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:36.840]   I'm really excited to be giving people this year.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.520]   If you're not already subscribed,
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.680]   you can read it online or sign up
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.240]   at allthehacks.com/email.
[01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:45.240]   That's it for this week.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.280]   See you all next week.
[01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:49.260]   (upbeat music)
[01:00:49.260 --> 01:01:01.320]   I wanna tell you about another podcast I love
[01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:03.640]   that goes deep on all things money.
[01:01:03.640 --> 01:01:05.320]   That means everything from money hacks
[01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:07.480]   to wealth building to early retirement.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:09.720]   It's called the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:12.600]   and it's much more about building generational wealth
[01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.760]   and spending your money on the things you value
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:17.640]   than it is about clipping coupons to save a dollar.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.640]   It's hosted by my good friend, Andrew,
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.800]   who truly believes that everyone in this world
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.520]   can build wealth and his passion and excitement
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:27.000]   are what make this show so entertaining.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   I know because I was a guest on the show
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.840]   in December, 2022, but recently I listened to an episode
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:35.080]   where Andrew shared 16 money stats
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.440]   that will blow your mind.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:39.400]   And it was so crazy to learn things like 35%
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.240]   of millennials are not participating
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.080]   in their employer's retirement plan.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:46.760]   And that's just one of the many fascinating stats he shared.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:49.480]   The Personal Finance Podcast has something for everyone.
[01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.120]   It's filled with so many tips and tactics and hacks
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:55.000]   to help you get better with your money and grow your wealth.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.080]   So I highly recommend you check it out.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:01:59.400]   Just search for the Personal Finance Podcast
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:01.080]   on Apple Podcasts, Spotify,
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:03.720]   or wherever you listen to podcasts and enjoy.
