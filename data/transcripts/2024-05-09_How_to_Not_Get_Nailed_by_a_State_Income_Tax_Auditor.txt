[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840]   Say goodbye to your credit card rewards.
[00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.300]   Greedy corporate megastores, led by Walmart and Target,
[00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.940]   are pushing for law in Congress to take away your hard-earned cash back and travel points to line their pockets.
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.480]   The Durbin-Marshall Credit Card Bill would enact harmful credit card routing mandates
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.240]   that would end credit card rewards as we know it.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:25.700]   If you love your credit card rewards, tell your lawmakers, "Hands off my rewards."
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.080]   Tell them to oppose the Durbin-Marshall Credit Card Bill.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.280]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, headline of today's articles from Bloomberg.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.280]   New York's rich get creative to flee state taxes. Auditors are on to them.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.980]   At New Jersey's Teterboro and Long Island's Islip airports,
[00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:51.680]   dozens of private jets destined for Florida take off at times such as 11.42 p.m. or 11.54 p.m.
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.180]   Over at JFK, a regular flight from San Juan, Puerto Rico, arrives at a seemingly purposeful time,
[00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.280]   about 15 minutes after midnight.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.580]   Meanwhile, tax attorneys tell stories of clients idling in their luxury SUVs
[00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.680]   near the New Jersey entrance to the George Washington Bridge shortly before 12 a.m.,
[00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.680]   waiting for the clock to turn before crossing the state line to New York.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.180]   When it comes to taxes and the wealthy, every minute matters,
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.680]   especially for those who have left New York and declared residency elsewhere.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.280]   At a time more high earners are departing, or at least are claiming to,
[00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:31.380]   state officials are stepping up already intense scrutiny to make sure former residents have actually moved.
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:36.180]   It's a complex operation that involves cutting-edge artificial intelligence
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.880]   and tracking everything from travel to the location of people's pets.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.880]   We'll continue in a moment, but the basic outline of this article is something that you need to be aware of
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.980]   if you are wealthy and you are trying to manage your tax costs properly.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:56.780]   One of the most important concepts in tax planning is to pay the taxes that you owe,
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.780]   but not to inadvertently create a tax obligation through short-sighted behavior.
[00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:11.580]   And one such behavior is spending a significant amount of time in a high-tax jurisdiction in an unplanned manner.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.280]   Now, we'll talk here in just a moment more about the timing,
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:21.980]   but one of the most important features that causes a state taxing agency to think that they can tax you
[00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:29.380]   is whether or not you spend significant amounts of time in the territory of that government taxing agency.
[00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.080]   Historically, the number has been something like 183 days.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:38.480]   The idea was that if you spent more than 183 days inside of a certain jurisdiction,
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.580]   then you would automatically be considered a tax resident of that jurisdiction,
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:47.680]   and the government there would believe that they were entitled to take a share of your income.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.880]   Now, internationally and globally, that has become much more complicated.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.880]   It's somewhat uncommon in today's world to find countries that have just a simple 183-day test,
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.880]   although they do still exist.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.580]   But this does exist in many places in the United States,
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.880]   and so for Americans, being aware of where you spend time is a very important component
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:14.180]   in order to minimize your tax liability,
[00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:21.280]   especially if you are moving from a high-tax jurisdiction to a lower-tax jurisdiction.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.680]   Let's continue with the article.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:28.380]   For the ultra-rich, even just an extra day in the wrong place could mean millions in income tax liability.
[00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:32.280]   Quote, "The minute you file a partial return, you're going to hear from New York State,"
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.280]   said Jonathan Mariner, who created TaxDay,
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.080]   an app that tracks users' locations so they don't overstay the threshold of days that would trigger residency status,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.280]   which is typically 184.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.880]   The whereabouts of the wealthy are particularly important to New York,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:56.680]   a high-tax area where the loss of even a handful of rich residents can have an outsized effect on budget revenue.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:02.580]   The state has been especially hard hit by departures since COVID-19 fueled the rise of remote work.
[00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:09.380]   The number of taxpayers earning more than $1 million who moved out more than doubled in 2020 from 2019
[00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.780]   and has continued each year to be well above pre-pandemic levels,
[00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.780]   according to the Department of Taxation and Finance.
[00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.080]   That's leading state officials to try to claw back money wherever possible through residency audits,
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.480]   an investigation into whether someone correctly identified themselves as a full-time,
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:32.580]   part-time or non-resident for income tax purposes.
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:39.680]   It's also taking place in California, another relatively high-tax, high-departure state facing budget strains,
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:47.680]   where the number of residency audits closed in the first 11 months of 2023 more than doubled from before the pandemic.
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.180]   There are two states in the United States that are notoriously aggressive with regard to income tax collection,
[00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.580]   and these states are New York State and California.
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:07.380]   Now, there are other states that also have notoriously high income tax rates and that are also aggressive,
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.780]   but these two states are especially aggressive.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.380]   And so if you are a resident of one of these states, or if you have been a resident of one of these states,
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.480]   you need to pay careful attention to make certain that when you leave, you leave properly.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:28.480]   And that's what I'm going to teach you about in today's podcast. Continuing with the article.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:33.280]   For some of these people, often accustomed to the privacy and ease afforded by wealth,
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.480]   a residency audit can be an uncomfortable dive into their daily life.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.380]   New York's auditors closely watch travel and apply a standard known as the "teddy bear test,"
[00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:51.280]   looking to see where individuals keep their most cherished possessions to determine whether a home is their primary residence.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:57.080]   "We always tell people the tax audit from New York is like the tax version of a colonoscopy,"
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:00.280]   said Mark Klein, a tax attorney at Hodgson-Russ.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.080]   "I've had cases that have hinged on a single dog," Klein said,
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.980]   "and I had a case once that was based on the fact that the person moved their Peloton bicycle to Florida."
[00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.280]   There was a famous test a number of years ago with a New Yorker who moved to Texas.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:24.180]   And the taxpayer in question alleged that, "Hey, listen, I fully live in the state of Texas.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:29.080]   I have all this stuff set up there. I just happen to spend a significant amount of time in New York."
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.880]   And that's what he's alluding to as far as where was the dog.
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.080]   That was ultimately the final clinching factor that came in to decide
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.880]   whether or not he had actually moved out of the state of New York or not.
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.180]   And in a little bit, I'm going to teach you how to go ahead and make certain that you don't wind up in a situation
[00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:52.680]   where it comes down to a specific dog's location, though, because that's not safe for you.
[00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:53.680]   Let's finish off the article, though.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.580]   Counting days. Residency audits have long been big business in New York.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.080]   The state collected roughly $1 billion from 15,000 audits between 2013 and 2017,
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.280]   according to data obtained through a Freedom of Information request.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:12.780]   While California lags behind New York in the scale and complexity of its residency audit operation,
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:19.080]   the Golden State collected $85 million in residency audit income last year through November,
[00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.980]   the largest single-year tally in at least a decade.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.080]   Both states are still recording overall growth in the number of millionaires thanks to income and stock market gains,
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.780]   but the key for tax officials is making sure they've genuinely left.
[00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:35.880]   Since the pandemic, higher-income people moved out at a faster pace than they moved in.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.280]   Data from both states show.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:42.080]   While wealthy residents have long pretended to leave to dodge taxes,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   tax experts say COVID brought more legitimate moves as companies embraced flexible work
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:53.380]   and set up outposts in places such as Florida and Texas, which have no state individual income tax.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.980]   New York's tax laws are notoriously tricky.
[00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:59.880]   Typically, someone who lives there will be considered a resident for tax purposes,
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.380]   paying levies on their income from all sources, even those outside of the state.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.380]   But the state considers someone a resident even if they don't live there,
[00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.580]   as long as they've spent more than 183 days in New York
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:15.480]   and maintain a permanent place of abode, which could simply be a vacation home.
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:18.980]   A few hours spent in New York qualifies as a whole day.
[00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:23.480]   Getting off the highway in New York for lunch while driving from New Jersey to Connecticut can count.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.680]   So can getting outpatient treatment at a New York hospital.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.980]   When you can't prove where you were on a given day, New York auditors may assume you were in the state.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:35.980]   Quote, even though you have a Florida driver's license, Florida voting record,
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.780]   Florida home, it does not matter, said Mariner,
[00:08:38.780 --> 00:08:43.380]   who created his app after facing his own residency audit after moving to the Sunshine State.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:47.580]   You could be on vacation in New York and they'll pull you back in.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:53.080]   New York's Department of Taxation and Finance has 300 auditors dedicated to conducting residency audits
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:56.280]   and they are notorious for their thoroughness.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   Bank records, phone bills, and family photos are under the microscope.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.080]   Auditors are backed up by sophisticated artificial intelligence-fueled tax monitoring systems
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.980]   that flag inconsistencies in return.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:16.880]   The point of the article, you can read it if you like, is that auditors are looking for money.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.080]   Many, many states in the United States, especially high-tax states,
[00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:26.880]   are finding that in our current era of significant geographic flexibility,
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.380]   it's harder for them to keep people in a high-tax jurisdiction.
[00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:37.080]   Now, that may not be the case across all income classes.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:41.380]   So it's not that common that you might have somebody earning $80,000 a year who says,
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.380]   "You know what? I'm just going to go ahead and move to a different state."
[00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.180]   But for the very rich, it is more common.
[00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:51.680]   Given the changes that have happened in the last couple of decades with connectivity,
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.780]   meaning the ability to reach out and talk to anybody, anywhere, at any time, anywhere in the globe,
[00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:59.680]   given the improvements in transportation infrastructure,
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:04.180]   the fact that flying around the United States and really around the world these days
[00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.980]   is pretty fast, pretty simple, pretty inexpensive,
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:12.880]   it's just relatively easy for people to do business in more places.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.880]   It's not uncommon if you're living in Florida, you can fly up to New York,
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.880]   spend half the day there, have meetings, have lunch, whatever you need to do,
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.580]   and you can be back home in your own bed at dinnertime.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.980]   The flights going back and forth between South Florida and the Northeast are legion.
[00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.680]   There are many, many, many of them available.
[00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:34.080]   And so people are taking advantage of this and availing themselves of it.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:38.180]   And one component of that is lowering their income tax rates.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:41.380]   Now, the places, the times in which this really affects you is,
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:45.080]   especially if you have some kind of property that you would like to sell,
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.280]   something like the sale of a business, something like the sale of stock,
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:56.380]   because whereas it can be difficult to move to another state just to shelter income taxes,
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:00.780]   if your income tax, if your business operations are in another state,
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:04.680]   in the high-tax state, what can be more challenging,
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:10.180]   excuse me, what can be simpler is when you are moving prior to the sale of a business,
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:12.180]   prior to the sale of a stock, things like that.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:13.880]   And this is very, very common.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:19.480]   Even just down to a simple 401(k), you may work in a high-tax state, a high-income state.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.180]   You may contribute to your 401(k).
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:26.480]   Your 401(k) contributions can bypass the state income taxes
[00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.680]   because they're pre-tax contributions.
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.780]   Then in retirement, you may move to a no-income tax state.
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:34.180]   And in that no-income tax state,
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:37.580]   you have the ability to now put yourself in a situation
[00:11:37.580 --> 00:11:40.880]   where you don't ever pay income tax on that money.
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.180]   And that can be helpful.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:44.580]   It can be, in many cases, several percent of your income,
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.780]   which can be substantial over time.
[00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:50.780]   So let me give you some suggestions and tips as to how to arrange your affairs
[00:11:50.780 --> 00:11:54.380]   so that you don't face a significant risk of audit.
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:59.680]   First and foremost, I don't think it makes sense to do any move in your life
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:05.080]   exclusively for or even primarily for tax planning.
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.980]   I really don't.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:08.780]   I don't think that you should move from New York to Florida
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:12.380]   exclusively or primarily for tax planning.
[00:12:12.380 --> 00:12:15.380]   I think the people who do anything primarily for tax planning
[00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:20.380]   are being short-sighted in their long-term outlook and in their long-term plans.
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:24.280]   After all, taxes, what we're talking about here with income taxes,
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.880]   taxes exclusively affect those people who are earning high income.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:32.880]   The fact that you're earning high income means that you have more choices.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:34.480]   You have more freedom.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.980]   The entire reason you earn high income or the entire reason you build wealth
[00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:42.480]   is so that you have choice, so that you have freedom.
[00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:47.580]   And it doesn't make any long-term sense for you to now abandon your freedom
[00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:51.080]   and allow an external government taxing authority to be the one
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:54.880]   who primarily or exclusively controls your decisions.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:57.380]   What's the point of getting rich if you can't live where you want to live
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.880]   and live how you want to live?
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.680]   What's the point of being wealthy and earning high income
[00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.080]   if you're looking over your shoulder trying to dodge the taxman all the time?
[00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:06.980]   It's a silly way to live.
[00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:09.780]   It doesn't lead to freedom and happiness.
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.280]   It's a very high-risk game and it's just flat-out not worth it.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:14.380]   Pay your taxes.
[00:13:14.380 --> 00:13:18.780]   It's an extortion fee that the government requires in order for you to stay out of jail.
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.380]   So if you want to stay out of jail, you have two choices.
[00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.980]   Either option A, pay your taxes or genuinely leave
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:27.980]   and don't play any games with the taxing authorities.
[00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:30.280]   I've already now showed my hand on the second point.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   First point is don't make taxes your primary or exclusive choices.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.880]   They are perfectly reasonable as a secondary criteria.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:43.680]   So if you really want to move where it's warmer and sunny
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.180]   and where your friends live in Florida or Texas
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:49.580]   and you want to move out of New York, then great, go for it.
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:55.580]   And if you want to enjoy the fact that you have lower tax bills as one piece of the puzzle,
[00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.080]   that's a wonderful extra reason to help.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.280]   And it may be the thing that pushes you over,
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.480]   but it shouldn't be a primary reason
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.280]   or there's a very good chance you'll be back in California within a few years.
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.180]   You'll be back in New York in a few years.
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:10.080]   You'll probably be priced out of the market.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:13.680]   You can't buy back in. You'll have lost relationships.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:18.280]   Just stay in the place that you want to be and keep taxes as secondary consideration.
[00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.580]   Now, if you do move or if you do want to change your tax situation,
[00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:28.880]   the secret to all of this is genuinely change your tax situation.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:30.880]   Don't play games with the taxing authority.
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:35.380]   If you're going to move from New York to another state, to Florida,
[00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.480]   then move from New York to Florida.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   And make sure that when you're moving from New York to Florida,
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:47.180]   your lifestyle is going to allow you to genuinely live in New York.
[00:14:47.180 --> 00:14:51.880]   Excuse me, I apologize. My brain is at half capacity this morning.
[00:14:51.880 --> 00:14:53.780]   It's going to genuinely allow you to live in Florida.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:58.980]   So if you think you have to be in New York possibly 180 days this year,
[00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:02.480]   that's probably a good sign that you should stay in New York as a tax resident.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:06.380]   But if you can genuinely move to Florida, just genuinely move to Florida.
[00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:11.880]   If you read the law and consult with relevant authorities to make certain
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:19.480]   that you understand how the state that you're dealing with assesses tax residency,
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:23.680]   and if you can satisfy those conditions, then just go and satisfy the conditions fully.
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:26.480]   Don't play games with them. Genuinely move.
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:31.280]   That will solve basically everything that you need solved.
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:37.680]   The most important thing is making sure that you're not a tax resident of a place
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.080]   that you don't want to be. Even in an international context,
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:44.680]   I teach this, especially for Americans. So Americans traveling abroad,
[00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:47.180]   Americans are always tax residents in the United States
[00:15:47.180 --> 00:15:49.680]   because we have citizenship-based taxation.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.880]   So there's not really any question about that.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:57.580]   It's one of the benefits of being an American is we have citizenship-based taxation.
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:00.680]   So either you're a citizen or you're not. And if you're a citizen,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.480]   you pay tax no matter where in the world you are,
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.680]   according to the relevant exclusions and things like that.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:10.080]   But if you're not, you're not. Now, the key is, however,
[00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:14.680]   don't become a tax resident of a place that you don't want to become tax resident.
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.380]   So when I covered the pop singer's issues with the state of Spain
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:22.880]   when she's just hanging out in Spain and a massive multi-million dollar settlement,
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:26.680]   the problem is that she allowed herself to become a tax resident of a place
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:29.780]   he shouldn't have been a tax resident of. And this is your choice.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.980]   You don't have to do this. You can control your activities.
[00:16:33.980 --> 00:16:36.280]   So make sure that you just control your activities
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:39.780]   and make sure that you're genuinely not a tax resident of the place
[00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:44.480]   that you previously were. Here's where the biggest danger is.
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:48.180]   There's very little danger of someone like me who's never lived in New York,
[00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:52.480]   spent very little time there, of me going there and spending a few months there
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.480]   and then having any kind of trouble. After all,
[00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:57.580]   my footprint in New York is relatively light.
[00:16:57.580 --> 00:17:00.780]   And while the state tax auditors can access mobile phone records
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:02.580]   and bank records and things like that,
[00:17:02.580 --> 00:17:06.480]   I would have to do something that would bring me to their attention.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.780]   But if I had lived in New York for a good number of years
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.080]   and then I was strategically moving out of New York
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.380]   with the goal of changing my tax residency
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.380]   so that two years from now I can sell my business
[00:17:17.380 --> 00:17:21.880]   or sell some assets and avoid the issues,
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.780]   now it's a much bigger deal because now I'm on their radar screen
[00:17:25.780 --> 00:17:28.980]   and they have a reason to want to keep me there.
[00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.680]   And I find this frequently with consulting clients that I work with,
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.380]   California and New York.
[00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.980]   If you are leaving one of those states and moving elsewhere,
[00:17:35.980 --> 00:17:41.280]   you need to genuinely leave and every fact matters.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:44.480]   So here is what you want to pay attention to.
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.280]   If you are going to go up against an auditor,
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:51.480]   the first thing is you want to make sure that all of the facts are on your side.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.080]   So if they say don't spend more than 183 days in the state of New York,
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:59.680]   you better make sure first and foremost that you are not in New York
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.680]   for more than 183 days and be smarter for you if it were significantly less.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:07.280]   But the person who's going to win in court
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:11.080]   is going to come down to who can put the most paperwork down
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:14.980]   proving that I'm not a tax resident.
[00:18:14.980 --> 00:18:17.980]   And you're going to be going up against the other side
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:20.780]   that's going to be trying to put paperwork down
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.880]   demonstrating that you're a tax resident.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:25.280]   So what you want to do when you leave a place,
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:28.680]   especially if a place like California or New York,
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.180]   is that you want to genuinely demonstrate
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.280]   full and complete intent to move elsewhere
[00:18:37.280 --> 00:18:40.480]   and you want to create a long string of paperwork
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:44.780]   that you could use to demonstrate your involvement in a new place.
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:45.780]   What does that mean?
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.980]   Well, the first thing is obviously you want to make certain that you have a home.
[00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.780]   So you want to go from California or from New York to a home in another place.
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.280]   Where I often hear this is people who go RVing,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:02.180]   somebody who's doing well, wealthy, living in California,
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.180]   says, "Okay, I want to move into an RV and I want to go and be a nomad."
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:07.880]   All right, well, that's a fairly straightforward thing to do
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:09.780]   if you're from Florida or Texas.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:10.880]   But if you're moving from a state,
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.880]   by the way, this is inclusive of any other state,
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:16.480]   any state that has a state income tax,
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.780]   you probably should consider putting in place an in-between step.
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:24.080]   You should consider genuinely moving to a new place
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:28.980]   outside of your previous high-tax state.
[00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.180]   Check the laws of each state.
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:33.480]   I'm using California and New York because they're the most aggressive.
[00:19:33.480 --> 00:19:37.280]   Each state has different laws that they use to determine residency
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:38.780]   and you should check the laws of your state.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:41.180]   Some states are clear, some states are less clear.
[00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:45.080]   But the first most essential factor that determines your domicile
[00:19:45.080 --> 00:19:49.980]   is occupancy of a home and ideally ownership of a home.
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.180]   So where you own or rent a home
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:57.580]   and as well as the relative size and nature and use of the home
[00:19:57.580 --> 00:20:01.180]   is largely going to determine your domicile.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:05.480]   If you have a big, beautiful home on the coast of California
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:07.480]   that you've lived in for many years,
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:12.580]   but now you go and you rent a tiny little studio apartment in Las Vegas,
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:14.480]   that is going to be the primary factor
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.980]   that is going to mess you up
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:19.080]   when it comes to actually being in tax court.
[00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.880]   You can't just convince the court that,
[00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.980]   "Well, I rent this studio in Las Vegas and that's actually where I live
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.480]   while I still own this big, beautiful home in California."
[00:20:27.480 --> 00:20:30.080]   So if you're going to keep that big, beautiful home in California,
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:32.180]   you probably need a bigger and more beautiful home
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.080]   in Nevada or Texas or wherever you're going
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:39.080]   in order to make certain that it's believable
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.480]   the home in California is your vacation home
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.580]   and the new home is your primary home.
[00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:48.580]   So you need to think very carefully about your housing situation.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:52.080]   The simplest thing to do is to amputate
[00:20:52.080 --> 00:20:55.380]   all of your connections to the state in question.
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:59.280]   And in some countries, people who want to become tax residents,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:01.880]   become non-tax residents, let's say you're Canadian
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:04.880]   and you want to become non-tax resident in Canada,
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:09.180]   then you probably want to sell all of your property
[00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:11.080]   because you're dealing in that situation
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.980]   with a very aggressive taxing agency
[00:21:12.980 --> 00:21:15.280]   and so you want to go through the steps
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:18.680]   to position yourself as genuinely ending
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.080]   your connections with the state.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:24.080]   And similar for people from California or from New York.
[00:21:24.080 --> 00:21:26.780]   Now, if you're from Michigan or Ohio,
[00:21:26.780 --> 00:21:28.580]   some state that has state income taxes,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:29.980]   but they're not as aggressive,
[00:21:29.980 --> 00:21:31.680]   you may have a little bit more leeway.
[00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:34.380]   But the biggest, most important function
[00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:39.280]   is going to be the home that you own
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.880]   and the home that you occupy.
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.780]   And you want to make certain that your big,
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:46.680]   beautiful primary residence is in the other state.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.280]   Now, there are other things that have to do.
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.880]   For example, your employment records.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:53.580]   If you're serving as an employee of a business
[00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:55.680]   that's in California, but now, of course,
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.280]   you move to a small studio in Nevada,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.780]   that's not going to work.
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:22:02.280]   And so if you're an employee or an officer of a business
[00:22:02.280 --> 00:22:04.580]   that's domiciled in the high-tax state,
[00:22:04.580 --> 00:22:06.180]   you need to change that relationship.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:08.180]   You need to become an independent contractor
[00:22:08.180 --> 00:22:11.980]   and you need to move your independent contracting entity,
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:15.680]   if existent, to another state.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:17.780]   Another huge factor is children.
[00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:20.080]   Where do your children go to school?
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:23.380]   So if somebody's investigating your domicile
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.780]   and they find out that,
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.880]   "Hey, I've got this modest house in Nevada,"
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:31.280]   but in reality, these children are attending
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.680]   a school in Los Angeles,
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:35.080]   well, that's going to be a key factor
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.680]   to show that, no, you actually still live in California
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:40.580]   because your center of life is in California.
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:43.380]   After all, this is where the children go to school.
[00:22:43.380 --> 00:22:45.180]   So you want to make certain that
[00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.780]   if you're trying to move outside of one of these states,
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:51.680]   you want to enroll your children in school in the new state
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.880]   or you want to homeschool them
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.980]   or make sure that they're staying with other friends and family
[00:22:56.980 --> 00:23:00.680]   until you fully have changed the situation.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:03.280]   Otherwise, wait till after they graduate.
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:04.480]   Now, if your children are older,
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.780]   their college age are older,
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:07.680]   then, of course, they're more independent
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:08.780]   and it's less of a big deal.
[00:23:08.780 --> 00:23:10.980]   But K-12 minors,
[00:23:10.980 --> 00:23:15.480]   you want to make certain that you arrange their schooling
[00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.880]   so that it doesn't indicate your tax residency
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.580]   in the high-tax state.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:21.980]   Next is going to be just your days spent in the state.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:25.980]   So California is a ratio.
[00:23:25.980 --> 00:23:28.280]   I believe California uses a ratio
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:31.380]   of how many days in California versus other places.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.180]   New York may have a strict days test,
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.680]   but this is why check your specific state.
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:37.280]   And what you're trying to come up with
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:41.080]   is what is the clear line indication.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.180]   So if memory is right, I should have checked this.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.880]   Forgive me for not checking this with California.
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.580]   But the key is that you don't have more connections
[00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:51.680]   with the state that's high-tax
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.180]   than you do with another place
[00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.180]   and don't spend more time there.
[00:23:55.180 --> 00:23:57.780]   This is also very common in international planning,
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:01.580]   that if you spend more days in the high-tax jurisdiction,
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:04.580]   let's say that you spend lots of time in Spain,
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:08.180]   and even if you're not passing the 183 days rule,
[00:24:08.180 --> 00:24:10.580]   you're just spending, say, 150 days in Spain.
[00:24:10.580 --> 00:24:13.380]   Then you're spending 30 days, 30 days, 30 days, 30 days,
[00:24:13.380 --> 00:24:16.480]   30 days, 30 days in five other countries.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:18.580]   Then now there's a good argument
[00:24:18.580 --> 00:24:19.880]   that the government can say, all right,
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:22.480]   well, we appreciate the fact that you were only in Spain
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.380]   for 150 days a year,
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.380]   but the fact that this is your strongest point of connection
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:29.780]   indicates to us that Spain is actually your tax home,
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:31.180]   and that can be a factor
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.380]   that is considered depending on the country.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.680]   So pay carefully attention to that.
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:40.580]   You also want to think about where you receive income from,
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:44.880]   because in many states,
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:47.580]   income that is generated in the state is taxable
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:51.380]   regardless of the actual location of the taxpayer.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:54.780]   So think carefully and research the laws of your state
[00:24:54.780 --> 00:24:57.680]   as to where income is generated.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   Those are the most important ones,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.980]   and you want to genuinely establish yourself
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:05.980]   as non-resident in the high-tax state.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.180]   Then after those important ones,
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:10.680]   because we recognize that there can be things that can change.
[00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:12.080]   So here would be an example.
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:15.680]   Let's say that you genuinely left New York,
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:17.580]   and you genuinely moved to Florida,
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.180]   and you're in Florida for two years,
[00:25:20.180 --> 00:25:21.480]   but then all of a sudden
[00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:23.080]   something's going on with your business,
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.080]   and you have a period of time
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.980]   in which you need to spend a significant amount of time in New York.
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:29.880]   You can genuinely have moved to Florida,
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:33.580]   but now you find yourself genuinely spending time in New York,
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:35.380]   and you're watching your days carefully,
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:36.280]   but something happens.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:40.080]   Again, hospital stay or emergency in a business or opportunities,
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:43.180]   and now boom, you're sucked back into the tax net all of a sudden
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.080]   because of a genuine reason.
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.280]   But these other factors can play in
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:50.680]   if you have them properly aligned.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.280]   So you want to create a stack of paperwork
[00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.680]   that you can take into an audit meeting
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:58.180]   or into a court case
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:25:59.480]   that's going to demonstrate
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:02.680]   that I'm genuinely truly resident in another state,
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:07.480]   so that if you're ever unanticipated in a questionable scenario,
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:09.480]   then the paperwork is on your side.
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:11.380]   So first thing, driver's license.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.380]   Anybody in your family who's a driver
[00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:16.280]   should go and get a driver's license in another state.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.580]   Not just one person,
[00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:19.580]   not just dad gets a license in Florida.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:22.080]   Get everybody to get a license in Florida.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:23.380]   Voter registration.
[00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:25.380]   Registration is an important component.
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:26.780]   So if you're going to register to vote,
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:28.980]   register to move your voter registration.
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:31.880]   Move your vehicle registrations to the new state.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.180]   Make certain that everything is properly tagged and titled
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.680]   and your property is there.
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:38.580]   Update the billing addresses on all of your banking accounts,
[00:26:38.580 --> 00:26:40.280]   all of your investment accounts.
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   Make sure that everything is in the new state.
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.680]   Go through all of your banking and financial accounts.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.380]   Make certain that you've changed your residency address
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.080]   with all of those bank accounts.
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:55.680]   You need to find new family doctors,
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:58.780]   dentists, consultants, people who you're working with.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:27:01.580]   And go and change your primary care provider
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.680]   with your health insurance.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.880]   Go and find a new doctor.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:05.180]   Go for a checkup.
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:06.780]   Visit the dentist in the new place.
[00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:08.880]   Make sure you keep those records showing.
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.380]   I don't go to the same doctor
[00:27:10.380 --> 00:27:11.980]   that I've gone to for 30 years in New York.
[00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:15.180]   I've gone to this new doctor in Florida.
[00:27:15.180 --> 00:27:17.280]   Move your professional memberships.
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.080]   Remove your name from the bar association
[00:27:20.080 --> 00:27:23.080]   or from the certified financial planners list
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.080]   or anything like that that's in the state.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:26.780]   Move it all to the new place.
[00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.380]   Any kind of community involvement
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.980]   or volunteer organizations.
[00:27:29.980 --> 00:27:32.980]   Move your church membership to a church in a new place.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.980]   Move your charity records and donations
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.080]   and all of that to the new place.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:41.280]   Attend social events in your new location
[00:27:41.280 --> 00:27:44.380]   and make certain that those social events are documented.
[00:27:44.380 --> 00:27:47.480]   Documented here I am at all these social events in Florida
[00:27:47.480 --> 00:27:49.280]   and that you're not in California.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.780]   Move your country club membership.
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:54.180]   Move safety deposit boxes, P.O. boxes.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.780]   Document the fact that your family members
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:28:01.080]   are visiting you in Florida, not in New York.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.880]   All of your professional work.
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:03.980]   Move your will.
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:06.980]   Make certain that your will is that you get a new will
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:08.380]   drafted up in the state of Florida
[00:28:08.380 --> 00:28:10.580]   and that's located in the new place.
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:14.980]   Move obviously your utilities that are in your name
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:18.080]   and make certain that you're visible in the new place.
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.080]   In some audits, the auditor or investigator
[00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.480]   is going around and literally interviewing your friends
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:26.180]   and your neighbors and your business associates
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.480]   to figure out how much time you're spending
[00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:32.280]   in the new place and so you should be very straightforward
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.280]   of always saying that, you know, I live in Texas
[00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:37.380]   or I live in Nevada or I live in Florida
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:38.880]   and I vacation in California
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.880]   when I want to visit my friends.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:41.680]   Things like that.
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:43.580]   So make certain that all of your language
[00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:48.380]   is properly and fully documented.
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:52.080]   So you want to genuinely change your affairs.
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.080]   Then you create a big stack of paperwork
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.280]   showing that you've genuinely changed your affairs.
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:00.380]   And then the final key to it is make certain
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:04.280]   that you're not generating any kind of paperwork
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.580]   or evidence that would be showing
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.280]   that well, in reality, he's spending lots of time
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.780]   in California or New York
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:15.480]   because it all comes down to who has the most paperwork.
[00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:17.780]   So you can be super hardcore with this.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.580]   You know, whenever you're in Florida,
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:22.280]   that's where you spend money with your credit cards
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.980]   and with all of your digital transactions.
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:26.280]   When you're in New York,
[00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.480]   that's when you use physical currency to pay for stuff
[00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:33.280]   and you do everything like that.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.180]   If you're going to have meetings when you're in Florida,
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.780]   that's where you do all your in-person meetings.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.080]   When you're in New York, that's where you use Zoom.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:41.880]   When you are thinking about your travel records,
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.680]   one of the things that gets people a lot of times
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:45.180]   is things like travel records.
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:47.880]   And a lot of times it comes down to small mistakes
[00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.980]   like, well, I flew in just at 2 a.m.
[00:29:50.980 --> 00:29:52.880]   instead of leaving before midnight.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.280]   That's why the article that references
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:57.280]   these travel things is important.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:02.080]   So if you can fly into New Jersey instead of New York
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:04.580]   or you can drive in and out of California
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.680]   instead of flying into California,
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.880]   well, now you're reducing the amount of evidence
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.680]   that an opponent in court can generate
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:18.080]   to show the specific day and time
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:20.880]   that you arrived into the state.
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:23.480]   If you're going to go on vacation,
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:26.380]   then you may want to rent a vacation home
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:29.480]   using an entity of some kind
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:33.280]   or you want to have a friend of yours rent the vacation home
[00:30:33.280 --> 00:30:36.280]   instead of you being the one to do it.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:40.480]   Make certain that you have all of the evidence
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:43.280]   indicating your presence in the other state
[00:30:43.280 --> 00:30:45.980]   and make certain that there's a minimum amount of evidence
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.980]   indicating your presence in the high-tax state.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:54.280]   Now, if this sounds like an enormous hassle,
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:56.480]   it should because it is.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.580]   And that's why I led with the advice of make certain
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.080]   that if you're going to move,
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:03.380]   you're moving because you genuinely want to,
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:06.780]   not just because of tax considerations.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:08.380]   If you're going to genuinely move,
[00:31:08.380 --> 00:31:11.580]   then genuinely move and don't play around with this.
[00:31:11.580 --> 00:31:13.580]   Don't try to play close to the line.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.980]   What's the point of being rich
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:18.680]   if you're worrying about an audit from a tax authority
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.580]   because you're playing around close to the line?
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:25.180]   And then after those important things
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:27.180]   that solve most of the problems,
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.680]   make certain that you put in place all this other stuff
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   so that if you ever do wind up in an antagonistic situation,
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:36.080]   an audit or in tax court,
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.980]   with them alleging you owe us $4.2 million,
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:42.680]   make certain that you have an enormous stack of paperwork
[00:31:42.680 --> 00:31:44.080]   on your side of the table
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:48.180]   showing your true and bona fide residence in another state
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:51.780]   and that there's not any significant paperwork
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:54.880]   that the auditors can come up with from your bank records,
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.480]   from your phone records, from all of the other stuff,
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:31:59.880]   showing that, oh, in fact, actually,
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.180]   you were in New York for 184 days
[00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:04.380]   because you arrived early and left late.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:07.880]   Pay attention to this stuff and do it right.
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.080]   - Spoiler alert, a two-word warning
[00:32:10.080 --> 00:32:11.780]   that we're about to ruin the end,
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:15.080]   but sometimes spoilers can be worthwhile.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:18.680]   And so we designed the Lexus NX to reveal many things,
[00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.380]   like taking the mystery out of how close you are
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.080]   between parking space lines
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   or the time you'll arrive at your dinner reservation.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   Technology designed to remove surprise endings.
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.280]   It's just a better story that way.
