[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai, and in this episode I want to talk about safe havens
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:12.160]   after the August CPI data came out. So unfortunately, the August CPI data came out
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:17.840]   disappointing. It did not decline as much as expected. As a result, treasury bond yields
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:26.240]   increased and stocks collapsed. The overall CPI rose 0.1% in the month versus an expectation of
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:35.280]   a drop of 0.1%, and the year-over-year CPI was up 8.3%, which was higher than the 8% expectation.
[00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.360]   Gasoline prices were down 10.6% month-over-month, and that's to be expected. Anybody who drives
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.040]   has seen the price of gas decline, and I think we all felt pretty good about that. However,
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:53.760]   excluding food and energy, prices were actually up 0.6% in August, and over the last three months,
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.400]   all items except energy rose at a 7.4% annual rate, and that was faster than during the spring.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.040]   And to me, the biggest surprise was shelter cost, which rose 0.7% and 0.8%,
[00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:15.040]   the highest increase in a single month since 1991. So in 31 years, medical care costs were up also
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:21.520]   0.7%, but that's not a surprise since our system is so poorly managed. It's a good reminder to eat
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.280]   better, work out more, exercise more, take care of your mental health, because you don't want to be
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.880]   trapped in this very cumbersome and expensive medical system. So the bottom line from this
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.480]   report is that the Fed will likely not relent on its rate hike mission until the Fed funds rate
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:46.800]   is at about 4%. 4%, and that means the yield curve is going to be inverted. It is inverted right now,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.720]   actually, the one year and two year bond yields are higher than the 10 year bond yields. And if
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.560]   the Fed funds rate goes to 4%, so that's the shortest end of the yield curve, 4% is way higher
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:06.480]   than the current 10 year Treasury bond yield of about 3.43%. So in terms of stocks, unfortunately,
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:12.880]   stocks are probably not going anywhere for the rest of 2022. I wouldn't be surprised to see the
[00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:23.680]   S&P 500 back down to $36, $3700. And it's pretty sad, because monetary policy is a determinant,
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.920]   80 to 90% determinant of where stocks are moving, the fundamentals of a company, margin expansion,
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:35.600]   market share increase, all that stuff doesn't seem to matter when the Fed is hiking rates.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.800]   So it's a good reminder also to focus on your personal cash flow, your job income,
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.040]   your investment income, and your side hustles. It's the cash flow that's real, not so much your
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.560]   net worth, not so much the value of a company, as indicated by the stock market market and the stock
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.800]   price. These valuations are subjective, but what's not is the cash flow that's coming in every single
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.680]   week, every single month, every single quarter, given the stock market is probably not going to
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.320]   go anywhere for the remainder of 2022. We don't have to rush to invest in the stock market,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:14.400]   but you should continue to dollar cost average into the stock market according to the appropriate
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.680]   net worth asset allocation model that I've discussed in my posts and that I've discussed
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.800]   in Buy This, Not That. You don't know when the stock market will turn exactly, but so long as
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.920]   you follow a proper model according to your goals and risk tolerance, you're going to be okay over
[00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:37.040]   the long term. Now in the short term, things are more uncertain now. So focusing on safe havens
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.560]   is a good idea for your capital, capital preservation. One of the things you can do
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.080]   is obviously look for higher savings rates online. Thanks to the Fed hiking rates,
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:54.480]   online savings rates are going up. And one of the highest APYs I've seen is actually by Personal
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:03.040]   Capital Cash. They're offering a 2.02% APY for non-customers and a 2.15% APY for customers.
[00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.640]   There's no minimum and there's unlimited withdrawals. And you can check it out at
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:14.320]   financialsamurai.com/pcc. Now, you're not going to get rich, obviously making 2%,
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.560]   but you're sure going to outperform if a risk asset is going down. So all the money that we
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.920]   invested in IBONZ at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, right, 10,000 each,
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:32.160]   is outperforming the S&P 500 by over 20%. It's probably going to outperform by 25%
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:39.200]   when the year is done. And that is fantastic. And I realized while driving my son to kindergarten
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.640]   this morning that there's another great safe haven to preserve your capital. And that's
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:52.160]   the three-month Treasury bill. Given the yield curve is inverted, that means rates on the short
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.520]   end are higher than rates on the longer end. And the three-month bill, Treasury bill, is the short
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.520]   end of the curve. So you get over 3% right now for a three-month Treasury bill and you get all
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:09.440]   your capital back every three months. So you can leg into three-month Treasury bills if you have
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.360]   liquidity concerns. There are obviously no liquidity concerns for online savings accounts or
[00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   high-yield cash accounts. But hopefully, three months is not that long of a period to wait.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.840]   So three-month Treasury bills, pretty attractive. And you can buy them through Treasury Direct.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:33.280]   If you've opened up an account last year or this year because you bought IBONZ, that's where you
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:39.840]   go. Or you should be able to buy it from your online brokerage account such as Fidelity, Vanguard,
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.080]   Charles Schwab. Just call them if you have difficulty. Each platform is a little bit
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:50.000]   different. But there should be pretty direct access as well. Now the other safe haven is
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:56.400]   really not a safe haven since risk is involved. However, based on the August CPI data, it has
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.080]   proven to be a safe haven so far. A couple of months ago, I touched base with Ben Miller,
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.120]   CEO of Fundrise. He mentioned rents for single-family and multifamily homes in the heartland
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:14.080]   were up in the teens percentages. So 11%, 12%, 13%, 14%, 15%. And one of the reasons why is that
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   higher mortgage rates pushed more people to rent instead of buy because it became too expensive to
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:26.160]   buy. Now that reasoning made a ton of sense. But to me, I was a little bit incredulous to hear 10%
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:32.240]   to 15% rent price year-over-year increases given we are not experiencing this here in San Francisco.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:39.520]   Instead, we're like, you know, flat to up 5%. So just kind of in the range of normalcy.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.480]   The only reason why I was able to increase one of my rental properties' rent was because I remodeled
[00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:51.520]   and added more space. So that's fair. And then this other rental property, actually one tenant
[00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.360]   is leaving. So I had two tenants in the two-bedroom condo. One is leaving and she asked if she could
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:04.160]   keep the rent flat. It's already been flat for years now. And I said, okay, because she's going
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.960]   to be the only one living in it. So she's going to use the other bedroom as a work-from-home office.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.360]   And so I said, well, okay, no rent increase. That's fine. You guys have been pretty good,
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.960]   but I still have to fix some things. So the costs are going up. HOA fees have gone up over the years.
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.080]   Property taxes have gone up over the years. But less wear and tear. That's fine. You know,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.000]   let's just keep it simple. So when I heard about 10% to 15% rent price increases, I was like, wow,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.160]   really? Is that really happening right now? But like always, let's review the data. And as
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:42.880]   mentioned in the beginning, shelter costs accelerated to 0.7% month over month. And
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:50.800]   that's the highest single month, month over month rent increase in 31 years. And so what Ben Miller
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.280]   told me a couple of months ago rings true, and it's coming through to the data. So I continue
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:02.080]   to believe in the long-term trend of investing in Heartland real estate. You can also call it the
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:07.520]   Sunbelt or the Smile States. I just wish I had invested even more of my real estate exposure
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.400]   to the Heartland Sunbelt to better ride the inflation wave. Heck, if I could snap my fingers,
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:18.960]   I wish I had, you know, 90% of my net worth exposed to this asset class. But obviously,
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.760]   making large wholesale changes to one's net worth composition would incur a lot of taxes. I'd have
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:31.280]   to sell, repurpose, and then there'd obviously be concentration risk. Finally, I'm looking in the
[00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:37.600]   rear view mirror, which is easy to say, "Oh, I should have done this," but we don't know the
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:43.680]   future. However, long-term, I think the trend of investing in Heartland real estate is the right
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.200]   one. Some of my private real estate funds are outperforming the S&P 500 by over 25% year to date,
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.600]   and it's only September. So let's see whatever happens over the next three months. It's going
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:59.040]   to be pretty interesting. It's also good to point out that just like headline inflation,
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:05.360]   Heartland rent growth will eventually moderate. It's already moderating if you look at the
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.160]   comparisons between 2021, which was the biggest. Like the national median rent, according to
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:22.240]   Apartment List, was up 17.6% in 2021. In 2022, 7.2% national. 2020, negative 1.5%. 2019, up 2.3%.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:31.200]   And 2018, up 3.4%. So I think there's going to be a moderation to the 2% to 3% to 4% range.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:36.960]   That's just the way things are. Things tend to revert to the mean, but outperformance is probably
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:44.880]   going to continue. Just watch out for those boom cities like Austin, where prices went up 50% in
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:50.080]   a couple years. That also means they're going to revert to the mean. And for more expensive coastal
[00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:55.600]   city real estate, well, prices didn't get as crazy. So they're probably not going to decline as crazy.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.840]   It's just going to be less volatile. So this leads me to my concluding point, which I did write a
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:08.160]   detailed post about it. And it's regarding the best time to upgrade to your move up home.
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:15.120]   Historically, the real estate cycle moves up in the seven to 10 year cycles. And then it moves down
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:21.760]   over a one to three year period. That's kind of like the average. We've had good times since about
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:27.680]   2012. So that's a 10 year bull run. And now that it's ended, so we're in a down cycle now.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:35.680]   And we can really only predict when the previous peaks and troughs were until about six months
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:42.240]   after. So if you look at the data, it sure looks like the most recent peak for home prices
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:50.320]   occurred in around March 2020. And so I think the perfect time to upgrade your home may be about
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.440]   18 months after the peak. So basically, you recognize when the peak was. So that takes
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:02.080]   six months to really know. And then you wait another 12 months. So that means for us right now,
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.920]   if you were to ask me to predict when is the best time to upgrade your home, that period is probably
[00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:16.320]   going to be sometime between June 2023 through February 2024. summers and winters are the slowest
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:21.360]   months of the year, which also make them the best times of the year to buy a home if you can find
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.400]   one that you really really like. So during a real estate down cycle, higher priced homes will
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:33.280]   usually decline more in absolute dollar terms, and often in percentage terms as well. The same
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:38.640]   thing goes with vacation properties. During a recession, nobody needs to own a vacation property,
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:44.000]   or a house with two or three more bedrooms than you need. Hence, they tend to be the properties
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.360]   that decline the most since they are the first to flood the market. So if you are looking to
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   upgrade your property, you've got a large cash balance, you got strong cash flow, and you're
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.760]   bullish about your job prospects and your company's prospects, then you're pretty happy to see more
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.320]   higher end homes with price cuts. Even if your own home is losing value, which it is, you're still
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.240]   gaining on a relative basis. So for example, let's say you own a home that's worth $500,000,
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.120]   and it declines by 10%. So you lose 50,000. But you want to upgrade to a million dollar home that
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:27.040]   loses 10%. So that loses 100,000 to 900,000. You're still net up 50,000. So you can go buy that home
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.640]   for 10% off. And you're probably going to go through less bidding wars because the bidding wars
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:37.760]   will disappear. And you're also going to be able to pay less in property taxes compared to the
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:44.960]   original price of the move up home. So what's interesting now is prices are fading because
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.640]   mortgage rates have gone up. But rent growth is strong, but that's also fading a little bit.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:56.960]   So if we can wait 12 months from now, so around this time next year, I think we'll be able to get
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:02.480]   better deals. Maybe we can get move up homes that are going to be priced about 10% below what they
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:09.280]   are or what they were in the first quarter of 2022, March 2022, to be exact. The only quote,
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:16.560]   risk to my thesis of declining home prices for move up homes is that the Fed might relent and
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:22.720]   stop their aggressive price hikes, or at least their moral suasion hawkish tone by the end of
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:28.560]   2022. And so if that occurs, we'll probably have like a three month window where we can buy our
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.680]   upgrade homes at a discounted price before demand comes into the market and buoys prices once more.
[00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:41.120]   So just pay attention to the Fed's tone. And I will be updating newsletter subscribers at
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:48.960]   financialsamurai.com/news. So even though things are not the way we want them to be right now,
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:55.040]   if you're a long only investor, you can look on the bright side of lower prices for things that
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:14:00.080]   you would like. And that's what I'm going to do. I am focused on building my cash hoard over the
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:05.760]   next 12 months. I love saving money. You know, I talk about accumulation and spending more
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:10.640]   now that I'm 45. But I love saving for a purpose. Really, it's for the purpose.
[00:14:10.640 --> 00:14:17.600]   And if that purpose is to buy a move up home in one year or two years time, that feels pretty
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.320]   good. It feels like ah, something to live for something to work for. It just gets me more
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:28.000]   motivated. I've lived in our quote forever home for the past two years and two months.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.560]   And leaving now would have been such it would just feel stupid after two years. So if I can enjoy our
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:39.600]   current home for another one or two years, and then buy a nicer home, I think that would be great.
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.240]   Because at the end of the day, I think the best time to own the nicest home you can afford is
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:50.560]   when you have the most number of heartbeats at home. So everyone, hang in there. I'd love to hear
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:55.360]   your thoughts on what you think about what the Fed is doing where the housing market is going.
