[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.040]   We continue this evening our studies in the twelfth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.960]   and we are now dealing with this subsection that starts in verse 9. Let me read, therefore,
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:22.160]   verses 9, 10, and 11. Let love be without dissimulation. Abhor that which is evil;
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.880]   cleave to that which is good. Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:37.520]   In honour, preferring one another. Not slothful in business, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:45.600]   Now, we began our consideration of this section last Friday evening, and here we indicated we
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.520]   are dealing with the apostles' injunctions and instructions to us as Christian people in our
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.520]   general relationships as Christian people, both with other Christians and with those who are not
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:04.960]   Christian. Until this point, he has been dealing chiefly with the gifts which are given to believers
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.120]   by the Holy Spirit as they are manifested in ministry in the church in various ways. But now,
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:20.160]   he moves to a wider sphere, and we saw that in the ninth verse he lays down the two great
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:27.760]   controlling fundamental principles that govern and control the whole of Christian conduct.
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.480]   We've always got to start with these. If we don't, we shall go astray. And it seems to me so often
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.600]   that we do fail as Christian people in our conduct and particular behaviour because we approach these
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.640]   problems directly instead of indirectly. We start with a particular problem instead of starting
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.240]   with these two fundamental principles. And they were, as we saw last Friday night,
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:03.920]   this great principle of love. "Let love be without dissimulation." Love of God, love of our neighbours.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.520]   Love is the fulfilling of the law. If we but loved as we should, and without dissimulation,
[00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.600]   we should be keeping the law. Love is the fulfilling of the law. And our Lord, you remember,
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.720]   in his teachings, summed it up in the same way. "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.120]   and all thy soul and all thy mind and all thy strength, and thou shalt love thy neighbour
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.680]   as thyself." If only we always remembered that and did it, how different the church would be,
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.320]   and how different the world would be. And then the second great principle is this one about,
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.720]   and it follows, of course, from the first. "Abhor that which is evil." Not only don't do it,
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:54.240]   but hate it. "Ye that love the Lord, hate evil." As Christians, we are not to be negative.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.840]   We're not just to be nice little people who don't do things. We are to be filled with a positive
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:06.880]   hatred of evil. We are to abhor it with the whole of our being. It is to be as hateful to us in our
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.600]   measure as it is to God himself. And on the contrary, we are to cleave to that which is good,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.720]   hold on to it, be glued to it, be such that we cannot be separated from it. Now there,
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:25.920]   you've got the two principles that govern the whole of this question of Christian conduct.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.640]   But the apostle, as is his custom, never stops at just laying down his generous principles.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.880]   He was a great teacher, this man, and he knew his people. And he knew that it wasn't enough
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.200]   just to lay down principles and go on. He comes down to details, and he deals with them. And now
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:53.120]   that is what we have got to proceed to do. Now I suggested in my general analysis of the section
[00:03:53.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   last Friday night, that in this tenth verse, he is again dealing with our general relationship
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.880]   to one another. I'm putting it deliberately as general, because once more he's going to come down
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:15.600]   to certain particulars. And he puts it in these words, as they're translated in the
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:23.040]   authorised version, "Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love, in honour,
[00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:30.400]   preferring one another." Now, let's deal with the exact statement first, before we come to consider
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:39.760]   how we can do this. A better translation probably would be this, "In brotherly love to one another,
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:50.160]   loving warmly, or with warmth." Now that is so because of this word that is translated
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:59.040]   by "kindly affectioned." It's a most interesting word, and it's a word which in the root and
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:08.080]   original meaning, conveys the whole notion of natural affection. Not an affection which is
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:15.920]   produced or called forth by circumstances, but something which is there, innate because
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:22.400]   of the relationship in which we find ourselves. In other words, it is the word that is used
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:31.760]   to describe the love you have for your relatives, for your kindred. That is the word in its original
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:40.240]   meaning. It is the kind of innate, instinctive love which we feel towards those who are members
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:45.680]   of the family to which we ourselves belong, the natural love of kindred.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.600]   So what the apostle is saying is this, that our brotherly love as Christian people, in our
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.920]   relationships as Christians with one another in the church and elsewhere, he says that this
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:08.800]   brotherly love of ours is not to be something merely superficial or official. It's not merely
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.560]   because we are associated together in the same church or something like that. He says it must
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:23.040]   go beyond that. He says your brotherly love should really take on something of the character
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.160]   of the love that you have to members of your natural families to which you belong.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.960]   Now this is the most interesting and the most important point. That is really what he's saying.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:42.880]   Somebody therefore translated it like this, "Love the brethren in the faith as though they were
[00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:50.640]   brethren in blood." And I think that brings out the meaning very well. The brethren in the faith,
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:57.680]   that's brotherly love. Now he says you must love your brethren in the faith as if they were
[00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:06.000]   brethren also in blood. Now the question that confronts us at once is this, what does this mean?
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:17.280]   You notice it is a command. Let all these things, let love be without dissimulation,
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:25.760]   be kindly affectioned to one another with a brotherly love. I think I indicated last Friday,
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:31.440]   I can't quite remember, that I have almost been amused that some of the commentators,
[00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:37.440]   in the way in which they handle this whole section, they seem to say, well this of course
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:43.200]   it's all quite obvious, we needn't stay with this. I was reading an article by a man in another
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.760]   country on this very section about three weeks back and he actually said that. He said these
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.480]   things are so obvious we needn't go into details here, we needn't wait with them. Now I've only
[00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:58.320]   one comment to make about that. That's a man who hasn't understood the section at all. Of course
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:02.400]   I know it's a very easy thing to do. You can read this, you say quite obvious, let love be without
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:09.200]   dissimulation. But what's it mean? "Abhor that which is evil, cleave to that which is good."
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.880]   All right, it seems obvious, but how do you do it? That's the question, and the same with this.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:20.240]   Be kindly affectioned to one another with brotherly love. But you stop and you say,
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:25.840]   well now am I doing that? Is that true of me? If not, why not? How can I conform to this?
[00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:30.560]   And the moment you do that, you find that it's not quite as obvious and as simple
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:36.080]   as you thought it was. Because there is one thing we cannot do, and that is to create feelings.
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:44.560]   You can't produce feelings. It's just impossible. And sometimes the more you try to do so,
[00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:51.200]   the more bereft you are of feelings. And yet here we are confronted by a commandment.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:58.800]   "Let your love of the brethren in the faith be as though you were brethren in blood."
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.080]   Can't you see how different the life of the Christian church would be and would have been
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:07.200]   throughout the centuries if only everybody had practiced this?
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:11.600]   Well how do we do it? How can it be done? Now here is the great question.
[00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:18.400]   And to me there is only one answer once more. We saw it last week, we see it again,
[00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:25.280]   we'll go on seeing it with every one of these separate injunctions. The only way to be sure
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:32.400]   that you are kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love is this, to pay attention to
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:38.080]   and to respond to the exhortation in the first verse of the chapter. "I beseech you therefore,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:47.680]   brethren, by the mercies of God." You work that out, the therefore and the mercies of God.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:55.040]   And you can't do it otherwise. In other words, you don't approach the question of feelings
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:10:01.360]   directly. That is almost fatal. Feelings are always the result of something else.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:08.640]   And feelings are the result ultimately of understanding and of thought.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:15.440]   So what the apostle is exhorting us to do here is not to try to put on some cloak of feelings
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:21.440]   which we don't have and which we don't feel, which would be sheer hypocrisy. He's saying,
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:28.000]   face these things in such a way that you will find that you do love your brethren in the faith
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:35.040]   as if they were also brethren even in blood. Well how do you do it? Well, you see, the answer is
[00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:42.320]   this. You've got to work out your doctrine. And you work out your doctrine like this.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:50.800]   You realize that as a Christian you are born again. You've got a new nature.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:11:00.720]   And you realize that the same thing is true of all other Christians. You have started a new life,
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:05.520]   you've been born into a new life, yes, but you've also been born into a new family.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:12.560]   So has every other Christian. So now you see that you and every other Christian
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:21.520]   are members of the same family. That you really are related to them in this extraordinary manner.
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:28.400]   Now let me put this plainly to you by showing you how our Lord dealt with this and how the
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:32.880]   same apostle does it at greater length somewhere else. But take our Lord's teaching,
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.360]   for instance, as you find it in the 10th chapter of the Gospel according to Saint Mark,
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:47.200]   in verses 29 and 30. And Jesus answered and said, "Verily I say unto you, there is no man that hath
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.680]   left house or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my sake
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:12:02.800]   of the Gospels, but he shall receive a hundredfold now in this time houses and brethren and sisters
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:09.280]   and mothers and children and lands with persecution and in the world to come eternal life."
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:15.360]   Now there it is, what he's saying is this. Because you've become followers of me,
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:21.440]   it may mean that you'll be ostracized by your family. You may lose in that sense your husband
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:26.800]   or your wife, your father or your mother, or your children or your relatives. They'll have nothing
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:30.880]   more to do with you. Because you've become a Christian, well you've lost them in a sense.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:36.080]   But it's all right, says our Lord. You'll get brothers and sisters and fathers and mothers
[00:12:36.080 --> 00:12:41.600]   and husbands and wives. You won't lose, it'll all be made up to you. You'll have many more than you
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.320]   had before. Why? Well because you've now entered into this amazing family of God. And there you
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:55.120]   have these relationships. And then you get the Apostle Paul, of course, putting the same thing
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:59.920]   in that well-known statement at the end of the second chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.
[00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:07.520]   He's writing to Gentiles. Now therefore he says, "You are no more strangers and foreigners,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:13.520]   but fellow citizens with the saints, and of the household of God."
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:20.560]   You are members of God's household. You are members of God's family. Now that's the thing
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.600]   that's at the back of the teaching of the Apostle in this verse that we're looking at here in the
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:33.840]   twelfth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans. We do belong to the same family as Christians.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:40.960]   Now this is not something merely in thought. I know we must be careful not to materialize it
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:48.880]   overmuch. But the term "regeneration" and "rebirth" does carry a real meaning. There is something new.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:56.560]   There is a new nature. And we do belong to a new family. And what he's saying, in effect, therefore,
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:03.600]   is just this. That you should feel, therefore, with regard to your fellow Christians, what you did
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:11.360]   feel and still feel, perhaps, in the natural sense, to your brothers and sisters. Because you do belong
[00:14:11.360 --> 00:14:17.280]   to this spiritual family in as great reality as you did to the physical family. And therefore,
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:25.200]   you should feel for them this same feeling that you know so well in the natural and in the human
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:34.320]   realm. Now, you see, you have to work this out. And that is what he's exhorting us to do. He is
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.720]   not saying just be polite to your fellow Christians because you are now members of the same society,
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.760]   or of the same institution, or of the church together. He says, no, no, it must be altogether
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:52.960]   deeper than that. You must feel this bond, this relationship to them, that you're brothers and
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:58.480]   sisters. I think I've often pointed out this before. This doesn't just mean that you begin
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:04.480]   calling everybody "brother." That's the negation of it. And as far as I'm concerned, it always
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:10.720]   makes me feel least brotherly. That's not what he's talking about. That's this superficial
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:16.560]   something. That's dissimulation. That's pretense. That's playing. That's not it at all. But what he
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:22.720]   does mean is that having realized the truth and the doctrine, well, you begin to be conscious
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:28.880]   of this. And you mustn't be content with anything less than that. And so, you see, it works out in
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:37.200]   practice in this way. What do we do as natural human beings? Well, we are always ready to do
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:44.880]   things with regard to our relatives that we won't do with other people. We are ready to correct
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.360]   other people's children for doing certain things which we don't correct our own children for doing.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:55.520]   That's human nature. You defend your own, you make excuses for your own. You're always on
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.240]   the defensive for your own. You can always understand what they're doing. Now, what he's
[00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:06.560]   saying is that should be equally true of your relationship to one another as Christians.
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:13.760]   You should feel this same innate desire. Now, this works out, of course, all round. Take the
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:19.200]   another way of putting the same thing. This whole analogy of the body that he's been using,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.560]   which is elaborated in 1 Corinthians 12, there you remember the apostle says,
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:29.840]   "If one member of the body suffers, all suffer with it." And that is true of us as Christians.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:36.720]   And it should be more and more true of us. Because of our consciousness of this family relationship,
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:43.360]   we suffer together. We rejoice together. Nothing can happen to any one of us but that we're all in
[00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:48.800]   it. Why? Well, because we are not only members of the same body, we are members of the same family.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:56.080]   And then, if we find certain brothers and sisters difficult at certain times and certain points,
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:17:01.920]   and do things which we can't quite understand, well, we don't condemn them as outsiders. We
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:08.000]   treat them exactly as we would treat natural relatives if they were doing the same sort of
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:14.720]   thing. And it is in that way, you see, that the life of the Church is harmonious. It is in this
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:21.040]   way we all together minister to the glory of God and show to the world our relationship to one
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:28.000]   another because of our relationship to him. Now let me add just one other note to this.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:37.520]   You notice that what he says is that our brotherly love is to show itself in this way.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:45.440]   It is important that we should draw the distinction between liking and loving.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:53.920]   Even in the natural sense, you don't like each member of your family as much as you like others.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:59.120]   Now, I'm not here to justify this or to criticize it. I'm just saying it is a fact.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:05.200]   That though you may be in exactly the same relationship to two people, you don't of
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:10.960]   necessity like them to the same extent. You are to love them to the same extent,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:16.720]   but you're not ever commended to like them to the same extent. And we're not told here that we've
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:24.080]   got to like every other Christian. But what we are told is that our brotherly love to every Christian
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:30.480]   is to have this quality in it that characterizes our natural love and affection to those
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:39.760]   with whom we share the same family and its likes and dislikes and its privileges and its so on.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:46.640]   Well, the way to do that is, as I say, to realize that this is the truth about us.
[00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:52.000]   And it becomes a very good test, of course. What do you feel about your fellow Christians?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:00.640]   Are you conscious of this quality coming into your brotherly love? It's a very good test of
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.320]   our whole position as Christian people. As I say, you can have a polite relationship to your
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:10.000]   fellow members in the church. That isn't enough, says Paul, that isn't what I'm talking about.
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:17.680]   Are we aware of this kinship, this relationship? I've sometimes even put it like this.
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:26.720]   Can you say quite honestly that you have a deeper affection for and a deeper understanding of
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:34.080]   your fellow Christians than you have for your natural relatives who are not Christian?
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:42.160]   That's a proof of your regeneration. And it is also a proof that you paid heed to this exhortation
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:48.480]   and that you are putting it into practice. A Christian should feel a closer bond
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:55.280]   with another Christian than he feels with a relative who is not a Christian.
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:20:01.280]   It's true of necessity. The new nature is in us. We are all children of God. We belong to the
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:06.640]   family of God. And it's a relationship that is not only going to last while we're in this world of
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:13.360]   time. It will last throughout eternity. There will be no end to it. Now then, says the apostle,
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:21.440]   make certain that this quality is being manifested in your brotherly love one to another more and
[00:20:21.440 --> 00:20:28.640]   more. And that is the way in which that happens. It is by meditation, by grasping the truth,
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:34.320]   by applying this therefore, by reminding yourself of all the doctrine that's gone before,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:40.000]   and realizing that this is true of you. And you pray that the Spirit may not only so enlighten
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.400]   you, but may so fill your heart with love, love to God and your fellow human being, you will find
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:52.560]   that this becomes increasingly true. Very well. There is the first part of the statement. But
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:59.520]   then he goes on and adds to that. He says, in honor, preferring one another.
[00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:08.480]   Now, this again appears to be obvious, but it's, the more you analyze it, the profounder you will
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:16.080]   find it to be. Honor. What is honor? What do you mean by honoring? Well, it's a word that was used
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:25.040]   the, again, the original meaning is this. It is the price that you fix for an object after you
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   have taken the trouble to evaluate it. That's the root meaning of this word honor. Think of anything
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:41.760]   you like, a watch, a vase, anything. You examine it, and then as a result of your examination and
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:50.240]   investigation, you assess its value. You put a price upon it. And you do that as the result of
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:56.160]   this examination. It's a kind of price fixing. Well, now, that's the meaning. So you take it up
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:04.000]   and it means this. It is your evaluation of others. It is what you think of others. And this,
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:11.360]   in turn, becomes the respect that you show one to another as the result of your estimation of
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:19.680]   one another and of the gifts that others have. That's what he means by honor. In honor, preferring
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:26.480]   one another. It carries the idea, if you like, of reverence and of respect. It is your whole
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:32.640]   estimate and evaluation of others, and that, of course, in turn, determines your behavior
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:39.600]   with respect to them, how you treat them, and especially how you treat them in terms of yourself.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:47.200]   Now, this is a very important matter. Again, you see how the failure to implement this
[00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:54.080]   exhortation so often wrought such havoc in the Church. I read to you 1 Corinthians 4 at the
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:59.440]   beginning, because the apostle had to deal with it there. There, the trouble was mainly the way
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:04.320]   they were quarreling amongst themselves because of their respective evaluations of Paul and Apollos.
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:10.160]   That's bad enough, but when it becomes trouble as the result of their evaluation of one another
[00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:15.040]   and themselves, well, it is still worse. Honor, that's the meaning. Well, then, what is the
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:22.240]   meaning of this word "preferring"? Here, the commentators make two points, and undoubtedly
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:29.600]   both are right. The word really means to go before, to lead, to lead the way, if you like.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:38.880]   And that can be interpreted in two ways. One is this, that he is saying that sometimes we show
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:46.400]   our respect for others by walking before them, as it were, and showing our deference by, as it were,
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:51.280]   leading them forward, opening doors for them, preferring them. We are going before them,
[00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:57.440]   and we are showing our respect by doing that. We don't walk after them and let them open the doors,
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.680]   and we go before them and prepare the way for them. And we are respecting them and paying
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:06.880]   honor to them, and that is one of the ways in which we do it. That is a part of the meaning,
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:12.480]   undoubtedly, but it also has another meaning, another possible meaning, and I believe that
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:19.040]   the two things are surely involved here. There are those who say that it means this,
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:25.280]   give a lead to one another in this matter of respecting one another. In other words,
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.000]   make sure that you are always first in paying honor and respect to one another.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:36.800]   Go before others in this matter of showing respect, not in the kind of physical, mechanical way that
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.120]   I've been describing, but that it's a kind of metaphor. Go ahead of one another in your desire
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:50.800]   to be showing respect and honor to one another. In other words, it's this, you see. Here we are
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:56.080]   as members of the Christian Church, and we have already seen in the earlier part of the chapter
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.760]   that we have all received gifts from God. I say, he says earlier in this chapter,
[00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:07.200]   I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you, and not to think of himself
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:13.360]   more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:19.200]   the measure of faith. And then he goes on in verse five, so we being many are one body in Christ,
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:24.880]   and every one member's one of another, having then gifts differing according to the grace that
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:30.080]   is given to us, whether prophecy and so on. Well now then, here we are, we've all got these gifts,
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:38.640]   and what he's saying is this, learn to evaluate these right, and give respect and honor one to
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:44.880]   another. Go ahead of one another in doing that. You see, the two ideas can be mingled together,
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:51.520]   and it comes therefore to this. It is, what is our attitude to one another, and our attitude to
[00:25:51.520 --> 00:25:57.920]   ourselves of course? You can't separate these two things. Well now, here it is. And once more,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.880]   how foolish are those commentators who say this is so obvious, we needn't stay with this, we're
[00:26:02.880 --> 00:26:08.160]   going on to something more important later on. More important? There's nothing more important
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:13.440]   than this. There is nothing that has done so much harm in the life of the Christian church
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:19.520]   throughout the centuries, and still does harm in the Christian church, as the failure to put this
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:25.120]   into practice. It's in the New Testament, you see it in the subsequent history of the Christian
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:33.680]   church. But again I ask, how are we to do this? Each one of us has got to give a lead to the other,
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:41.600]   and all others, in showing honor and respect to the gifts that we have received, that others have
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:48.480]   received as well as ourselves from God. What is this? Is the apostle inculcating a kind of
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:57.120]   modesty here? Is he teaching us to be a succession of Uriah heaps? Well of course the whole suggestion
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:27:05.520]   is just ridiculous. Now that chapter I read at the beginning is to me one of the most fascinating
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:12.640]   ones, and of course on this particular subject it is the classical passage, because the apostle
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:20.320]   deals with it in his own exhaustive manner. What are the principles? Well you can say this at once.
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:29.120]   To lead one another and to prefer one another in the matter of giving honor,
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:33.040]   does not mean for a moment that you abandon your canons of judgment.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:40.880]   Now that is the false modesty, to say well of course I'm nobody, I'm nothing. You know the
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:45.840]   type of person who does that, they're often the most conceited persons alive. I'm nothing,
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:51.600]   I'm nobody. You know they don't mean it and it isn't true. You ought to have a true evaluation.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.320]   For instance, here is the apostle you see in this chapter, 1 Corinthians 4,
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   working out this great principle, but then towards the end of the chapter he says this,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.920]   "I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you,
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:14.800]   for though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers. For in
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:21.120]   Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel, wherefore I beseech you, be ye followers
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:26.560]   of me." Well how can a man who says in honor preferring one another, and he includes himself
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:32.640]   in the injunction, how can he at the same time say, "be ye followers of me"? Is he contradicting
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:39.360]   himself? Of course he isn't. You see it isn't a matter of pretense. You don't do away with facts.
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:47.680]   That's quite ridiculous. For the great apostle in that sense, to say that he gives greater honor
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:53.040]   to some insignificant member of the church at Corinth is just to be ridiculous. You notice that
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:29:00.720]   because of their utter folly, he uses sarcasm in teaching them. He says, "I think that God hath
[00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:05.840]   set forth us the apostles last as it were appointed to death, for we are made a spectacle into the
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.840]   world and to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:19.680]   weak, but you are strong." Now that's nothing but sarcasm. Don't lose sight of that. That is sarcasm.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:25.360]   He didn't mean for a moment, he cannot mean that they are strong whereas he is weak, that they are
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:33.120]   honorable and so on, and he is not. No, no. He's dealing here with the impression that they're
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:40.160]   giving, the attitude and mentality that they have got into. So he reprimands them. He is the apostle.
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.440]   He is their father. He is their teacher. And he doesn't take that away. And he handles them as
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:52.240]   such. He instructs them. And he leads them in this particular manner. Very well then, I say,
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:30:01.040]   it doesn't mean that you abandon all standards. For instance, if a man happens to be unusually
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:12.320]   gifted with brain power and understanding, this injunction does not tell that man to keep quiet
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:18.480]   and not to give his opinion, but to allow some poor man who is equally a Christian with him in
[00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:23.360]   the matter of regeneration, but who hasn't been gifted by God in the same way. It doesn't mean
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:30.560]   that a man like Paul sits quietly while somebody who hasn't got the capacity and the gift to expound
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:36.000]   some Old Testament passage in the church at Corinth. That would be to make the thing ridiculous.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:41.680]   It doesn't mean that. And that, if we pretend that, well then we're not only not using the
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:48.880]   gift which we have, we are bringing the whole of the teaching into disrepute. No, what the apostle,
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:56.160]   you see, is really inculcating here is this. He is really saying that there is to be no
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:04.480]   room nor place for pride in the Christian life. That's what he's concerned about. That we must be
[00:31:04.480 --> 00:31:11.520]   never guilty of pride. It's another way of putting what our Lord puts in one of his beatitudes about
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:19.040]   meekness and poverty of spirit. Blessed are the meek. Now that's really what it is. Or take the
[00:31:19.040 --> 00:31:24.720]   way in which our Lord has put it very plainly in a bit of teaching that is recorded in the
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:29.440]   fourteenth chapter of the gospel according to Saint Luke. Let me read to you verses seven to
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:35.200]   eleven. "And he put forth a parable to those that were bidden, when he marked how they chose out the
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:41.280]   chief rooms, saying unto them, When thou art bidden of any men to a wedding, sit not down in the
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:48.560]   highest room, lest a more honorable man than thou be bidden of him. And he that paid thee and him
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:54.320]   come and say to thee, Give this man place. And thou begin with shame to take the lowest room.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:00.000]   But when thou art bidden, go and sit down in the lowest room, that when he that paid thee cometh,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.800]   he may say unto thee, Friend, go up higher. Then shalt thou have worship in the presence of them
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.920]   that sit at meet with thee." Now I believe that that is the teaching that the apostle is putting
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:18.560]   before us here. Or, let me put it in terms of the apostle's own statements. He has said some
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:25.920]   extraordinary things. This is what he means here. Take 1 Corinthians 15, 9. Take verse 8 first.
[00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:32.240]   "Last of all," he's dealing with the resurrection appearances, "last of all he was seen of me also,
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:40.160]   as of one born out of due time. For I am the least of the apostles, that I am not meet to be called
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:48.880]   an apostle, because I persecuted the church of Christ." When the apostle says that, he means it
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:56.960]   literally. That is exactly and precisely what he felt. Mark you, he says, and here you see you get
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:03.200]   the balance, he says that in Galatians that he's not inferior to any one of them. That he went up
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.640]   to Jerusalem to see whether he had run in vain and had preached in vain, and he went there and
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:14.080]   he listened to these, he said and he discovered that he was not inferior in any way at all.
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:20.480]   There's no contradiction there. He knows the gift he's received, he knows the ability he's been
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:26.000]   given, and he cannot make little of that because he's then not, he then would be criticizing the
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:32.640]   gift of the Spirit. But as to his own attitude towards himself, well there it is in those words.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:40.800]   But take it again as you get it in Ephesians 3, 8, "Unto me, who am less than the least of all
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:48.640]   saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:55.840]   Christ." That's not mock modesty. That was exactly what the apostle felt. That's a kind of exposition
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:02.240]   of this phrase that we are looking at together. Or take it in those words which I often have felt,
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:07.840]   perhaps some of the most poignant words, in the whole of the New Testament,
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:12.320]   where he's writing in his first epistle to Timothy and in the first chapter.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:19.920]   He talks about anything which is contrary to sound doctrine, according to the glorious gospel of the
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:30.640]   blessed God, which was committed to my trust. "And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who hath
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:37.840]   enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the ministry, who was before a
[00:34:37.840 --> 00:34:45.040]   blasphemer and a persecutor and injurious, that I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:50.400]   in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord was exceeding abundant with faith and love,
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:56.480]   which is in Christ Jesus. And later, howbeit for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first,
[00:34:56.480 --> 00:35:02.640]   Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:10.000]   believe on him to everlasting life." Now then, that's the thing that the apostle is saying.
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:16.160]   In honor, preferring one another. How do you do this? Well, you do it, you see, by starting
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:25.520]   by having a true estimate of yourself. Self is the greatest curse of all. It's the source of
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:32.640]   nearly all evil. Self. A wrong view of self. So when you're told to prefer, in honor, preferring
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:38.320]   one another, you don't start by looking at them, you start by looking at yourself. You will never
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.040]   be right in your evaluation of others until you've made a true assessment of yourself.
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   You've got to start with yourself always. Now again, go back to 1 Corinthians 4, and here it is.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:56.400]   The apostle puts it so plainly. He was aware of this quarrel in the church at Corinth about
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:03.280]   Apollos and himself, but he puts it like this, "With me, it is a very small thing that I should
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:10.880]   be judged of you or of men's judgment. Yea, I judge not mine own self. I know nothing by myself."
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:16.800]   He means by that, that he can't justify himself, "Yet am I not against himself, yet am I not
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:24.480]   hereby justified. But he that judges me is the Lord." The man has finished with himself. He's
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:32.000]   not sensitive, oversensitive, hypersensitive, waiting for an insult. Isn't this the curse of
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:38.640]   life? It's the most prolific cause, I say, of all the troubles in the church and in the world.
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:44.960]   Here's a man who's been delivered from that. He's finished with himself. He can say quite honestly,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:51.520]   "It is a very small thing with me that I should be judged of you or of men's judgment. Yea,
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:57.440]   I judge not mine own self. I don't spend my time in looking at myself and saying what a wonderful
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:02.240]   fellow I am and what I've done. I don't do that. I've finished with it." But then you see, he's got
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:08.320]   a second argument which we've got to add to that. And here is the thing that he brings out in the
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:15.680]   seventh verse. And here, my friends, is the cure to this particular horrible disease, one of the
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:22.160]   most terrible of the spiritual diseases, this overestimate of self and underestimate of others,
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:27.360]   which is the exact opposite of in honor preferring one another. Now this is the answer. Verse 7,
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:37.600]   1 Corinthians 4, "Who maketh thee to differ from another?" Answer that question. You're
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:44.960]   pleased with yourself. You say, "I've got wonderful powers." That other person beneath contempt. But
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:51.520]   to answer this question, who's made you different? How do you explain the difference? Who maketh thee
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:58.960]   to differ one from another? And then go on. "And what hast thou that thou didst not receive?"
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:06.160]   Now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:12.880]   Can you answer that? There's nothing to be said, is there? And we just all see that we're not only
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:20.880]   unworthy and shameful, but on top of it all, we are just fools. We haven't answered those questions.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:26.480]   Now what is the teaching therefore? What is the doctrine that is put before us in these various
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:31.920]   verses that I have read to you? Well, here it is. This is how the apostle clearly works it out in
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:39.680]   his own case. He marvels at the fact that he's a Christian at all. And we all ought to marvel at
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:46.800]   the same thing. If we ever lose our sense of wonder at the fact that we have ever become Christians,
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:53.760]   we are already victims to this disease in a sense. We must never lose this sense of wonder.
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:59.760]   Why are we different? Well, there's only one answer. It is entirely the result of the grace
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:06.640]   of God. Furthermore, the apostle is amazed and astonished that he of everybody should ever have
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:12.480]   been called to be an apostle. It's nothing in him. He hasn't done it. It isn't because of his
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:19.040]   wonderful achievements or his great insight and understanding. It's all in spite of him. It's all
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:28.640]   the grace of God. "I am what I am by the grace of God." He's the chief of sinners. And you see,
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:33.280]   the more spiritual you become and the more knowledge you have of God and of the Lord
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.480]   Jesus Christ and of the Holy Spirit, the greater you will see your own sinfulness and the depth
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:43.280]   of evil that is in you. The trouble with people who don't see this and who have a high conceit of
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:49.760]   themselves is that they're ignorant of God and ignorant of God's character and of his being.
[00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:57.600]   The apostle is the chief of sinners. And he really felt it. Again, it's because, you see,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:03.680]   he can't imagine anybody to be a greater sinner. So he's got nothing to boast of. Boasting is
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:09.440]   excluded, as he's so fond of saying. All that he'd boasted of, he seemed to be done and refuse
[00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:16.800]   and entirely useless. So you start with that. And when you've started with that, you're already
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:22.400]   75% on the way to the solution of this problem, aren't you, in honor of referring one another.
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:30.480]   Once a man has really seen himself as he is as the result of the fall and his own actions,
[00:40:30.480 --> 00:40:36.240]   once a man gets to know something of the plague of his own heart, he's down. And nobody can ever
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.280]   say anything too bad about him. He can say worse things always about himself than anybody else
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.480]   ever knows. What he says is this, "Thank God they don't know all the truth about me."
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:53.280]   There is your starting point. But then you go on to the second point, which is your gift
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:59.600]   for service. Here are these foolish Galatians comparing Paul and Apollos, as if they were two
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:05.520]   actors on a stage, using their own natural powers and faculties. Don't you realize, he says,
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.480]   that I am the Apollos and all others. We are only what we are because of the gift that has been
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:15.760]   given to us. One's been called to plant and the other's been called to water. One's been called
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:22.080]   to lay the foundation, others called to build upon it. But it isn't us at all. It is the great
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:28.240]   master of building. He's the one that counts and we are nothing. We can do nothing in and of
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:35.360]   ourselves. We can only do harm in and of ourselves. We've been given gifts. We've not produced them,
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:41.680]   we've not generated them. They're entirely given, as he's been showing in the earlier part of this
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:47.760]   twelfth chapter of the epistle to the Romans. So for a man to boast of his gifts, his innocence
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:55.360]   almost to deny the gift. It is so ludicrous. It is so ridiculous. Now, as we realize these things,
[00:41:57.360 --> 00:42:03.520]   you will find that inevitably you are in honor preferring one another and add to it this third
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:10.000]   and last consideration, if you like. Look at your service. Let all of us look at our service.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:19.280]   What a poor service it is. You see, you can only boast of it when you're not really examining it.
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:28.720]   You're looking somewhere else. But examine your service. Realize exactly its character and its
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:35.760]   quality. When you realize the gift of the Spirit to you, when you realize the character of the work,
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:42.560]   what is it? You remember what our Lord again said? He put this thing right once and forever.
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:48.000]   His teaching was this, to the disciples who are always ready to boast and to compete with one
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:52.800]   another and so on, and to be animated by these wrong and ugly and false feelings,
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.040]   he tells them, "Do everything you can, and then having done it all, say to yourselves,
[00:42:57.040 --> 00:43:02.240]   'We are but unprofitable servants.' Having done everything, you are still
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:09.600]   unprofitable servants." I've often tried to put it like this from this pulpit.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:18.400]   The danger is always to compare ourselves with people whom we think have inferior gifts and
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:24.880]   qualities. The thing to do, my friend, is to compare yourself and contrast yourself
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:31.520]   with the saints of the centuries, with the men depicted here in the New Testament,
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:41.360]   and above all, with our blessed Lord himself. What pygmies we are. What small creatures we are.
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:48.000]   This is the best antidote to this false feeling. It is the best way to encourage what the apostle
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:54.800]   Enkel gives in this phrase, in honour of preferring one another. "Read," I say, "about the saints."
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:44:00.880]   Have you ever heard of what Charles Edmund Spurgeon once said about his own preaching?
[00:44:00.880 --> 00:44:06.160]   That great preacher who preached for all those years here in London in the last century,
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.720]   and whose name they've almost forgotten, whose principles they've certainly denied,
[00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:15.680]   almost every one of them, though they still use his name. Do you remember what he said
[00:44:15.680 --> 00:44:20.320]   about his own preaching? He said he wouldn't cross the street to listen to himself, and he meant it.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:26.880]   When a man has a true conception of this gospel and sees what it is and what it's worthy of and
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:34.240]   what it deserves, he's bound to feel that his best efforts are so unworthy. They're so poor.
[00:44:34.240 --> 00:44:39.760]   They're so feeble. Charles Wesley, he was a great singer, wasn't he? I mean as a poet.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:46.080]   And yet, you see, this is how he says, "Oh, for a thousand tongues to sing." He'd only got one,
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:52.720]   and he felt it was so feeble. This poor, lisping, stammering tongue, as his contemporary puts it.
[00:44:52.720 --> 00:45:00.080]   "Oh, for a thousand tongues. What is adequate? Whatever can be." Now then, as you view it all
[00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:07.840]   in that way, you begin to see that you, in a sense, are nothing. You've got nothing to boast of. You're
[00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:14.400]   less than the least of all saints. And once you feel like that about yourself, well, it follows,
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:20.800]   "He that is down need fear no fall." Nobody can insult you. You know that perfectly well,
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:25.520]   because they never know the worst about you. You alone know that. So they can't insult you. It's
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:34.480]   impossible. But not only that, you feel sure that no one can be quite as bad as this.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:43.280]   No one can have the ugliness within that you have. And you see the gifts that God has given
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:50.480]   them. And so you maintain this perfect balance. You never see anything derogatory of the gift
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:58.240]   you've been given. But you always have this view of yourself. And when you're tempted to boast and
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:03.840]   to despise others, you say, "What hast thou that thou hast not received? What maketh thee to differ
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:13.200]   from another?" And it's not you at all. It's God. And he's the same God who's given to others as he's
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:22.640]   given to you. And you glorify God by recognizing his gifts in other, and paying honor and respect
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:30.160]   and reverence and deference to them. Now, says the apostle, "Realize these things and give one
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:38.320]   another the lead in respecting the gift of God that you see in one another." Well, God willing,
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:44.960]   we'll go on with these great and mighty and all-important injunctions next Friday evening.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:52.240]   O Lord our God, we thank thee that we can come to thee. We've been examining ourselves,
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:47:01.760]   and we have seen the ugly sight. We have seen the folly. O Lord, we thank thee that with thee
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:08.640]   there is mercy, that thou mayest be feared, else we know that we would all be entirely undone.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:18.000]   God have mercy upon us, and so reveal thyself and thy love to us, and so shed it abroad in our hearts
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.480]   by thy Holy Spirit, that we shall all be filled with such a love to thee that we shall
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:32.880]   hate ourselves and love one another, and see nothing in one another but thy love
[00:47:32.880 --> 00:47:42.960]   and the marks of thy blessed Spirit. Lord hear us, and O we pray, so fill us with thy Spirit,
[00:47:43.520 --> 00:47:49.680]   that we shall indeed in our brotherly love have this fondness for one another,
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:58.160]   and at the same time in honour prefer one another. And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:03.040]   and the love of God, and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit,
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:09.520]   abide and continue with us now this night, throughout the remainder of this our short,
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:16.880]   uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage, and until we shall stand before him,
[00:48:16.880 --> 00:48:23.120]   entire and complete, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing or any imperfection,
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:29.040]   but glorified in his holy and eternal presence. Amen.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:34.400]   - We do hope that you've been helped by the preaching of Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones.
