[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.200]   - Stephanie writes in to ask this.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.560]   Hello, Pastor John, here's my question.
[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.960]   The older women in my life are concerned
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.600]   with the way I study the Bible.
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.780]   They claim I take an academic approach
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.360]   to reading the Word of God,
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.320]   but I'm afraid it's the only way I truly know how to.
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.880]   Nothing makes me more excited than to connect the dots
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.580]   from the Old Testament to the New Testament.
[00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.520]   With many different colored pens,
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.320]   I highlight and underline verses
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.520]   and scribble notes about what God is revealing to me
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.880]   and whatever blank spaces are available in my Bible.
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.200]   I truly feel this is one of the ways I worship God,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.840]   and I do feel the closest with Him
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.440]   while reading His Word and watching His divine story
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.160]   unfold page by page.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.800]   They say I should be reading my Bible more devotionally,
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.360]   not academically.
[00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.480]   They worry I am making more head knowledge connections
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.400]   rather than heart-changing connections.
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.040]   Can an academic study of the Bible be God-glorifying?
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.200]   - When I hear a question like this,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.200]   I want to crawl inside the heads of the older women
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.900]   who have this concern about Stephanie,
[00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:18.080]   and I want to crawl inside Stephanie's head as well
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.420]   to see what's really going on there.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.760]   It may be that I would wind up being entirely
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.840]   on Stephanie's wavelength and would need then
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.720]   to offer counsel to the older women
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.880]   to have a different attitude, and I will come back to that,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.480]   or it may be that I would find things
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.340]   in Stephanie's heart and mind
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.400]   that would cause me to caution her
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.240]   not to write off their concern.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.240]   So let me try to imagine the best of both of their concerns.
[00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.660]   And state them so that Stephanie can test
[00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.260]   where she fits into this.
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.900]   If I give these older women the benefit of the doubt
[00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.900]   for a moment, I would ask Stephanie if her excitement
[00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.300]   about connecting the dots from the Old Testament
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.800]   to the New Testament might sometimes slip over
[00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   into being an excitement more with intellectual insights
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.160]   than with God Himself.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.880]   Do the older women detect
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.000]   that there is perhaps a slight misplacement?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.200]   And you need to be careful here because it's not black
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.840]   and white, it's not either/or, it's subtle.
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.740]   A slight misplacement of affections
[00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.440]   onto the process of discovery
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.260]   more than on what is discovered,
[00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.740]   or even more delicately, is there a slight misplacement
[00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.000]   of affections onto what is discovered
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.800]   more than the one who revealed it?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.860]   Nobody escapes this danger, nobody.
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.080]   Whatever they're doing, whether they're worshiping
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.980]   corporately or whether they're reading their Bibles,
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.960]   it is possible to delight in the process
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.860]   of giving God praise than in God.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.760]   Some people enjoy singing praise to God
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.040]   more than they enjoy God.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.040]   And so we all are vulnerable at these moments.
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.900]   I'm very encouraged when I hear the way Stephanie talks
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.600]   because when she says, "I truly feel this is one
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:36.600]   "of the ways I worship God, and I do feel the closest
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.800]   "to Him while reading His Word
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.160]   "and watching His divine story unfold,"
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.400]   I say, "Amen, amen."
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.880]   I'm glad she's talking that kind of language.
[00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:52.920]   And the only caution that I might have
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.040]   as I try to imagine what these older women
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.280]   are concerned about is that Stephanie could develop
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.760]   a kind of fascination with the intricacies
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.880]   of redemptive history and with the typological structures
[00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.880]   of the Bible that may be disconnected from real life
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.880]   for these older women who aren't as fascinated
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.120]   as she is by those discoveries.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.480]   And it's so interesting, Tony, just this morning,
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.880]   God is so good, just this morning,
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.800]   I was devotionally plotting my way
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.320]   through 1 Corinthians 10.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   And in 1 Corinthians 10, Paul is chastising the Corinthians
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.160]   for some bad behaviors and warning them.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:39.900]   And the way he does it is by using
[00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.460]   the Old Testament people of Israel in Egypt,
[00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.580]   in the Exodus, in the wilderness at Mount Sinai,
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.160]   to help the Corinthians have right affections
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.220]   and right attitudes.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:57.000]   And it's this verse six that just struck me.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It says, "Now these things took place as types."
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.900]   Now that, it's tupoi in Greek, types.
[00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.640]   And I think it's translated examples
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.580]   or something like that, which is just fine.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.260]   But I think Stephanie will know what I'm talking about here
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.260]   because typology is one way that God,
[00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.180]   in his marvelous running of history,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.680]   has caused the old and the new to be interwoven.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.880]   There are types, any types.
[00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.660]   And here's what it says.
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.260]   "Now these things took place as types for us
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.260]   that we might not desire evil."
[00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.820]   And I just stopped and I said, "Paul, you're amazing.
[00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.820]   You're saying typology is about emotions."
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.940]   That's what he says.
[00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.740]   "These things took place as types
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.740]   that you might not desire evil as they did."
[00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.300]   So amazing.
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.660]   Now here's the question for Stephanie.
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:05.200]   These women that she's relating to
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.980]   are not excited about types.
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.940]   But I'll bet they're excited about desires for good
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.300]   and hatred of evil and seeing those kinds of changes.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.300]   And so I'm just suggesting that Stephanie in her excitement
[00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:25.420]   maybe needs to work at helping others,
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.060]   like these older women, see the payoff.
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:32.640]   The payoff for worship and the payoff for joy
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.900]   and the payoff for godliness.
[00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.900]   Instead of simply celebrating with many colored pens
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.860]   what she's seen, and these women are not
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.740]   on the same intellectual wavelength,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:47.300]   they're not getting excited about the same things,
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:51.860]   but if you move through that, then they might say,
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.660]   "Okay, if Stephanie can get to worship,
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:55.980]   if Stephanie can get to joy,
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:57.740]   if Stephanie can get to godliness,
[00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.860]   if it's having those amazing effects,
[00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.300]   then we'll tolerate her strange way of studying the Bible."
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:06.780]   But let me close by giving Stephanie
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.660]   the benefit of the doubt here.
[00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:10.160]   This is maybe not what she's bargaining for.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.420]   Like, here I am cautioning her,
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.100]   and maybe I need to be cautioning these older women.
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.800]   So that's what I'm gonna end with.
[00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.180]   Give her the benefit of the doubt for a moment,
[00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:23.580]   and let me caution these older women
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:25.780]   who are minimizing, it seems,
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:28.660]   the importance of what Stephanie's doing.
[00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:32.820]   The answer to Stephanie's question is yes.
[00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:36.420]   Can an academic study, and I might suggest to her,
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.260]   use another word beside academic,
[00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:41.820]   like serious or rigorous or detailed.
[00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:44.260]   The very word academic turns some people off.
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:46.340]   So I know what you mean.
[00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.780]   Can an academic study of the Bible be God-glorifying?
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:51.860]   Answer, yes.
[00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:56.300]   You're an example of it, and I hope that I am too.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:00.580]   I want to glorify God by serious, rigorous, detailed
[00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.540]   study of the Bible that owns up to all that God put there.
[00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:07.460]   But here's something we both need to remember.
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:11.740]   Some people are wired, just by God,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:13.140]   in their genetic makeup,
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:19.860]   that if they themselves make that effort at detailed study,
[00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:23.740]   their heads shut down their hearts.
[00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:24.580]   It does.
[00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:28.620]   I mean, as soon as they try their best to think hard,
[00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.740]   they start feeling cold.
[00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.500]   And for those of us for whom it works exactly the opposite,
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.580]   we just shake our heads and say,
[00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.380]   no, no, it doesn't work that way.
[00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:38.620]   And they say, well, it does work that way.
[00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.660]   Now, if you put yourself in their shoes,
[00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.780]   if it works that way for them,
[00:08:42.780 --> 00:08:46.740]   they're almost inevitably going to assume
[00:08:46.740 --> 00:08:48.660]   it's gonna happen to you too,
[00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:52.380]   which is why their suspicion is built in
[00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.180]   to that kind of study, because it's their experience.
[00:08:56.180 --> 00:09:00.900]   And what we have to do, the best way forward, I think,
[00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.500]   and this is what I tried to do for 33 years in preaching,
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.380]   'cause I did that kind of study, behind my sermons.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.940]   And I knew that there were hundreds of people out there
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.020]   who, if I dumped all my study on top of them,
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:14.100]   they would say, that is so boring.
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.940]   The best way forward that I know,
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.820]   and this is my advice to Stephanie,
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:23.700]   is that the one who is studying most rigorously
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.700]   also has to love most rigorously.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.720]   In other words, if others think that our study
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.340]   will damage us, we must prove to them
[00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:36.580]   that it does the opposite.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   So Stephanie should out-love them, out-rejoice them,
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.960]   out-repent them, and out-serve them.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.960]   And how will they then be able to say
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.580]   that study is hurting her if all the evidence
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.880]   is in the other direction?
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:01.060]   - That is good and balanced counsel, Pastor John, thank you.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:03.420]   And thank you, Stephanie, for raising the question.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.860]   We need your questions, so please send them in to us.
[00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.540]   You can send those questions in to us,
[00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:09.420]   and you can listen to old episodes,
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.700]   and you can see a constantly updated list
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.960]   of our most popular episodes of all time.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:16.420]   You can do all of that from our landing page
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:20.980]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.540]   Well, we are all in need of saving.
[00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:28.220]   We know that much, but what are we saved for?
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.300]   That's a question that's a little more complex,
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:33.340]   but no less important, and John Piper will explain
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:36.220]   what we are saved for tomorrow.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.300]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:39.900]   Thanks for listening to the Ask Pastor John podcast.
