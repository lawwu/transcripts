[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.560]   APJ listeners, hello. Thanks for joining us again. Today, we talk about warfare singing.
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:19.520]   Yes, warfare singing. It emerges from an amazing moment in a battle chronicled for us in 2 Chronicles chapter 20.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.980]   There, we're given a scene where Judah's king, Jehoshaphat,
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.920]   is under attack by foreign nations. And from the worries of war, Jehoshaphat set aside time to pray,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.880]   and fast, and lead the people in worshiping God.
[00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.000]   And then he directed worshipers to walk in front of the army and to sing this,
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.380]   "Give thanks to the Lord for his steadfast love endures forever."
[00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.120]   And when they began to sing and praise, verse 22 says,
[00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:52.880]   "The Lord set an ambush against the men of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir,
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.000]   who had come against Judah, so that they were
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.140]   routed."
[00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.980]   Incredible. Singing is not just how we respond to God's grace. Singing is power
[00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:05.580]   for
[00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:12.620]   battle. When we sing, the Holy Spirit works. And that's the theme of a classic John Piper sermon titled,
[00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:17.840]   "Ambushing Satan with Song." It was preached on January 20th, 1995.
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.260]   And here is my favorite clip.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:26.140]   "Singing is not merely a response to grace.
[00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.580]   Singing is a means of grace. Singing is power.
[00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.060]   When you sing, the Holy Spirit comes and does something."
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.660]   Now, if you have read
[00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.140]   the book that we've been trying to sell, Dick Eastman's book, "The Hour That Changes the World,"
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.620]   there's a little chapter in there on singing and your personal devotions, and it tells some stories in there.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.340]   You would have remembered two of them. One is of Mary Schlosser,
[00:01:53.660 --> 00:02:00.380]   who was a missionary to China, and it says that Mary used to say, "I sing the doxology and dismiss the devil."
[00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.620]   And Amy Carmichael, without any connection with Mary Schlosser, as far as I know,
[00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.020]   used to say,
[00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.860]   "I believe truly that Satan cannot endure it, and so slips out of the room, more or less,
[00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.420]   when there is a true song."
[00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.980]   Then listen to Martin Luther.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.060]   "Next, after theology, I give to music the highest place and the greatest honor.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.500]   I would not change what little I know of music for something great.
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.080]   Experience proves that next to the Word of God only, music deserves to be extolled
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.420]   as the mistress and governess of the feelings of the human heart.
[00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.040]   We know that to the devil's music is distasteful and insufferable.
[00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.660]   My heart bubbles up and overflows in response to music, which has so often
[00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.060]   refreshed me and delivered me from dire
[00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.980]   plagues."
[00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.300]   Just like David did for Saul, remember?
[00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.940]   Again and again.
[00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.700]   It's no wonder that Satan does his best to keep us from being a singing church.
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.580]   Satan does his best to keep you from being a singing person.
[00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.020]   I don't think these testimonies of Mary Schlosser and Amy Carmichael and Martin Luther,
[00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.260]   and I could add William Law and Jonathan Edwards, I was collecting a whole bunch of them yesterday.
[00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.880]   I don't think they are pious platitudes
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.660]   that sort of mean,
[00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.700]   "Well, of course everybody feels a little better when they sing."
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.260]   Sort of an emotional
[00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.940]   pill that you can take to add spice to your worship. I don't think that's what they mean. I think what they are saying is
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.140]   strictly and terribly true.
[00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.220]   Satan
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.340]   flees
[00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:45.660]   before the spiritual singing of God's people. I'll tell you a story why I'm so convinced of that. Four years ago,
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.620]   I got a phone call
[00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.620]   at 1030 at night,
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:56.460]   and the person on the other end said, "There's a woman in this apartment who is demon possessed. Would you come over?"
[00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.900]   All right, I'll come over.
[00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.140]   I called Tom Steller on the phone. "Tom, would you go with me?" "Sure, we go.
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.820]   Five stay home and pray. I don't know what we'll find." What we find
[00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:10.860]   is an apartment with about
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.740]   five young Christian women and one young man
[00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.860]   who will not let this woman out of this apartment.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.820]   Glazed eyes,
[00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.220]   bitter, with a little pen knife in her hand,
[00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:25.000]   threatening.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.340]   For two hours I
[00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:32.000]   talked to this woman, read scripture, and read prayers of deliverance.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.260]   It comes to a head where she becomes, starts getting very vile. She knocks the Bible out of my hand,
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.700]   she rips the paper out of my hand, she pounds on my back.
[00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.580]   About one o'clock in the morning when the word of God and the force of evil were at their fever pitch,
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.620]   one of those young women started to sing.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:57.200]   And what they sang was the little phrase, "Hallelujah."
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:59.980]   And
[00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.980]   she became vicious,
[00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.060]   threatened everyone if we wouldn't stop singing.
[00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.860]   She fell on the ground,
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.580]   screamed for Satan not to leave her, went into convulsions, and then went limp.
[00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.860]   When she came to,
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:22.460]   she didn't have any idea what had happened. She was willing to take the Bible and read Romans 8 and pray with us.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:25.500]   So if you tell Tom and me
[00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.740]   that
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.740]   battle with Satan in song
[00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.380]   is a kind of
[00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.380]   pious pill,
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:37.660]   we'll say for us that night it felt like life and death.
[00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:43.580]   And it has ever since had that quality about it. It ought to have that quality about it in the church.
[00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.500]   I believe that when God moves us to sing from the
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:52.380]   from the Holy Spirit, Satan is frustrated in our midst.
[00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:56.780]   But 10 minutes of song at the beginning of a time of prayer
[00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.800]   banishes Satan.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.820]   It has great
[00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.180]   power.
[00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.380]   Don't let Satan deceive you out of that
[00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.180]   power or privilege by saying,
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.140]   "I can't sing."
[00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.660]   Some of you are thinking that right now. "I can't sing." That's not true.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.980]   You can sing. Everybody in this room can sing. Not everybody can sing well.
[00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:26.380]   And not everybody can lead. And not everybody can perform. And not everybody can stay on the notes. Everybody can sing.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.220]   If you've got a four-year-old and they come home from Sunday school
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:32.140]   and
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.180]   they say, "Got a song. Can I sing you a song, Daddy?"
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.660]   Sure. And what comes out of their mouth is three songs, three tunes, and four sets of lyrics.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:45.980]   All jumbled up. And they stop.
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:51.180]   What do you feel like? You know what you feel like?
[00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:54.460]   There's a song in my son's heart.
[00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.580]   That's all you feel. And if somebody comes along and says, "That's a lousy song,"
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.580]   you would do just what God did to Moab.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.940]   You'd flatten them.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.900]   Or you'd shake the jail.
[00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.900]   You see, when God hears his children sing,
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:17.180]   he looks around and says, "Where's an enemy?"
[00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:22.700]   You don't have to worry about whether you can sing or not.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.620]   If you're a daddy and you've ever heard a four-year-old sing,
[00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:29.820]   you'll sing.
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.320]   That clip was taken from John Piper's sermon on 2 Chronicles 20:1-25,
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.280]   titled, "Ambushing Satan with Song," preached on January 20, 1985.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:46.880]   The whole message, a classic, is available in the sermon archive right now, free of charge at DesiringGod.org.
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.020]   This is a clip I found while just listening to Pastor John's sermons.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:54.860]   And if you have a favorite sermon clip of Pastor John's that you found, send it to me.
[00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:55.580]   I'd love to hear it.
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:59.980]   Give me the title of the sermon and the timestamps from the audio of when the clip begins and ends.
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:01.420]   Tell me why it impacted you.
[00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:08.080]   Give me your name and the closest city to you and email me all of that information at AskPastorJohn@DesiringGod.org.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.260]   And put the word "clip" in the subject line, if you would, please.
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:18.060]   What's not uncommon to hear that people listen and read Pastor John's content as a shortcut and a
[00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:20.220]   replacement for
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:24.220]   their own personal Bible study. And that is a big
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:31.280]   no-no. Pastor John himself will explain why next time on Friday. I'm your host Tony Reinke. I'll see you then.
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.840]   You
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:36.400]   You
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:46.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
