[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Intro music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Tomorrow is July 4th, Independence Day here in the United States.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   A big day of celebration for us here. Every year it raises
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   questions for Christians about nationalism and what's a healthy level of patriotism.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   Matt, a podcast listener, writes in to ask this.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   "Pastor John, hello. Obviously as Christians we are to live as strangers,
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   exiles, aliens, and pilgrims on this earth. Is there an
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   appropriate place in the Christian life to be patriotic? If so,
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   what is it, and at what point does our patriotism go
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   too far?" Pastor John, what would you say to Matt?
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Yes, I think there is, and I think it's
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   right, or at least it can be right and good. It is
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   true, and we need to stress it at the beginning, maybe stress it
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   at the end. We are pilgrims here. We are exiles,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   refugees, sojourners. Peter says, "Beloved,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I urge you as sojourners and exiles, abstain
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   from the passions of the flesh that wage war against your soul."
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   Paul says in Philippians 3.20, "Our citizenship is
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   in heaven." That's number one. That's foundational.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   That's relativizing to all human allegiances. So the
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   question is framed rightly. We are citizens of heaven. We are
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   sojourners and pilgrims on the earth, but that's owing
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   to the fact that the world is fallen, not the fact that
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   the world is created. We are going to spend eternity
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   in a created world.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   In fact, this created world, renewed and cleansed.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   But Satan won't be the god
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   of that world anymore, like the New Testament says he is now.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   That's what makes us feel so alien here, is that the
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   god of this world is Satan. He holds
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   such extensive sway. The world is
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   permeated with sin. It makes us feel like we're not
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   at home, and we're not in a very real sense while
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   that kind of sinfulness permeates the world. We are
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   just aching to be done with sin,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   mainly our sin, not just the grossness and godlessness
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   that we see in the world. We long to be
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   holy and to be in the presence of holiness
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   himself. So when I say we are aliens
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   and exiles and sojourners and pilgrims, I don't mean that
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   the earth itself or everything in it is
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   despised. I mean that the structures we
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   find ourselves in, this rebellious body of
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   John Piper, family, work, education,
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   entertainment, politics, media, even church, all of it,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   are so permeated with sin that
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   we long for something new and clean and pure
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and holy and Christ-exalting.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   However, God means for us to be
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   enmeshed in this world. We're not of the
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   world, Jesus says in John 17, 16,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   but we are in the world, and we are supposed
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   to be in it. I just read in my devotions yesterday,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   2 Corinthians 10, 3, "Though we walk
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   in the flesh, we are not waging war
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   according to the flesh." That's just another way of saying
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   "in the world" but not "of the world." We may be in a city,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   a state, a country, and if I ask
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   what is patriotism in this enmeshment,
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   my answer is that patriotism is a kind of
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   love for Fatherland, and I mean Fatherland in a very general
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   sense. It could be a city, Minneapolis, or it could be a state,
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Minnesota, could be a country, U.S., Brazil,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   China, Nigeria, a tribe,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Ojibwe, Navajo, Fulani, Kachin,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   and that love for these enmeshments,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   these belongings, is different from
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   the general love that Christians have for everybody
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   or for the whole earth. And the reason I think it's good
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   to have special affections for these particular
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   attachments is that the Bible seems to point
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   in that direction in several ways. For example, Paul says in Galatians 6:10,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   "As we have opportunity, let us do good to
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   everyone and especially, especially to those who
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   are of the household of faith." So it's as though there is
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   this specialness about those who are close
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   to you and like you. There is a kind of affection
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   for them that's different. Or consider 1 Timothy 5, 8,
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   "If anyone does not provide for his
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   relatives and especially the members of his
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   household, he has denied the faith." So it seems like
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   it's right not just to have a
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   general love spread over the whole world for people,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   as if everybody will receive from us exactly the
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   same affections, but rather there is an especially,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   a peculiarity about the affections
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   for certain affinity groups. Not at the expense
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   of others, but even for the sake of others.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Paul seems to point in this direction in Romans 9, 3 when he says,
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   "I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   according to the flesh." What's that? There's something
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   about this kinship according to the flesh. He means Jewishness.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   It's being bound together in a family
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   way or a cultural way with a group that makes him have a
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   special affection and longing for them that's different
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   from the love he has for everybody. And as I was thinking
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   about this, C.S. Lewis gave me some help
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   because in his book, The Four Loves, which by the way, Tony,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   45 minutes ago, I realized I've got
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   this book on file in my computer in the voice
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   of C.S. Lewis himself. So I went there and listened to this section about
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   45 minutes ago. So I've got Lewis talking in my mind
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   about Storge. Okay, I wasn't going to say that, but I did that this morning.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I'm so excited that I've been listening to C.S. Lewis. Well, now you've got to tell us, is that an audiobook?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Yes. It's The Four Loves. You can get it
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   somewhere. I got it. I got it years ago, but you can hear
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Lewis's own voice. Well, anyway, he wrote this book, The Four Loves,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   and he distinguishes philos, friendship, eros,
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   sex, agape, the love of God, and the one that I
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   think is relevant right here, namely Storge. Now, Storge
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   is a kind of affection. It's what you feel for a
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   pair of slippers that your wife thinks you should
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   have thrown away a long time ago, but they fit
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   just right. They feel just right. Storge
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   is the affection that a child feels for an old raggedy doll that
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   everybody looks at and says, "That's just good for nothing." Well, no, it's
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   really good for that child. That child has a very special affection
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   for that doll. Or I can think of a sweater. I just
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   tossed a 10-year-old sweater away the other day, and I took a picture of it, sent it to my
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   kids, and I put a text on it, "Rest in peace." I should have said
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   "Rest in pieces," because it was so torn up.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   And Noelle was saying, "You don't need to wear that anymore." I said, "Well, I just
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   like it." So it's the sweater. It's the tree where you carved
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   your initials as a couple at Wheaton
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   College, and they took that tree down, the rascals, just a few
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   years ago. You love to be near that
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   tree. That tree means more than other trees.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Or it's the lagoon where Noelle and I were engaged. That's a real
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   special place that we can go back to. So there is a kind
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   of affection for a tree, a sweater, a city,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   a language, a culture, a fatherland.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Why? Because it fits you. When you leave
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   it, get on a plane to go to another country, there may be excitement
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   and challenge and stimulation, and you get real
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   worked up with new cultures. Here they come. And they might even
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   be superior in some ways to your own
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   culture. In other words, we're not talking here, when we talk
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   about special love for your own family or
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   ethnicity or city or state or fatherland, we're not talking
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   about superiority and inferiority here any more than your
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   love for your husband or your wife is because they're the smartest or
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   the handsomest person in the world. That's not what's going on here. That's not the
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   point in this special kind of affection that we're talking
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   about. The point is, when you come home from those travels,
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   even from so-called superior cultures,
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   the fatherland fits, like the slippers
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   fit or the sweater or the smells or the sound. It's just
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   full of good associations, like the tree where
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   you carved your initial. So it seems to me that
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   this is good and that the goodness is implied in the Bible
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   and God created us to be in skin,
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   in languages, in families, in cultures. He doesn't mean
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   for us to despise our skin or our language or our culture,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   but rather to be at home in them
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and to feel good about them. Of course, we have to add
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   up to a point. They're all sinful, and so we
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   never give them absolute allegiance. We never cease
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   to be exiles and sojourners, even in our families and tribes
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   and ethnicities, indeed in our own bodies.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Now, Romans 13 seems to me to
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   take this point of the special affection
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   to the level of countries. When it says that
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   a state has the right to use the sword to maintain
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   order and to defend itself against aggression,
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   when it says that, it seems to me to be saying, in effect, that this
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   fatherland has the right to exist. And if it has
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   the right to exist, it would seem that the people who
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   live there can be glad that it exists.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   They can say, "We're glad that this fatherland exists.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   We like it here." They can say that without putting down
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   other nations or cultures. You don't have to be
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   negative about another country because you love
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   your own. That's a lesson, by the way, we need to learn today at
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   every level. In fact, I would argue that
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   in globally connected nations like we have
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   today, this interdependent world of ours,
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   you probably will fail to love your country
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   if you fail to work for the good of other countries
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   as well. We're just too interdependent for that
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   not to be true. Now, let me end on this note, for Christians especially.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Never feel, never feel
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   more attached to your fatherland or your
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   tribe or your family or your ethnicity
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   than you do to the people of Christ.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Everyone who is in Christ is more closely
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   and permanently united to others in Christ
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   no matter the other associations than
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   we are to our nearest fellow citizen or party
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   member or brother or sister or spouse. Oh, how many
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   horrible indignities, injustices,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   contradictions of Christianity have been perpetrated because believers
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   have failed to realize this. We are more
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   bound together with other believers no matter
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   their ethnicity or their political alignments or their nationality
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   than we are to anybody in our own fatherland.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   In the end, Christ has relativized
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   all human allegiances, all human
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   loves. Keeping Christ supreme in our affections
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   makes all our lesser loves better
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   not worse. Under his flag,
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   it is right to be thankful to God that we have a fatherland,
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   a tribe, a family, an old pair of slippers that just
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   fit right. That's a great word. Yeah, my wife
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   doesn't ask permission. She just takes the old clothes. Oh, no, no.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And they disappear. Oh, that would be a major crisis. Well, see, I wouldn't
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   get rid of them. That's the problem. They just have to disappear.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Shout out to my wife who listens. She's a minimalist who keeps our closet beautifully organized
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   and simplified. Thank you, honey, for listening. And if you, like my wife, want
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   new episodes of this podcast, deliver to your phone as soon as they are released.

[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   We return on Monday with a really interesting Bible question. The
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   ESV's Old Testament has about 103 mentions of atone
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   or atonement, but the ESV's New Testament doesn't contain
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   any mention of atone or atonement, not one.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   So where'd the atonement go in the ESV's New Testament?
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It's a great question, and we will find out on Monday. I'm Tony Rehnke.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Thanks for listening. Have a wonderful Independence Day celebration if you're in the States.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   And we will see you back here then. Thanks for listening.
