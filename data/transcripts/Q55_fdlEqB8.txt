[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.400]   and some of the conflicts of interest that exist

[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.720]   in the financial services industry.
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.620]   He is the head of planning strategy
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.840]   at Buckingham Wealth Partners,

[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.400]   Our second guest is Dr. Nicole Boyson.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.760]   She is the chair of the finance department
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.160]   of Northeastern University's
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.660]   D.R. Moore McKim School of Business.

[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.720]   I'm pleased to have with us today Michael Kitsis.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.560]   Welcome to the Bogleheads on Investing Podcast, Michael.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.400]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:43.220]   Great to be here.
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.360]   I appreciate the opportunity.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.560]   It's a real pleasure to have you
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.720]   because you are the leader out there
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.400]   in the advisor community, bar none.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.320]   You're the voice, so to speak,
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.680]   and rightly so on your blog,
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.040]   on Nerd's Eye View,
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.920]   and on your website, kitsis.com,
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.720]   for mostly advisors in the advisor community.
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.540]   I know we have a good number of Bogleheads
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.280]   that come over and read as well.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.680]   We appreciate some of it circulates there
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.200]   in hopefully helpful ways
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.960]   for everybody who's reading it for themselves.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.940]   The information you put out there,
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.200]   everything from taxes to insurance
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.320]   to trust work.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.720]   I mean, certainly very, very helpful
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.400]   to individual investors
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:24.680]   and very helpful to advisors.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.560]   I mean, I've learned a lot by reading your information
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.800]   and watching you on videos
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.320]   and also in person at various conferences.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.160]   And by the way,
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.920]   how many conferences are you doing a year now?
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.280]   Oh man, well, historically it was 50 to 70 events
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.240]   that I was out for in person.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.080]   I'm still doing about that many,
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.640]   but not everything's in person on the road anymore.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:49.280]   It's more of an even split between in-person
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.880]   and lots of webinars and virtual broadcasts and live streams
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.800]   'cause that seems to be our post-pandemic era.
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.400]   Sure, well, that's fantastic.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.080]   Okay, so let's get first into,
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.160]   how did Michael Kitsis become michaelkitsis.com,
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.040]   Nerd's Eye View?
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.120]   Tell us the story of your life.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.840]   Yeah, the story of my life.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.840]   So I was born and raised in the Washington DC area.
[00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.200]   I was the son of two computer scientists.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.720]   So like nerding out on computers and technical stuff
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.840]   from a very early age.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.080]   I was hacking my own computer games on my Commodore 64
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.680]   when I was six years old.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.520]   Probably kind of dates me a little.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.760]   I went to college in the sort of classic
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.640]   New England liberal arts experience.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.520]   Like, you know, we teach you to critically think,
[00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:35.440]   but prepare you for nothing in particular.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   Fruitful adults.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.280]   You know, I went to college as a psychology major,
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.120]   theater minor, pre-med student.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.360]   And the only thing I figured out by the end of college
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.200]   that I did not wanna do psychology, theater, or medicine.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.680]   So I was getting ready to graduate and needed a job
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.940]   and landed somewhat randomly
[00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.440]   in the financial services industry.
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:56.600]   Well, before we get to that,
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.880]   I wanna circle back to college,
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.880]   because I remember you and I were at a conference together
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.480]   one time and we were walking around
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.900]   and we came across this big hall
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:06.640]   and they were doing ballroom dancing.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:07.480]   Yes.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.160]   And you turned to me and you said,
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.920]   "That was me, I did that in college."
[00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:14.240]   Yes, yeah, so I was co-captain
[00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.000]   of the college ballroom dancing society.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.520]   And like, this was way before Dancing With The Stars.
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.160]   Like, this is all the way back in the 1990s.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:26.320]   And yeah, I did a lot of competitive ballroom dancing
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.480]   throughout college.
[00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:29.640]   And then after graduation,
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.840]   took lessons and was hardcore into it.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.880]   And then 10 years later got married
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.880]   and now have been married for 11 years.
[00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.860]   So unfortunately, very little time for it these days.
[00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.800]   Like, life got very busy.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.960]   Obviously, you didn't become
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.700]   a professional ballroom dancer.
[00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.520]   You ended up somehow in the financial services industry.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.120]   So could you tell us, how did that happen?
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.720]   My grandfather, my mother's father passed away
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:54.720]   when she was fairly young.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.560]   And so my grandmother suddenly found herself
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.800]   the young widowed single mother of two young girls
[00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.120]   and needed to provide for them.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.400]   And so all the way back in the 1960s,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.320]   she went and had to get a job.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.680]   And she ended up getting a job as an assistant
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.240]   for a life insurance salesman
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.560]   from the New England Life Insurance Company.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.920]   Did that for many, many years
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.840]   as my mother and my aunt grew up.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.160]   And when my mother got married
[00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.080]   shortly after college to my father,
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.120]   the insurance agent has this moment of,
[00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.720]   what do you give your secretary's daughter
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.820]   when she's getting married?
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.080]   A life insurance policy,
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.640]   'cause he was a life insurance salesman.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.060]   So he gives my father a life insurance policy.
[00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.000]   Fast forward 20 plus years,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.920]   like my grandmother is retired.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.280]   This life insurance agent has retired.
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.880]   I am now like getting ready to graduate from college.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.640]   And my father gets a phone call
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.080]   from a New England life insurance agent
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.120]   that says, Mr. Kitsis,
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.840]   like you have a life insurance policy with us.
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:53.040]   You've had it for many, many years.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.240]   It looks like no one's been out to see you
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:57.360]   in a long, long time 'cause the original agent has retired.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:59.520]   Someone should come out and review the policy.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.120]   So the agent comes out and reviews the policy.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.480]   And then at the end of the meeting,
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.160]   the insurance agent kind of takes off
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.840]   his insurance agent hat and puts on his sales manager hat
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   'cause he was also the recruiter for the local office.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.040]   And said, by the way,
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.080]   now that we reviewed the policy,
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.280]   like I just wanted to ask,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:14.840]   do you know anybody who might be wanting
[00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.040]   to come into the industry because our company's hiring?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.900]   My father said, funny thing.
[00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.440]   My son's about to graduate from college.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.040]   He has no idea what he wants to do with his life.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:24.360]   I come home on spring vacation.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:25.680]   My father's like, great news.
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:27.680]   I got you an interview 'cause you need to figure out
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.000]   what you're gonna do when you're graduating
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.680]   'cause you're not coming back here.
[00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.400]   And so I interviewed for the insurance company,
[00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.740]   got the job.
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:36.400]   As I learned many years later,
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.940]   was probably less my wonderful potential
[00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:41.700]   as a strong student and willing to work hard
[00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.860]   and a lot more of the zip code that my parents lived in.
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:47.280]   They were hoping that my parents
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:48.940]   were from a fairly affluent neighborhood
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.640]   where I would know people with money
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.640]   to whom I could sell life insurance.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.100]   Unfortunately for them, what they didn't realize
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:58.000]   was my parents moved to that neighborhood in the '70s
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.600]   before there was any money in that neighborhood.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.580]   I did not have any natural market
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.360]   of like my parents, friends, and family
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.040]   that I was supposed to sell life insurance to,
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.920]   which made that very challenging.
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.800]   Well, let me read something that you put on your website
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.760]   about that job, which I found striking.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.920]   And it goes right into
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.740]   what we're gonna be talking about today.
[00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.520]   You wrote, "When I started my career
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:21.160]   "as a financial advisor more than 30 years ago,
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.940]   "I couldn't believe the company that hired me
[00:08:23.940 --> 00:08:28.180]   "will let me put financial advisor on my business card.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.160]   "The reality was I didn't actually know anything
[00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.600]   "about giving financial advice or economics or money."
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.920]   I was a psych major, theater minor.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.340]   But this is the way it was.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.280]   And in many cases, I mean, I guess I'll ask you this now.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.180]   I mean, it still is that way.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:47.160]   It still is for a lot of the industry.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.760]   Right, like at the end of the day,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:51.040]   they put financial advisor on my business card.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:53.360]   My job was not to give advice, which frankly was good
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:54.880]   'cause I didn't know anything about money.
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:55.800]   I didn't go to school for that.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:57.160]   I didn't learn anything.
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:58.880]   My training was how to sell the company's
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.400]   variable universal life policy,
[00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.180]   'cause that was the kind of the big thing
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:04.040]   back in the late 1990s.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.320]   Like it was sales training
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.840]   because I wasn't a financial advisor.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.400]   I was an insurance salesperson.
[00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.200]   It was a nice euphemism on my business card
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:12.920]   to say financial advisor, but I was a salesperson.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.080]   I was literally paid on commission
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.640]   to sell the insurance policies.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.140]   And like that distinction,
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.520]   the term financial advisor is used very, very widely.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.160]   Some people who use it literally
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:25.320]   are in the business of advice.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.720]   Like they get paid for advice
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.400]   and they charge fees for advice and they receive advice.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:33.840]   But we also still continue to hire people in the industry.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:35.600]   We call them financial advisors,
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.200]   but they're salespeople.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.240]   - That used to be 90% of the industry.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:43.360]   90% of the industry was you're being hired to sell.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.820]   I mean, when I came out of the military,
[00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.000]   I didn't know anything either.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.720]   They hired me because I might be able to recruit veterans.
[00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.420]   - Yep, natural market, yes.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.760]   - And I was a pilot, so go after the pilots.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.960]   That's why they recruited me.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:56.400]   And I thought I was being recruited
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:58.400]   because I was financially savvy.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.040]   I mean, I did run an antiques business
[00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.360]   when I was in college, so it must be sort of related.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.340]   - I thought the same thing.
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:05.480]   Like I had good grades.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:06.320]   I was a hard worker.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.040]   I was like, no, I was hired for the zip code
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.080]   that my parents lived in.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:10.600]   - But at least to your credit,
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.840]   you realized that and you began on this other career.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.160]   - Yeah, I mean, it didn't take long for me,
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:18.200]   like literally into the first year,
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.520]   sitting with the prospect in their home,
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:22.440]   across them on their kitchen table,
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:24.640]   talking to him about quote financial advice,
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:25.840]   which was basically selling him
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.680]   a variable universal life policy.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.800]   He had accumulated about $300,000,
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.440]   pretty darn good amount of money 20 plus years ago.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.800]   He was already well into his fifties.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:36.120]   He wanted to retire in 10 years.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:38.040]   He was trying to figure out how to get from here to there.
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.200]   And you know, it was like, this is what I've got.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:42.100]   Like, what do I do?
[00:10:42.100 --> 00:10:44.000]   What do I do for the next 10 years
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.600]   to get from here to there so I can retire?
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.440]   'Cause I'm kind of, you know,
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.400]   he was in a practice that was burning him out.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:53.880]   And I remember sitting across from him and was like,
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.960]   I have no fricking idea what you should do.
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.800]   I'm a psych major theater minor
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.200]   who just got trained in one type of product
[00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:02.360]   that I'm supposed to sell you
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.240]   because it's literally supposed to be the answer
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.680]   to every single person I sit across from.
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.800]   And I'm just supposed to do that for enough people
[00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:12.120]   that eventually some of them say yes inevitably.
[00:11:12.120 --> 00:11:13.560]   And like, I mean, just we're taught in the industry,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.120]   like it's a quote game of numbers.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:17.160]   If you just pitch your thing to enough people,
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.800]   eventually some of them will say yes
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:20.320]   and you'll get to a sale.
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.160]   And just like this crisis moment for me of,
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:25.920]   my God, like this is literally
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.560]   his financial life on the line.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:30.200]   And I have no fricking idea what I'm talking about.
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.440]   And I probably should.
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.840]   And so that took me down.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:36.600]   Now, granted, I perhaps went a little overkill on it.
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.540]   Like I got my CFP certification
[00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:40.320]   and then a master's degree in financial planning
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.960]   and then five more professional designations
[00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.640]   than the second master's degree in taxation.
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:46.680]   So granted, I maybe went like a little bit off the deep end
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.240]   in that dynamic once I went down that path.
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:54.360]   But just, I mean, to me, like, look, financial advice is,
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.880]   I really view as a sacred duty.
[00:11:56.880 --> 00:11:58.760]   And like, I'm not trying to be melodramatic.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.360]   Like literally people's lives can be destroyed
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.960]   by finances, money problems are the number one cause
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.120]   of divorce and marital strife.
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.280]   It's a very common issue tied to suicide.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:12.880]   Just in general, people with more access to wealth
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:14.680]   tend to have better life expectancies
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:17.160]   and better health outcomes because of the accessibility
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.520]   that wealth creates to medical care.
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:22.640]   Like people's lives and livelihood
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.240]   are literally on the line.
[00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:27.120]   Like you can't screw around with that.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:29.760]   - You have a conscience, that's the problem.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.520]   - Yes, and for whatever it's worth,
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.000]   I did not get the sale that day.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.160]   He didn't buy.
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:38.400]   - Let's start out the conversation
[00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:43.400]   with the evolution of the advisor industry.
[00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:47.840]   You've given talks on this, I've listened to your talks.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.760]   I think they're very good.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.880]   And you go through four phases.
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:53.160]   You think we're in the fourth phase now.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.960]   So why don't you go ahead and tell us
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.800]   how you see the evolution of the industry.
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.400]   And by the way, I've been in it for 35 years.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.360]   So I lived the evolution.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.840]   - Yeah, you've lived most of these transitions.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:06.040]   - Anyway, I might throw in my two cents as we go along.
[00:13:06.040 --> 00:13:07.760]   Go ahead and start from the beginning.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.400]   - Yeah, so I mean like the beginning of financial advisors
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.880]   for most of us, like just, it was pure product sales.
[00:13:13.880 --> 00:13:18.520]   We sold insurance, we sold annuities, we sold stocks, right?
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.840]   Most of the roots of the industry
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.160]   are essentially like it's the stock broker.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.640]   It's the Charlie Sheen, Wall Street, 1980s model,
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:30.320]   or Wolf of Wall Street model of stock brokering.
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.080]   And I mean, it paid well.
[00:13:32.080 --> 00:13:34.160]   If you go all the way back to even to the 1970s,
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.880]   like for big clients,
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:40.680]   we could get paid $200 a trade in 1975 dollars
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:43.560]   just to sell a stock to an individual client, right?
[00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:44.840]   That's like, I don't even know what the number is,
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:47.200]   probably a thousand plus dollars today,
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.160]   like as a ticket charge.
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:50.720]   - That was the fixed commission rate.
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.760]   - That was the fixed commission on a big trade.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.600]   It was scaled to the size of the trade.
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.000]   That would be a big one, but-
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.240]   - Every firm had the same rate.
[00:13:57.240 --> 00:13:59.360]   - Every firm had the same rate by law
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.040]   because FINRA back then,
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.920]   the National Association of Securities Dealers,
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.080]   had fixed it at a set rate.
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.960]   It was like part of the aftermath of the Great Depression.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:09.680]   There was a whole bunch of commission gouging
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.080]   in like the boom and the bust of the '20s and the '30s.
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:13.320]   Nobody paid attention to what they were paying
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.120]   when stocks were going to the moon in 1929.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.640]   And then no one paid attention to what they were paying
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.000]   when stocks were going to the ground in 1931.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:20.800]   So there was a bunch of commission gouging
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:23.120]   when people were just desperate to buy and sell.
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:25.520]   And the regulatory response back in the '30s was,
[00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.760]   well, we're just gonna set all the trading commissions
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.320]   at a fixed rate that every brokerage firm charges.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.920]   Good news, got rid of all the gouging.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:33.840]   Bad news, obliterated all the innovation
[00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:35.320]   'cause no one reinvested
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:36.760]   into making brokerage more efficient
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.800]   'cause you were legally barred from competing on price.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.360]   So by the 1970s, we decide this regulatory structure
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:45.240]   has run its course.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:46.440]   It's time to let it go.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:49.040]   We deregulate the stock trading commissions.
[00:14:49.040 --> 00:14:52.880]   And a startup in Northern California,
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.280]   right outside of Silicon Valley says,
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:56.480]   hey, it's the 1970s.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.280]   These things are coming out called computers.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.960]   I think we could use computers
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.560]   to replace financial advisors.
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:04.160]   Like, why are we paying all these stock brokers
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.080]   so much money?
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.440]   A computer could do this.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:07.920]   - Discount brokerage firm.
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.880]   - And a lot of people are familiar with the company
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.320]   'cause the guy that said this was named Chuck Schwab.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.760]   And Schwab was founded the month
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   after the deregulation of trading commissions,
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.760]   basically to create, you know, call it robots of the era,
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:20.920]   to eliminate human financial advisors.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.000]   As it turned out, like, it didn't kill advisors.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.280]   We're still here.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   But it did obliterate stock trading commissions.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:28.320]   Like, you know, we went from $200 a trade
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:30.400]   down to $20 a trade by the 1990s.
[00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.760]   Obviously, over the past 20 years,
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.920]   we took it from 20 all the way down to zero.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:37.040]   So it did kill the stock brokering model
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.280]   and it forced us all to shift.
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.920]   And so as financial advisors,
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:41.320]   we shifted into a new environment.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.640]   We said, well, you know, anybody can sell you a stock.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:47.280]   I will find for you a great stock picker.
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.960]   Like, we went in the mutual fund business and said,
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:51.320]   well, I'll get you mutual funds with great managers.
[00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.200]   And, you know, huge growth cycle.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.440]   The mutual fund industry alone in the 1990s
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:57.160]   grew from less than half a trillion dollars
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:58.400]   to five trillion dollars.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.120]   Like, it was a 10X growth cycle.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   If you think the ETF shift has been big in the past 10 years,
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:05.840]   the mutual fund shift in the 1990s was actually bigger
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.320]   when you adjust for the market size at the time.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.960]   All driven by technology was obliterating
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.440]   the financial advisor business model.
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:14.080]   And so we were all reinventing ourselves
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:16.120]   from stockbrokers peddling stocks
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.480]   into mutual fund salespeople.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:18.880]   Still on the salesperson side.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.960]   There was actually something else going on too.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.440]   It was the wrap fee account.
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.280]   Yep.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:25.920]   And this was started in the 1980s
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.760]   and really took off in the early 1990s.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:33.840]   In fact, Shearson Lehman, which became Smith Barney,
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.680]   started a whole division that did this.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.760]   CFAs, PhDs all get together and they're gonna go out
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:40.720]   and they're gonna pick the managers
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:43.040]   that are gonna outperform the institutional managers.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:45.920]   And we are going to let you,
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.000]   who might have a couple of hundred thousand dollars,
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.040]   hire these very top-notch managers
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:54.120]   and charge you only 3% wrap fee.
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:55.520]   Very, very generous of them.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.360]   And who cares?
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.400]   Like stocks were making 14% a year back then.
[00:16:58.400 --> 00:17:01.000]   It's like, who cares if the house gets a 3% vague?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:03.280]   You're making only, you're making 11% net.
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:04.280]   It's still great.
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.720]   So phase two is this mutual fund or manage money,
[00:17:08.720 --> 00:17:11.160]   separate account management/mutual fund concept.
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.800]   And then what happened after that?
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:14.360]   The internet showed up.
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:16.320]   We like all this like discount brokerage
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:18.080]   becomes online brokerage.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.040]   E-Trade runs all of their wonderful commercials.
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.680]   Like, you know, buying mutual funds is so easy.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:22.520]   A baby can do it.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.920]   Or, and they have the picture of the baby day trading stocks
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.400]   and mutual funds from the crib.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.560]   All of a sudden, like you could buy mutual funds
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:30.840]   and sort of more practically like Schwab again,
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.400]   being one of the leaders in this space,
[00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:34.560]   launched their one source program
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:36.720]   where you could get almost any mutual fund
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:39.640]   in a giant supermarket with no commission.
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:41.680]   I mean, we would do them as no load funds,
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.840]   but the load is the commission that the advisor
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.520]   or mutual fund salesperson gets.
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:49.480]   And so a no load mutual fund marketplace
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.560]   essentially said,
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:52.920]   meant the internet brokerage companies
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.600]   were giving away a hundred percent
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.560]   what advisors did for no commission
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:59.840]   when our money came from commissions,
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:02.120]   which created kind of like the next crisis
[00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:04.200]   of business model for advisors
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.200]   and shifted us to where a lot of us are today,
[00:18:06.200 --> 00:18:08.000]   which was this huge shift
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.520]   into the assets under management model.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:12.920]   So like you, anybody can pick a mutual fund
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:14.080]   on a brokerage platform.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:16.440]   I will create for you a diversified asset,
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:19.800]   asset allocated portfolio of all of it brought together,
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.960]   aligned to your goals and your time horizon
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.920]   and consistent with your tolerance for risk.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.600]   And for this aggregate service
[00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.760]   of everything brought together,
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.440]   I will charge you nearly 1% lower than the 3%
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:33.800]   that that she was gonna charge you for the wrap account.
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.480]   And so you see this sort of explosive growth
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:38.200]   over the past 20 years
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:42.320]   in the rise of assets under management.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.680]   And once you're building assets under management,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:46.760]   we tend to build them with ETFs to the point
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:49.520]   that now you see the entire mutual fund complex
[00:18:49.520 --> 00:18:50.560]   in net decline.
[00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:52.360]   That's kind of the tail end of,
[00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:54.080]   we started shifting away from the model
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.920]   in the late 1990s when the internet showed up,
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:18:57.960]   natural outcome is,
[00:18:57.960 --> 00:18:59.960]   well, now we're mostly in an AUM model
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:04.080]   charging these standalone 1% assets under management fees
[00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:07.340]   and the whole mutual fund sales complexes in net outflow.
[00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:10.360]   - I see the ETF evolution
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.280]   as giving the brokerage industry,
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:19.360]   traditional Merrill Lynch, UBS,
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.720]   Wells Fargo brokers,
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.680]   the ability to do this wrap fee.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:27.000]   In other words, to compete with the independents who left.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.960]   I left the brokerage industry in 1999
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.560]   to go and become one of these advisors.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:37.120]   And the evolution of the ETF
[00:19:37.120 --> 00:19:40.360]   has allowed the wire houses,
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.340]   traditional wire houses to kind of backtrack
[00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:45.680]   and get into that business and compete head on head.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:47.240]   - One, and some of it is just the,
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:51.600]   again, it's part of the evolution of that model itself.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.840]   Just even from the advisor's end,
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:57.120]   as I'm sure more than a few listeners have observed as well,
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.520]   like at some point,
[00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:01.240]   I can just buy an asset allocated mutual fund on my own,
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:03.640]   or I can do this with a handful of Vanguard funds
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:04.760]   and pretty much get this done.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.080]   It's like, why am I paying you, Mr. Advisor?
[00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.680]   So, one version of this goes down the road
[00:20:10.680 --> 00:20:12.360]   of sort of deeper financial planning advice,
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.540]   which we'll probably come back to in a few minutes.
[00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:17.280]   The other version of this is,
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.440]   well, I'm gonna manage your asset allocation
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.880]   more effectively, more proactively.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.380]   And one of the big shifts to me that's happened
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.720]   just over the past 10 years
[00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:28.720]   is a lot of financial advisors
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:33.720]   have essentially become active managers of ETFs.
[00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:36.960]   And that that's become one of the big models in our space.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.360]   So we used to buy the mutual funds
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:42.280]   and say the fund is the manager, I just pick them.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:45.280]   Now we're often building with more passive vehicles,
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.160]   or like the ETF is sort of structurally
[00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.560]   a more passive vehicle,
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:52.720]   but a lot of advisors are actively managing the ETFs
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:54.160]   and not trying to necessarily justify
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.260]   if it's right or wrong.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.080]   Frankly, some of them probably do it okay,
[00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.600]   and a bunch of them probably not so much
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.920]   'cause we have a lot of other things we're doing as well.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:05.080]   But relative to the mutual fund model,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.040]   part of the big shift and focus
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.360]   has been the advisor come and say,
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:10.980]   look, you've got a bunch of mutual funds
[00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:14.480]   with an expense ratio of 2% because you own C shares,
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.640]   which essentially is 1% to the manager
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:18.680]   and 1% to the advisor who sold it to you,
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:20.400]   that's their trail commission.
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:21.760]   And the advisor comes in and says like,
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:23.680]   well, instead of just getting paid 1%
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:25.840]   for the mutual fund company for selling it to you
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:27.720]   on top of their 1%,
[00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.380]   I'll manage your portfolio for you for the same 1%.
[00:21:31.380 --> 00:21:32.460]   But if I'm gonna manage it for you,
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:34.640]   I don't need to give them their 1% on top of mine,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:37.080]   I'm gonna buy it with a whole bunch of ETFs.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:37.920]   And I'm gonna do this
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.440]   for 10 or 20 basis points of ETF costs.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.080]   And so now my all-in cost as an advisor,
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.200]   it's 2% with your mutual fund portfolio,
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.160]   it's 1.2% with mine, my fee plus the ETFs.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:53.920]   I can save you 40% off of your fees,
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:56.400]   not necessarily a cut to us as advisors.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.120]   I mean, it's like that's the reality in the industry.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.460]   I mean, that's why you're seeing so much of this shift
[00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.020]   within the advisor world towards ETFs
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:06.160]   is we're feeding on our own, right?
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.920]   The advisors that wanna build lower cost portfolios
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.400]   are killing the mutual funds themselves
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:17.720]   as a way to bring down costs for our clients.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.520]   I mean, you can look at that a good or bad way.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:22.400]   Obviously, the cynical version is just we come up
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.400]   with a way to defend our 1% and stick it to everybody else.
[00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.760]   But the good version of it is like,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:30.960]   hey, at least we're proactively trying to earn our 1%
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:34.220]   by getting every upstream cost structure
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:36.580]   down as little as we can.
[00:22:36.580 --> 00:22:38.940]   And I do think just when you look structurally
[00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:40.660]   at the declining expense ratios
[00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:41.980]   across the industry right now,
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.740]   like it is that shift in the advisor business model
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:45.780]   that's driving a lot of it.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.740]   When I sold mutual funds,
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.100]   I didn't get paid for finding a lower cost fund,
[00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.340]   I got paid for selling a fund that had a good story
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:55.060]   'cause that's what sold.
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.740]   You know, all the way back to like the Munder NetNet
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:22:58.920]   was the big one when I was getting going.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:01.020]   In this environment, at least for the advisors
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.500]   who are managing portfolios on an AUM basis,
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:05.340]   you know, our incentive as the advisor
[00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:07.900]   is to drive at least every other cost down that we can.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.620]   We'll go through the pressure for ours,
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:12.260]   but at a minimum, we try to force every other cost
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.080]   out of the system.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:15.500]   And because there are so many advisors in the aggregate,
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:18.380]   again, I think that's part of why you see such growth
[00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:21.340]   in ETFs and the whole mutual fund complex and net decline.
[00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.780]   Like we're causing it because the fee model puts you
[00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.140]   on the client side of the table.
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.160]   It's like when I represented the mutual fund company,
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.840]   I had no reason to bring down your costs.
[00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:31.880]   When I represent you,
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:34.120]   I have every reason to bring down your costs
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:36.560]   'cause frankly, that's one of the ways I justify my fee
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.280]   as an AUM advisor.
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.320]   - So along comes Betterment, Wealthfront, Vanguard,
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.540]   and they're gonna do it.
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:45.280]   Same thing that you just talked about, you know,
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.880]   we're going to not only are we gonna drive down costs
[00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:50.760]   by having low cost funds in your portfolio,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:54.540]   but we are gonna charge you a low fee.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:58.260]   And this is another evolution that advisors appear
[00:23:58.260 --> 00:24:00.640]   to be grappling with right now,
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:05.280]   especially the 5,000 pound gorilla, which is Vanguard.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.680]   - Vanguard itself, yes.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:09.120]   - You know, at 30 basis point PAS program,
[00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:10.800]   all of a sudden showing the world that, yeah,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.980]   you can have some advice plus portfolio management.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.480]   And yeah, you don't need to pay 1%, you pay 0.3.
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.480]   And so is this a different phase now?
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.200]   Have we then moved to a different phase of advising
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.060]   that might include separation of asset management
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:27.900]   and advice and could you talk about that?
[00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:30.660]   - Yeah, we are very much in a kind of that
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:31.980]   fourth phase transition, right?
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.060]   So round one was stock brokering
[00:24:34.060 --> 00:24:36.380]   and then computers with discount brokerage killed it.
[00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:37.820]   Round two was the mutual funds
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:40.860]   and the online internet environment killed it.
[00:24:40.860 --> 00:24:42.260]   Round three was, you know,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.600]   building diversified asset allocated portfolios
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:48.040]   and then kind of the rise of robos and the technology
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.420]   as well as just sort of the ability
[00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.400]   to work with people virtually is now disrupting that
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:56.680]   and driving kind of this fourth phase to it.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   The industry likes to talk about the proverbial 1%,
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.240]   but if you really actually look at most advisory firms
[00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:05.020]   and just take how much assets they have in total
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.080]   and how much revenue they bill,
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:10.060]   the average really is closer to about 70 to 80 basis points
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.080]   than it is 1%.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:13.200]   Like there's some discounting
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.840]   and like all handle your kids accounts
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:15.940]   with charging them separately.
[00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:16.800]   And like, there's some money
[00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.760]   where you kind of wanna hold onto the stock
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:19.760]   'cause you've had it a long time.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:20.760]   It's like, I'm not really gonna manage,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.120]   I'm gonna put it in a separate account
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.760]   and like we'll oversee it,
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.140]   but we're not actively trading it.
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:28.420]   So like the true net fee usually is a little bit lower
[00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.220]   than 1%.
[00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.980]   And so what I think you're starting to see emerge
[00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:36.380]   in this dynamic is that the advisor fee
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:38.260]   is essentially getting disaggregated
[00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:41.380]   into sort of three primary components.
[00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:43.860]   What's the raw cost to just build and manage
[00:25:43.860 --> 00:25:45.980]   a diversified asset allocated portfolio?
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:48.060]   And you know, it's not a terribly high number.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.060]   It's not a zero number.
[00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:50.720]   Like just, there is some staff, there is some labor,
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.120]   there's some systems that have to get built,
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:53.860]   but you know, that's kind of converging
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:56.060]   in this 20 to 30 basis point ish.
[00:25:56.060 --> 00:25:59.080]   Yeah, 25 basis points, a good number.
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.800]   You know, the second component that you're seeing
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.720]   is all of, I'll just broadly call it
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.240]   the financial planning advice.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:07.200]   And you know, that varies tremendously
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.420]   by firm and capability
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:10.640]   because we all use the title advisor,
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.920]   but we may not have as much training experience
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.120]   and knowledge in advising and actual advice,
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.400]   but that's everything from retirement planning,
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.660]   advising on insurance, advising on taxes,
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:21.040]   covering estate issues,
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.160]   just getting into cashflow and budgeting
[00:26:23.160 --> 00:26:24.580]   and where's your money going.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:26.120]   Higher level questions about just,
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.840]   is your money actually going towards the things
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.120]   that fulfill you, you know, from a cashflow basis,
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.580]   from how your dollars are invested,
[00:26:32.580 --> 00:26:34.040]   from what you're trying to pursue.
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.840]   Like I don't get that from a robo.
[00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:37.840]   Like that's a human conversation
[00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:40.360]   and an exploration conversation.
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.520]   Let me jump in here and ask you though.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:44.740]   I mean, that could be a conversation you have
[00:26:44.740 --> 00:26:46.640]   with somebody who has 300,000.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:47.960]   It could be a conversation you have
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:49.160]   with somebody who has a million.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.800]   It could be a conversation you have
[00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.960]   somebody with has 2 million,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.480]   somebody who's going to inherit 10 million.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.320]   I mean, it doesn't have anything to do really
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:59.440]   with the size of the portfolio.
[00:26:59.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   So how do you reconcile aligning a fee
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:08.640]   with this advice part of being an advisor?
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:13.600]   - So I'd answer that in, I guess, two primary ways.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.080]   One, I mean, just to acknowledge,
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.760]   like there is a segment of industry
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.560]   that's starting to decouple that a little bit.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.040]   That's doing things like, you know,
[00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.480]   I've got a financial planning fee.
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:25.120]   That's whatever my number is.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.360]   Two grand a year, three grand a year,
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.760]   five grand a year or higher for some firms.
[00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.040]   And then I've got a separate fee
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:31.360]   for just managing your portfolio.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:34.640]   And that's 50 basis points or some,
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:38.400]   at least much lower number relative to the proverbial 1%
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.740]   because like the planning stuff scales in a different way
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:43.360]   than the investment management stuff.
[00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:45.480]   And the fees are decoupling a little.
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:48.260]   So some of that is happening already.
[00:27:48.260 --> 00:27:51.640]   The other answer I would give to it though,
[00:27:51.640 --> 00:27:53.340]   just in practice.
[00:27:53.340 --> 00:27:55.320]   So there were two interesting things to me
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:59.840]   that does happen just as wealth lifts up.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:03.680]   One is complexity does start to rise.
[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:05.020]   It's not a perfect proxy.
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:08.080]   Like, you know, I have had clients with $5 million
[00:28:08.080 --> 00:28:11.300]   whose lives were simpler than people who had $200,000
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:14.020]   because of what's going on in their world.
[00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.940]   But it's actually a pretty decent correlation
[00:28:16.940 --> 00:28:19.180]   of the amount of complexity that's going on
[00:28:19.180 --> 00:28:20.860]   and the amount of wealth overall that we have.
[00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:23.000]   In part, just 'cause more wealth is more choices,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:23.840]   more at risk.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:25.580]   Frankly, like more predators coming after us,
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:26.780]   trying to sell us crappy things
[00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.120]   'cause wearing my advisor hat.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.700]   I spent a lot of time explaining to clients
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:31.420]   why the thing that's getting pitched to them is crappy
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.580]   and not actually good.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.220]   And when you've got more wealth,
[00:28:34.220 --> 00:28:36.940]   a lot more things often can get pitched at you.
[00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.460]   Just the raw stakes of some strategies,
[00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:41.580]   not necessarily the retirement conversation,
[00:28:41.580 --> 00:28:44.180]   but you know, good tax planning strategies
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:46.700]   can just literally have more mathematical impact
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:48.660]   when there's more dollars at stake.
[00:28:48.660 --> 00:28:50.480]   So, you know, part of that,
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.580]   just part of that, like, you know,
[00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:55.220]   why does a $5 million clients get, you know,
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:57.140]   pay 10X to $500,000 client
[00:28:57.140 --> 00:28:58.940]   'cause I'm charging a percentage of a portfolio
[00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:00.620]   that's 10X the size.
[00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:02.780]   Part of that is a proxy for complexity.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:04.780]   Like, there is actually more stuff going on.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:06.580]   If you look at most advisory firms,
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:09.540]   they do more, either they do more stuff
[00:29:09.540 --> 00:29:11.220]   for their more affluent clients,
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.420]   like there is more services rendered,
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:16.440]   or you are getting more senior expertise
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:18.160]   in the planning experience.
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.580]   You know, smaller, smaller, air quotes,
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.740]   smaller clients may work with slightly less knowledgeable
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.780]   and experienced advisors.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.980]   Not to say they're inexperienced,
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:28.600]   but you know, it's kind of like the law firm thing.
[00:29:28.600 --> 00:29:30.460]   Like, you know, if I'm a small law firm client,
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.040]   I get the seven-year associate.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.620]   If I'm a, you know, lot more at stake,
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:37.980]   I get the senior partner who has 37 years of experience
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:40.160]   and like has seen my situation more times
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:41.000]   than I've been alive.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   So there are kind of gradations that come in both.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.420]   Advisors usually have graduated fee schedules.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.620]   So frankly, like 10X the portfolio
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:52.820]   usually isn't 10X the fee.
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:55.180]   It may still be 5X or 7X,
[00:29:55.180 --> 00:29:57.940]   but like it's not perfectly linear.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:00.100]   But more services, more experience,
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.620]   more dollars at stake,
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:03.580]   more consequences for the decision.
[00:30:03.580 --> 00:30:05.160]   You know, there does come a point
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.660]   where if you've got a lot of dollars
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:07.940]   and you're getting advice from someone,
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.500]   you want to make sure they have some,
[00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.880]   something at stake and some skin at the game
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.100]   for the consequences of their advice.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.420]   And so, just for better or worse,
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.380]   like I think that's why you see the model hold up
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:23.840]   and continue to persist as strongly as it has.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.540]   Now, that doesn't speak to a huge segment of people
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.840]   who like, I literally don't need anyone
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:31.300]   to manage my portfolio.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:33.740]   Like I just want to pay for advice.
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:35.820]   And obviously like that whole
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:37.180]   assets under management model,
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.940]   like that just doesn't work.
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.580]   And so there's the growth of like advice only models
[00:30:41.580 --> 00:30:43.540]   and subscription models that are planning based
[00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:46.260]   in a whole lot of other really cool fee innovation
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:48.700]   that's happening there for the whole segment
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:50.340]   that's like, I just want to pay for advice.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:52.580]   I don't need investment help.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:53.940]   But for the folks that do
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.740]   where all of that gets bundled together,
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.780]   like, you know, wealth is not a perfect proxy
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.780]   for complexity in dollars that are at stake,
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:05.340]   but there is a piece of that.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:06.740]   One final question.
[00:31:06.740 --> 00:31:09.460]   The advisor industry continues to evolve.
[00:31:09.460 --> 00:31:12.040]   The asset management industry continues to evolve.
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.660]   Fees continue to go down.
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:14.500]   Yes.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:16.100]   People are trying to figure out the model.
[00:31:16.100 --> 00:31:18.140]   It doesn't seem like any of the old stuff's going away.
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.900]   I mean, there's still commission salespeople.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:21.780]   There's still insurance people selling, you know,
[00:31:21.780 --> 00:31:24.140]   insurance, whole life insurance.
[00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:26.020]   Sometimes I just want to buy a product.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:27.740]   Like, and I mean, sometimes I really do just want
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.500]   to buy a product and want someone to sell it to me.
[00:31:30.500 --> 00:31:33.140]   Like, there is a time, like, I go onto the car lot.
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.780]   Like, I just want someone to sell me the car.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:37.620]   Like, I don't need a holistic automotive family consultant.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:40.500]   Like, just sell me, like, I'm just here to buy a car.
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.300]   Like, sell me a car, tell me about the features
[00:31:42.300 --> 00:31:43.580]   and benefits, help me make a choice,
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.300]   and then take my order.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.220]   So yeah, like, sales isn't going away.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:53.060]   And then also AUM 1% advising
[00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:56.340]   where the advisor's trying to select ETFs that, you know,
[00:31:56.340 --> 00:32:00.540]   adding alpha with tactical asset allocation
[00:32:00.540 --> 00:32:03.620]   or smart beta or whatever, whatever you're doing,
[00:32:03.620 --> 00:32:05.220]   trying to add excess return.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:07.180]   I mean, that's not going away.
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:10.500]   - No, it just, there will always be a segment of people
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:12.420]   who are willing to pay for the opportunity
[00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:13.380]   for outperformance.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:15.420]   You know, lots of debate about whether they're going
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:16.260]   to find it.
[00:32:16.260 --> 00:32:18.860]   And you know, we've both read all of that research,
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:20.980]   but just, right, it's a human nature thing.
[00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:22.780]   There will always be a portion of us that are willing
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:25.140]   to pay for the opportunity to do better.
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:27.460]   - What I'm getting at here is that, you know,
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:29.660]   the old models have not disappeared.
[00:32:29.660 --> 00:32:32.020]   They've just overlaid a new model on top of it,
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.780]   and then a new model on top of that.
[00:32:33.780 --> 00:32:37.140]   And so we've talked about the latest new model.
[00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:38.780]   So my last question to you,
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:42.820]   because we have limited time here, is what's the future?
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.860]   You know, if you look forward, what's the good stuff
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:47.660]   that's happening in the advisor industry?
[00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:49.620]   And then, well, maybe you could start with,
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.780]   what's the bad stuff that you see happening and going on?
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.660]   And then what's the good stuff?
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:57.380]   - Here's the worst of the bad stuff to me right now.
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:59.700]   The worst of the bad stuff is that the whole industry
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:02.020]   has figured out, like, the future is advice.
[00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:06.260]   The future is just more holistic advice because I can,
[00:33:06.260 --> 00:33:08.380]   you know, get a diversified asset-allocated portfolio
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:11.300]   from a platform for 25 or 30 basis points.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:14.260]   So like, we ain't winning on that.
[00:33:14.260 --> 00:33:15.820]   Gotta find somewhere else to add value.
[00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:17.700]   And so the whole industry has figured out
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.300]   the future is advice.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.140]   And our regulators are very, very behind on this
[00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:26.580]   because there is open, just open, broad, unfettered usage
[00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.380]   of titles like financial advisor by people
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.220]   who are literally not in the advice business.
[00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:36.380]   Like, their legal job is to represent their company
[00:33:36.380 --> 00:33:37.900]   to sell a product.
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:39.260]   We see it in the insurance channels.
[00:33:39.260 --> 00:33:41.580]   We see it in the brokerage channels.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:44.380]   This, like, ubiquitous adoption of financial advisor,
[00:33:44.380 --> 00:33:46.860]   financial consultant, and similar-sounding terms
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:50.380]   from people who are just literally, legally a salesperson.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.300]   And usually it says somewhere on their business card,
[00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:54.340]   like, registered representative of such-and-such
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:56.220]   or licensed agent of such-and-such,
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:57.340]   which is a nice way of saying,
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:33:59.260]   I literally don't work for you.
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.180]   I work for that company in the--
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:03.460]   - Securities offered through blah, blah, blah.
[00:34:03.460 --> 00:34:04.300]   - Correct.
[00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:07.060]   The brokerage industry figured out the future is advice
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.020]   before the advice industry figured out
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:10.860]   how to protect their own space.
[00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:13.300]   And so the brokerage industry now is so encroached
[00:34:13.300 --> 00:34:16.460]   into the advice space with the titles, with the marketing.
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:18.020]   You go to most brokerage firms' website
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.740]   and they're talking about the holistic value
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:20.580]   of all the stuff they do
[00:34:20.580 --> 00:34:21.940]   to help your wealth management picture.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:24.100]   And their literal legal purpose
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:27.300]   is to manufacture and distribute product.
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.340]   Like, they are not in the business of advice.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.060]   That just confuses the bejesus
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.420]   out of the consumer landscape
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.900]   in ways that, frankly, the brokerage industry benefits from,
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.980]   which is why they continue to do it.
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:39.980]   - And what do you see as the bright spots?
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:42.780]   - To me, when I look at the bright spots, I see a few.
[00:34:42.780 --> 00:34:45.100]   Like, number one, the big one by far
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:48.580]   is we are in this transition from sales to advice.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:51.980]   And relative to my roots, I know your roots as well,
[00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:54.340]   having sat on the sales side of the table,
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:56.740]   this shift of the industry from sales to advice,
[00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:58.660]   like what it means to me at the end of the day
[00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:00.700]   is I used to sit across from the client
[00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:01.780]   and try to sell them something.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.380]   And now I sit on the client side of the table
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:07.740]   and we look out there at the landscape of what we can do
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:10.220]   that's best and beneficial for them.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.260]   - So there's also a shift
[00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:15.300]   to different non-asset management fee models,
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:18.660]   where hourly or retainer.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:21.260]   Do you see that growing as well?
[00:35:21.260 --> 00:35:24.220]   - The AUM model is basically just a tiny niche model.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:27.460]   It works for a very, very small subsegment of consumers
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:29.900]   who have a material amount of assets,
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:31.900]   liquidity to actually hand it to an advisor,
[00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.780]   so it's not business or real estate
[00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.000]   or a 401(k) plan or something else,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   a willingness to delegate it to an advisor,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.180]   so you don't wanna do the portfolio stuff yourself.
[00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.800]   By the time you take how many people have enough money
[00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.460]   to meet a typical advisor minimum
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:47.100]   or have it liquid and available
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.020]   and not tied up in a 401(k) plan,
[00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.380]   have a mental inclination
[00:35:50.380 --> 00:35:52.020]   towards delegating in the first place,
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:55.180]   you get down to something like 5% to 10% of all households.
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:56.220]   And that's it.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:00.860]   The model does not fit literally 90% of the marketplace.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.660]   And so as I look out,
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:05.420]   this shift is underway towards other fees.
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:07.980]   That's how the majority of consumers
[00:36:07.980 --> 00:36:10.220]   will need to engage advisors
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:12.420]   because you want a service,
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.880]   you pay from your available income.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:15.400]   Like that's how we buy everything else.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   Assets in our management,
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.800]   it's just this really specialized niche model.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:19.960]   It happens to work really well
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:22.320]   for a segment of affluent retirees
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:24.760]   that just wanna delegate so they can enjoy their retirement
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:27.400]   and hire a firm that has the expertise to handle it.
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.440]   But that's not most people.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:31.920]   And so when I look out in the future,
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.240]   like I see the AUM model continuing to grow,
[00:36:35.240 --> 00:36:37.720]   but it will probably be a minority of advisors
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.980]   in the niche in 10 to 15 years.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:41.480]   - Michael, it's been wonderful
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:43.040]   having you on Vogel Heads on Investing.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:44.880]   Thank you for being on the show today.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:45.720]   - Absolutely.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:46.540]   My pleasure.
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:47.380]   Thank you.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:49.440]   - Our second guest is Dr. Nicole Boysen
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.920]   from Northeastern University.
[00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:56.920]   I apologize for the quality of the sound on my end
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:01.720]   because I recorded it in a small room in a library
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:05.840]   while I was on vacation and the acoustics were not very good.
[00:37:05.840 --> 00:37:07.200]   So here we go.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:08.420]   - So with no further ado,
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.960]   let me introduce Dr. Nicole Boysen.
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.560]   Welcome to the Vogel Heads on Investing podcast.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.680]   - Thank you, Rick.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:17.380]   Please feel free to call me Nikki.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:19.760]   - Thank you, Nikki.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:21.280]   I wanted you on the podcast
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:25.600]   because you are one of the rare academics out there
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   who have studied the advisor industry as an academic.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.480]   So you have no skin in this game.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.840]   You don't work for an investment company.
[00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:37.760]   You don't work for a mutual fund company.
[00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:38.940]   You don't work for a brokerage firm.
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.720]   - That is absolutely true.
[00:37:40.720 --> 00:37:42.800]   - Before we get started on your research
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.600]   in the advisor industry,
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.400]   I wanted to hear your background.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:49.600]   How did you get to this point where you are today
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.600]   as the department chair for finance at DMSE?
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:55.920]   - Yeah, so I think the kind of interesting part
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.600]   is I started out as a CPA.
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:00.280]   So my first job out of undergrad
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:02.720]   was in public accounting at KPMG, Pete Marwick,
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:07.720]   and I worked as an auditor, attained my CPA license.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:09.080]   Did that for about three years
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.040]   and realized that being an auditor is a pretty good job,
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.920]   but it's also a little bit tedious.
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:16.040]   And so I went to work for one of my clients,
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:17.400]   was a commercial bank.
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:21.200]   And then I moved on to work for another person
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:24.160]   who does play a role here, who is an investment advisor.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   He was a fiduciary in some sense, but he also was a broker.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.480]   And so I remember learning about that business.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.840]   I was like 25 years old and thinking,
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.880]   this is a really interesting space, right?
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:37.480]   It probably took me about six months
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:39.800]   to understand the fees he was charging,
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.120]   how he was charging them.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:42.480]   And I can say pretty clearly
[00:38:42.480 --> 00:38:45.040]   that I'm not certain his clients fully understood.
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.040]   So I kind of tucked that away, it's like 1996.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.320]   Went on to leave that job,
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.960]   worked back in public accounting,
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.360]   and there I was in the investment advisory space
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:38:56.880]   at Ernst & Young.
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:59.040]   And so kind of little known fact,
[00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:00.240]   but the big accounting firms
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.720]   do have some investment advisory space.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:03.880]   Some of them are registered
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:05.880]   and some of them are more giving advice
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.480]   as part of their tax client's business.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.960]   And so I got to learn a little bit about RIAs
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.760]   and what that looked like.
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.200]   Ultimately turned 30, decided if I was going
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.600]   to go get a PhD, it was a good time to do it.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.200]   So I went off, went to Ohio State, got a PhD,
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.120]   and started immersing myself in academic research.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.560]   And so that was a lot of fun.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.920]   - Okay, so you've been in academics then
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:30.560]   for more than 15 years.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:31.680]   - Yeah, more than 20 years.
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.720]   I started my PhD in 1998 and graduated,
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:38.240]   call it 2002, 2003.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   Went to work for Purdue for a little while,
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.040]   just over a year, and then got my current position
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:45.120]   at Northeastern in 2004.
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:48.360]   And so I've been able to kind of move up the academic ranks,
[00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:50.160]   which has been really wonderful.
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.400]   Started as an assistant professor,
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.680]   get promoted with tenure,
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:56.600]   and then was promoted again to be a full professor.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.800]   Recently took on the department chair role,
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.680]   which is, as academics know, it comes with pros and cons.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.160]   Also co-editing the Financial Analyst Journal,
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:08.800]   which I'm really proud of and excited about.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.840]   And then, yeah, my research has evolved.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:14.000]   I started out being very interested in hedge funds.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.960]   I started my program in 1998.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:18.160]   And for those of you who know about hedge funds,
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.400]   that's when long-term capital management blew up.
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:23.760]   And it was just a really interesting time to study that.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:26.640]   And I was also very fortunate to be kind of young
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.480]   in that area.
[00:40:27.480 --> 00:40:29.760]   I mean, I was young, but the area was young as well.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:33.280]   And so I was able to do a lot of really cool work
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.480]   with new datasets and try to understand
[00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.360]   risk and return characteristics.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:41.560]   Moved on to start focusing on hedge fund activism,
[00:40:41.560 --> 00:40:44.040]   which I would say is probably my key body of work.
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.080]   I worked on that for eight or 10 years.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:50.080]   And then the last few years, decided to just go back,
[00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.320]   think about that investment advisory job
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.320]   that I had back in 1996.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.160]   And I started that project,
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:58.960]   which we'll talk about in detail,
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:01.080]   but I started thinking about that project.
[00:41:01.080 --> 00:41:04.000]   I'm interested broadly in investing
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.400]   and institutional investors in particular.
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:09.120]   And I started looking at mutual fund flows
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:09.960]   for whatever reason.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:13.560]   I was just reading the ICI report,
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:15.200]   'cause that's what academics do.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.720]   And I was reading this report and I noticed
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:20.560]   that funds were money, money was flowing
[00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.480]   into institutional share classes of mutual funds,
[00:41:23.480 --> 00:41:27.520]   which are presumably cheaper and often in my mind,
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:30.760]   what I thought were going to institutional investors
[00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:33.360]   and moving out of the broker sold side.
[00:41:33.360 --> 00:41:35.640]   And having worked for a broker way back when,
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:38.080]   I thought this is probably good for clients
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:41.000]   because if brokers are no longer able,
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.480]   and again, brokers are not evil,
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.880]   but the broker I worked for was pretty opaque
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:46.320]   about the fees he charged.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.600]   And so institutional funds are cheaper and often sold.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:51.720]   Turns out I learned this
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:53.440]   by registered investment advisors.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:55.720]   So I thought this would be good, right?
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.280]   RIAs are fiduciaries,
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:59.160]   they have their client's best interest at heart,
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:01.520]   and they're selling these share classes that are cheaper
[00:42:01.520 --> 00:42:03.800]   and presumably more transparent
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.040]   in the way that they charge fees.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.480]   So my initial premise was, this is a very positive thing,
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:10.440]   but let's look into it a little deeper.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.800]   - So it was the mutual fund flows
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.880]   from the Investment Company Institute Annual Report, ICI,
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:19.400]   as you stated, that got you, I wonder why that is.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:21.080]   I wonder what's going on here.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:22.480]   This is interesting.
[00:42:22.480 --> 00:42:23.960]   Well, you must also then be interested
[00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.720]   in the amount of money flowing into ETFs
[00:42:25.720 --> 00:42:26.640]   and the amount of money flowing
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.120]   into index funds in general.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:28.960]   - Absolutely.
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:31.320]   So there's sort of two things that are going on.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.880]   I mean, the one was that within a particular fund,
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:37.760]   let's pick an active fund, say the MFS Growth Fund,
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.120]   we would see more money flowing
[00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:42.280]   into the institutional share class of that active fund
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.480]   than the broker sold class.
[00:42:43.480 --> 00:42:44.880]   And so I thought, okay,
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.760]   I'm gonna write a paper about distribution.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.800]   And you know, I kind of did.
[00:42:47.800 --> 00:42:49.920]   So who's distributing these share classes?
[00:42:49.920 --> 00:42:51.320]   It's not brokers anymore, right?
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.720]   That was my first thought.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:54.240]   The other piece that you mentioned,
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:56.000]   which does come up in my paper,
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.480]   but is a little more tangential is,
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.440]   what about the composition of the investment?
[00:43:00.440 --> 00:43:04.080]   So is money flowing out of active into passive?
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:06.320]   I knew that was happening being an academic
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.160]   and studying this for years,
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:10.400]   but also trying to think about then
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:13.320]   the distribution side of passive versus active.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.880]   And my paper focuses only on active
[00:43:15.880 --> 00:43:18.320]   because my premise, which I know is true,
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:21.400]   is that most of the folks on the brokerage side
[00:43:21.400 --> 00:43:23.760]   are not selling passive funds
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:26.840]   because it's kind of hard to justify your big commissions
[00:43:26.840 --> 00:43:28.520]   if you're just selling an index fund.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:30.320]   RIA sell passive funds,
[00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:33.720]   but my point was trying to think about the movement
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:35.800]   out of brokerage into institutional
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.720]   within kind of the active space.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:41.040]   - Prior to this, I interviewed Michael Kitsis
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   and I've known Michael for many years,
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:47.600]   and we've both seen the evolution of the advisor industry.
[00:43:47.600 --> 00:43:49.280]   I've been in the business now 35 years
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.240]   and started out as a broker,
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.280]   and then went out, became an RIA on my own
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:43:57.160]   and used index funds mostly from Vanguard
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:58.400]   and a couple of other companies.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.200]   And now I'm just doing advice only.
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.000]   So I've lived through this evolution.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.280]   So one thing we didn't talk about was the number of people
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:09.680]   that are kind of locked into each one of these groups.
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:14.680]   And I was reading the latest FINRA industry snapshot,
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.640]   which you referenced in your paper,
[00:44:18.640 --> 00:44:22.120]   and found out that there are probably
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:25.600]   close to 700,000 people
[00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:30.600]   who are calling themselves advisors based on FINRA.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:35.600]   Now that gets broken down into registered reps
[00:44:35.600 --> 00:44:38.440]   who work for brokerage firms,
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.240]   or in your paper, duly registered.
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:46.080]   And there was about 720,000 of them.
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.320]   And they could be working for big firms
[00:44:49.320 --> 00:44:51.880]   like UBS, Wells Fargo, Merrill Lynch.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.880]   There's also RIAs, registered investment advisors.
[00:44:55.880 --> 00:44:59.680]   And this is a considerably smaller number, about 70,000.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.360]   So basically about 10% of the advisor community
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:05.840]   are registered investment advisors.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:08.960]   And these people who are paid a couple of different ways,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.720]   but the main way is through assets under management.
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:15.080]   And they're managing money, they're managing portfolios,
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.920]   and they're charging a fee based on those assets.
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:19.720]   And so it's assets under management.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.840]   There's also people who are doing retainers
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.360]   and fixed fee and hourly and so forth.
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:27.320]   But that's a very, very small number,
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:31.040]   a very small number, maybe less than 1,000 even.
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:35.320]   And then there are the people that you studied.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:37.800]   And these are dual registered advisors.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:42.800]   And what they are, are both brokers and RIAs.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.080]   And here is where it becomes interesting.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.720]   And here is where you wrote about in your paper,
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.080]   which I wanna get into in detail.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:55.240]   And that is that you're able to analyze
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:45:58.800]   what they were selling as brokers
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:03.800]   and what they were selling or using as fiduciary RIAs.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.440]   And you found some real conflicts of interest.
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.240]   So could you get into the paper a little bit?
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.280]   Absolutely.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:15.920]   And I think you framed the industry really clearly.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.160]   And when I think about the industry,
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.560]   I think about it that way as well.
[00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.840]   And so as I was kind of following up on this,
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.520]   money's flowing into institutional funds
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.800]   and out of broker sold funds,
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.320]   I didn't realize at first that it was actually the same guy.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.440]   And I'm gonna say guy, 'cause it's mostly men,
[00:46:33.440 --> 00:46:35.040]   but it was actually the same guy
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.160]   who was selling both those share classes
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:41.000]   to different clients under the same umbrella of his firm.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   And this is a dual registered advisor
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.400]   who could sell the broker commission side of the mutual fund
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:49.160]   and collect an asset management fee
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.320]   by using the other side as well.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:52.840]   Exactly, exactly.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:55.960]   And again, so if you think about kind of the evolution
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:58.600]   would be, you know, say in the year,
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.600]   let's just go back to say the year 2000,
[00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.400]   just to give it a clear number,
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.200]   someone starts, some guy starts working
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   for say a company called Ameriprise.
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.880]   And at that time Ameriprise
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:10.280]   and all the big dual registered firms,
[00:47:10.280 --> 00:47:13.160]   and to be clear what I mean by dual registered firms
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.200]   is that, as you said, they have both a brokerage arm,
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:18.280]   which is really their legacy business.
[00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:21.280]   And then they've got a registered investment advisory arm,
[00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:23.280]   which is, I would call slightly newer.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.840]   Now, many of these firms have been dual registered
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.120]   for a very long time,
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:29.640]   but the brokerage side of their business was dominant.
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:33.280]   So if you go back to like the year 2000, 2004,
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:35.360]   you'll find about 80% of the revenues
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:37.640]   coming from the brokerage side of a business,
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.200]   let's just pick on Ameriprise,
[00:47:39.200 --> 00:47:41.760]   and 20% coming from the RIA side.
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:45.000]   And over time for various regulatory reasons
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:48.360]   that we can talk about or not, the balance shifted.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:50.680]   And so now what you'd find at Ameriprise
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:53.520]   is probably most new clients walking in the door
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:55.720]   are being put into RIA accounts,
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:57.640]   fewer in brokerage accounts.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:00.040]   And part of the reason is one,
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.480]   the RIA accounts are going to be charging
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.880]   one or 2% per year to the small clients,
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:07.800]   which turns out over the longterm
[00:48:07.800 --> 00:48:10.040]   to be more lucrative for the advisors.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:14.080]   And the other reason is that investors probably are,
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.560]   brokers have gotten a bad name in many cases.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:18.560]   So if I'm at Ameriprise, I can say,
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:20.400]   "Hey, look, I'm a fiduciary.
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.360]   I'm gonna put you in a fiduciary account,
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:24.160]   and I'm gonna charge you an annual fee,
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:26.200]   you know, one or 2%, whatever that is."
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.720]   And so the dual registered advisors,
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:30.560]   it's at the firm level, right?
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:32.400]   The firm has both abilities,
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.280]   but it's also at the advisor level.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.760]   So they've got both, right?
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.640]   It's just a matter of taking another test.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.000]   And so then when a client comes in,
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.520]   they can decide, you know, presumably with the client,
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:42.760]   do you wanna be a brokerage client?
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:44.120]   I'll sell you some load funds,
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.680]   or do you wanna be an RIA client?
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.520]   Where I do have more responsibility for you,
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:50.720]   but I'm gonna charge you an asset-based fee.
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:55.040]   - And by the way, let me get back to the numbers.
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:59.920]   It turns out that about half of the brokers
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.160]   are dual registered.
[00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:05.720]   So over 300,000, in fact, it's been increasing.
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.760]   The interesting point about your paper,
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.040]   which I found fascinating,
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.120]   was that you have this unique lens then
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:17.120]   to analyze investment decisions by these advisors.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:21.240]   And are they doing what's in the best interest
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:22.080]   of their clients,
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:24.240]   given the fact that they could go the commission route,
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:29.240]   or they could go the RIA route and charge AUM fees?
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:32.680]   The question became, are they actually doing
[00:49:32.680 --> 00:49:34.520]   what's in the best interest of their clients?
[00:49:34.520 --> 00:49:36.800]   So I turn it over to you.
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:37.640]   Are they?
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:41.200]   - So the overarching conclusion of my paper is,
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:42.360]   no, they are not.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:45.760]   So I wanna be a little bit clear.
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.840]   It's not obvious to me that they are acting
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.320]   in the best interest of their clients.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.640]   And I'll just list a few reasons why.
[00:49:51.640 --> 00:49:53.840]   One really important reason why
[00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.680]   is that during my sample period,
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:58.720]   these dual registered advisors
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:50:01.480]   within the RIA side of their business
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:03.880]   were also charging commissions.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:05.760]   Now, these commissions were small.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.200]   They came in the form of trail commissions
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.120]   from mutual funds, which for those of the audience here
[00:50:11.120 --> 00:50:13.840]   who's not experts on mutual fund structure,
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:16.680]   this is a typically 25 basis points,
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.800]   so one quarter of 1% fee that the mutual fund family
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:23.720]   is paying to the advisor.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:24.760]   - Oh, is that right?
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.280]   I didn't know they could do that.
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:27.720]   I thought if you were an RIA
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.800]   and you were charging an asset management fee,
[00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.600]   you couldn't get trailing commissions as well,
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.720]   but you're saying you can?
[00:50:33.720 --> 00:50:35.080]   - I thought that for a long time
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.840]   and I had a whole bunch of people tell me you couldn't,
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.600]   but then I read everything I could find
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:41.240]   and the answer is you sure can.
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:45.440]   And in fact, the SEC tried to crack down on this in 2019,
[00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:47.040]   which I'll talk about in a sec.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.840]   But effectively what was happening then is,
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.280]   imagine I'm at Ameriprise and I've got a client come in,
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:54.360]   I'm going to put that client
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:57.080]   in an institutional share class of a mutual fund.
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:50:59.800]   But many of those institutional share classes
[00:50:59.800 --> 00:51:04.160]   are also paying this 25 basis point trail commission.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:07.400]   And it was not at all clear, nor was it happening,
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.800]   that the Ameriprise advisor would say,
[00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.480]   "Okay, I was gonna charge you 1%,
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.160]   "but because I get this trail,
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.240]   "I'm gonna charge you 75 basis points
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.400]   "so that your total fee is 1%."
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:19.800]   Absolutely not.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:22.280]   - So let me ask you about that.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:24.760]   Is that a rule or a law?
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:27.080]   In other words, are they supposed to do that?
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:29.840]   In other words, if they normally charge 1%,
[00:51:29.840 --> 00:51:32.360]   yet they're getting comped from the mutual funds
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:36.040]   that they're putting money into, let's say 0.25,
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:39.000]   are they required by law to bring it down to 0.75?
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.760]   - Nope, and they still aren't.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:42.400]   Reg BI didn't change that.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.480]   They're not required by law.
[00:51:43.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   What they're required to do
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.200]   is tell their clients they're doing it.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:48.480]   And so this was where the trouble came in.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:52.600]   Around 2019, the SEC knew this was going on
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:54.360]   with all the big dual registrants.
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:56.640]   And they said, "Hey, look, dual registrants.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:52:00.280]   "We know you're doing this, and we know it's legal,
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:03.520]   "but the problem is you're not properly disclosing it
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:04.640]   "to your clients."
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.360]   In other words, what their form ADV would say is,
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:12.680]   "We may choose mutual funds that pay us a trail commission
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:15.120]   "in addition to your fees."
[00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:17.280]   But what they really should have written down was,
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:19.760]   "We always do this," or, "We're going to do this,"
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.440]   or, "Most of the time we do this."
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:23.720]   And so the problem, interestingly,
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.480]   as I found throughout the paper over and over,
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.960]   isn't so much that they were doing illegal stuff,
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.280]   although they frequently were.
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.680]   There are tons of disciplinary actions,
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:35.200]   but even the stuff they were doing that was legal,
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:38.320]   and which I would call sort of at least potentially unethical
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:39.840]   and certainly conflicted,
[00:52:39.840 --> 00:52:41.520]   they weren't disclosing it properly.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.600]   So what the SEC did was they had this thing
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.960]   called the Share Class Disclosure Initiative,
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.600]   and they said, "Hey, all you guys who are doing this,
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.900]   "you need to come clean.
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:54.360]   "You need to tell us, the SEC, how much you were doing this,
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.880]   "and you need to reimburse clients because,
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.580]   "not because you were overcharging them,
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.680]   "but because you didn't tell them
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.600]   "you were overcharging them."
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:03.160]   - How many firms are we talking about?
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:05.680]   In your paper, you mentioned Raymond James.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:09.040]   Can I name off a few more, like LPL?
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.160]   - Oh, of course.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:12.440]   Yeah, there are hundreds of dual registrants.
[00:53:12.440 --> 00:53:15.360]   The top 10, which you'll see in my paper,
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:18.440]   manage something like 75, 80% of the assets.
[00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:20.220]   - Okay, and they found this across the board
[00:53:20.220 --> 00:53:22.080]   in all these dual registrants?
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.920]   - 100 dual-registered firms ended up kind of being involved
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.640]   with this disclosure initiative.
[00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:31.520]   And the number is still kind of happening,
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:35.720]   but I believe the initial was something like 97 came forward
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:37.200]   and then three of them, the SEC,
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.800]   had to go after on their own.
[00:53:38.800 --> 00:53:42.160]   And effectively, the deal that the SEC cut was,
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:44.120]   we won't charge you any civil penalties.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:47.120]   What we'll make you do is pay these folks back
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:50.600]   and going forward, improve your disclosures.
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.800]   - Well, it wasn't illegal.
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:52.640]   It's still not illegal.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:53.460]   They're still doing it.
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:55.120]   They just have to disclose it somewhere
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.000]   that they're doing this.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.160]   - What I will say is fascinating about that
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.820]   is my look at some form ABVs post this incident.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.560]   So this got all kind of wrapped up by 2020.
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:09.940]   Most of the firms now are not doing it, right?
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.120]   So now if you read the form ABVs,
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.960]   they realize that the next step for the SEC
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:17.280]   probably would be to make something like this illegal
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:20.000]   or at least much more hard to do.
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:22.880]   And so what most of them are doing is they are,
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:25.320]   they say clearly in their form ABV,
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:27.520]   we're not gonna do this if we can help it.
[00:54:27.520 --> 00:54:28.680]   If we really like the fund
[00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:30.800]   and it has a 25 basis point trailer,
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:34.560]   these are called 12B1 fees also, we will rebate it.
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.320]   And so I will say that this has been
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:38.000]   the most encouraging thing that's come out
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.580]   of this initiative, has nothing to do with my paper.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:42.580]   But what I did see happening
[00:54:42.580 --> 00:54:44.660]   was when the SEC cracked down on this,
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:46.540]   but effectively it did seem to help.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.220]   And so they seem to be doing it less.
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:50.540]   I'm sure it's still happening.
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:52.860]   The handful that I looked at that kind of got busted
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:54.380]   seem to have kind of like
[00:54:54.380 --> 00:54:56.300]   gone the straight and narrow on that.
[00:54:56.300 --> 00:54:57.860]   - Well, let me ask you about the larger firms,
[00:54:57.860 --> 00:55:00.800]   the wire houses, like the Merrill Lynch's,
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:02.580]   Wells Fargo and all that,
[00:55:02.580 --> 00:55:04.060]   they weren't involved in this, were they?
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.420]   - They were, absolutely, all the big firms.
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:09.060]   - Interesting.
[00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:10.740]   I want to go back, I want to circle back
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:12.420]   to the conflicts of interest.
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:16.060]   And I just hit maybe three or four points
[00:55:16.060 --> 00:55:17.220]   on conflicts of interest.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:19.300]   - So the very obvious conflict there
[00:55:19.300 --> 00:55:21.100]   is that you would choose products
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.220]   that paid the highest possible commission.
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:24.660]   So you would look at the menu
[00:55:24.660 --> 00:55:26.400]   of all the mutual funds out there
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.860]   and pick the one that paid the highest possible commission
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:32.060]   without regard to whether that product
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.380]   was good for your client.
[00:55:33.380 --> 00:55:36.060]   And so I think that conflict is very obvious.
[00:55:36.060 --> 00:55:38.260]   You might choose a variable annuity, which again,
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:40.260]   some variable annuities are fine, they have lower fees,
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:43.060]   but like the historical model of variable annuities
[00:55:43.060 --> 00:55:45.380]   is that they paid the biggest commissions.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:46.900]   And if you were a broker,
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:49.280]   that was where you got your biggest bang for your buck.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.120]   - And a second one?
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.540]   - One conflict that was really common
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.460]   in the brokerage space,
[00:55:53.460 --> 00:55:54.900]   they would use the term churning,
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:57.920]   meaning that they put you in a product
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.400]   and then three years later,
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.580]   sell you out of that product,
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.580]   put you in a new product
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:04.020]   that had another big front load commission, right?
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.420]   And so without getting in the weeds on mutual funds,
[00:56:06.420 --> 00:56:08.020]   effectively, if you just think of,
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:10.540]   I get paid a commission every time I trade,
[00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:12.540]   and this would be true with trading stocks as well,
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:15.140]   which paid really hefty commissions back in the '80s,
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.980]   I'm gonna trade as much as possible.
[00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:19.780]   And certainly that's rarely good for any client,
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:21.660]   even just from a pure tax perspective,
[00:56:21.660 --> 00:56:23.180]   it's probably not a good idea.
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:25.980]   And then the other thing that you and I had chatted about
[00:56:25.980 --> 00:56:29.420]   in the past was this idea about certain fund families
[00:56:29.420 --> 00:56:32.540]   would say, if you have a certain number of dollars with us,
[00:56:32.540 --> 00:56:34.000]   the commissions are lower.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:35.640]   So a client with a million dollars
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.220]   would pay a very low commission.
[00:56:37.220 --> 00:56:39.420]   So what the broker would do is say,
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:41.580]   well, we're not gonna just use one fund family,
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:43.660]   let's divide you up into six fund families
[00:56:43.660 --> 00:56:45.900]   so that they could maximize their commission
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:48.200]   across the total that was being invested.
[00:56:48.200 --> 00:56:52.340]   - I have seen a few, not many,
[00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:55.220]   and I review accounts basically daily.
[00:56:55.220 --> 00:57:00.220]   I have seen a few broker, brokers, just broker only,
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:01.340]   not doing AUM,
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.400]   who have actually done the right thing for clients.
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.600]   They will put a million dollars in one fund company
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:07.820]   to get the break points.
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.580]   I'll look at the account statement and I'll see this,
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:12.900]   and I'll say, wow, I rarely see that.
[00:57:12.900 --> 00:57:14.360]   I really, basically most of the time,
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.380]   I see this thing broken up
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:17.460]   so that the broker gets higher commissions
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.180]   by breaking it up into different fund companies,
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:23.020]   but I actually have seen on a few occasions in my career
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:26.220]   where a broker has actually done the right thing.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:28.060]   So it's just because you are a broker
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:29.980]   doesn't mean that you're doing this.
[00:57:29.980 --> 00:57:32.300]   I'd say that a lot of brokers are,
[00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.100]   but there are some that are really acting much more
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:38.980]   like a fiduciary than the AUM advisors who,
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:40.400]   even though they are fiduciaries,
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:43.080]   I have to say that I have seen a lot of people
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.760]   not acting in the client's best interest,
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:45.600]   even though they're charging AUM.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:49.180]   - Yeah, so my paper really is kind of silent
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:53.200]   on the AUM versus commissions.
[00:57:53.200 --> 00:57:54.760]   When I compare to the RIA,
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:56.440]   so I have dual registrants,
[00:57:56.440 --> 00:57:59.280]   then I have independent RIAs that aren't affiliated.
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:00.760]   I can compare their fees,
[00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.000]   and the only thing I can tell you
[00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:05.560]   is that the dual registrants charge higher percentage fees
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:06.980]   to their retail clients,
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:09.180]   but then a lot of the independent RIAs
[00:58:09.180 --> 00:58:10.460]   don't take small clients.
[00:58:10.460 --> 00:58:13.820]   So oftentimes stuck between a rock and a hard place.
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:17.780]   - What about fees for advice not linked to commissions
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.780]   and not linked to assets under management?
[00:58:19.780 --> 00:58:22.340]   - I think that when you decouple the products
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:23.780]   from the advice,
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:26.240]   that clearly is going to reduce conflicts
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:28.820]   because for obvious reasons, right?
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.560]   If you're not getting paid based on assets
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:33.380]   or if you're not getting paid a commission
[00:58:33.380 --> 00:58:35.040]   based on a particular product,
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.420]   your independence is going to be more of a straight line
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.740]   and fewer conflicts.
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:41.740]   The conflicts, I guess, that could occur there
[00:58:41.740 --> 00:58:44.540]   would just be you talk to them for an hour
[00:58:44.540 --> 00:58:45.380]   and charge them for two,
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:48.480]   but that's more fraud than it is a conflict, right?
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:51.300]   - Well, Nikki, thank you so much for joining us today

[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.300]   We greatly appreciate your insight
