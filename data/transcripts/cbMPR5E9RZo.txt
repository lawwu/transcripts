[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180]   The culture is really interesting.
[00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.440]   So we heard so many stories.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.660]   One of the things about Iceland is that
[00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.080]   you're gonna spend some time driving.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.640]   And I think a mistake you could make on a trip
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.720]   is to base yourself solely in Reykjavik
[00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.680]   because then you're not only gonna have to drive everywhere,
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.920]   we had to drive everywhere,
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.240]   but you're gonna have to drive everywhere every day.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.260]   And so really getting out
[00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.980]   and staying in different parts of the country,
[00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.120]   I think gives you a lot more access.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.760]   It means you don't have to drive three and a half hours
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.760]   to start your day every day.
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.400]   But on those drives, there were so many amazing stories.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.520]   I don't even know how I could recap them,
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.640]   but it was funny how a recurring theme
[00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.440]   seemed to be that in almost every Icelandic story,
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.280]   everyone dies.
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.680]   We thought this was really just like from the sagas,
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.000]   the Vikings and all these old stories,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.840]   but even with like children's stories,
[00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.880]   death is not something that it seems like
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.320]   in Icelandic culture.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.720]   Maybe it's scary, but it's not not talked about.
