[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:13.460]   In a 2011 sermon on John 11 verses 1 to 16, John Piper recounted the story of the raising of Lazarus.
[00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.440]   The sermon is titled "This illness is for the glory of God."
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:24.000]   In it, he explained the love of Christ and how Christ showed his love by letting Lazarus die.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.960]   It's a crazy story we need to think about. Here's a clip of what John Piper said in that 2011 sermon.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.160]   Now let's look at it again so you can see it. Verse 5 and 6.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.760]   "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:50.960]   Therefore, when he heard that Lazarus is ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was,
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:57.360]   and he did not hurry to his side because he loved them."
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.160]   Because he loved them, he did not go to them.
[00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.560]   John intends, and Jesus intends, for everyone seeing this to ask, "Now how is that love?"
[00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:18.360]   It's okay to ask that if you don't ask it with a snooty attitude. He expects you to ask that.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   How is it love to let him die? I would like you to come if it were my brother.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.160]   That's a good question. And the answer is very clear in this text. Very clear.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.560]   But not common or acceptable without the work of the Holy Spirit in your life.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:53.360]   The key to this is, "Love lets him die because his death will help them see the glory of God."
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.560]   That's why verse 4 is here.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.960]   This is not about death. This is about the glory of God and the glory of the Son through him.
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   That's what this is about. And since I love them, I'm going to put that on maximal display
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.360]   at great cost to Lazarus and his sisters.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   A cost that most people do not want and are not willing to pay.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.960]   You're going to take my brother to show your glory? Yes.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:39.360]   That's where many of you are right now, shaking your heads, saying, "I don't think I want that for a Savior."
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:47.560]   That's where you are. This is one of the reasons why Christianity is hard to believe in for many people.
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.960]   Because it defines love in a way that is so different.
[00:02:52.960 --> 00:03:00.960]   So what is love? If love says, "I love you, Lazarus. I love you, Mary. I love you, Martha.
[00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:08.960]   I know he's mortally sick and that I could come and spare him death, but I'm not because I love you."
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:17.960]   How, Jesus? "Because in his dying, I am going to get great glory.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   My father is going to be seen as mighty over death in a way he would not any other way.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   So I'm going to let you pass through this horrible experience of losing your brother."
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.960]   You fill in the blank.
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.960]   Here's what love is.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:41.960]   Love means giving us what we need most. Most people would probably be okay with that definition of love.
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.960]   Love means giving us what we need most, especially if it costs you something.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:58.960]   What do we need most? What human beings need most is a full and endless experience of the glory of God.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.960]   That's what human beings need most.
[00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.960]   Most of them don't know that. That's why we preach. That's why we share the gospel.
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:19.960]   Most people don't know what human beings need most is a full and endless, joyful experience of the glory of God as their supreme treasure.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   All satisfying treasure. That's what human beings need most.
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:31.960]   They need to be changed into the kind of people who will see that, and then they need to receive that.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   A revelation to your soul of the glory of God is what this text says love gives above life.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:49.960]   We were sitting in here on Wednesday night, singing our lungs out in a beautiful time of praise and prayer.
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   One of the songs we sang loud and repeated was the loving kindness of the Lord is better than life, better than life, better than life.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.960]   And I'm sitting there thinking, does anybody here believe that? Really?
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:13.960]   I think they did, but many people do not. You can tell they don't by the way they react to death.
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   It's good to cry. Really good. Because loss is loss to us.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.960]   Hurts more than almost anything. But not to the dead.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:34.960]   A revelation to your soul of the glory of God is what the human soul needs.
[00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.960]   Seeing, admiring, marveling at, savoring the glory of God in Jesus.
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:46.960]   When someone is willing to die or let your brother die to give you that, he loves you.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   Here's another way to say it. I'm struggling to define love biblically.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.960]   I don't care what Hollywood thinks love is. I don't care what the television thinks love is.
[00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:02.960]   I don't care what you think love is. I care infinitely what love is in this book.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.960]   Because that's reality. Opinions don't matter. Reality really matters.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:18.960]   And here's another way to say it. Love is doing whatever you have to do to help people see and treasure the glory of God as their supreme joy.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.960]   Wow. That is one of the most poignant sermon clips I've ever heard from Pastor John.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   And it was sent in to us by Brian Hughes. Brian, thank you for emailing this clip in to us.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.960]   John Piper returns tomorrow to answer another one of your questions.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:40.960]   You know, he often talks about risk and mission, and one podcast listener wants to know whether comfortable Christians are compromising Christians.
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.960]   We'll find out tomorrow.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   Well, for everything related to this podcast, go to DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.960]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke. I'll see you tomorrow.
