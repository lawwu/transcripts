[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   Hello, it's Sam here from Financial Samurai and in this episode
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.880]   I'm going to talk about why quitting your job is selfish and why
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.360]   Engineering your layoff is the ethical and right way to go
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.080]   So when some people find out that I engineered my layoff
[00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.440]   They kind of look at me funny and say well, what is that?
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.740]   And when I explain to them what engineering your layoff is
[00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:27.600]   They look at me further and say you know what that sounds ethical and that's not right for me
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:33.640]   And I'm always always surprised by this response in this day and age of zero job security
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.100]   Most people do not have pensions anymore
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.760]   You know
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.680]   Maybe it's like less than 20% of employees have pensions because I certainly didn't and many people who work in any private industry
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.280]   Don't have pensions either
[00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.340]   Further no longer do employers keep their employees around for decades because the world is just too competitive now
[00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.920]   It's cutthroat thanks to globalization and much poorer people around the world
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.880]   Looking at our lifestyles in America and wanting to eat our lunch dinner and breakfast
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.840]   And then of course technology has done away with a lot of jobs and have made a lot of jobs redundant
[00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.040]   during my days on Wall Street
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.920]   We would have
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.480]   traders and equity sales traders and now everything is done algorithmically or
[00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.120]   Online electronic trading so clients don't have to talk to anybody and these jobs that once paid
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.320]   500,000 to 2 million dollars are really no more
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.280]   So going back to the ethical comment or the unethical comment of engineering your layoff
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.460]   One could argue that if you're not doing everything possible to fight for yourself and your family's financial security
[00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.820]   You're the one being unethical
[00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.240]   That or you're just ignorant
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.080]   Quitting your job is selfish compared to negotiating a severance
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.160]   I really want to make this point clear in this podcast
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:59.000]   The only way quitting your job is not selfish is if you were a terrible deadweight employee
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Who was a cancer to your team in such a scenario you quitting is like?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.560]   your colleagues and your managers throwing a party and saying hallelujah because oftentimes it is very
[00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.100]   Very hard to remove an underperforming employee
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:19.400]   Even though there is a fire at will clause because of potential discrimination lawsuits and so forth
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.260]   So let's go through in detail why it's always best to engineer your layoff instead of quitting your job
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:31.520]   So first of all, if you quit your job, you're leaving your colleagues and your manager in a bind
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.760]   So if you broadside your manager and colleagues by quitting you're dumping all your work onto them
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.280]   The reason why you had a job was because you provided more value than you cost
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.320]   otherwise, you didn't wouldn't have a job right so it often takes months to find a replacement and
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.440]   Months more to train your replacement to do a proper job for my job in equity sales and trading
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:02.000]   It could take easily three months to find a replacement and then three to six months to train someone to take over the accounts
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.960]   And do all that stuff. So quitting your job creates a lot of lost
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.200]   productivity and ultimately lost revenue and time
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.520]   - you hurt your clients who depended on your services if you're in a revenue-producing role quitting your job one day means your clients can
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   No longer count on you for advice or service
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.440]   This is especially disruptive if you've been their point person for years and years and years
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.160]   Clients come to rely on people and by quitting you're telling them you don't care about them and only yourself
[00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.760]   Three you're hurting your future job prospects
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.560]   If you haven't lined one up already and even if you have I got to say if you're so selfish as to quit on your
[00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:42.760]   colleagues and your clients
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.160]   You will have fewer supporters when you apply for a new job in the future and that will be an inevitability
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.520]   Or if you want to start your own business people will be a little bit suspect
[00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:59.360]   Nobody's gonna write you a favorable recommendation letter when you didn't give them a chance to properly transition your work and coverage
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.880]   For you hurt your reputation
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.480]   Nobody likes a quitter. Let's be honest
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.600]   Especially if you quit a job to lounge around on the beach for months while your old colleagues and ex-clients still have to work
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.160]   They will resent you trust me. Although today it's common to job hop every one to three years
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:24.720]   Repeatedly quitting your job creates distrust when I'm looking at a resume and I see a new job on the resume every one
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.200]   Year for the past five six years. There is no way in hell
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.600]   I'm hiring that person because I know they're gonna quit on me sometime in the future
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.080]   Your managers will not want to invest time or money in you because they're afraid you're gonna be gonzo, right?
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.840]   So as a result your reputation does suffer
[00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:46.760]   Next five you hurt your finances at the end of the day. This should be really obvious if you quit your job
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.200]   You aren't eligible for a severance
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.160]   You're not eligible for 26 weeks of unemployment benefits
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.200]   That's for state unemployment benefits during the financial crisis. It went up to all the way to 99 weeks. That was pretty interesting
[00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.920]   You're not eligible for subsidized Cobra health care
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:10.580]   You don't get Warn Act mandatory federal pay and you don't get any job search help
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:13.080]   So if you successfully negotiate a severance
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.280]   You'll have a financial runway that allows you to be pickier in doing something more meaningful with your life
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.800]   You won't feel the pressure to take immediately any soul-sucking job
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.360]   Because of your need for money and think about how much happier you will be as a result
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:33.780]   You know, you can spend more time with your family. You can go travel the world. You can explore new business opportunities
[00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:40.280]   You can go back to school having this severance as a financial runway is so awesome for me
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.120]   I just spend the time writing on financial samurai slowly, you know three times a week
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:50.840]   I spend time consulting with FinTech companies and I did a lot of traveling and during this time
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.440]   I really found myself and I found what I really really wanted to do
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.920]   So not having to rush into something is really important because oftentimes when you rush into something
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.080]   You often just rush out because you made a wrong choice
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.560]   So given these very logical reasons
[00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:13.440]   Why would anybody quit their jobs if they can negotiate a severance and I think there are three main reasons
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:17.680]   Why number one people simply don't know better
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:23.880]   They think they are powerless employees who have no chance at walking away with money in their pocket
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:27.160]   But given there are plenty of free blog posts out there
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:33.680]   Free podcasts now out there and also a book teaching you how to engineer your layoff
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:39.840]   Nobody can plead ignorance anymore, which brings us to the second most common reason why people quit
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.040]   Which is selfishness if you are selfish, you don't care if you dump your work onto your colleagues
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.380]   You're thinking to yourself. Nah, not my problem
[00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.260]   Go deal with it. I'm out of here guys
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:56.520]   selfish people don't care about the well-being of their clients who've come to depend on them and
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:03.360]   Selfish people even compromise the well-being of their family because they're too afraid to negotiate a severance
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:09.260]   You know, it really sucks to be selfish if you don't think about other people you're just screwing yourself
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.080]   Ultimately pretend you're a landlord. Okay, this has happened to me before
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:19.840]   Wouldn't you much prefer getting a six months heads up from your tenants saying hey, they accepted a job overseas
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:25.760]   Instead of a two-week notice before Christmas. I never got a two-week notice because in the lease
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.040]   It says give me at least a 30-day notice
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:33.520]   But I did get a 30-day notice last year right before Christmas because my tenants said hey, you know what?
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:36.600]   We're gonna go and move to New York City. So that really sucked
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:44.640]   But the good thing is they found tenants for me because they had friends who are moving to San Francisco from Boston
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.360]   So that was really nice, but if that didn't happen, I would be really bummed out
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:55.880]   So the final most common reason why people quit their jobs instead of engineering their laugh is due to fear
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:04.120]   Weak people are afraid of confrontation partly because they lack the communication skills necessary to create a win-win scenario
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:12.600]   You know who these people are they'd rather quit or break up with someone by text message instead of calling them on the phone
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:16.840]   Let alone seeing someone face to face to relay the news
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:24.520]   Heck if they could ghost the other side and I just understood what ghosting means it means to completely ignore someone
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:27.080]   They probably would do that as well
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.400]   but the funny thing is
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.440]   Managers also fear confrontation. It's the worst thing ever if you're a manager to try to lay someone off
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:42.360]   Can you imagine having to go through your employees that you've worked with for years and tell them you know what?
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:48.680]   Their services are no longer needed because they're not good enough. They're not worthy enough, you know
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.640]   Obviously, you're not gonna say that but to sit down and have that conversation to someone you don't hate you
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:09:01.720]   Respect because you probably hired them that they're gonna get laid off is a really really tough thing. So by volunteering
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:04.440]   Your layoff
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:09.160]   obviously with the servants you're helping the manager make the decision for her and
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.520]   You're probably saving someone a job
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:19.600]   That really needs a job and that's really really powerful. That's the opposite of being selfish. That's being
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.080]   Magnanimous that's being thoughtful and that's being kind
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:27.360]   So some of you may ask what if you're stuck in a toxic work environment?
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:34.560]   You can't stand and in such a scenario, it's even more important to attempt to engineer your layoff while concurrently looking for another job
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:38.360]   This is where you have power you have leverage
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   Because you literally have nothing to lose because you would probably happily walk away with nothing
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:51.560]   But as a financial samurai as someone who wants to optimize their financial situation and achieve financial independence
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.520]   You don't want to waste these opportunities where you really couldn't give a damn and would happily quit
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.800]   You want to use this opportunity to negotiate more aggressively? You just need to do so in a more respectful way
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:10.680]   listen, you can tell yourself that negotiating severance is beneath you or unethical or just
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.480]   Weird, but you'd be lying to yourself
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:21.360]   That's the only person you'd be lying to the more you can help provide a smooth transition for those affected by your departure
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.080]   the better everything will be after you've departed and the better everything will be
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:32.080]   The more friends you will have in your industry in your community
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:38.880]   Around the globe because people want to work with people and help people who've made things better
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.760]   So don't let your pride get in the way of doing what's right for everyone
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.880]   Don't let your fear or ignorance get in the way either
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:53.960]   Engineering your layoff is a win for you your family your ex-colleagues and your previous employer
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:59.120]   And if you need more examples, just click over to financial samurai and type in the search box

[00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:13.240]   Engineering your layoff is more and more feasible today than ever before. Thanks so much everybody
