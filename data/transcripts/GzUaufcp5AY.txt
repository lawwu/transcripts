[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.680]   - Well, last time we talked about Christians
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.680]   who work on Sundays in episode number 1389.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.980]   Today, in episode 1390,
[00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.400]   we talk about Christians who work every day.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.120]   The question comes from Samantha.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.460]   Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.020]   I'm honored to work in a very demanding field in DC
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.500]   alongside a number of other young Christians
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.920]   who also work very hard.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.980]   I think it's safe to say we are overworking.
[00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.160]   It would be pretty normal for me and other young associates
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.360]   to put in seven-day work weeks.
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.160]   The phone is never off, text never stopped,
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.440]   the work never ends.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.400]   It's immersive.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.640]   Work is life.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.980]   And as much as we bemoan it,
[00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.920]   we struggle to know what to do in the moments
[00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.660]   when we are not working.
[00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.800]   Work gives us our cues for action in life
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800]   of what to do next,
[00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.520]   and thus our work can undermine relationships
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.900]   and meaningful church involvement.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.080]   Everything that is not work.
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.420]   Even if we are not officially forced to work every day,
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.640]   the desire for advancement and for future success
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.560]   and for achieving financial security
[00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.840]   are such strong draws that to stop working
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.740]   feels like losing momentum to others
[00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.720]   in a very competitive career field.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.340]   That's my world right now,
[00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.840]   and it doesn't feel healthy.
[00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.040]   At what point does vocational diligence
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.240]   become corrupting idolatry?
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.200]   - Seems to me that Samantha already has
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.200]   such an amazing grasp of the telltale signs of idolatry
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.720]   in the way she describes her situation.
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.760]   Maybe the best thing I can do
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:33.760]   is to give her perhaps a fresh set of categories
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.320]   for how to think about this.
[00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.680]   Not at all contradicting what she's already seen,
[00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.800]   but just coming at it a new way.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.120]   So let's begin like this.
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.040]   Here are four words which in Greek,
[00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.680]   yes, this is gonna be relevant,
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.400]   which in Greek have a positive meaning
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.520]   and a sinful meaning, and yet they're the same word.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.680]   Sometimes a virtue, sometimes a sin.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.920]   And in trying to figure out
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.160]   when the positive meaning should describe something
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.100]   and when the sinful meaning should describe something
[00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.200]   is a very fruitful exercise
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.000]   precisely for Samantha's concern.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.420]   So here are the four words.
[00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.360]   The word epithumia can mean desire in a positive sense
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.360]   or covetousness in a negative sense.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.360]   The word perosmos can mean test or trial
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.740]   in a positive sense or temptation in a negative sense.
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.000]   The word zealos can mean zeal in a positive sense
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.840]   or jealousy in a negative sense.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.040]   And the word, and this gets really close,
[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   the word ergon can mean work in a positive sense
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.920]   and works in a negative sense
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.560]   as it relates to justification.
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.680]   All of these seem to me, as you try to get at
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.520]   why does the positive become negative,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.900]   get very close to Samantha's issue.
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.840]   So let me just do it real quick.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.160]   Let's take them one at a time.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.160]   When does desire become covetousness?
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.040]   And the clue for me that set the stage
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.160]   for all of these words and her position,
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.800]   her question in particular is the 10 commandments.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.800]   The 10 commandments end with thou shalt not covet.
[00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.960]   And that word covet, same word as in Psalm 19 10
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.960]   where it says that the scriptures
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.480]   are more to be desire than gold.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.120]   So sometimes the word desire, very positive
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.680]   and sometimes it's covetousness.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.560]   So same in Hebrew as in Greek.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.360]   And the clue to what turns desire into coveting,
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.700]   I think is the first commandment.
[00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.920]   They are very mutually explanatory.
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.260]   The brackets you might say,
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.000]   the first and the last commandment of the 10 commandments.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   You shall have no other gods before me.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   That is don't desire anyone or anything above me.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:24.120]   Find me to be your greatest treasure and desire.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.920]   So here's my answer.
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   A desire becomes covetousness
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.920]   when it begins to displace God as your chief desire.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.940]   So in our workplace,
[00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.800]   we always have a measuring rod for idolatry.
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.800]   Is what I am desiring starting to feel more precious to me
[00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.280]   and more satisfying, more valuable than God?
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.540]   Number two, when does the word test,
[00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:00.520]   testing our faith become temptation or lure into sin?
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.440]   And we see the answer when we notice what tests are for.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   God sends tests to strengthen our faith,
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.080]   to make us more gladly and confidently reliant,
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.480]   dependent on him.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   But a test becomes a temptation, a lure into sin
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:30.480]   when it starts to do just the opposite.
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.480]   Namely, not to strengthen our faith, but to undermine it.
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.820]   The test is not putting firmness
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.600]   into our resolve to depend on God,
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.960]   but it's drawing us into dependence on ourselves.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.480]   That we, not God, know what's best.
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.160]   We can taste the difference.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.040]   We know, we can taste when this is happening.
[00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:02.040]   This test is making me stronger
[00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.920]   and happier in my dependence on God,
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:10.920]   or it is in fact weakening my dependence on God
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.960]   and starting to make me more likely to depend on myself.
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.220]   And we can test it in the workplace.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:23.220]   As pressures are coming, is the effect on me,
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.540]   I'm staying up later, I'm doing more,
[00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.500]   I'm depending more on me, I'm showing my gifts,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.700]   or is our faith growing with a kind of restful,
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.680]   God is enough and he will help me.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.820]   We can tell the difference, it's a test.
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.020]   Here's the third one.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.760]   When does zeal become jealousy?
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.140]   It happens when we shift from a passion
[00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.020]   for God's name being above other names
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:53.520]   to a passion for our name being above other names.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.680]   Jealousy is a resentful desire
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.680]   that someone else got some glory or some reward.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.040]   That I wanted for myself.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   It's driven not by a mere sense of achievement.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.800]   It's driven by desire for recognition above others,
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:23.760]   for superior achievement recognized above others.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.160]   So we can tell it's starting to happen
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.480]   when we don't rejoice at other people's successes
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:35.400]   and rewards, but feel a niggling resentment
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.400]   and we know, okay, my zeal is becoming jealousy.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.040]   Now here's the last one.
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:46.560]   What's the difference between work and works?
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.200]   When does that word become evil?
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:54.400]   And the key text is Ephesians 2, 8, following,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:55.320]   here's what it says.
[00:07:55.320 --> 00:07:58.280]   By grace you have been saved through faith.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:00.400]   This is not your own doing.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.400]   It is a gift of God, not as a result of works.
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.600]   So works is negative in that sentence.
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.440]   You must not work for this.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.280]   You must not view your standing with God
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:21.240]   as a result of these efforts so that no one may boast.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.480]   And then he continues, verse 10.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.480]   For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:33.400]   for good works.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.600]   Those are good.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:36.920]   The first ones are bad, same word.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.560]   Second one, good, which God prepared before him
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.400]   that we should walk in them.
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:47.400]   The difference between damning works and delightful work.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.480]   What's the difference?
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.560]   Works are sinful.
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.640]   It's talking about good works there.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.200]   It's not talking about hitting people or hurting people.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:58.640]   It's talking about good works.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:03.080]   Those good works are sinful when we think
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.680]   that our salvation, our acceptance with God,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:08.120]   our great status as the children of God,
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.440]   our great riches as fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.680]   we think that all that acceptance, that great status,
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:19.640]   those great riches is the result of our works.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:21.080]   It's not.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.080]   It's free grace.
[00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:26.760]   It's a gift of God through faith, not works.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:31.400]   And then, verse 10, we are his workmanship.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.120]   We are created.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:37.000]   We are now for good works.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.880]   So when is your work becoming works?
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:43.360]   Your work is becoming works.
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:47.120]   When you begin to feel that your work
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.360]   is earning your acceptance with God,
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:55.360]   when you feel that it is earning your greatest status,
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.320]   when you begin to feel that it is earning
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.760]   your greatest riches,
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.760]   your godly work is becoming ungodly works
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.920]   when your greatest sense of acceptance,
[00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:12.560]   your greatest status, your greatest riches,
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.200]   your greatest meaning and identity
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.920]   are the product of your work.
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.480]   Or to say it one other way,
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.720]   your work has become idolatry
[00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:30.000]   when it's the root and not the fruit
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.920]   of your acceptance, your status, your riches,
[00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:36.600]   your identity, which are all free in Christ.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:40.280]   The glory of God's grace is at stake here.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.080]   By grace, he has freely given in Christ
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.280]   the greatest acceptance, the greatest status,
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.640]   the greatest wealth, the greatest identity.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.920]   If we shift from seeing our work
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.640]   as the overflow of that and start seeing our work
[00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:00.880]   as the basis of that,
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   we have turned our work into grace-belittling idolatry.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:09.280]   - Wow, that is a potent word for all of us.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:10.420]   Thank you, Pastor John,
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:12.320]   and thanks for the excellent question, Samantha.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:13.880]   I really appreciate it.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.080]   And thank you for listening along
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:16.840]   and for subscribing to Ask Pastor John
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:19.680]   in your favorite podcast app or on YouTube.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.520]   Next time we hear from a non-Christian
[00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:23.560]   who wants to know why coming to Christ
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:26.720]   and believing the gospel are so difficult.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:29.200]   Shouldn't salvation be easier?
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.200]   That question will be put to Pastor John next time.
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.640]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:33.680]   See you on Wednesday.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:36.260]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:38.840]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:48.840]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
