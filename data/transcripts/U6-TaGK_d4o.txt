[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720]   We're playing Red Dead Redemption 2, a game that my good friend Ng has recommended.
[00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:12.640]   We met in Austin, but she's now in Boston, Cambridge, working on exoskeletons.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.840]   And robotic limbs.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.320]   And robotic limbs, which in the future I guess would be cyborgs.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:25.440]   We started playing it a little bit ago, and it's way better than I imagined.
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.800]   So the dialogue is great.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:31.680]   But just even the dynamics of horses, because I thought it was just going to be Grant that
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.560]   has to odd on a horse.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.800]   But there's so much more to this game.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.240]   Well, right now we're in story mode.
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.400]   If we played free play, we could find a random horse and train it.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.760]   Yeah, but it's cool that the horse gets tired.
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.880]   You have to take care of it.
[00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:55.040]   Just the harsh conditions of snow as a start of the story is incredible.
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.200]   You ever ridden a horse?
[00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.320]   You're laughing because there's a picture of me on the internet on a horse.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.440]   Okay, I'm not sure this is going to be a lot of shooting.
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.720]   Is it Y to take out the gun?
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.040]   I don't think we have a gun.
[00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.040]   I picked up where you left off.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.320]   No, why did I get off the horse?
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.520]   Okay, check your pockets.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.840]   Oh, you've got your binoculars.
[00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.280]   I know you have in your pocket.
[00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.680]   But the gun, I don't know.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.680]   I don't know if you have any weapons.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.520]   What happened?
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.480]   What happened to our weapon?
[00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.800]   I don't know.
[00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:31.600]   I wasn't here for that.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.080]   All I did is I played it for like five more minutes and I shot the wolves that were attacking.
[00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.200]   Oh, the wolves?
[00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.800]   The wolves?
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:42.560]   That's how you wasted all of your ammo?
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.880]   There's like five of them.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.920]   It was as difficult as you don't.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.080]   How long did it take?
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.520]   You said it took you five minutes?
[00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.880]   No, I did.
[00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.760]   Yeah, it was five minutes because it's just one little chase.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.160]   But it took me like three attempts because I was trying to get better at aiming.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.360]   Dude, I kept killing the other guy.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.600]   Oh, there's a bit of a fight.
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   Looks like we're about to go into combat.
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.520]   Anyway, I mentioned Austin.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.480]   Do you remember how we met?
[00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.080]   How long ago was this?
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.240]   It was like a year and a half ago, I think.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:26.240]   In the summer, right?
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:32.720]   I came to visit some friends and that was at a coffee shop and we ran into each other.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.860]   Yeah.
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.540]   And that was...
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.400]   And since then...
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.760]   And when did you go to MIT?
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.960]   That was recent, right?
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.680]   Very recent.
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.520]   That was in September.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.560]   It's been fun.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.000]   The winter is very cold, though.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.640]   So this is your first cold place, right?
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.240]   Yeah, and I love the heat.
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.240]   Like, the Texas heat was great.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   96 degrees, walking on the trail.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.080]   Yeah, it's nice.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.580]   I love it.
[00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.080]   How do I pull out a gun?
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.640]   I don't know if you have a gun.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.360]   Hold LB.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.480]   Oh, you have a gun.
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.760]   Nice.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.360]   Okay, so how do you do the...
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.480]   You know, like you can swap through the different guns you have?
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.560]   How do you think you could flip through it?
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.340]   No.
[00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.560]   I don't need guns.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.440]   I use fists, bro.
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.380]   Okay.
[00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.060]   But the revolver might be enough.
[00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.560]   Okay.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.540]   Approach our horse.
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:33.060]   I think it's more entertaining when you play this.
[00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.460]   Because I'm so bad at it.
[00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.060]   It's just so great to watch.
[00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:40.660]   I mean, it's just an incredibly gorgeous game.
[00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.500]   Just like the snow, the sound of it.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.980]   I also put it on cinematic mode.
[00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.260]   Which does what?
[00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.460]   It just... the views of it.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.300]   It's not really first person.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.700]   It's not as pleasant for playing the game,
[00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.700]   but it's pleasant for watching someone else play.
[00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.380]   Okay.
[00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.420]   Is this not my horse?
[00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:03.380]   Just for the record, we're both noobs at this game.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.660]   But it's more fun this way.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.780]   Okay, horse weapons.
[00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.020]   I saw that you can skin animals.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.380]   There's a lot of really interesting stuff.
[00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:12.660]   RT to cycle.
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.740]   Oh, there we go.
[00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:15.620]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.260]   I told you.
[00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:17.300]   How do you swipe?
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.940]   RT to cycle?
[00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:18.660]   RT.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.160]   RT.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.120]   Cool.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.160]   Okay.
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.800]   Why do I need to go...
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.000]   Why do I still need to do this?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.240]   I remember like it was yesterday.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.000]   All the wolves I killed with that.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.720]   Our needs right now are supplies.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.120]   Nice twirl.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.680]   Everything else, including comb, can wait.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:39.180]   Okay.
[00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.640]   This guy walks really slow.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.400]   ...deal with as it is.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.120]   Now come on.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.360]   I don't think these guys are in touch with their feminine side.
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.880]   Why don't you think that?
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:53.480]   Just everything they're doing is like the most masculine.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.520]   Their coats are pretty long.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.880]   That's true.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:57.880]   It's pretty feminine.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.800]   Look, three-year kilt.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.920]   Probably not a skirt.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.680]   I guess a kilt isn't.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.640]   What do you think about kilts?
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.640]   I think they're pretty awesome.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:14.280]   I mean, it's pretty aggressive to buy one, but...
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.520]   Yeah, if you're not Scottish.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.120]   Just in general.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.720]   Just sport a kilt.
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.600]   It's just like an aggressive move, but if you have one, rock it.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:25.480]   Just walk around Boston in a kilt.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.240]   A giant coat and a kilt.
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.760]   I mean, I don't wear a skirt in the winter.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.280]   You think I can go to the gym in a kilt?
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.040]   Just work out.
[00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.240]   Just do curls.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.360]   Like you've got to sink in.
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:45.080]   Would I get kicked out of like Planet Fitness if I wore a kilt?
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.680]   I mean, well, you have to think about it this way.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.480]   Like would I get kicked out of Planet Fitness if I wore a skirt?
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.220]   To the gym?
[00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.920]   I don't think they think of it that way.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.680]   They'll just see me in a kilt.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.880]   It's like, "Excuse me, sir.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.800]   You're scaring."
[00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.480]   You're scaring everyone.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.920]   And you're making all kinds of sounds.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:05.320]   You would make sounds while you're wearing a kilt?
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.360]   Yeah, you have to.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.640]   You have to make the sounds?
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.680]   Like William Wallace.
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.280]   I'll paint my face blue, whatever, and stripes.
[00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:19.000]   Like Braveheart?
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.120]   Mm-hmm.
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.620]   Wow.
[00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.220]   Wow.
[00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.760]   It's cheesy as hell, but it's epic.
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.840]   It's a great speech.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.760]   Is it?
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:30.120]   It's a good monologue?
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:36.520]   No, he does a speech where they're the underdogs and they have to fight the British.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:45.320]   And he basically says, "We can run and keep our lives, or we can stand here and fight
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:46.760]   for our freedom."
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.920]   And the question is, you have to imagine years from now when you're in your deathbed
[00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.480]   and you're looking back, would you come back here for just one more chance
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:03.720]   to fight instead of fleeing?
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.520]   It's a good speech.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.240]   Gotta be brave.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.700]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.240]   Sometimes you have to put your life on the line.
[00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.280]   Bravery is important.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:17.000]   I was talking to my nephew about this recently.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.520]   So he plays, I think it's called Minecraft.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:21.580]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.720]   And there's zombies in the game.
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:29.240]   And he knows a way of escaping whatever conflict he's in so that he doesn't have to face it.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:32.120]   And I told him that in life, it's really important to be brave because you can't
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.560]   always run away from your problems.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.800]   So I think bravery is super important.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.400]   What are they saying?
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.280]   Should I take the lead or should I send the gang?
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.760]   What do you mean?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.560]   You have those options?
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.920]   I have those options.
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.840]   No, take the lead, send the gang, send the gang.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:47.900]   Oh.
[00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.160]   Lead from the back.
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:58.280]   All right.
[00:07:58.280 --> 00:07:58.780]   Should we just...
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:01.480]   Oh shoot.
[00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.200]   Where is...
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:03.320]   Where are the people?
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.280]   Oh, that's right.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.040]   I didn't see the dot.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.440]   This screen is humongous.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:09.400]   Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.120]   Should I bring the thing closer?
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.240]   No, it's good.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:14.280]   Oh shoot.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.320]   I keep on getting shot.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:16.760]   How do I hide?
[00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:20.920]   Oh, this is getting real.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:21.480]   Hold on.
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.600]   How do I crouch again?
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.000]   Sometimes you have to put...
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.400]   Just like you said, you have to put your life on the line.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:32.520]   That's worth it.
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:33.480]   That was worth it at the end.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:34.600]   Retry checkpoint.
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.640]   Don't restart the mission.
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:37.160]   Is that an A?
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:37.660]   A.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:41.080]   Oh, you have to hold it.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:45.880]   Yeah, because restarting the mission, we're going to go through that whole walking thing.
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.240]   So what is it?
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.440]   Is it Y to shoot?
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:48.840]   No.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.640]   To take out the gun?
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.240]   This is really hard.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.200]   I know.
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.760]   It's hard to like chat and do this.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.180]   Yeah.
[00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:00.680]   You try it.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.820]   Okay.
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:03.740]   Oh.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.200]   Oh shit.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:06.680]   That was me.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:08.360]   That wasn't you.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.320]   That was me.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.040]   Yeah, that was you.
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:12.920]   Me was animating your death shot.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.880]   Yeah, I did so good.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.500]   Nice.
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:19.900]   Oh, there's no one there.
[00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:20.860]   All right, where are the people?
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.720]   Oh.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   Nice.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.740]   Oh, where are the...
[00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:30.240]   Who is it?
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:33.340]   I don't think there's anybody behind you.
[00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:36.140]   I think you're imagining things.
[00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.400]   Nice.
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.760]   Oh no.
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:44.860]   But I figured it out now.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:45.360]   Okay.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.260]   All right.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.880]   What are we doing, Dutch?
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:54.080]   By the minute, becoming more and more of a cowboy.
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.840]   Thank god we're in Texas.
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.840]   Oh.
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.880]   Where's the set?
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.380]   Do you know?
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.040]   I don't know.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.200]   I could look it up.
[00:10:05.200 --> 00:10:06.880]   Oh, my phone's charging somewhere over there.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   Kill these sons of bitches.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:17.360]   I don't go down that easy.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:21.120]   Did you hear what he said?
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.000]   I don't go down that easy and you just shot him twice.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.680]   Just to prove a point.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.240]   Sounds like your claim was false.
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:30.800]   You need to eat.
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:31.680]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.400]   I need to eat.
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.520]   Oh, yeah, all right, cool.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:33.920]   Hold on.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:34.560]   What am I eating?
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.260]   Apples?
[00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:37.860]   I think that's salt.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:40.500]   How do I switch over?
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:42.900]   Oh, I see.
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.400]   Okay.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.740]   That thing.
[00:10:44.740 --> 00:10:45.700]   LB to use.
[00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.340]   Okay.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:48.980]   Did that help?
[00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:52.660]   I want to eat.
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.260]   Oh, shoot.
[00:10:54.260 --> 00:10:56.340]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:57.220]   Everything is fine.
[00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:58.920]   All right.
[00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:01.060]   I'll just keep dying.
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:04.600]   Oh.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.640]   What?
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:07.080]   I restarted the mission.
[00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.360]   Yeah, just restarting the mission.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.200]   We're going to go through that whole walking thing.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:19.480]   That's good.
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.360]   Gives us a chance to relive the incredible graphics of this video game.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.880]   Going faster.
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.560]   Were you pressing A while you were on the horse?
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.800]   Yeah, but not enough.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.480]   I haven't figured out if you can just hold it or if you have to keep pressing it.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:36.520]   It's complicated.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:51.960]   I don't think I'm controlling it anymore.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:53.580]   Yeah.
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:56.280]   This is gorgeous.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.320]   Yeah, it's really beautiful.
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:01.080]   Have you ridden horses?
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:04.040]   Yeah, I used to go to a horseback riding camp.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:06.440]   You like it?
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.660]   Loved it.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:11.080]   I like horses a lot.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:11.880]   They're very gentle.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.240]   They're kind of like...
[00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:17.240]   Well, they're better than dogs in a way.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.200]   Like, they're more loyal and they don't realize how large they are.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:22.840]   And they're really just sweet.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.200]   I love horses.
[00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.840]   There's so many cliche things and this is great.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:39.000]   This is like a mix of Grand Theft Auto and Skyrim.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.640]   Because the nature scenes are beautiful.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:42.760]   It's not always winter, right?
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:47.640]   Well, I think that I remember a version where it was winter.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.120]   Someone played it in the off.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:55.080]   I'm sure the seasons change in the game.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.520]   Winter is brutal.
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.240]   It's crazy.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.440]   So you're not enjoying the craziness of it?
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.560]   At least a little bit?
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:10.440]   I mean, I think it's bonding for the people that live there.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.640]   Because you get to complain.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.160]   Yeah, because they get to complain together.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.000]   And you get to appreciate it deeper when it's actually warmer.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.520]   When it's a different season, yeah.
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.880]   Yeah, when the seasons change.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:21.400]   It is beautiful when it snows.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.040]   It was a weekend where it was like -11 degrees or something.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.560]   It's crazy.
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.120]   You ever build a snowman?
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.480]   Once, but when I was younger.
[00:13:33.480 --> 00:13:33.880]   Have you?
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:35.320]   Yeah, all the time.
[00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.840]   All the time?
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:40.520]   Yeah, I used to really enjoy eating snow.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:42.840]   And then people would tell me you shouldn't do that.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.360]   And I would still do it.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.360]   Why did you keep doing it?
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.760]   Just a rebellion and you couldn't live with it?
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:49.560]   I think it tastes good.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:50.860]   I see.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:53.160]   It tastes good?
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.840]   I don't know.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:13:55.960]   Do you chew on ice too?
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:57.320]   No.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.240]   No, it's like, it's refreshing.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.840]   But I think it's probably horrible for you.
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:04.280]   Because all kinds of stuff could be in the snow.
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:11.960]   I don't think I was so much concerned about my health or immune system when I was young.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.320]   Probably made it stronger.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:14.120]   Yeah, probably.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.440]   Because these days.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:18.600]   They're not eating enough snow.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:20.760]   They don't know what it was like.
[00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.080]   What's the scariest thing you've ever done?
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.680]   Scariest?
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.240]   Skydiving?
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.440]   Did you skydive?
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:27.480]   I've gone skydiving.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.720]   I think probably scuba diving.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:36.760]   Because I didn't take a class or anything and I was scuba diving.
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:42.120]   And we went under the water and there were stingrays.
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:47.400]   And it was like this really weird feeling of like, this may go very wrong.
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.760]   But I feel like the people around me are very competent.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.920]   So they'll take care of me if something happens.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:55.080]   Yeah, the same thing for skydiving for me.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.580]   Yeah.
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:58.840]   Have you ever killed a man?
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:00.440]   No, have you?
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:00.940]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.280]   Lost count.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.400]   I'm really taking this game in.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:08.680]   Just the spirit of this game.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:11.960]   Just killed many cowboys in my day.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:15.240]   If you had the opportunity to live in this time for like a year, would you?
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:18.280]   Oh yeah, probably.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.080]   Like a vacation?
[00:15:19.080 --> 00:15:20.440]   But the opposite of a vacation.
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:23.880]   But you know, you have to stay for a whole year though.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.160]   Whole year I would do it.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:25.720]   Okay.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.220]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:31.080]   My lab, they do this thing where they go to Africa.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.960]   And they help people and you stay for a month.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.800]   But it's like these really harsh conditions.
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:40.680]   I think two of the girls that recently went, they got really sick while they were there.
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:44.840]   But you're helping these people who don't have access to these limbs.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:48.280]   Yeah, probably also helps you appreciate.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.160]   Yeah, everything that you have access to readily.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.400]   You guys are suspiciously close together.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.840]   I know.
[00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:57.640]   We're like, hey.
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:01.560]   What do you think about John?
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.320]   All right, let's go.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.840]   Wait, wait, why isn't it letting me?
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.320]   All right.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.120]   Oh, that's what it was.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.120]   I only had my fist.
[00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.080]   Oh, shoot.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.500]   Nice.
[00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.640]   I really want to get this guy.
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:35.320]   Okay.
[00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:36.040]   All right, come on.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:39.240]   Obviously, we're not very good at this game.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.940]   Oh.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.440]   It's kind of fun.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.080]   We just keep.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:44.920]   We just keep dying the same.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.420]   But.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:47.160]   Hey, how about this?
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.660]   What?
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:50.300]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.000]   A, restart checkpoint.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.500]   Okay.
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   Hey.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:16:56.320]   Hey.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:59.500]   I'm the one that pointed that out.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.660]   I clicked the restart mission by accident.
[00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:02.140]   That's true.
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.740]   What do you think about cyborgs?
[00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.180]   Do you think that in 100 years, we'll all be partially robot?
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:11.020]   Yeah, I think we have to merge with technology in order to like.
[00:17:11.020 --> 00:17:17.820]   In order to evolve with it, because it's evolving so quickly.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:21.820]   If we don't evolve with it, it's like we lose a step in evolution.
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.980]   Like it's the logical next step.
[00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:27.180]   Including brain.
[00:17:27.180 --> 00:17:27.900]   Yeah.
[00:17:27.900 --> 00:17:29.500]   BCIs and BMIs are the future.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.580]   So you like the Neuralink stuff?
[00:17:33.580 --> 00:17:34.080]   Love it.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:35.280]   Love it.
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:38.700]   There's a lot of awesome Neuralink people here in Austin.
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.260]   Are there?
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:43.900]   They're saying they want to give me a tour and meet them and stuff.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.700]   I really want to meet them.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.540]   And the surgeon, I talked to a few surgeons.
[00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.540]   They're just incredible people.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:49.420]   I love it.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:49.820]   Yeah.
[00:17:49.820 --> 00:17:53.020]   And the cool thing about Neuralink is they have all these like different.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:54.700]   How do I stop crouching?
[00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:55.200]   I don't know.
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.160]   Oh.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:00.620]   That's fine.
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:01.260]   Crouching is good.
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:01.820]   It's a good look.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:03.180]   I feel like you should be crouching.
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.380]   You're definitely safer.
[00:18:04.380 --> 00:18:04.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:08.940]   But you look less gangster, but it's fine.
[00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:14.220]   The cool thing is they got like all kinds of, they got materials, engineering people.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.780]   They got electrical robotics, obviously software engineering.
[00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:22.220]   They have like, they have to take care of the animals.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:22.940]   That's a whole thing.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:24.860]   That's tough.
[00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:27.980]   I mean, I deal with a lot of animal stuff in our lab too.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:28.780]   Like with the rats.
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:31.660]   The rats are a lot nicer than the mice.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:33.740]   Oh.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:35.420]   But I think they're dealing with monkeys, right?
[00:18:35.420 --> 00:18:36.880]   Yeah.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:37.900]   No, they're doing everything.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:39.180]   They do mice too, I think.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:40.460]   But they're monkeys.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.220]   And they make them super happy.
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:42.940]   And pigs too.
[00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.540]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.740]   I did Gigafactory opening.
[00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:50.140]   There's like an animal zoo you can rent.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:55.260]   You can rent folks that, like they'll bring a bunch of animals and you get to play with them.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:58.700]   They're petting, like it's a cool thing for a party.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:03.180]   If you just order a bunch of animals, you get to pet them like a goat and a bunny.
[00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.340]   You're talking about petting zoos?
[00:19:05.340 --> 00:19:05.980]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:06.780]   But they're portable.
[00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.140]   Like you can bring it to your party.
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:08.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.220]   Those exist.
[00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:12.620]   They usually come to like children's parties.
[00:19:12.620 --> 00:19:14.140]   Yeah, it was awesome.
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:16.060]   Yeah, they're great.
[00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:17.580]   I will forever be a child.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:19.420]   Do you see any bad guys?
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:20.140]   Because...
[00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.820]   Nobody hears someone shooting.
[00:19:21.820 --> 00:19:22.320]   Where?
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.360]   I don't know.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:23.860]   Out there?
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:25.500]   They're shooting at someone.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.740]   I feel like they're just shooting.
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:29.580]   They're just shooting at some of the things.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.080]   Like...
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.900]   Is it aiming at them?
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:32.700]   Trying to look cool.
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:33.740]   They're shooting for the gram.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:34.960]   I don't know.
[00:19:34.960 --> 00:19:37.420]   It's like you're going to the gun range.
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:42.380]   It's like me wearing the...
[00:19:42.380 --> 00:19:47.200]   The kilt.
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:48.620]   At the gym.
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.140]   I think I might eat the protein bar that's in your fridge.
[00:19:52.140 --> 00:19:52.640]   It's not...
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:54.300]   Can I just have a bite of it?
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.980]   Because I feel like my blood sugar is really low.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.040]   Okay.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.340]   It's not that good.
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:19:59.840]   Is it?
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.500]   Does this have sugar in it?
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:03.420]   No.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:04.540]   Sadly not.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:05.820]   Maybe I'll drink some of that.
[00:20:05.820 --> 00:20:06.540]   Maybe it'll help me.
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:12.060]   I killed the last of them.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:14.220]   The last of what?
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.980]   Of the Powerade things?
[00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:16.700]   No, no.
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:17.660]   The last guy.
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:18.700]   You did?
[00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:19.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.460]   Okay, let me just see.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.300]   I think they actually...
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.860]   The AI in this game is pretty shitty because it couldn't...
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.940]   It didn't pick up?
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:28.220]   They were just shooting around.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:29.740]   They couldn't figure out what the enemy is.
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.820]   And the enemy couldn't figure out what the good guys are.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.380]   And kill without thought.
[00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:34.880]   You're in.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.040]   Whoa.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:40.460]   Why did you buy that one?
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:42.320]   What do you mean?
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.140]   That protein bar.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:51.020]   Because I went out yesterday and it was past midnight.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:52.700]   And I wasn't sure where to get food.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.420]   So that's when you decided to eat?
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:56.620]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.420]   I was ambitious.
[00:20:57.420 --> 00:20:59.500]   I got a different flavor and it was pretty good.
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.380]   What are they shooting at?
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.260]   Oh, there you go.
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:03.760]   There you go.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:14.620]   Am I still shooting at somebody?
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.120]   Oh.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:22.400]   Advance or defend?
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.020]   Advance.
[00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.300]   All men die.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:26.640]   I think you should mount a horse.
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:28.080]   Not all men truly live.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:29.380]   I shouldn't...
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.640]   You should mount a horse?
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:31.140]   What?
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:33.680]   I think it would be more fun and quicker.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.120]   But you don't look as cool.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.080]   Look how I'm walking.
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.680]   No cover.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.720]   Not crouching anymore.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.520]   Not crouching.
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.620]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.220]   You've made me angry.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:48.500]   When I get angry, I don't crouch.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:54.900]   You ever play shooters like Call of Duty?
[00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.540]   I'm not as into it.
[00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:58.740]   I like when there's a story.
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:06.340]   No, with Call of Duty, I think there's a story mode, like single player.
[00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:07.060]   There is.
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:07.620]   There is.
[00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.580]   But it's more like...
[00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:11.620]   It's a lot of like this, but not as...
[00:22:11.620 --> 00:22:13.620]   Scenic.
[00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:15.620]   It's also a little bit more military oriented.
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:16.900]   So if you're into that kind of thing.
[00:22:16.900 --> 00:22:19.620]   I don't know which direction I'm being shot from.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:26.340]   It doesn't show you on the map.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.260]   Oh, I guess not.
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.500]   They're running away.
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:33.940]   I took care of everything.
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:34.440]   Thank you.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.380]   What would I do without you?
[00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:38.440]   I don't know.
[00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:39.260]   I don't know.
[00:22:39.260 --> 00:22:43.720]   Oh, I need to just chill with the guys, I think.
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:45.960]   Oh, we're going into different buildings.
[00:22:45.960 --> 00:22:50.380]   Nice.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.580]   Okay.
[00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:58.840]   I like that we're delegating duties here.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.280]   That's great.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:05.480]   I mean, if there's anything I love to do in a game, it is forage.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:05.980]   Forage stuff.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:06.760]   And gather.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.400]   That's great.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:07.900]   Fun.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.300]   You can do all of the fighting.
[00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:13.420]   I'm not good at fighting in this either.
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.120]   We're learning.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.500]   I like the "we" in that.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:20.300]   It feels like a team.
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:22.220]   This is great.
[00:23:22.220 --> 00:23:28.140]   I really thought this game would be way worse.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:32.860]   Well, you didn't like Zelda, so I think that's why.
[00:23:32.860 --> 00:23:35.740]   Yeah, we should mention we played Zelda for a little bit before.
[00:23:35.740 --> 00:23:39.020]   And it was too fun.
[00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:39.820]   It was too adventure.
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:41.740]   It was too shallow.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.740]   You like the accents in this game better?
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.820]   Yeah, this game is gritty.
[00:23:47.820 --> 00:23:48.320]   It's like...
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:52.380]   It feels like a movie I'd want to watch.
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:24:00.140]   Do you think you were a cowboy in a past life?
[00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:02.380]   What made you decide to live in Texas?
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.140]   What guy would answer no to that?
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:05.660]   No, I was...
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:12.300]   I was more of a carrot farmer.
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:16.940]   Like some very insignificant vegetable.
[00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:20.780]   Of course I was a...
[00:24:20.780 --> 00:24:22.700]   No, you know what?
[00:24:22.700 --> 00:24:23.420]   Not a cowboy.
[00:24:23.420 --> 00:24:25.180]   Because the cowboys are the good guys usually, right?
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.020]   I think so.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.340]   Or I mean...
[00:24:29.340 --> 00:24:30.380]   I was a bank robber.
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:31.840]   Bank robber?
[00:24:34.380 --> 00:24:34.880]   Do you...
[00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:38.060]   So you think that being a criminal would be a lot of fun?
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:41.500]   Yeah, I like the challenge of it.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.720]   Yeah.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:48.540]   I don't like the murder, but sometimes you have to do what you have to do to get the job done.
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:49.260]   It's like a puzzle.
[00:24:49.260 --> 00:24:51.660]   I'm just speaking like a cowboy would.
[00:24:51.660 --> 00:24:54.160]   No.
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:58.940]   No, I think it actually would be, in this context, super challenging to...
[00:24:58.940 --> 00:25:01.260]   Without hurting anybody to steal money.
[00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:01.900]   But you're going to hurt a lot of people.
[00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.020]   It's also very stressful.
[00:25:03.340 --> 00:25:07.420]   If you rob a bank in a small town at that time, you're probably hurting a lot of people.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:09.580]   You think so?
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:10.780]   You think you have to kill someone?
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.780]   No, I mean like financially.
[00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:13.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.860]   That town is probably dependent on the bank.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.160]   Although like...
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.780]   It's a really good show, Yellowstone.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:20.860]   Oh, that's a great show.
[00:25:20.860 --> 00:25:21.500]   It's a great show.
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:22.220]   I've seen it.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:22.860]   You've seen it?
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:23.920]   Good job.
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:24.460]   There's cowboys.
[00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:26.460]   It's more like a modern...
[00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:28.620]   I mean, it's, you know...
[00:25:30.620 --> 00:25:41.820]   Without going into cowboy sounding cliches, there's a certain kind of ethic and value system you live under that I think is in part admirable.
[00:25:41.820 --> 00:25:44.460]   Oh, I clicked the wrong thing.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:45.820]   What happened?
[00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:50.300]   Oh, we didn't get there in time.
[00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:50.800]   Oh.
[00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.420]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:54.300]   We were chatting too much.
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:54.860]   I got this.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.820]   Yeah, whatever.
[00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:56.940]   It's just beautiful.
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:59.900]   I like kind of chilling and walking around this world.
[00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:04.700]   Does it make you sad that we'll have cyborgs and robots and AI?
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:10.380]   No, I think if we merge with it, we have a really optimistic looking future.
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:13.260]   But you're gonna lose some of the...
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.820]   This kind of cowboy humanness, you know?
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:21.020]   Well, I think that your humanness will be enhanced.
[00:26:21.020 --> 00:26:25.340]   Like the same way that, you know, money makes you rich, sure.
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:28.220]   But it just amplifies whatever type of person you are.
[00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:30.060]   I think it'll be the same thing with AI.
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.740]   Like it's just a current...
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:36.540]   It's amplifying whatever interests you have.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:45.500]   So if you're very interested in, I don't know, art, you're going to be able to download all of art history and have access to it at any time that you need it.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:51.100]   Was that the guy that I was supposed to shoot?
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.720]   No.
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:54.000]   Oh.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:55.900]   Oh, I think so.
[00:26:57.900 --> 00:26:58.460]   Don't hurt me.
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.520]   I'll be.
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.640]   Just...
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.980]   Is don't hurt me...
[00:27:01.980 --> 00:27:04.220]   Is he dying or...?
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:08.620]   Is that like a reverse psychology or what?
[00:27:08.620 --> 00:27:15.900]   I think he has to die.
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:17.660]   Was I not supposed to kill him?
[00:27:17.660 --> 00:27:20.000]   Damn it.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:20.800]   Oh no.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:23.100]   You weren't supposed to kill him.
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:24.400]   Oh no.
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:28.620]   I think we're not paying attention to the mission and I think it's better that way.
[00:27:28.620 --> 00:27:30.060]   I think it's more entertaining.
[00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:30.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:32.620]   I thought for sure he was trying to trick you.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:36.460]   Yeah, I'm definitely excited about AI, but you have to be...
[00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:39.180]   You definitely have to be cautious.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:44.460]   Especially about which companies get the control of it.
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.300]   I like the more companies, the more people have control.
[00:27:48.300 --> 00:27:51.660]   Supervisor control of AI systems is better.
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:53.180]   Distributed.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:57.260]   That's the cool thing about ChadGBT is like it's pretty easy to build.
[00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:59.740]   Relatively speaking.
[00:27:59.740 --> 00:28:02.300]   So a lot of companies will be doing it.
[00:28:02.300 --> 00:28:11.740]   I just lassoed him.
[00:28:11.740 --> 00:28:12.540]   How did you know that?
[00:28:12.540 --> 00:28:15.020]   Wait, did you do that?
[00:28:15.020 --> 00:28:15.580]   Yeah, I did.
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.600]   What?
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:18.380]   What did you...?
[00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.260]   Oh wait, wait, wait.
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:19.820]   What did I do?
[00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:20.380]   Hold on.
[00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.020]   What did I do?
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:21.660]   What did I do?
[00:28:21.660 --> 00:28:22.220]   What did I do?
[00:28:22.220 --> 00:28:22.780]   What did I do?
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:23.340]   Hold on.
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:24.460]   Why is it going this way?
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:26.300]   Okay, that started so nice.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.580]   I know, that really went well.
[00:28:27.580 --> 00:28:28.940]   Don't hurt me.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:30.380]   Okay, hold on.
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.180]   Why is the horse...
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.620]   LT ready to lasso.
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:33.340]   Throw the lasso.
[00:28:33.340 --> 00:28:33.840]   RT.
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:34.340]   Cool.
[00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:36.860]   All right.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.300]   Now you're just flirting with him.
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.500]   And then dismount.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.380]   Oh, did you kill him?
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:41.100]   I think you killed him.
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:42.860]   Press B near...
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.420]   Oh, hog tying him.
[00:28:45.420 --> 00:28:46.620]   Oh, nice.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:52.140]   He's really playing dead for you.
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:53.920]   He's done.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:29:00.060]   Hold X near and just kind of pick him up.
[00:29:00.060 --> 00:29:01.680]   All right.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.940]   Are we kidnapping him?
[00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:05.440]   I think so.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:10.460]   Approach the back of your horse and hold X to stow him?
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:12.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:12.480 --> 00:29:13.500]   Okay.
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:14.860]   I don't really think it's kidnapping.
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:19.100]   He's like broken, dying in the middle of the wilderness.
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.700]   I think you're saving him, honestly.
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.700]   All right, let's get back on the horse, I guess.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:38.380]   Wow, this winter is brutal.
[00:29:38.380 --> 00:29:42.940]   Do you think people will have relationships with AI systems?
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.260]   Because the AI system will be able to, I think, guess your needs very quickly.
[00:29:49.260 --> 00:29:50.380]   But I think it'll get boring.
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.680]   I think it'll be...
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.900]   It'll be too perfect?
[00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.060]   Would you date a robot?
[00:29:56.060 --> 00:29:59.200]   Maybe.
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:00.620]   Maybe for a little bit.
[00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.940]   I don't think it would be as fun as dating a human, though.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.060]   Especially if humans merge with technology.
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:06.560]   Sure.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:11.980]   Fun. That's an interesting word.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.580]   Yeah, I suspect that robots would be too perfect.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.520]   But if it's...
[00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:24.620]   I think the human merging with the AI would be a very interesting combo.
[00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:25.420]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:30:25.420 --> 00:30:31.100]   Because then you wouldn't have this laggy brain that's like forgetting things.
[00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:35.500]   You would have more interesting conversations and you would have like
[00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:38.300]   all of your passions.
[00:30:38.300 --> 00:30:42.780]   You would be able to dive in deep to them and then come up with really great ideas on
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.780]   how to explore those ideas and research would become more intuitive, I think.
[00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:49.900]   Yeah, it's a tricky thing because you want some...
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:53.420]   Like life should still have some challenge.
[00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:57.340]   It feels like a lot of our development happens in the face of challenge.
[00:30:57.340 --> 00:31:00.700]   But we just find new challenges with the...
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:06.940]   Even though we gain extra abilities, we'll still find stuff that's challenging.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:23.020]   This guy does not sound nice.
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:26.140]   Oh no, now all we'll get is lies.
[00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:31.420]   Uncle, Mr. Williamson, tie this maggot up someplace safe.
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.420]   We get him hungry first.
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:35.100]   I got a saying, my friend.
[00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:44.300]   You shoot fellas as need shooting, save fellas as need saving, and feed 'em as need feeding.
[00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:48.220]   We are gonna find out what you need.
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.020]   I can't believe it!
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:53.980]   An O'Driscoll in my camp!
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:55.340]   I ain't an O'Driscoll, missus!
[00:31:55.340 --> 00:31:57.180]   Is that how you dress in Boston?
[00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:58.540]   Pretty much.
[00:31:58.540 --> 00:32:01.260]   Pretty much.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:03.980]   It's too cold.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:09.900]   I would always underdress.
[00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:11.180]   Did you?
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:11.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.980]   Were you driving a lot?
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.420]   No, I didn't have a car.
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.980]   You do a threadline and bus.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:20.380]   I love it.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:21.180]   I love taking the T.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.140]   But I do bus much more.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:27.660]   And I'll stand at the bus stop freezing.
[00:32:27.660 --> 00:32:30.860]   There's an intimacy, there's a romance to the bus.
[00:32:30.860 --> 00:32:35.020]   There is some romance to standing outside while it's cold out.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:39.260]   Like you're bearing this cold, but why?
[00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:43.020]   Like what is it that you're doing that's so important that you need to be facing these
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:43.520]   elements?
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:48.300]   But you're also together with other people that are just standing there and suffering.
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:50.620]   And all pretending like we're not suffering, but we're suffering.
[00:32:51.020 --> 00:32:51.820]   Yeah.
[00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:54.460]   But then we're not really suffering because it's just cold.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:55.660]   It's just temporary too.
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:06.060]   No, I never understood the romance of like people would always post like "winter in Miami"
[00:33:06.060 --> 00:33:09.100]   and then post a picture of them on the beach.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:10.700]   Oh, I see.
[00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:11.820]   They're trolling.
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.500]   Wait, didn't you do that?
[00:33:13.500 --> 00:33:16.060]   I've never done that in my life.
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:17.740]   I feel like you sent me a picture of-
[00:33:17.740 --> 00:33:19.500]   I probably recently did that.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:20.540]   Like "winter in Miami".
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:21.500]   Oh, because you're now a boss.
[00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:22.860]   You feel like you've earned the right to-
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:23.820]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:24.300]   I got you.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:26.940]   We're going to starve to death up here, Mr. Morgan.
[00:33:26.940 --> 00:33:28.860]   We're okay.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:33.740]   We have a few cans of food and a rabbit.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:34.460]   For what?
[00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:35.500]   10, 12 people?
[00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.020]   When I was in the Navy, I do not-
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:42.700]   I was thinking about the barbecue.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:44.140]   What about it?
[00:33:44.140 --> 00:33:44.940]   That was so good.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:46.380]   Should we go back?
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.820]   Should.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:48.380]   I think so.
[00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.780]   I'm very up for that.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.420]   For the record, we went to Tara Black's barbecue.
[00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:54.140]   It was really good.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:55.660]   It's really, really good.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:56.380]   Oh, it's so great.
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:57.100]   I don't- it's funny.
[00:33:57.100 --> 00:33:58.460]   You take it for granted because I haven't-
[00:33:58.460 --> 00:33:59.980]   just haven't gone in a while.
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:01.420]   It's so delicious.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:02.300]   Where do you usually go?
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:05.980]   I just go to like restaurants or just eat at home.
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:07.660]   Because it like-
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:11.020]   I don't know why it's almost like too delicious, but-
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:12.620]   It's like a treat.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:14.540]   Yeah, it should be like a treat, but it's not really.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.220]   It is really special though when you do have it.
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:23.260]   Like because I feel like it takes a while to prepare that kind of food.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:25.180]   Like they're smoking it all day, right?
[00:34:25.180 --> 00:34:28.060]   And I like it because like when visitors come and you-
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:32.380]   go to like Tara Black's and you do the barbecue and you-
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.140]   It's crazy. It's so good.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.900]   And because there's so many like-
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:39.820]   the bar is so high and then they still deliver.
[00:34:39.820 --> 00:34:40.700]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.180]   That's cool.
[00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:44.300]   And it's consistently great.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:46.460]   Like every time you go, it's amazing.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.740]   You know, one time my dad and I went.
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.740]   My dad used to do his residency here.
[00:34:51.740 --> 00:34:54.380]   And he was so excited.
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.300]   He was like, "I can't wait to go have barbecue.
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:58.060]   I'm so excited you're going to live in Texas."
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:34:58.620]   All this stuff.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:01.820]   We ate way too much and we got so sick afterwards.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.900]   That's the challenge.
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.580]   There's a few tech-
[00:35:05.580 --> 00:35:08.540]   tech folks here.
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:09.500]   They're really cool.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:09.740]   They-
[00:35:09.740 --> 00:35:11.180]   we went out with them.
[00:35:11.180 --> 00:35:13.900]   But we got trashed.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:14.620]   Like whiskey.
[00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:17.180]   Just so drunk.
[00:35:17.180 --> 00:35:19.500]   And what I didn't realize is when I'm that drunk,
[00:35:19.500 --> 00:35:21.100]   the-
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.340]   whatever module in my brain that says don't stop eating was off.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:25.580]   Off.
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:28.220]   Yeah, because your body is so relaxed.
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:29.740]   And I'm having fun.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:34.220]   And then all of a sudden it's a good idea to order like 10 pounds of meat.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:34.860]   And then you're just-
[00:35:34.860 --> 00:35:35.340]   Eat all of it?
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:36.140]   Well, not just me.
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:37.100]   Like everybody together.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:38.700]   And we're just eating and just-
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:40.060]   And it's-
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:42.620]   it's so hard to stop because it's so freaking delicious.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:43.420]   And then you're drunk.
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:43.660]   Wait.
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:45.820]   That's happiness.
[00:35:45.820 --> 00:35:46.700]   It's delicious.
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:47.660]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:48.940]   It's great while you're eating it.
[00:35:48.940 --> 00:35:52.140]   You know what I've noticed about unhealthy foods or like treats?
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:54.540]   It's always really fun while you're eating it.
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:58.700]   But before and after, there's always this feeling of like regret.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:35:59.500]   Yeah.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:35:59.900]   Or like-
[00:35:59.900 --> 00:36:02.940]   like before you eat a cupcake or something,
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.380]   I always feel this feeling of like,
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:08.460]   I'm really gonna regret this after I eat it, but I really want it.
[00:36:08.460 --> 00:36:10.060]   And then while I'm eating it, I'm like enjoying it.
[00:36:10.060 --> 00:36:11.180]   I'm like, oh, this is so good.
[00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:12.380]   I want like another one.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:14.540]   And then afterwards, I'm like, why did I do that?
[00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:14.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:17.580]   I have to really work on that to walk away.
[00:36:17.580 --> 00:36:21.980]   Walk away while you really want a thing and you say, nope, no more.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:27.820]   God, that looks beautiful.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:28.380]   Look at that.
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:32.220]   Do you ski?
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.180]   I have.
[00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:39.180]   Yeah, I did like grew up cross-country skiing.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.940]   Like I'm, you know, not downhill.
[00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:43.260]   I don't know what that is.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.140]   I was born in the-
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.020]   You were born-
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:48.380]   On the mountains with the goats.
[00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:50.860]   No, I don't really-
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:51.980]   With goats?
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.100]   Why goats?
[00:36:53.100 --> 00:36:54.620]   Because they're really good with the mountains.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:36:55.260]   You don't know a lot of things.
[00:36:55.260 --> 00:36:55.660]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:59.340]   Aren't they the ones that they stand on the edges of?
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:00.300]   I have an inner goat.
[00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:00.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:01.500]   What's your best?
[00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:06.220]   What's your favorite really bad meal that you shouldn't be eating?
[00:37:06.220 --> 00:37:09.420]   My favorite really bad meal that I shouldn't be eating?
[00:37:10.540 --> 00:37:11.100]   Cheap meal.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.820]   Like something naughty.
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.620]   Probably like fried chicken.
[00:37:18.620 --> 00:37:21.980]   I love fried chicken.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:22.700]   Like what kind?
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:24.460]   I don't think I've had much fried chicken.
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:26.300]   So talking about like KFC like-
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:28.780]   No, so there's this grocery store in Miami.
[00:37:28.780 --> 00:37:32.540]   It's called Publix and they have the best fried chicken.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:33.740]   Like it's so good.
[00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.740]   Or like in like the little spot that keeps it warm.
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:36.940]   Yes, yep.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:37.740]   And it's so good.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:38.380]   And they have like chicken tenders.
[00:37:38.380 --> 00:37:40.380]   It's gonna be super crispy and all that.
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.260]   Oh, it's so good.
[00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.100]   It's great.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.340]   With sauce of some kind?
[00:37:45.340 --> 00:37:45.820]   No sauce.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.780]   I'm not a sauce person.
[00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:47.740]   Okay.
[00:37:47.740 --> 00:37:48.540]   Are you saucy?
[00:37:48.540 --> 00:37:49.180]   No respect.
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:50.460]   Are you saucy?
[00:37:50.460 --> 00:37:50.860]   No, I'm not.
[00:37:50.860 --> 00:37:52.380]   No, I'm not saucy at all.
[00:37:52.380 --> 00:37:53.580]   I'm just giving you respect.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.460]   The people that cover themselves with sauce are the people that-
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.660]   You scare everything around.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:38:00.460]   Are you being the saucist?
[00:38:00.460 --> 00:38:01.900]   100%.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:06.140]   The people that I'll have people here in Texas who are like
[00:38:09.260 --> 00:38:14.940]   legit barbecue like aficionados or whatever you call that.
[00:38:14.940 --> 00:38:15.740]   The selectable.
[00:38:15.740 --> 00:38:18.380]   They will put sauce on their barbecue.
[00:38:18.380 --> 00:38:19.660]   They'll like dip it and stuff.
[00:38:19.660 --> 00:38:21.340]   They'll have like different sauces, right?
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:22.780]   I did that the last time I think.
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:23.100]   You did?
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:24.700]   I put a little bit of sauce on my barbecue.
[00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:25.100]   It's not cool.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:26.380]   It's disrespecting the meat.
[00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.220]   It's just not cool.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.140]   It's like putting ketchup on a steak, on an aged steak.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:36.540]   I don't judge people for putting sauce, but for certain things I don't need sauce.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.500]   I don't judge people.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.900]   It sounds like you're very emotionally charged for this.
[00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:42.140]   For anything except-
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:42.620]   Putting sauce.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.020]   Except putting sauce on their barbecue.
[00:38:45.020 --> 00:38:47.340]   It's the one thing I judge them on.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:48.220]   No, I don't care.
[00:38:48.220 --> 00:38:49.580]   But it is-
[00:38:49.580 --> 00:38:50.060]   I like-
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:50.380]   I like-
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:51.260]   What am I looking for?
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:52.940]   Great basic ingredients.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:56.220]   Why is it all slow motion?
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:38:58.460]   Because I activated eagle eye.
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:38:59.820]   I just don't know what I'm looking for.
[00:38:59.820 --> 00:39:04.780]   That's the problem is I keep chatting with you.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:05.980]   And forgetting what we're doing.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:07.500]   Oh shoot.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:10.700]   All right, check it out.
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:11.740]   Oh, it's there.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:11.980]   Okay.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:13.180]   Oh cool.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:13.740]   It has a-
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.380]   What is that?
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.540]   It's like a scent.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:17.020]   What is it?
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:24.140]   You're making too much noise.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:31.340]   It's easier in the snow, but once you get your eye in it,
[00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:34.060]   you'll be able to track Amelia as well in grass and woods.
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:35.180]   Okay.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.860]   So we're looking for an animal.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:40.460]   Okay, so then we focus on the track.
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.300]   And then-
[00:39:42.300 --> 00:39:48.860]   So all you have to do is press RB while focusing on the track.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.460]   I just don't know where the track went.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:51.900]   Oh, there we go.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:54.380]   So you see how it's like-
[00:39:54.380 --> 00:39:54.780]   Do you know-
[00:39:54.780 --> 00:39:56.140]   How do you know we're hunting for an animal?
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:56.380]   Stop.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:57.340]   Oh, stop tracking.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:57.660]   I see.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:03.020]   It's a giant TV and the text is blurry.
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:05.900]   I'm pretty sure my vision doesn't suck that bad.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.660]   No, it's definitely-
[00:40:07.660 --> 00:40:10.540]   I think it's just too much stimuli.
[00:40:10.540 --> 00:40:12.300]   Like it's like just a giant screen.
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:13.340]   You don't know where to look.
[00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:15.260]   Giant screen and low resolution or something.
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.060]   I don't know what it is.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.780]   It's just the quality.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:20.540]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:20.540 --> 00:40:21.020]   Oh yeah.
[00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:23.820]   Is there any other ones?
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:29.500]   Go get them.
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:30.220]   Go get the meat.
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:32.780]   I don't know how to uncrouch.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.060]   Press this button.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.900]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:39.260]   Let a man handle it.
[00:40:39.260 --> 00:40:46.860]   I like how you did the hunting and I'm now doing the-
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:48.380]   The gathering.
[00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:49.020]   The gathering.
[00:40:49.020 --> 00:40:50.140]   Oh, hey.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:51.020]   Hey.
[00:40:51.020 --> 00:40:52.060]   What the-
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:55.180]   Wouldn't it tell me to do stuff with it?
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.660]   No, you have to look for more deer.
[00:40:57.660 --> 00:40:58.700]   Okay.
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.260]   Why is he crouching?
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.300]   It looks like he's really trying to be stealth.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   Anyway, besides fried chicken, what else?
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:12.140]   I love sweets.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.100]   So I love chocolate.
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:13.740]   Dark?
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:13.740]   Dark?
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:16.380]   Mm, I'm a milk chocolate girl.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.660]   But I love dark chocolate.
[00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:18.460]   Yeah, me too.
[00:41:18.460 --> 00:41:20.700]   I'm a milk chocolate girl.
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:23.420]   Because it was-
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:23.820]   Yeah.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:24.940]   So much creamier.
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.660]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:26.300]   It's more delicious.
[00:41:26.300 --> 00:41:28.460]   But then like the sophisticated people-
[00:41:28.460 --> 00:41:29.820]   How do I run?
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.500]   Dark chocolate's not bad.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:31.820]   That's great.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:34.780]   I'll have dark chocolate with some nut butter in it.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.180]   But people will judge you because the real-
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:40.540]   If you're a real chocolate person, you're going to do dark chocolate because it's the
[00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:43.100]   more sophisticated, complicated flavor, right?
[00:41:43.100 --> 00:41:44.140]   That's fake.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:50.060]   That's like someone going to, I don't know, some restaurant and being like, "If you don't
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.380]   order this, then you didn't really go to that place."
[00:41:52.380 --> 00:41:53.500]   I don't think that really matters.
[00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:54.780]   I think it's all subjective.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.540]   Say we're like coffee.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.140]   I still drink instant coffee.
[00:41:58.140 --> 00:41:59.740]   I still drink instant coffee.
[00:41:59.740 --> 00:42:01.660]   Do you like instant coffee?
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:03.420]   I don't think I've ever had instant coffee.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.820]   I don't like to admit it because-
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:06.060]   Why?
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.020]   People say that-
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.620]   Because they don't consider instant coffee real coffee.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.660]   But I'm like, it's-
[00:42:11.660 --> 00:42:12.300]   It's coffee.
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:15.740]   And it's like reliable.
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:16.140]   Like it's-
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.820]   I can count on it.
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.780]   I know the flavor.
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:21.180]   It's good.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.980]   I know the amount.
[00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.060]   The aroma.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:26.220]   Like the whole point of-
[00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:26.940]   Not the whole point.
[00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:28.300]   Can you make it with hot water?
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:29.100]   Yeah, with hot water.
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:30.060]   Or just water?
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:30.620]   Hot water.
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:32.060]   Hot water.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:33.020]   I'm just running around.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.540]   Not that way.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:35.980]   What are you doing?
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:36.540]   How do you know?
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.420]   I just asked you.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:38.620]   Oh, so I should follow this guy?
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:39.740]   But he's just crouching.
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.140]   Well, you have to use your eagle eye.
[00:42:42.140 --> 00:42:44.380]   What's the eagle eye thing?
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.300]   It's these two.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:47.580]   You click them down at the same time.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:50.860]   And you got to look around because you're going to run out of eagle eye.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.580]   How do I?
[00:42:53.580 --> 00:42:54.860]   I think we lost the animal.
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.180]   Hold on.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:56.940]   Cancel it.
[00:42:56.940 --> 00:42:57.180]   Okay.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:58.620]   Wait.
[00:42:58.620 --> 00:43:00.060]   Don't do it yet.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:05.100]   Just go back to where that animal was and then look for the-
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.340]   Right.
[00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.620]   Then look for the scent.
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:12.140]   Chocolate.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.780]   What are your favorites?
[00:43:14.780 --> 00:43:19.420]   Like something naughty though.
[00:43:19.420 --> 00:43:21.260]   Because you eat very clean.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:25.660]   I don't think I use the word naughty to describe-
[00:43:25.660 --> 00:43:28.540]   With describing food, it makes me uncomfortable.
[00:43:28.540 --> 00:43:29.020]   Does it?
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:32.140]   Such a weird word to use.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.020]   I'm feeling naughty.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.220]   I don't think I feel naughty.
[00:43:34.220 --> 00:43:39.260]   I think that's just not in my vocabulary.
[00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:39.980]   The thought.
[00:43:39.980 --> 00:43:40.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.540]   Is this back?
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:43.420]   Is this where it is?
[00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:46.380]   Wherever the animal is.
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:47.980]   He's following you like that.
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:50.300]   I think he likes the view.
[00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:50.780]   I don't know.
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.540]   Oh, okay.
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:53.820]   So the animal's over there.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:58.700]   So get close to it and then just look around and I'm sure you'll find the scent.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:00.540]   I love baking, by the way.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:02.060]   Actually baking?
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:02.300]   Yeah.
[00:44:02.300 --> 00:44:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:05.580]   So cookies like oatmeal raisin.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.420]   That's the best cookies, oatmeal raisin.
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:08.700]   I've got a lot of trouble over this.
[00:44:08.700 --> 00:44:09.660]   Not chocolate chip?
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:10.380]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:12.220]   I went to war on Twitter over this.
[00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:14.380]   You're a chocolate chip girl?
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:15.660]   All right.
[00:44:15.660 --> 00:44:18.460]   So I'm doing oatmeal raisin for me.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:21.020]   Warm oatmeal raisin.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:23.580]   So one of my nephews really loves oatmeal raisin.
[00:44:23.580 --> 00:44:25.180]   The other one loves chocolate chip.
[00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:26.860]   One of my following is that?
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:27.100]   Yeah.
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:27.660]   That's a scent.
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:31.900]   Anyway, oatmeal raisin cookie, like a thick oatmeal raisin cookie.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.620]   Thick?
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:37.340]   No, the thin ones are like, it makes no sense.
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.500]   Cause it's not enough cookie?
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:39.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.900 --> 00:44:42.620]   There's not enough like meat.
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:43.980]   It's substance to the cookie.
[00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:44.380]   Good job.
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:50.940]   Just like a warm, thick oatmeal raisin cookie with some milk.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.860]   It's your jam.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:54.700]   With almond milk, actually.
[00:44:54.700 --> 00:44:55.420]   Almond milk?
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:56.060]   Yeah.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:56.780]   With a cookie.
[00:44:56.780 --> 00:45:00.460]   The creamy almond milk or like real almond milk?
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:02.300]   I don't know what real almond milk is.
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:05.180]   Real, but not sweetened.
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:05.740]   Not sweet.
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:07.580]   Unsweetened.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.980]   Who's whistling?
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:12.780]   Looking for the horse.
[00:45:12.780 --> 00:45:16.220]   Got to take this deer on the horse.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:16.780]   Oh, there it is.
[00:45:16.780 --> 00:45:18.220]   Nice.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:20.380]   This horse is great.
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.900]   What's your favorite cookie?
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:22.620]   Chocolate chip.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:22.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.860 --> 00:45:26.380]   I love a chocolate chip cookie because there's so many different ways of making it.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:27.580]   I'm sure there's the same thing for...
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:29.500]   You're just going to leave the animal?
[00:45:29.500 --> 00:45:30.380]   No, I'm going to grab it.
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:31.420]   I had to move the horse.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:34.060]   So I had the option to grab it.
[00:45:34.060 --> 00:45:38.860]   So you can make like cakey chocolate chip cookies.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:39.420]   Sure.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:41.500]   You can make like a gooey chocolate chip cookie.
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:42.860]   You can make a chewy one.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.860]   Maybe chewy gooey.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:45.660]   Chewy gooey.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.580]   It depends on what, like you can add molasses.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.980]   Do you want it to crumble or do you want it to be chewy?
[00:45:51.980 --> 00:45:53.020]   I don't like a crispy.
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:53.820]   I like chewy.
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:54.300]   Yeah, good.
[00:45:54.300 --> 00:46:02.780]   Job's off.
[00:46:02.780 --> 00:46:10.300]   There's a, you know, growing up in, I think it's like in the Soviet Union that had,
[00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:15.340]   I think there's a kind of cake.
[00:46:15.340 --> 00:46:21.260]   I don't know how they call it in English, but it's a muravina kucha, which is an ant hill cake.
[00:46:21.260 --> 00:46:22.380]   I think. Is it like an angel?
[00:46:22.380 --> 00:46:25.100]   No, it's a condensed milk.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.020]   Oh, well, the bunch of, you know, condensed milk is.
[00:46:29.020 --> 00:46:30.060]   Yes, of course.
[00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:30.620]   Of course.
[00:46:30.620 --> 00:46:31.740]   I'm Cuban.
[00:46:31.740 --> 00:46:32.940]   Oh, let's check on this.
[00:46:32.940 --> 00:46:35.740]   Uh, I don't do Cubans do this kind of thing.
[00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.100]   What do they use it for?
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:40.460]   You use it for a lot of different things, but desserts, desserts.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:41.260]   Yes.
[00:46:41.260 --> 00:46:44.620]   You can also, yeah, you can make a lot of different things with it.
[00:46:44.620 --> 00:46:45.580]   It's delicious.
[00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:46.220]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.220]   It's like very sweet and gooey.
[00:46:48.220 --> 00:46:48.380]   Okay.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.580]   It's a cake with, I don't know, it's called ant hill.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.700]   People can look it up.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:55.180]   It's great.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:47:00.460]   And it was just a source of happiness because my mom would make it every year for my birthday.
[00:47:00.460 --> 00:47:01.180]   So.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.220]   Oh, that's delicious.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:09.100]   But then you like, as you grow up, you realize like, oh, this is probably really bad for you.
[00:47:09.100 --> 00:47:11.340]   Yeah, it's not great.
[00:47:11.340 --> 00:47:14.060]   And I'm the only one that eats it.
[00:47:14.060 --> 00:47:15.660]   So when she makes it, it's like.
[00:47:15.660 --> 00:47:16.620]   Entire cake for you.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:21.740]   Am I going to do like this 20,000 calorie contraption?
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:23.660]   Am I really going to take this on?
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:26.060]   And I do because I can't do a slice of it.
[00:47:26.060 --> 00:47:27.820]   No, you just keep going.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:29.260]   The gods of cake.
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:33.180]   So your mom likes to bake too?
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:34.220]   Yeah.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:36.060]   What else does she bake?
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:40.780]   What else does your, like, what is your favorite thing?
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.900]   Like a home cooked meal?
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:50.300]   You know, it's like, I don't, I think it's just being with family is the favorite thing
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:52.700]   versus like a specific meal.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:54.060]   Probably like barbecuing.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.300]   Like, you know, I'll usually grill.
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:47:56.940]   I'll make meat.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:02.860]   So just getting together around a grill.
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.300]   And then enjoying the meal with family.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:08.620]   And then just drink like whiskey, vodka.
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:09.180]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.940]   I feel that way about traveling.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.460]   Like people romanticize going to different places, but I think it's really about the
[00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:15.420]   company that you keep.
[00:48:15.420 --> 00:48:23.260]   It almost feels like we're having a conversation, but we're actually on a horse having a conversation.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.540]   It does feel like we're on a horse.
[00:48:24.540 --> 00:48:27.980]   Which one am I and which one are you?
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:29.740]   I think they look the same.
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:33.340]   Look how big that deer is.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:35.340]   I'm backing my horse.
[00:48:35.340 --> 00:48:35.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:37.900]   It's kind of incredible.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:39.340]   This game just looks beautiful.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:39.580]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:40.460]   It's like realistic.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:50.860]   Wait, did you say bear?
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:51.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:51.900]   What do we do with that?
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.180]   Oh, I got to get on my horse.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:55.580]   It's a bear.
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:58.700]   What are we going to do about the bear?
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.620]   Aim weapon?
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:01.020]   RT?
[00:49:01.020 --> 00:49:06.540]   All right.
[00:49:06.540 --> 00:49:07.660]   I guess we won't shoot it.
[00:49:07.660 --> 00:49:08.940]   Could be cocaine bear.
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:10.700]   It looks like cocaine bear.
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:11.500]   Look how big it is.
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:16.380]   Actually, in the trailer for cocaine bear, the cocaine bear doesn't look big.
[00:49:16.380 --> 00:49:17.580]   He doesn't?
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:19.180]   He looked kind of skinny.
[00:49:19.180 --> 00:49:20.940]   Well, he's a CGI now.
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:21.500]   Yeah.
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:27.980]   I understand this, but I think they realized they can't make the cocaine bear fat because then...
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.980]   Because then he would be lazy.
[00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:31.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:31.900]   It would be slow moving.
[00:49:31.900 --> 00:49:35.500]   You have to have like a skinny agile bear.
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:35.740]   Yeah.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.660]   Like just woke up from hibernation.
[00:49:37.660 --> 00:49:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:39.020]   Took some cocaine.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:40.620]   Accidentally.
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:42.700]   Took some cocaine and just go nuts.
[00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:45.980]   I really want to see that movie just to see...
[00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:48.220]   Like how far they take it?
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:54.620]   Like how can you have a movie for two hours on a premise that feels like it should not last longer?
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:59.500]   It feels like a joke that you say amongst friends for like 10 minutes.
[00:49:59.500 --> 00:50:01.660]   And like maximum 10 minutes.
[00:50:01.660 --> 00:50:05.100]   Like you have like this weird banter about it and it gets weird after like three minutes.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:06.620]   So literally...
[00:50:06.620 --> 00:50:09.980]   This is based on a true story, right?
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:11.500]   So literally they're going to...
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:12.300]   I love the movie.
[00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:14.220]   It is.
[00:50:14.220 --> 00:50:18.140]   There was some cocaine in the woods, dropped off in the woods.
[00:50:18.140 --> 00:50:18.380]   All right.
[00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:23.420]   So they're going to do that and they're going to say, "Oh, it looks like some bear ate into it."
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:23.660]   Okay.
[00:50:23.660 --> 00:50:25.580]   That takes like two minutes to introduce.
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:27.900]   What else is there?
[00:50:27.900 --> 00:50:30.940]   Maybe half the movie is just like the cocaine story.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:32.620]   Yeah, could be.
[00:50:35.580 --> 00:50:40.540]   Or maybe like looking at how the cocaine changes the relationship the bear has with his family
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:45.900]   and other bears going like the Lion King way.
[00:50:45.900 --> 00:50:46.700]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:50:46.700 --> 00:50:49.340]   It's a very silly movie.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:52.860]   It could be like a cool action film.
[00:50:52.860 --> 00:50:54.140]   Maybe they're going like...
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.980]   I think it might be hilarious.
[00:50:55.980 --> 00:50:57.100]   Kills a bunch of...
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:50:58.700]   Like the bear kills a bunch of people.
[00:50:58.700 --> 00:51:02.860]   I almost hope that it's really dumb because I think it would be funnier that way.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:04.380]   I hope Liam Nielsen is in it.
[00:51:05.340 --> 00:51:05.900]   Who's not?
[00:51:05.900 --> 00:51:06.460]   Liam Nielsen.
[00:51:06.460 --> 00:51:07.660]   He made a giant mistake.
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:09.660]   For stealing my daughter.
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:12.860]   He would call it a bear.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:14.140]   Is that the guy from Taken?
[00:51:14.140 --> 00:51:14.700]   Yeah, Taken.
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:19.180]   I am a sucker for those movies.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:19.580]   For Taken?
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.340]   I am taking all of them.
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.620]   He's in a bunch of...
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:26.620]   He plays the same exact guy and he is such a badass.
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:28.220]   Those movies freaked me out.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.620]   I think it was probably a good thing.
[00:51:30.620 --> 00:51:32.940]   I'd love to talk to him on the podcast.
[00:51:32.940 --> 00:51:34.620]   He's a really, really interesting dude.
[00:51:34.620 --> 00:51:35.820]   And he like...
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:38.220]   Same with...
[00:51:38.220 --> 00:51:39.740]   What's the guy from Breaking Bad?
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:44.060]   I don't know his name but I know who you're talking about.
[00:51:44.060 --> 00:51:45.260]   Aaron something?
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:45.580]   No, no.
[00:51:45.580 --> 00:51:46.380]   The other guy.
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.100]   The older guy.
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:48.620]   I don't know what his name is.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.940]   Bryan Cranston, I want to say.
[00:51:50.940 --> 00:51:53.260]   He's like a badass in real life too.
[00:51:53.260 --> 00:51:54.380]   I like it when you're like...
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.260]   When you don't just play the part.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:58.300]   Like it's part of who you are.
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:03.420]   I feel like playing the part made him more of a badass.
[00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:03.580]   Interesting.
[00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:04.700]   And he embraced it.
[00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:07.740]   The part changed him and that's really cool.
[00:52:07.740 --> 00:52:16.140]   I mean when you play a meth dealer for like 10 seasons, whatever it is, that's gonna change you.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.180]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.220]   I mean it's part of you now.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:27.340]   It's like when you do any job, it becomes...
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.220]   It consumes you.
[00:52:29.100 --> 00:52:29.340]   Yeah.
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:33.900]   You've been working like crazy, right?
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:34.940]   I work a lot, yeah.
[00:52:34.940 --> 00:52:36.780]   I work like 60 or 70 hours a week.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.940]   That's good.
[00:52:38.940 --> 00:52:40.300]   I love it.
[00:52:40.300 --> 00:52:41.180]   Hard work is good.
[00:52:41.180 --> 00:52:42.700]   Yeah, it's important.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:52.540]   Dark.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:53:14.780]   It's interesting, you know, when you spend 60 or 70 hours a week doing something.
[00:53:14.780 --> 00:53:17.100]   Because before that I wasn't working.
[00:53:17.100 --> 00:53:21.100]   It's like become my entire life.
[00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:22.300]   It's all that I think about.
[00:53:22.300 --> 00:53:27.580]   To the point that sometimes when I'll go to a restaurant, I'll see an elderly person,
[00:53:27.580 --> 00:53:29.340]   a person who's having a hard time walking.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:30.940]   And I'm like, "I should be in the lab working."
[00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.340]   Like, "What am I doing? Why am I here?"
[00:53:33.340 --> 00:53:34.060]   That's really good.
[00:53:34.060 --> 00:53:35.420]   That means you really care about it.
[00:53:35.420 --> 00:53:40.700]   I mean you were talking about it when I met you, about prosthetics and all that kind of stuff.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.820]   That was a passion.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:41.980]   Yeah.
[00:53:41.980 --> 00:53:44.940]   It's cool that you like found that passion in this work.
[00:53:44.940 --> 00:53:45.420]   It's great.
[00:53:45.420 --> 00:53:46.300]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.300 --> 00:53:49.340]   I'm skinning a deer.
[00:53:49.340 --> 00:53:53.340]   There we go.
[00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.420]   I'm kidding.
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:58.940]   Did you have to press something?
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.420]   Just why?
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:04.620]   Did you do any animal work ever?
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:09.020]   Yeah, dissecting in high school and college.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:12.460]   Yeah, for anatomy and physiology.
[00:54:12.460 --> 00:54:17.500]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:22.140]   I miss high school for the educational aspects.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:24.220]   Were you funny in high school?
[00:54:24.220 --> 00:54:26.940]   What were you like in high school?
[00:54:26.940 --> 00:54:27.980]   Very stoic.
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.100]   Very read a lot.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.980]   And wrestling and sports.
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:34.620]   And just that.
[00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.860]   Was there any book that really shaped you in high school?
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:39.900]   Yeah, like a lot.
[00:54:39.900 --> 00:54:40.380]   A lot.
[00:54:40.380 --> 00:54:47.900]   First it was "The Stranger," which is probably by Albert Camus.
[00:54:48.620 --> 00:54:49.120]   He...
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:54.860]   It's like I just re-read it recently and it's not nearly as good.
[00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:56.780]   As when you read it in those formative years?
[00:54:56.780 --> 00:54:59.740]   I've read other books that I've read it and they're much better.
[00:54:59.740 --> 00:55:04.060]   Or is it not as good in comparison to books that you've read after that?
[00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:08.700]   See, there's other books like "Dusty Eskett Gets Better and Better as I Get Older,"
[00:55:08.700 --> 00:55:10.300]   and I read that in high school.
[00:55:10.300 --> 00:55:12.220]   But "The Stranger" was like, "Meh."
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:16.860]   But it's the first time I had this feeling of existentialism of like...
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.260]   It's the first time I really intensely felt like, "What's the meaning of it all?"
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:22.940]   I felt it.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:23.580]   And I just...
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:24.940]   Like an existential...
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.640]   Interesting.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.780]   And then, of course, you take it way too seriously.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:34.220]   Yeah, and you get really depressed and nervous.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:35.440]   Yeah.
[00:55:35.440 --> 00:55:45.500]   You know the one that really hit me is "Animal Farm."
[00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:47.420]   Oh, that's a great book.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:51.500]   Can I tell you which character I like the most and then you tell me which one you like the most?
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:52.000]   Sure, let's go.
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.260]   Can you guess?
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:58.220]   Uh, well, it's not the pigs.
[00:55:58.220 --> 00:56:01.740]   Is it the...
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:04.860]   Molly, the horse that likes pretty...
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:06.780]   How dare you?
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:11.420]   Uh, Benjamin the donkey.
[00:56:11.420 --> 00:56:12.540]   Nope.
[00:56:12.540 --> 00:56:14.300]   Who's cynical about everything.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:14.800]   Nope.
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:17.740]   I feel like it's obvious.
[00:56:17.740 --> 00:56:21.420]   It's Boxer.
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:21.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.260]   Now you're just...
[00:56:25.260 --> 00:56:26.380]   You're working harder.
[00:56:26.380 --> 00:56:26.880]   Yep.
[00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:29.580]   Yeah, obviously it's mine too.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:33.820]   Just doing my best, my vibe.
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.700]   Yeah, I will work harder.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:38.000]   But...
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.340]   I think hard work is a lot more important than...
[00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.660]   Because human intelligence doesn't vary all that much.
[00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:49.500]   Like, when you're smart, I mean, there's only...
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:52.540]   Like, you can't get much smarter.
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:57.900]   So you think hard work beats the cliche of talent?
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:01.180]   I think like a combination of the two probably.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:03.340]   Or like even just being passionate.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:03.740]   Yeah.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:04.700]   And putting in the work.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.780]   Because you could be passionate and lazy.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:07.280]   I agree.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:14.380]   And I think sometimes if you think you're really smart,
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.220]   it kind of holds you back.
[00:57:16.220 --> 00:57:19.500]   To where you feel like you don't have to try as hard.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:28.700]   But then it leads to like a very, I think, boring life.
[00:57:28.700 --> 00:57:30.140]   But who knows?
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.340]   For some people, they enjoy that.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:38.540]   This is straight up a movie.
[00:57:38.540 --> 00:57:39.340]   Yeah, it's beautiful.
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.420]   What do you think is the meaning of life?
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:44.940]   What do I think is the meaning of life?
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:51.100]   I feel like it's a good thing to ask while we're listening...
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.300]   We're watching a bunch of cowboys ride through the woods.
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:58.860]   I think nothing in life matters except for love and human connection.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:05.340]   Like nothing else is really all that important.
[00:58:05.340 --> 00:58:12.220]   Like, I think when you look back on life,
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:14.700]   you look back on the moments that you shared with other people.
[00:58:14.700 --> 00:58:16.860]   How deeply you loved them.
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:18.300]   How deeply you felt things.
[00:58:18.300 --> 00:58:22.540]   I think all of that is important.
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:23.900]   Everything else is just noise.
[00:58:23.900 --> 00:58:26.240]   Yeah.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.820]   I agree.
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.940]   This is really beautiful.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:32.860]   The seasons are changing.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:35.340]   Yeah, before our eyes.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:38.700]   What do you think is the meaning of life?
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:43.420]   I think it's about how good you can ride a horse.
[00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.780]   And how pretty you look in a cowboy hat.
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:49.340]   That's probably it.
[00:58:49.340 --> 00:58:59.260]   So it's not wearing shorts barefoot on a beach on a horse.
[00:58:59.260 --> 00:59:02.620]   When the feeling strikes you.
[00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:09.980]   Aang is referring to a ridiculous photo of me barefoot on a horse.
[00:59:09.980 --> 00:59:11.340]   It's my favorite photo I've ever seen of a person.
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:13.180]   Yeah.
[00:59:13.180 --> 00:59:14.780]   It's a fabulous photo.
[00:59:14.780 --> 00:59:18.140]   The funny thing is there's a bunch of shirtless versions of that.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:19.500]   There's shirtless versions?
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:21.980]   It was like, you know, almost like ridiculous.
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:25.580]   Because I rode the horse shirtless, but then I put on a shirt.
[00:59:25.580 --> 00:59:28.460]   This is like too ridiculous to take a picture of.
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:29.660]   Like, what are you doing?
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:30.540]   It was cool.
[00:59:30.540 --> 00:59:33.820]   Like riding a horse on sand is a different experience.
[00:59:34.220 --> 00:59:38.700]   [Music]
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:40.380]   It's like looking out over the ocean.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.740]   It's cool.
[00:59:41.740 --> 00:59:42.860]   It's an incredible feeling.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:44.060]   Why did you just shoot a gun?
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:45.020]   [Laughter]
[00:59:45.020 --> 00:59:47.660]   I had binoculars.
[00:59:47.660 --> 00:59:49.420]   [Laughter]
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:49.900]   Sorry.
[00:59:49.900 --> 00:59:55.260]   This is how all bad things happen.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:56.940]   This is why we can't have nice things.
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:00.780]   I think this is a good place to end it.
[01:00:00.780 --> 01:00:01.500]   Yeah, I think so too.
[01:00:03.660 --> 01:00:05.100]   What game should we play next time?
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:07.500]   Do you have ideas?
[01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.980]   Maybe we'll play GTA.
[01:00:09.980 --> 01:00:11.520]   Could be.
[01:00:11.520 --> 01:00:13.340]   Good thought.
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:17.180]   What's your big takeaway from this journey we took together?
[01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:21.260]   Do you like the game?
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:21.980]   I love the game.
[01:00:21.980 --> 01:00:23.740]   I love it too.
[01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:26.300]   But it's also like, it's almost nostalgic.
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:31.100]   Nostalgic like personally for you?
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:33.420]   Like, a different life?
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:34.140]   Oh, I see.
[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:35.260]   You used to play this.
[01:00:35.260 --> 01:00:36.940]   I thought you meant like, it takes me back.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:41.420]   It takes me back to my old days when I used to ride horses at summer camp.
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:41.920]   Me too.
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:47.020]   Your shirtless Mexico trip.
[01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.300]   I don't talk about that time.
[01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:49.900]   You don't talk about the times.
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:51.180]   The things I've seen.
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:53.180]   The things these eyes have seen.
[01:00:53.180 --> 01:01:03.180]   [Music]
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:11.980]   [Music]
