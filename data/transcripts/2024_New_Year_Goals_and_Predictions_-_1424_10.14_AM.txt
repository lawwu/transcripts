[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.480]   Hello, everybody.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.360]   It's Sam and Sydney from the Financial Samurai Podcast.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.560]   And happy New Year 2024.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.800]   Happy New Year.
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.120]   How are you feeling?
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.600]   Good.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.320]   I'm feeling good.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.880]   I'm actually feeling really rejuvenated,
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.880]   despite having 10 days with no child care
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.960]   help during the winter break.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.680]   It was pretty relaxing.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.080]   I'm surprised. How about you?
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.400]   I'm feeling pretty good.
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.760]   Well, I admit I'm still tired.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.960]   But overall, I'm excited that we started a new year.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.160]   And hopefully, things will be good this year.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.560]   I mean, the key is how long this endurance, this good feeling,
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.240]   and excitement will last.
[00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.640]   Because as we know, as we grind through the year,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.680]   things get a little bit slower, a little bit more tired.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.400]   So let's talk about some 2024 goals between you and me.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.600]   And then I'll discuss some of my predictions,
[00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.680]   finance-related and otherwise, for the episode.
[00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.200]   So what are your main 2024 goals?
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.680]   Well, I kind of went a little overboard this year
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.080]   and had a lot of very small goals.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.000]   I'll just throw a few of them out there
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.360]   that come to the top of my mind.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.040]   In terms of work, I definitely want
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.800]   to keep a more consistent and regular schedule.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.920]   I'm the type of person that gets very easily distracted.
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.880]   And I think it helps to have very clear priorities
[00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.040]   for every day and to also chunk my time so that I can plan
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.160]   to spend 30 minutes, one hour, two hours
[00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.720]   on a very specific thing and block out everything else.
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.480]   So don't check email during that time or messages.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.360]   I think that will hopefully help me focus better,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.240]   because I tend to get distracted very easily.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.960]   And I also have a really big goal,
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.040]   which is a shared goal for us, is to do more
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.720]   work on your second book.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.280]   We've got the manuscript deadline coming up and then
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.240]   all throughout the rest of the year.
[00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.120]   So I'm really looking forward to working on that.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.880]   And I also hope to read at least five nonfiction books this
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:18.380]   year.
[00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:21.200]   I had a goal last year of three to five, and I hit five.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.280]   So hopefully to get at least five under my belt this year.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.000]   And then two personal goals.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.880]   I really want to help our daughter
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.840]   get a jump start on reading.
[00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.760]   So my goal is to teach her around 50
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.200]   of the most commonly used and simple sight words this year.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.680]   And then I finally want to get our son and I
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.880]   to sit down and get some piano lessons in.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:52.900]   I would love to be able to teach him a few songs by the year end.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.540]   How about you?
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.580]   Oh, some great goals.
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.060]   Well, I have a theme.
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.700]   Every single year I have a theme for all my years.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.540]   And this year's theme is one last year of intense focus.
[00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.500]   I was going to call it the one last year for survival,
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.740]   but that sounded a little too dire.
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.320]   This marks my 15th year running Financial Samurai,
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.360]   coinciding with both our children starting
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.220]   school full time in September.
[00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.540]   And I've got to admit, fatigue has set in,
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.880]   reminiscent of 2011 when I was pondering leaving investment
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.180]   banking for good, because I was just burned out
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.840]   and I ended up making a huge life change.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.720]   I don't think I'm going to make that huge life
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.760]   change by stopping Financial Samurai and this podcast
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.100]   altogether.
[00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.020]   However, I think adjustment needs
[00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.340]   to be made because I'm trying to keep Financial Samurai going
[00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.000]   for 20 more years, or at least until our kids are
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.520]   young adults and they know what they
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:50.280]   want to do with their lives.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.620]   So for some of my goals, health goals, stay the same weight.
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:56.740]   I've given up on losing weight.
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:04:00.820]   I think 168 to 171 pounds at 5'10" is perfect.
[00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.400]   I'm going to play tennis and pickleball combined
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.240]   three times a week, hopefully without getting injured.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.560]   And if I do that and maintain my eating habits,
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.780]   I think I'll be able to stay the same weight.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.360]   And then one thing was really good
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.000]   was taking one mental health break a month.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.200]   I think I only did one day of unproductive nothing
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.480]   for all of 2023, and it was amazing.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.640]   I kind of locked myself away in a room
[00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   and I went to the hot tub.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.560]   I had peace and quiet, and I just felt like a green shoot.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.400]   Green shoots were sprouting out of my body.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.720]   I was like, wow, I'm healing like Wolverine.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.640]   In terms of wealth goals, I think this year
[00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:44.080]   is going to be back to frugality mindset for me
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.960]   versus being a relatively free spender.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.440]   And the main reason why is we need to re-boost
[00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.960]   our liquidity after buying this house.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.040]   So I'm hopeful that our net worth will increase by 10%
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.780]   and we're going to boost back our liquidity
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.800]   to get to six, 12 months of living expenses
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.160]   because those capital calls at the end of 2023
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.080]   really sucked away a lot of liquidity.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.400]   There are all these surprise capital calls.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:12.680]   I was thinking to myself, what is going on?
[00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:14.680]   There are higher percentage than normal
[00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:17.760]   and more frequent than normal from more funds.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.840]   And then finally, in terms of the wealth side,
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.920]   replenish our stock exposure to about 20% of net worth.
[00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.600]   Ideally, the percentage range is between 25 to 35%
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.160]   of entire net worth.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:33.360]   But again, with the selling of stock to buy the house,
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:36.520]   it's declined to about 15%.
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.800]   Oh, and there's another financial goal.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.960]   I want to invest about $50,000 in private funds
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.000]   that invest in artificial intelligence.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:46.720]   I know it's all the rage, valuations are high,
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.360]   but I'm going to invest in funds
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.320]   that are looking at the best in class companies in AI.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:55.920]   And I want to diversify across all segments of AI.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.520]   I think it's just a smart hedge because in 20 years,
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:02.560]   AI could crush a lot of jobs, millions of jobs,
[00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.100]   and our kids might be underemployed or unemployed as a result.
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.800]   And as we learn from the OpenAI CEO debacle,
[00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.120]   as well as the New York Times copyright lawsuit
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.120]   against OpenAI, OpenAI is full on trying to make max money
[00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.600]   for its shareholders and for its employees.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.480]   This is not nonprofit for the good of all humanity.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.200]   It's about max profits.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.680]   So if you can't beat them, you've got to invest with them
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.860]   at least to try to make money as a hedge.
[00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:34.920]   If AI turns out to be a dud,
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.400]   then hopefully our kids will have jobs.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.900]   And if AI turns out to be some revolutionary technology,
[00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:43.980]   then well, hopefully our funds
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.580]   will grow tremendously in value.
[00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.340]   And in terms of X-Factor goals, I've got two.
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:54.700]   One is to publish our second book with Portfolio Penguin.
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.460]   Hopefully it'll come out in the second half of 2024.
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.160]   It is a lot of work.
[00:06:59.160 --> 00:07:02.020]   Thank you so much for editing every single chapter,
[00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.020]   the intro, the conclusion, so much work,
[00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.280]   but it's so rewarding once it comes out.
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.620]   And the second X-Factor goal
[00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.620]   is to potentially help you get a consulting job
[00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.260]   in the second half of 2024,
[00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.460]   once our daughter goes to school full-time in September.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:20.180]   And I'm pretty excited about it.
[00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:22.220]   I don't know how excited you are about it
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.420]   after being free since 2015,
[00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:31.100]   but my thought is I care too deeply about you
[00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.940]   to let you be a stay-at-home mom
[00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.980]   after our daughter begins school full-time,
[00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.020]   because I've talked to many stay-at-home mothers
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.140]   over the past six and a half years, many, many,
[00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.020]   some who have faced divorce,
[00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:46.980]   some who have lost their spouses tragically,
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:50.500]   and they suddenly have to bear the sole responsibility
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.120]   of earning all the income.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:56.420]   And that is a very daunting task,
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.180]   especially now that our passive income is lower,
[00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.340]   given the house.
[00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:02.740]   So to be able to get back on the horse,
[00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:03.900]   earn some consulting income,
[00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:07.540]   maybe full-time income one day to provide for our children
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:09.700]   just in case something happens to me,
[00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:14.700]   I would rest easier knowing that could happen.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:16.700]   And I'll also rest easier knowing
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:19.000]   that you'll be able to do that
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.460]   while filling that time as our kids are in school.
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:23.620]   What are your thoughts?
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.620]   - I know you are way more excited about that than I am,
[00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.660]   but I'm definitely open to the idea.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:32.660]   And I wouldn't say that I've been free
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:34.420]   since our kids were born,
[00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.120]   since I have been contributing in many different ways
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.980]   for the site.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:43.540]   People who have never run a website
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:45.860]   don't realize how much actually has to go on
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.420]   to get everything running smoothly
[00:08:48.420 --> 00:08:49.900]   and just to have a small business.
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:51.220]   There's a lot to do.
[00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:52.340]   - Absolutely.
[00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.600]   - And yeah, motherhood has definitely kept me very busy.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.180]   And yeah, I think, yeah, it will be an adjustment
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:02.820]   to have both kids in school full-time.
[00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.780]   I'll definitely miss having our daughter home twice a week.
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.580]   And yeah, we'll see how things go.
[00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.300]   It's definitely nice to feel productive.
[00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:15.140]   I just hope I won't be too tired.
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.380]   I'm already tired, but I am partly to blame
[00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:20.300]   because I don't sleep enough
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.740]   and I have to work on my productivity.
[00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.500]   So I've got a lot of goals to work on between now and then.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:29.020]   And yeah, we'll see how things go or by the end of the year.
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.260]   - Yeah, I would say change is inevitable.
[00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:34.780]   You've done so much work for Financial Samurai,
[00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:38.660]   the editing, the finances, the backend stuff,
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:41.900]   troubleshooting, so you have been invaluable.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.780]   But at the end of the day, Financial Samurai,
[00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:46.140]   this podcast, for example,
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.220]   this podcast doesn't make any money.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.580]   Financial Samurai makes some money, but it's okay.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:53.260]   But I think it's like, okay,
[00:09:53.260 --> 00:09:57.620]   are we gonna really spend more time writing and recording?
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.740]   I think we've got a happy cadence.
[00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.380]   And it's actually fun, I think,
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.700]   to find, let's say, part-time work
[00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.940]   and inject ourselves back into society,
[00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.340]   hang out with new people, meet new people, go to events.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.340]   I think it's fun.
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:14.780]   It's kind of like how we got injected back into society
[00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:16.900]   after sending our kids to school.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:19.540]   We got to meet new parents, new friends,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.060]   and I thought that was a lot of fun.
[00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:25.900]   - Okay, so let's jump into predictions for 2024.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.540]   What are your thoughts on interest rate,
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:30.180]   real estate, et cetera?
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:33.420]   What are you predicting could happen this year?
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.660]   - Well, I think the Fed is gonna cut the Fed funds rate
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:42.180]   four times in 2024 by 25 basis points each time
[00:10:42.180 --> 00:10:44.580]   for a total of 1%.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:46.460]   In other words, by the end of 2024,
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:51.460]   the Fed funds rate range will drop from 5.25 to 5.5%,
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:56.740]   down to 4.25 to 4.5%.
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.300]   And partly as a result,
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.820]   average mortgage rates will likely decline
[00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:04.060]   below 6% on the 30-year fix.
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.980]   These are national averages,
[00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:08.340]   but if you go and apply for a mortgage,
[00:11:08.340 --> 00:11:10.820]   you're gonna be able to get 50 to 75 basis points
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.660]   lower than the stated average.
[00:11:12.660 --> 00:11:14.180]   So we're talking you could potentially
[00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:18.700]   get a 30-year fix mortgage at 5 to 5.5%,
[00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:20.440]   which sounds pretty reasonable
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.460]   in light of current inflation,
[00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:24.460]   in light of where we were.
[00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:27.260]   And so due to these events,
[00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.180]   so the consensus is calling for three Fed funds cuts.
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:31.300]   I'm saying four.
[00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.060]   And part of the reason why is,
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.340]   look, look at CPI at 3%,
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.840]   look at the Fed funds rate at 5.25.
[00:11:37.840 --> 00:11:40.580]   That's 2.25% real.
[00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:42.500]   So that's restrictive.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.340]   And if inflation goes down to 2.5%,
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:46.660]   well, that's more restrictive, right?
[00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:49.780]   So the Fed can't be too far behind the curve on cutting
[00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:54.240]   or else it could cause a recession and lots of job losses.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.040]   So with these forecasts in mind
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:00.840]   for the Fed funds rate and mortgage rates,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.160]   we should expect demand for real estate to increase.
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:05.980]   I think there's gonna be a lot of pent up demand.
[00:12:05.980 --> 00:12:07.320]   There has been a lot of pent up demand
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:09.800]   since starting in the first half of 2022,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.880]   when the Fed started raising rates.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.660]   So every single month,
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:17.560]   more people just waiting, wondering what's going on,
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.880]   why buy a home, not so much inventory,
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:21.960]   mortgage rates are high,
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.340]   maybe mortgage rates will finally come down.
[00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:25.760]   And they are gonna finally come down.
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.160]   They have been finally coming down since the end of 2023.
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:32.020]   And so the more it comes down,
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.900]   the more demand is gonna appear in the market.
[00:12:34.900 --> 00:12:36.620]   So I think there's gonna be back to bidding wars.
[00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:38.840]   And I think real estate market,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:42.580]   the median or the average price increase,
[00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:45.640]   home forecast is about 1.8%.
[00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.040]   I think it's gonna be higher than that.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:49.640]   I think we could see four to 5% increase
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.080]   in the median home price.
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.840]   Depends on which index you use,
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:54.600]   whether it's the St. Louis Fed
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:57.020]   or the Freddie Mac home price index,
[00:12:57.020 --> 00:13:00.560]   which is much higher than the St. Louis Fed.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:03.520]   But I think it's gonna be really a good time
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.720]   for the real estate market,
[00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:08.120]   especially since there's been a huge lag in performance
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.800]   compared to the stock market,
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.000]   which was up 24% in 2023, the S&P 500.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.320]   So capital searches for laggard companies,
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.120]   assets, sectors to invest in.
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:21.360]   And I think that capital is gonna rotate
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.960]   into the real asset of real estate.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.700]   So we're talking four and a half to 5% increase in 2024.
[00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:29.880]   Now in terms of the stock market,
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:33.660]   it's interesting because the median S&P 500 forecast
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.400]   by Wall Street forecasters is something around 4,830.
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:45.720]   Now, based on the huge rally end of year in 2023,
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.680]   that means there's only about two, 2.5% upside
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.240]   based on the end of 2023 numbers.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.520]   And so the market has sold off quite persistently
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:59.080]   on the first several days of 2024.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:02.240]   So we have maybe three to 4% upside now,
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.440]   but that's not a lot.
[00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:06.040]   If you think about it, the risk-free rate of return,
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:11.040]   which is the 10-year bond yield, you can get 3.8%, right?
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.640]   If you get a one-year treasury bond
[00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:14.480]   or a six-month treasury bond,
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.700]   you can get about four and a half to almost 5%.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:19.960]   So if you tack on four and a half percent to 5%
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:24.320]   to the existing S&P 500 level of 4,700,
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:26.900]   we're talking like 4,900 something,
[00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:30.640]   which is above the average Wall Street sell side
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:34.280]   year end 2024 S&P 500 target.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:38.600]   So we've got to think about how are we going to allocate
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:42.640]   our money in terms of risk-free and risk.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:46.080]   And it seems to me that risk-free
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.920]   is a better trade right now
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.560]   based on these average target prices.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.680]   So I see upside in the S&P 500.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.580]   I think we could get to 4,900,
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:01.360]   basically based on 20 times the S&P 500 earnings
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:04.840]   of maybe 247, 248.
[00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:06.520]   Nobody really knows.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:08.420]   It sounds kind of expensive 20 times,
[00:15:08.420 --> 00:15:12.120]   but then by the time we get there in the second half of 2024
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:15.360]   we're going to start looking at 2025 estimates,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.200]   which could grow to 260, $270 earnings per share
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.480]   for the S&P 500, which would bring that multiple down.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.920]   So not too exciting on the S&P 500,
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:29.520]   more excitement in real estate.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.380]   And in terms of the economy,
[00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:33.440]   it doesn't seem like we're going to go
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:34.360]   into a recession anymore.
[00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:37.720]   Amazing, because every single inversion
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:40.040]   in the past of the yield curve has portended
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.740]   to a recession 12 to 18 months later.
[00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:45.840]   So the Fed can start cutting rates,
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.280]   let's say in March, April.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.920]   I mean, it's pretty soon March or April.
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:54.360]   Then maybe the economy will be saved, who knows.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.000]   But so far things seem pretty decent.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.140]   And if rates do go down this low,
[00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:02.620]   you're going to see a lot of the riskiest assets,
[00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:06.360]   the assets with the highest beta, like small cap names,
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:09.920]   like cryptocurrency, it's already run so much,
[00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:13.720]   like private growth companies whose valuations got smashed
[00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:18.720]   by 30 to 70% since late 2021, early 2022,
[00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:20.800]   come back with a vengeance.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.240]   Because it's going to be risk on if the rates go way low
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:26.320]   or down by another one or 2%.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:29.340]   So that's it for our predictions for 2024.
[00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:32.380]   If you're an investor, it should be a pretty decent year.
[00:16:32.380 --> 00:16:36.220]   I don't expect huge increases or huge collapses.
[00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.220]   The volatility hopefully should subside a little bit.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:42.300]   As we learned from 2022 and 2023,
[00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.340]   it's important to stay invested.
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:46.820]   Stay invested for the long-term.
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:49.980]   Look at your asset allocation, review it quarterly,
[00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:52.660]   semi-annually, at least annually.
[00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:56.300]   Talk to a friend or significant other about your goals
[00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.160]   and have a conversation at the beginning of the year.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:01.120]   What do you want this year to be like for you?
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:04.240]   And how are you going to achieve your goals?
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.920]   I hope everyone has a wonderful 2024
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:09.840]   and you meet most of your goals.
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:12.440]   And we will speak to you in the next episode.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.680]   - Happy New Year, everybody.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.880]   Talk to you later.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:15.720]   - Bye.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.300]   (upbeat music)
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:21.060]   (dramatic music)
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.060]   [Music fades out]
