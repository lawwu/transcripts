[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.220]   We even have a court criticizing Elon for taking an options package where he made no
[00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.680]   money unless he saved the company from bankruptcy.
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.240]   Meanwhile, the CEO of his arch rival, who created no shareholder value over a period
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.320]   of five years, is making tens of millions of dollars a year in our shoes.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:33.800]   Hey, man, great to see you.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.800]   Good to see you.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.800]   Good to have you back.
[00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.800]   Glad to be here.
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.920]   Man, I raced up here from NVIDIA GTC.
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.920]   How was that?
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.200]   I mean, it's a, you know, I texted Lincoln yesterday when I was down there for the keynote
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.480]   and he said, you know, I said, how'd your day go at school?
[00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   And he said, good.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.280]   He's like, hey, Pops, what are you up to?
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.320]   And I said, you know, I'm just watching the future.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.600]   And he said, he asked a great question.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.040]   He said, well, why is this any different than all the other computers in the world, right?
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.960]   And I said, you know, like we've talked about before, we're going from this era where computers
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.840]   were highly efficient calculators.
[00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.240]   And I said, you know, we're not far off from computers being able to reason and think and
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.920]   being smarter than every human who's ever lived on the planet.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.520]   So it's, I mean, it's an exciting time, disruptive time.
[00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.680]   We're going to talk about that more later in the show.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.240]   But we thought for episode five, we'd mix it up a little bit.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.880]   I mean, one of the things you and I talked about when we started the pod was not only
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.940]   do we want to talk about the topics of the day, but we also wanted to do some deep dives
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.240]   on topics that you and I have talked about over the years.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.960]   You know, I think about the topics that you've covered on Above the Crowd, whether it's network
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.780]   effects or whether it's a rake too far.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.040]   And so, you know, one of those things we're going to talk about today.
[00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.460]   After that, we're going to get into some of these Google Apple rumors.
[00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.360]   We're going to talk a little bit more about the TikTok fallout, et cetera.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.400]   But one of the, we've been pretty passionate and talked a lot, argued a lot over the years
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.000]   about stock-based compensation.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.240]   And it's so important to Silicon Valley because it's all about incentives and alignment.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.440]   It's such a special part of what makes this place great, but it also has been a source
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:21.060]   of a lot of consternation from Warren Buffett down the line.
[00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.120]   So we knew we wanted to talk about this, but in order to talk about it, we had to invite
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.480]   one of our old friends.
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   Correct.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.100]   Who may be, you know, the best expert on the topic.
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.140]   The legendary CFO of Priceline, Bob Mylod, who's served on tons of VC boards.
[00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.520]   And he's truly got, gets this from both the startup perspective and the public company
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.560]   perspective.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.480]   So Bob, thanks for joining us.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.040]   Gentlemen, thanks for having me.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.920]   It's great to be here.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.640]   If any of my CEOs or CFOs are of the mindset, they want to get this right.
[00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.480]   There's no one on the planet I'd rather, you know, introduce them to and have them talk
[00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.480]   to them, Bob.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.920]   Bob, I think you joined Priceline in 1999.
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.760]   You know, we must have met around 2000 or 2001.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.600]   You were the CFO of the company from when I believe it was a billion dollar company
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:21.480]   all the way to it being worth, you know, upwards of a hundred billion, certainly on the board
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.360]   for that entire period of time, you're still on the board of booking and you know, it's
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.120]   become extremely valuable in the public market.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.640]   There was a little bit of a, there was a big rollercoaster along that way, but that's generally
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.600]   the and I wasn't CFO the entire time, but yes, that's the general math of it.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:46.160]   Bill, why don't you frame for us, why is this topic so important and importantly, a little
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.120]   bit about how we got here with stock-based compensation?
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.400]   And I think everyone in Silicon Valley knows that equity participation is part of the model,
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   always has been.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.400]   Right.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.960]   And in general, when it was started, venture capitalists felt strongly that it created
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.040]   alignment, right?
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.200]   You wanted managers and shareholders owning the same equity and having the same interest.
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.320]   And if you create one of these monster outsize, you know, wins, everyone's a winner.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.440]   And so it just made sense.
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440]   Right.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.640]   And I think it's been since certainly since I got here, but way before I got to Silicon
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.360]   Valley, I think it's been a part of what people do.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.420]   In the late 90s, you know, we went through the dot-com boom and bust.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:40.540]   And prior to that time, I think the primary vehicle that was used to incent executives
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.120]   and employees were stock options, employee stock options.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.320]   And they would be priced at the current price of the company.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.780]   And you know, while a company's private, you had this, you know, evolving argument of how
[00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:59.520]   you value the options prior to being public, they were typically a discount to the preferred.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.960]   Likpref and things could make that argument stand.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.840]   Anyway, coming out of 1999, you know, you had a bunch of companies boom bust.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.520]   You had a bunch of companies go out of business that people said were never a business.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.160]   And you had a lot of skepticism coming in from, you know, people like writers for the
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.760]   Wall Street Journal, but even ISS, Institutional Shareholder Services.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.080]   You may want to tell people quickly what ISS is.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:36.680]   I mean, you know, ISS is basically, you know, a body that helps advise owners, shareholders
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:44.720]   of public companies on how to vote on a variety of topics, including compensation, quite controversial.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.120]   But they have a voice.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.120]   But they have influence.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.800]   That matters in this world.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.840]   And people also were upset about repricing, backdating.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.160]   You know, there were options that were backdated and then re-granting.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.760]   So the stocks collapsed and then they just issued new options.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.720]   And people didn't like that.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.680]   And people begin to argue that options created too much risk.
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:11.920]   And so there was this idea, you know, that maybe we needed a different instrument.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:18.420]   Along that same time, a very large investor in a very prominent internet company was worried
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.420]   about dilution.
[00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:21.680]   He was worried about the dilution from options.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:26.000]   And for those that want to just use a rough framework, you know, when a startup would
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.440]   get started in early years, you might have as much as, say, 10% dilution from options.
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.200]   You might hire three executives during that year and it's a big grant.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.680]   But then as you move towards being public, people would typically, and these are very
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:45.820]   gross rules of thumb, steer towards, you know, a 3% type dilution rate.
[00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.500]   This particular investor in this very large public internet company felt that if they
[00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:57.120]   moved to zero-based RSUs from options, and this gets into a technical detail around Black
[00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.580]   Scholes, that, you know, there's an argument from Black Scholes that a single RSU is worth
[00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:05.440]   about two and a half or three options.
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.600]   So if you could switch from these options to an RSU, this investor thought dilution
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:15.640]   might drop from, say, 4% to 1.2% or something like that.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.460]   And there would be, quote, less dilution.
[00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:25.240]   And so that change happened at this one company, but then these zero-based RSUs became prevalent
[00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.240]   everywhere.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   Okay.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:31.080]   So let's just pause there for a second because I think there's a potential we've lost half
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:36.160]   of the audience because it's a very technical and detailed topic.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.480]   So if I just step back for a second, I want to invite you into the conversation, Bob.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:47.020]   The reason, obviously, we care in the case of this large internet company, they're granting
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.020]   options.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.580]   They want employees to be incented and aligned with them.
[00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.140]   They may not have a lot of cash in order to pay cash, but you said something critical.
[00:07:55.140 --> 00:08:00.460]   As they get toward the public market, right, there is—these things are obviously expensive
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:01.940]   to the potential shareholders.
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:07.020]   So folks who are going to buy it, Fidelity, Wellington, others in the public market, they
[00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:10.040]   care and are sensitive to that cost.
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:16.620]   Bob, Bill's describing the world that existed about the time, right, that you guys were
[00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:19.700]   going through this at Priceline.
[00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:25.700]   So tell us a little bit about kind of your experience in those early years with options
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:32.380]   and then kind of this transition that we struggle with to RSUs.
[00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:37.820]   Yeah, I think Bill does a very good job of describing what the world looked like in venture
[00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:40.240]   capital and private equity for that matter.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:44.020]   That's what I did for 10 years before I joined Priceline.
[00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:50.260]   It was a very simple, straightforward model of investor makes investment at a certain
[00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:57.520]   price per share and sets aside an option pool to be granted to management at the same price.
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:03.600]   There wasn't some—there was no exercise of contorting oneself into figuring out how
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:06.120]   to make the strike price lower.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:16.840]   It was just simply as investors reap rewards from the outcome of the company growing, employees
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:19.400]   share in those rewards.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.400]   So by the way, I became kind of battlefield promoted during the dot-com bust.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:32.600]   So I became CFO of Priceline in the fall of 2000 and this was—Brad, as you mentioned,
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:39.880]   I joined the company just after it was founded, less than a year or almost exactly on the
[00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:45.720]   one year anniversary of the founding, the company went public.
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:50.440]   A few months after that, we had a market value of about $35 billion.
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:57.520]   We were a tiny little company but this was the absolute heyday of the dot-com bubble
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:03.000]   and then the dot-com bubble burst and essentially our stock went to zero.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.480]   If you go back and look at the stock price run of Priceline, we were all the way down
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:13.720]   to $5 a share which is a post-reverse split adjusted value.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   I became CFO at that point and I wasn't too much worried about stock, stock options.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:26.280]   Our stock had just plummeted so much that all of the stock options that were sitting
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:31.280]   in the hands of whether it was myself or every single employee, they were under water.
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:39.200]   So the only possible way for us to compensate people at that point was in cash which really
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.640]   sowed the seeds for some of the ultimate successes.
[00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:47.160]   When you start to think of your business in the form of you're paying people based upon
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.880]   the cash that you have in your bank and you have no more ability to raise money, it's
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:57.840]   very, very clarifying about what you can afford to pay people.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.000]   That was the model that we operated for a couple of years, operating Priceline and then
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:11.320]   what I will define as one of the great unintended consequences of an accounting change occurred
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:16.280]   right around the 2002 to 2004 timeframe and there were two things.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:21.840]   First, there was the adoption of Sarbanes-Oxley where people like me and Jeff Boyd are – this
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:29.520]   CEO, we had to sign our names on the financial statements under penalty of criminal prosecution
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:36.940]   and there was the adoption of FAS 123 which required that historically, any granting of
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:40.600]   stock options to employees did not come with a charge.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:45.980]   The theory historically was it's hard to value the stock options because they really only
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:52.320]   have value if a stock goes up and therefore, we won't try and do that even though there
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.400]   is such a thing as a Black-Scholes model and the things do have value.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.320]   Historically, a stock option granted resulted in no charge.
[00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:09.560]   The SEC and the FASB were trying to get to a place where companies had to recognize that
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:17.960]   granting of a stock option did represent the transfer of economic value from the employer
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.520]   to the employee and that needed to be accounted for.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:28.620]   So FAS 123 came along and every public company had to expense the granting of a stock option.
[00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:34.720]   Well, as you can imagine for somebody like me with a hugely volatile – being the CFO
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:41.880]   of a company with a hugely volatile stock and I'm a University of Chicago grad and
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:47.160]   I studied the Black-Scholes model and had a very clear understanding that there is a
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:54.600]   lot of inputs into the calculation of a Black-Scholes calculation that there's some subjectivity
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:03.440]   to it and that made CFOs like me very uncomfortable as to signing your name to financial statements
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:06.760]   with the stock option charges in it.
[00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:11.900]   Not to mention the fact obviously that when we're sitting down talking to employees
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:17.120]   about their compensation and you say to them, "Hey, here is your stock option and by the
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:25.920]   way, Fisher Black and Myron Scholes says it's worth – they say it's worth $100,000,"
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:30.080]   and you're looking at it and saying, "Well, the stock is trading for $20 a share and you're
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:33.440]   telling me my strike price is $20 per share.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:35.080]   So in my mind, it's worthless."
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:40.780]   In fact, it is Bob, unless the stock goes up in value.
[00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:45.120]   But the reason it has some intrinsic value according to Black-Scholes is they look at
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.560]   the volatility and other measures related to the stock and it's effectively a probability
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:54.680]   weighted estimation of what this thing is worth today, right?
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.520]   So from an – go ahead, Bill.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.880]   I believe – and Bob could correct me because I didn't go to the University of Chicago.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:07.440]   But I believe Black-Scholes was backed into by looking at – you can create it once synthetically
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.520]   with the short and a call option and these kind of things and –
[00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:12.760]   Explain that to an employee.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.760]   But I understand –
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:14.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:17.080]   But you said it didn't have value.
[00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.800]   At the money call option has value.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   No, for sure.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:20.800]   They trade on the public markets today.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   That's my only point.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:24.800]   Absolutely.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   And they do have value.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:33.200]   Again, which is why for the dawn of the venture capital era, stock options were granted and
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:36.480]   they did have value and they created huge value.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:42.160]   But again, only in the event that value was created for shareholders.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.880]   As the 2000s moved along, there were more and more companies – and by the way, this
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.600]   includes Priceline.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:54.120]   We moved away from stock option grants to RSU grants.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:59.360]   And let's just explain again to folks what some of these things are.
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:02.200]   So stock option, I get a security.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:06.640]   It says the strike price is $20 that you referenced.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:09.720]   Our stock today is trading at $20.
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:13.280]   According to Black-Scholes, that would have some intrinsic value today.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.680]   You would have to recognize and expense that over time.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:20.040]   But for me as the employee, I'm just looking at this and saying this is only going to be
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.680]   valuable to me if this stock goes up over time.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.760]   In fact, if I quit the company three years later and it's still at $20 a share, then
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:29.880]   I don't walk away with anything.
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:37.400]   The move to RSU's restricted stock units means that I'm going to own a security and zero
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.600]   basis RSU's.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:44.000]   I'm going to own – this is just like get somebody handing you a share of stock and
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.840]   when I leave three years later, whatever I vested in that share of stock, I can cash
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:52.060]   that out and I can walk away with that cash value.
[00:15:52.060 --> 00:15:59.120]   So it works very differently from an incentive and alignment perspective than options were
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   working.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   Sorry to interrupt you, Bob.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.120]   Why don't we –
[00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.120]   Bob Gourley Yeah.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   No, that's exactly right.
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:11.240]   So if you give one share of a restricted stock unit at a value of 20, then the recipient
[00:16:11.240 --> 00:16:13.400]   has $20 of value.
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:21.680]   Now, if the stock happens to go down by 50 percent, the employee still has $10 of value,
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.560]   whereas in the case of the stock option, if it goes down one percent, let alone 50, it
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   has zero value.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:36.000]   Here's where we get into questions of alignment with shareholders because you could theoretically
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:43.240]   have a management team that leads a company over a year to a 20 percent decline and pick
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:50.020]   up 80 percent of the value of their equity award, whereas shareholders are down 20.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.460]   You as a large public owner of shares, you would be down 20 and management gets 80 percent
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:55.460]   of their equity value.
[00:16:55.460 --> 00:16:58.060]   Trevor Burrus So Bob, why did you go from options to RSUs?
[00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.460]   Bob Gourley Well, again, I will just say that before
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:10.640]   the adoption of FAS 123, if you were to grant an RSU, the full cost of that RSU would have
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:14.180]   to be expensed in the P&L, in the income statement of a public company.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:16.580]   Trevor Burrus So treat it like cash, same as cash.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:19.740]   Bob Gourley It was treated as cash and – by the way,
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.500]   there were some companies that did it, but there was – it was very clearly understood
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:30.180]   by all people that that was essentially no different than cash.
[00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:37.740]   It would be no different than issuing a share of stock to the public for $20 and then turning
[00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.540]   around and taking that $20 and handing it to the employee.
[00:17:41.540 --> 00:17:43.900]   So that was always expensed.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:50.060]   It was just when the stock option also got expensed that issuers looked at that and said,
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.060]   "OK.
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.500]   Well, if I now have to expense stock options and I always had to expense RSUs, I might
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.980]   as well just do RSUs."
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:07.020]   It was at this time also that companies got into the practice of adding up all the charges
[00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:13.180]   related to this stock-based compensation and proforming the effects of those out of the
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.460]   income statement so that they could effectively compare current results to what the results
[00:18:18.460 --> 00:18:21.220]   would have looked like before FAS 123 was adopted.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.220]   Trevor Burrus OK.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.580]   So hold on a second here.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:33.180]   So you shifted from stock options, which as a shareholder, I like because nobody makes
[00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:42.060]   money unless I make money, to RSUs where people made money even if I lost, right?
[00:18:42.060 --> 00:18:49.020]   And then because that was all now in the P&L, you had to expense that like cash, which Warren
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:54.140]   Buffett and many others had been pushing for since '97, '98.
[00:18:54.140 --> 00:19:01.060]   But in order to get around that, everybody started adjusting what they – their earnings,
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:02.060]   EBITDA.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:07.880]   They started adjusting the stock-based compensation expense out of EBITDA, OK?
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:12.100]   So as though the expense no longer counted.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:13.100]   Did you start that?
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:17.260]   Warren Buffett I don't know that I started it.
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:21.340]   But we did – so we did do the proforming.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:27.220]   But the reason that we did the proforming wasn't because we didn't view that every
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:33.620]   single dollar of RSUs that we were handing out had real, very significant value.
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:38.000]   It was more that we were going through this transition period where some of the compensation
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.900]   we had handed out historically were stock options and now we were moving to a world
[00:19:43.900 --> 00:19:47.100]   of RSUs.
[00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:52.260]   So there was a multiyear period where some of the stock-based compensation was option-based.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:55.480]   Some of the stock-based compensation was RSU-based.
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:20:04.160]   So that would have created even more confusion around how to think about core earnings.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:12.720]   So we did proforma them and obviously almost all companies proforma them.
[00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:20.640]   I think the big difference is that we, as a company, we always viewed one dollar of
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:24.600]   an RSU as fully being worth one dollar.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:30.160]   In fact, if you really are bullish on your company, which we were, we viewed that a dollar
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:34.360]   of RSUs was actually worth more than a dollar because we certainly had a view hopefully
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.560]   that if we did our jobs, that the stock was going to go up.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:46.240]   So it was our most valuable form of currency that we used to pay employees and we certainly
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.680]   thought about that all along the way.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:56.560]   We never – it never occurred to us that it shouldn't count or that it didn't count
[00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:02.400]   and we always looked at it in terms of the dollars associated with employee compensation,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.400]   period.
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:09.480]   We never looked at it in terms of what dilution – what do these share grants represent as
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:15.700]   a percentage of the total outstanding shares or "dilution"?
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:23.800]   I assure you, as somebody who sat across the table paying people their compensation, I
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:27.760]   wouldn't sit across the table at year end and say, "Congratulations, we've had a
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:29.020]   good year.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:38.240]   Your salary is X and your bonus is Y and we're giving you a stock grant of percentage points
[00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:39.880]   of dilution."
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:44.860]   Percentage points of dilution do not show up in a W2.
[00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:50.840]   Percentage points of dilution are not what you pay taxes on.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.580]   People on the other side of the table are looking at dollars.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:22:01.760]   So we always looked at dollars and I think where some other companies have strayed is
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.480]   they've forgotten that those dollars are dollars.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:12.860]   For a tech company, oftentimes stock-based compensation happens to be the single largest
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:22.200]   expense component of a tech company and yet somehow, inexplicably, even though it's
[00:22:22.200 --> 00:22:28.240]   the largest single expense component of that company, it is not considered to be even an
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:33.080]   expense in some companies and in some boardrooms.
[00:22:33.080 --> 00:22:40.560]   The result of that is that you've seen runaway stock-based compensation on an almost
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.440]   uninterrupted basis for the better part of 10 to 15 years.
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:51.520]   As this happened, exactly what Bob talked about, and as it became way more prevalent,
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.320]   we were entering that ZERP period and so there was spend at all costs.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:23:02.960]   There wasn't a lot of attention to profitability or even kind of paying attention on the expense
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:05.720]   side because that window happened.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:10.680]   Coming out of the ZERP window, people like yourselves are finally raising their hand,
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:14.920]   I'm not blaming this on you, and saying, "Hey, wait a minute.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.920]   This isn't right."
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:22.080]   Not only is there a non-alignment problem, but these numbers are massive and this drumbeat
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:25.000]   has just started to grow.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:31.400]   If we boil it way down, because I think we all have benefited from the magic of stock
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:36.760]   options as incentive and alignment for all the value creation that's occurred in Silicon
[00:23:36.760 --> 00:23:41.400]   Valley over the course of the last 20 years, I think what we're trying to point to and
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:45.720]   I want to drive toward is kind of what are those best practices if you're a founder,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:51.000]   if you're on the comp committee on a board, if you're an investor.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:59.480]   To me, when you pro forma something out, when you stop treating it like cash, it leads to
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:06.900]   a misallocation of resources because you're effectively saying this doesn't exist.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:09.600]   What happens when the cost of something disappears?
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.440]   You get a lot more of it.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:16.200]   Let me give you a very specific example that I heard the other day.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.800]   Take for example the recent competition for AI engineers in places like OpenAI and Google
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:29.160]   because venture-backed private companies have to compete in an ecosystem against public
[00:24:29.160 --> 00:24:31.080]   companies.
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:36.120]   There are rumors that lead engineers are offered millions of dollars a year.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:43.560]   But instead of cash, for example, Google's offering $500,000 in cash plus a million and
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:51.580]   a half dollars in RSUs vesting monthly to these engineers.
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:56.160]   Every single month, those RSUs are immediately available for sale.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:00.880]   And then as a shareholder, you have to ask the question, how much of this expense hits
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.040]   the book at the end of the year?
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:09.440]   If you're adjusting out the cost of those RSUs, then you're pretending that the cost
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:15.120]   of that engineer is only $500,000.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:19.440]   That to me is what leads to this spiral in inflation.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:26.600]   Now, you saw this in the early 2000s and you said when you had to treat it as cash, you
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.280]   got a lot more sober about what everybody was paid.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:34.800]   Now the difference in that period of time is the whole world deflated.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:36.120]   Everybody kind of came down together.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:40.360]   But today, we have public companies that are pro-forming this out.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.000]   They're still spending a lot on these engineers.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.400]   For me, the problem with this is when we – it leads to excess in the public markets which
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:56.760]   then misallocates resources away from startups and I think leads to less innovation.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:26:05.080]   It's – we're now – whatever, we're 20 years since the adoption of FAS 123.
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:10.480]   I especially thought when Zerp disappeared that people were going to wake up and say,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:17.000]   you know, we're actually not counting profits correctly here.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.840]   These tech companies are far less profitable than we actually think they are.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:25.640]   I've been on – I've been involved in so many companies now as a venture investor
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:26.960]   that have gone public.
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:32.520]   I've sat on multiple compensation committees of both private and public companies and Brad,
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:37.640]   exactly to your point, I can't tell you the number of conversations I've had with
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:44.080]   the leadership of a company who – I can think of a specific conversation where CEO
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:50.440]   called me and said, "I'm trying to hire this really talented software engineer.
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:58.040]   But that person wants $400,000 annual salary which really screws up our compensation here
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:03.800]   because that will have that person making $100,000 more per year than anybody else at
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:05.720]   our company.
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:06.720]   What do you think?
[00:27:06.720 --> 00:27:10.080]   Should we stretch for this person?"
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.880]   I said, "Well, what's the RSU grant?"
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:18.360]   The answer was $10 million.
[00:27:18.360 --> 00:27:22.600]   I'm sitting here like, "Wait, I just got a phone call from somebody worrying about
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.600]   the $100,000 salary."
[00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:31.160]   Of course, the CEO should worry about the $100,000 salary because if he's playing
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:36.360]   the game where that is the number that counts and the other one doesn't, then they're
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.700]   going to focus on the $100,000.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:43.440]   Of course, I'm looking at it going, "No, you really want to focus on the $10 million."
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.440]   Absolutely.
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:53.200]   It seems to me, just back to why I care so much, obviously, when I think about companies
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:28:02.360]   getting fit, companies dealing with the post-SERP hangover where we had excess hiring, excess
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:07.280]   pay, they got out of shape, let's make it very concrete.
[00:28:07.280 --> 00:28:17.800]   If a company has $20 a share in earnings but has 10% dilution every year, then my claim
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:20.520]   on that earnings as a shareholder is going down.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:21.520]   Absolutely.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   Right?
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:28.520]   If they produce $20 in earnings with no dilution, they're not issuing stock at all.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:33.720]   They're paying it all in cash, then I have a claim on that $20 in earnings.
[00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:35.840]   I think the same thing in venture-backed companies.
[00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:42.080]   I think what some people find as shocking is they get to the end of the journey, Bob.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.160]   They start off owning – you're a Series A investor, a Series B investor in a company.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.920]   You think you own a certain percentage of the company.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.400]   But if you're not paying attention to that 10 million share grant, by the end of the
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:29:00.680]   time, like your ownership claim – by the way, founders should care because their ownership
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.320]   claim as founder is going down.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:09.180]   But unfortunately, they've had to compete in this arms race where the public companies
[00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:13.680]   are all pretending this isn't an expense.
[00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:16.000]   And look, I think competition is real.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:20.760]   I don't want to be seen as this investor type that's saying, "Oh, the owner should
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:21.760]   keep everything."
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:27.200]   You're out there competing for employees and talent every day, and the price has gone
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.200]   up, and you are competing with large companies.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.680]   Listen to these numbers.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.320]   Big companies have an advantage from my point of view.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:40.840]   Microsoft's SBC is $2.8 billion a quarter, so that's over $11 billion a year.
[00:29:40.840 --> 00:29:45.300]   And this morning, we woke up and read about them taking some employees from a hot AI company
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.480]   in the Valley.
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.920]   And when you're handing out $11 billion a year in RSUs, you've got a lot to play
[00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.920]   with.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   Now, that $11.2 billion happens to only be 10% of free cash flow and 35 basis points
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:01.920]   of dilution.
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:06.520]   It's one-third of one percent because they're worth, what, $3 trillion?
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:10.720]   You can't be a big company unless you sort of – in my opinion, unless you establish
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:15.480]   much better hygiene when you're the smaller company or even before you're a public company.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:22.000]   And I want to be very clear, like booking holdings – I'm chair of the board of booking
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.840]   holdings and I'm on the comp committee.
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:32.960]   And I want to be clear, like I view that our employees – I know that our employees have
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:41.040]   been very, very generously rewarded over a multi-decade period, partly because we live
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:44.960]   in a competitive marketplace and we have to make competitive stock grants.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:54.600]   But the biggest reason is because our stock has appreciated over that period so rapidly.
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:59.880]   Has gone from $10 a share to $3,400 a share.
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:07.880]   That is the appreciation that has driven returns for not only the employees, but driven returns
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.920]   for all the shareholders of Booking.com.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.920]   Correct.
[00:31:10.920 --> 00:31:17.840]   And at least from our perspective, our culture has been, hey, the way to get rich, the way
[00:31:17.840 --> 00:31:24.160]   to make a lot of money is for – to create huge shareholder value.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:28.480]   And the senior management and the board of directors along the way is going to try to
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:36.040]   put our thumb on the scale in the form of smartly using our capital to further reward
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:37.040]   shareholders.
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:39.080]   Well, again, like you're exactly right.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:44.600]   If you look at the top – certainly the NASDAQ 100 companies, but absolutely tech
[00:31:44.600 --> 00:31:52.400]   companies below that market cap, what you will generally see is a year-over-year increase
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:32:01.560]   in share count, literally the expansion of the number of slices of pie because of these
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:03.800]   stock granting practices.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:08.000]   You will see some companies that do share buybacks and they will literally state, "I'm
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   doing the share buyback to offset dilution associated with employee stock-based compensation,"
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.560]   and thereby doing that, taking a huge cash expense in the form of stock buybacks and
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:28.680]   putting it below the line so that when people look at operating cash flow or free cash flow,
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:30.400]   it looks like one number.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:34.560]   But yet below the line, there's all this money being spent just to buy back the stock
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:40.400]   that employees are selling when their stock vests.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:45.560]   We have taken the view that we want to be very, very fair.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:50.780]   But again, back to the thumb on the scale, we take our excess cash flow or we have tried
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.120]   to take our excess cash flow and buy our stock back.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:33:00.560]   So if you were to look at our share count, say 10 years ago, I think we probably had
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:04.760]   50, 52 million shares outstanding.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:12.800]   Today we have 35 million shares outstanding, meaning that during the last 10 years, if
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:20.720]   the value of our company, if the enterprise value has doubled, the share price has tripled.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:24.880]   The biggest beneficiaries of that are the people who have gotten the grants that we
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:27.240]   gave in the prior periods.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:36.120]   So to me, creating that virtuous cycle where you really are counting that stock as an expense,
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:37.120]   that's the way to do it.
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:44.040]   A long, long time ago, we adopted the practice of not pro-forming out the cost of stock-based
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:48.400]   compensation because it's a very, very real cost.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   We do reference cash flow and we do reference free cash flow.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   But in our most recent proxy statement, we actually pointed out that the thing that we
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:05.040]   really look at is how much of our free cash flow is being spent on stock-based compensation.
[00:34:05.040 --> 00:34:10.240]   Maybe that's a segue, Brett, to what are the solutions to get this under control?
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:13.360]   But we have always had booking.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.300]   And certainly with all the companies that I'm involved with, I try to get everybody
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:22.280]   to focus on the fact that a dollar of stock-based compensation is actually, not only should
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.920]   it not be ignored, it's the most single valuable expense.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:32.600]   You had a chart and in the chart you compared booking holdings, and we'll show this, the
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:40.680]   percentage of operating cash flow that various tech companies spent on stock-based comp.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.080]   And so again, I've been on comp committees on public companies.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.520]   So if I'm on the comp committee of a public company board, generally what I do at the
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:55.440]   start of every year when I'm negotiating the options or the RSU packages for the employees,
[00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:59.520]   we bring in a comp consultant, right?
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:05.680]   And this comp consultant makes some recommendations to us based upon the peer groups that look
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:09.040]   like this particular company.
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:13.440]   Not surprisingly, because everybody has adopted this practice, you know, it's a little bit
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.280]   of **** in, **** out.
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.440]   And so if, you know, if everybody's, you know, following a dumb comp practice, that is your
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:24.420]   peer group, you know, compare.
[00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:30.000]   But tell us a little bit about this chart and, you know, if I'm, we're on a public company
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.800]   comp board, and I'm going to, Bill, ask you the same thing as it relates to venture.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.580]   But if I'm on that public company comp board, what is my takeaway in terms of what the gold
[00:35:38.580 --> 00:35:39.580]   standard is?
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.960]   What, is this the way that I should be measuring it?
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:46.120]   Or should I be paying attention to Compensia and these other comp consultants that are
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.120]   coming my way?
[00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:48.760]   I don't know that there's a gold standard.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.200]   To me, the gold standard is to just count it.
[00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.040]   Again, as I said, like you would never think of not counting expenses that are denominated
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:02.840]   in euros if you were, if you had a European subsidiary.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.160]   Just the dollars count.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:09.200]   I guess what I'm saying is, is like, it shouldn't be excluded to begin with.
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:16.240]   So, one easy way of looking at the practices of various companies is to look at, okay,
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:24.080]   what is the dollar value of stock-based compensation expressed as a percentage of OCF or FCF?
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.720]   That is a blunt way of looking at it.
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:33.760]   And by the way, it will shock you when you look at just how much of a company's free
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:39.200]   cash flow goes directly back to stock-based compensation.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:42.320]   I think we've done that analysis, Bob.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:43.320]   You've done that analysis.
[00:36:43.320 --> 00:36:50.720]   You know, I think on a chart of maybe 40 or 50 names, we have maybe 10 names that are
[00:36:50.720 --> 00:36:56.880]   under 20 percent of their free cash flow as a percentage of stock-based compensation.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:03.600]   So it is – like the thing that jumps off the page at you is just for tech companies,
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:08.760]   which is what we're here talking about, what we care about, it's a massive, if not the
[00:37:08.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   largest single expense for them.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:15.880]   And it's the one thing that way too many of them are not paying attention to.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:21.000]   I think to give some credit where credit is due, I do think some of the adjustments, for
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.960]   example, that you've seen Meta make both in terms of headcount and now how they're talking
[00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:31.240]   about SBC as a real expense, Uber is talking about SBC as a real expense.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:37.640]   Like there has – partly due to your leadership, partly due to this move to GetFit, people
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.080]   are paying attention and are talking about it.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:46.360]   I think from our perspective, it's not that you should stop giving – using stock.
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:50.880]   But to your point, you should discount the damn thing and treat it as cash and we should
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:57.360]   have an honest conversation on an all-in basis what these various companies are earning.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:02.880]   Yeah, and look, let me talk – first of all, I do think shareholders are starting to care.
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:06.320]   Like it's – the conversations are happening.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:12.840]   I think most of them oddly happen in one-on-one conversations and as was said earlier by Bob,
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:17.360]   the industry seems to kind of accept this adjusted EBITDA thing.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.400]   It shows up in the sell-side research.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.720]   It's in the earnings releases from the companies.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:27.360]   There are many companies who only talk about that on the earnings call and never talk about
[00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:28.360]   the net income.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.400]   So it is – but I think the shareholders are paying attention.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:36.080]   I think they're very unhappy with where things are.
[00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:37.720]   A couple of things Bob hit on.
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:42.680]   You know, if you're in a boardroom where people are saying we should buy back the exact
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:49.840]   number of shares to offset the SBC, this is going to sound like I'm really – but you're
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:56.040]   dealing with financially ignorant people and they just don't understand and those same
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:39:03.760]   people I think are being widely disrespectful to people in your practice, Brad, of owning
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.760]   shares.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:08.400]   You're not that stupid to where you would say, "Oh, if you buy it back, then it never
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.400]   happened."
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   Like –
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:11.880]   I've had this argument many times.
[00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:12.880]   Right.
[00:39:12.880 --> 00:39:13.880]   Right.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:18.920]   You're taking my earnings that we could either use to invest in new projects, invest
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.320]   in new countries –
[00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.240]   Do a dividend.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.400]   Or just hand – give back by way of dividends and instead you're buying back the shares,
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:32.200]   which effectively just acknowledges that this in fact was the cash that we said it was in
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   the first place.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:36.600]   By the way, when the RSUs invest, they sell – so you're selling and buying at the
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:37.600]   same time.
[00:39:37.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   Right.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:39.600]   What's the point of that?
[00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:45.520]   But anyway, I also agree with the comment that was made that I think management teams
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:50.320]   treat cash – I thought that conversation about the hiring example you mentioned.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:55.520]   But management gets very concerned about spending a dollar of cash and they're – and many
[00:39:55.520 --> 00:40:00.120]   of these companies, they almost don't care about spending the equity, which is a weird,
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:03.400]   bizarre thing because they're actually the same thing in these cases.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.840]   Well, it's not weird and bizarre if at the end of the year, remember, a lot of their
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:10.920]   bonuses are based on adjusted EBITDA.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:11.960]   Okay?
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:17.640]   So again, to Bob's point, if we adjust this out, then it gets back to Charlie Munger,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:21.080]   show me the incentives and I'll show you the behavior.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.680]   Let me jump off of that.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:29.080]   So having been in many public comp committees, here's what happens.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:34.400]   There's no one in that committee that's thinking about things from a shareholder alignment
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:35.400]   perspective.
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:39.120]   They're all thinking about what are the common practices.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:44.280]   So you go hire a comp consultant and the comp consultant is going to tell you what your
[00:40:44.280 --> 00:40:45.280]   peers are doing.
[00:40:45.280 --> 00:40:49.520]   In fact, you create a peer list, you study what the peers are doing and you build your
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:51.840]   program based on what the peers are doing.
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:56.560]   And if enough people choose the 75th percentile, then you move – what happens there?
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:40:58.800]   You move even higher.
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:03.440]   But nowhere does anyone – I don't think the comp consultant or anyone stand up and
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.240]   say, "Hey, is this a good program for the shareholders?"
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:10.960]   And when I've tried to do that in the board meetings, I get pushback.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.360]   And there's a great –
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:18.480]   Ironic given that there's a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders, but I agree with you.
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:19.480]   No doubt.
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:20.960]   And I love this quote.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:25.840]   Warren Buffett said, "I'd rather stick a viper down my shirt than hire a comp consultant."
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:31.800]   And my big takeaway from that is the best and the brightest companies have to have the
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:37.800]   courage to lead and go in their own direction and create a compensation program that is
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:42.480]   unique to them and that is financially rigorous and understands these things.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.520]   We've heard a great example of booking.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:46.640]   I think another one is Netflix.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:51.820]   So Netflix today has a remarkably unique compensation structure.
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:53.440]   No one does anything like them.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:59.460]   But today, if you're an employee, you get to choose either options or cash.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.120]   And there's a slider and you get to pick where you want to be on that slider.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:05.480]   They don't have RSUs, none.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:10.760]   And in a very recent comp committee consultant conversation, I said, "I'd rather use options."
[00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.160]   They said, "I wouldn't recommend it.
[00:42:12.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   No one else is doing it."
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:14.840]   Yeah, no one else is doing it.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:15.840]   No one else is doing it.
[00:42:15.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   Unbelievable.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:17.840]   And so anyway –
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.280]   But this gets back to the conversation you and I had last week, right?
[00:42:21.280 --> 00:42:27.420]   We even have a court criticizing Elon for taking an options package where he made no
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:31.000]   money unless he saved the company from bankruptcy.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:36.440]   Meanwhile, the CEO of his arch rival, who created no shareholder value over a period
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.760]   of five years, is making tens of millions of dollars a year in RSUs.
[00:42:40.760 --> 00:42:45.460]   And by the way, I'll say it again, I said it before, I would offer any CEO I work with
[00:42:45.460 --> 00:42:50.460]   the Elon package and I'm certain none of them would take it.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:55.520]   And two, if Delaware doesn't get this right, they really need to understand that shareholder
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:43:01.560]   alignment and executive compensation is a very, very important piece of making these
[00:43:01.560 --> 00:43:03.560]   markets work.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:08.040]   But I'll just – again, Bill, I'll agree with you that – because I've been on both
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.740]   sides of it obviously when I was on the management side putting together these compensation plans
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:19.880]   and presenting them to our compensation committee and to our compensation consultant.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:28.400]   And of course, as a director of many public companies and many comp committees, the dynamic
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.360]   is kind of almost always the same.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:37.800]   A company establishes its peer group and no board ever wants to think of their management
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:42.560]   team as being anything other than above the mean.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.960]   And you have 100 percent of all those companies that are thinking of their management teams
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:52.680]   as being above the mean, so you have this constantly upward pressure on these – on
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:54.320]   the granting practices.
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:44:01.840]   It takes a mindset of like how do we as executives and how do we as leaders of the company want
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:04.600]   all of us to make money?
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:09.880]   And I think one of the – back to sort of what are solutions.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:18.080]   Consultants, comp committees, venture capitalists, even investors, they're very far too focused
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:24.080]   on the term annual dilution percentage.
[00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:30.680]   Hey, this is a reasonable granting practice because it's only 2 percent or it's only
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.880]   3 percent or whatever.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:39.440]   But really, all anyone is saying when they say that is they're making a commentary on
[00:44:39.440 --> 00:44:45.600]   the valuation of the company because if I'm a company making a billion dollars of free
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:54.360]   cash flow but I have a 100 billion dollar market cap, right, and I've got a 1 percent
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:45:01.720]   dilution rate, well, I theoretically look like I'm managing the company well, it's
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.320]   1 percent even though I just wiped out all my free cash flow.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:13.640]   You just have to focus on dollars, ignore dilution percentage and if you want, yeah,
[00:45:13.640 --> 00:45:19.320]   you could look at stock based compensation expressed as a percentage of free cash flow.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:24.560]   But again, Brad, to your point on that slide, it's a shocking number.
[00:45:24.560 --> 00:45:31.680]   The percentage of free cash flow that goes right back in to stock is a huge number and
[00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:38.120]   when you do that over and over and over again, if it's 25, 30, 35 percent every single year
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:42.560]   which that's kind of the math of it for many, many years.
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:48.440]   The dilution is actually – if you dilute free cash flow by 30 to 35 percent every single
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:51.160]   year for 20 years, guess what?
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.960]   Your dilution is 35 percent.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.160]   It's not a half of – it's not 50 basis points.
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:45:58.160]   It's not 1 percent.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:59.160]   It's not 2 percent.
[00:45:59.160 --> 00:46:02.520]   It's literally a third of the company.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.800]   I think you make such a good point, Bob.
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:13.220]   I go back to this Buffett interview he did on CNBC because this gets pretty esoteric.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.120]   You sit in these comp committee meetings.
[00:46:15.120 --> 00:46:16.920]   I see the eyes glaze over.
[00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:19.400]   There's a social dynamic at play.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   You sit on the board.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.640]   You're in the room.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.900]   You often know these people, right?
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:26.720]   You want to treat them fairly.
[00:46:26.720 --> 00:46:28.680]   But Buffett said this and we'll show this quote.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.840]   He said, "I think the best way to compensate people is with cash.
[00:46:31.840 --> 00:46:35.600]   If you want to give them a bonus for exceptional performance, give them cash.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   It's simple.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:37.600]   It's straightforward.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:38.600]   It's clean."
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:42.120]   He said, "I don't believe in using stock options as a form of compensation.
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:44.800]   I think it's just a way to get around paying out cash.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:48.560]   I think it's a way to sort of camouflage what's really going on."
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:54.080]   Now, I disagree with Buffett on the idea of whether or not we should use options.
[00:46:54.080 --> 00:47:00.400]   I actually think there's a tremendous amount of alignment and incentives that are created
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:01.400]   through that.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:05.600]   But if you ask me, Bob, what do you think is the best thing if you're sitting on a comp
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:13.320]   committee, the conversation that I would force is let's have a discussion about cash, right?
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:20.400]   What is the value of what we're giving up, right, in order to achieve our objectives?
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.160]   Does it make sense?
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.820]   Because if not, then it obscures bad business models.
[00:47:27.820 --> 00:47:30.560]   It obscures sloppy performance, right?
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:34.840]   To me, it comes back to this question of getting fit.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:38.200]   You want to know, "Am I really fit?"
[00:47:38.200 --> 00:47:43.480]   If you're going to work out and you're not measuring your weight or your body fat or
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:48.360]   anything else, you're kidding yourself.
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:54.640]   To me, the measure of whether or not a company is really performing is the cash equivalent
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:47:56.200]   focus.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:48:05.120]   Bill, on this, the thing I wanted to ask you is what has been the rule of thumb in Silicon
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.120]   Valley?
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:12.440]   If you're a founder, you used to invest almost exclusively in Series A companies, first institutional
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:14.240]   money in.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:15.240]   I don't know.
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:20.840]   The rule of thumb is there would be a 20% or a 30% stock option pool in addition to
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.360]   what the founders owned in the business.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.640]   That would go down over time, I think.
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:31.760]   As you march to the public market, you would have to focus on, again, treating this as
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.360]   cash and getting profitable.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:40.120]   What are the rules of thumb today in Series B, Series C, Series D?
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:43.680]   Where do you think you're seeing some of the sloppiness?
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:49.440]   Well, look, the thing I'd start with in answering that question is mostly startups never get
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:54.140]   to this place that we're talking about.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:49:00.360]   A lot of the commentary in Silicon Valley is always about the 10 or 20 or 50 companies
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:06.200]   at the top, and the vast majority of these companies never get to that place.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:11.360]   The general rules of thumb, as I started with, are like 10% headed down to three.
[00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:16.040]   It is done as a dilution perspective.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.240]   Profitability first, I think, is if you have a company, especially one that burns a lot
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:26.520]   of cash, and if new fundraising and capital is expensive, I think one of the reasons people
[00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:32.360]   start with this adjusted EBITDA number is it does represent a point in time at which
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:37.520]   you no longer have to raise capital from the markets.
[00:49:37.520 --> 00:49:41.500]   You could argue over whether that matters or not if you're issuing stock, but it does.
[00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.840]   It may matter, especially if capital is hard to come by.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:48.640]   Then I would just say some of the same things we've been saying.
[00:49:48.640 --> 00:49:50.600]   Don't fool yourself.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:54.720]   Don't assume cash is cheaper or more expensive than equity.
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:57.880]   They're really the same thing, and eventually it's going to matter.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:00.280]   I do think Wall Street figures it out.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   I don't think there are any secrets.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:05.760]   I think alignment is really, really important.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:12.960]   I encourage companies to, and I do this when I'm recruiting, to look at scenarios of the
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:19.280]   stock being up 20%, 40%, 80%, 100%, and look at the payouts that people are going to make
[00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:21.880]   on that, and see if you have alignment.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:27.940]   I think if you're only doing zero basis RSUs, you've got a horrible alignment problem.
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.200]   Don't be mad.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:33.360]   When you think you're EBITDA profitable, and your stock doesn't have the same multiple
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:39.600]   as the other company, and I guarantee if you look under the hood, they've got a lower SBC
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.920]   expense, and they're not pissing away their free cash flow.
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:46.400]   I don't think there are any secrets.
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.320]   I think competition is a real issue.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:55.360]   One of the things I wanted to go to with Bob, I saw this really interesting presentation
[00:50:55.360 --> 00:51:01.920]   from Gary Steele, who turned around Splunk in a similar way to what happened at Meta.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:06.640]   Gary crushed it at proof point, and a huge value creator.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:15.920]   He said, in a very short window, he said he took stock participation from 87% to 15%.
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:20.800]   I saw so many CEOs in the audience, their face just went into shock.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:27.760]   It has become almost ritual in Silicon Valley to assume you have to give everybody stock,
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.160]   including the chef.
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:33.960]   It literally is part of, "Oh, we're cool like everybody else."
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.600]   I think that's being re-examined.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:42.760]   The other thing he said was, they moved a lot of employees out of Silicon Valley.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:47.200]   That's an interesting thing, and I'm hearing that from more and more CEOs.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:50.040]   They say, "Silicon Valley is a wonderful place to start a company.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:53.000]   It's a horrible place to scale a company."
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:57.960]   My goal isn't to come on this podcast and say, "Hey, everybody is getting overpaid."
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   Far from it.
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:05.120]   It's more just how I think people – we need to have a better model by which people
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.120]   get paid.
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:16.440]   At least at Priceline Booking, we always had the mantra of a dollar has to be worth a dollar,
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.080]   whether it's in cash or comp.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:26.120]   If we can't convince somebody that a dollar worth of stock is worth a dollar, then you
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:27.320]   actually shouldn't grant it.
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:33.840]   You should just give a dollar of cash because they will actually value it greater.
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:39.360]   I think over time, because we've been so careful about this and because we have been
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:47.200]   able to create shareholder value through many ways, mostly through the incredible work of
[00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:52.560]   the employee base, but also, as I said, through smart capital management that has allowed
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:58.760]   us to reduce our share count, that's an incredible benefit that employees have gotten
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:53:01.440]   over the past many years.
[00:53:01.440 --> 00:53:06.560]   When the share count is getting reduced, theoretically, the stock price is supposed to go up.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.320]   That benefits not only shareholders, but the RSU recipient.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:16.480]   Ryan: Hey, Bob, do you have any sense how many employee millionaires that Booking Priceline
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:19.080]   has made over the last 20 years?
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:21.320]   Bob: No, I don't.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:23.680]   But it's – it is certainly –
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:25.280]   Ryan: Extraordinary number.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:26.280]   Bob: Yeah.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.360]   Ryan: Extraordinary number.
[00:53:28.360 --> 00:53:32.240]   Maybe this is a good place to wrap.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:38.120]   I think your leadership on this issue, right, with this fundamental thing – this is not
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:47.080]   about undermining founders' and employees' opportunity to make an extraordinary return,
[00:53:47.080 --> 00:53:50.160]   make millions of dollars in these startups.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.640]   In fact, it's about protecting that.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:55.400]   And it starts in the public markets.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:59.800]   Because if the public markets all pretend that this doesn't exist, then they're going
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:05.400]   to pay excessive amounts, which deprives startups and the venture capital community of being
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:07.480]   able to hire those employees and compete.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:13.080]   That's the example you just gave us just now of Microsoft.
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:18.800]   And so I think that accountability, treating stock as cash, as public shareholders – and
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:26.320]   the good news is, like I said, there's a lot of evidence that this is starting to be
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:32.760]   a real matter of conversation on Twitter, on CNBC, in annual letters, folks like Bob
[00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.360]   leading the way.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:40.240]   And then I think we need to begin telling the stories again in Silicon Valley.
[00:54:40.240 --> 00:54:44.680]   The reason the Michael Dells of the world own as much of their companies at the end
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:49.820]   of the day as they do is because from day one, they were concerned about giving shares
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:52.560]   away where they didn't need to give shares away.
[00:54:52.560 --> 00:54:55.440]   And so that discipline cascades down.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:55:02.080]   I think all companies are better when their DNA from the get-go is just honest.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:04.880]   They treat all of these things as expenses.
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:07.920]   It forces you to build a better business model.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:12.320]   We were lucky to be partnered with Bob and investors from the early days.
[00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:18.000]   And they were forced to really reboot and think about the business model that they were
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   going to focus on.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.520]   If they kept pretending that this didn't matter, I think it would have been a very
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.280]   different outcome for that business.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:29.120]   I think you would have produced far fewer millionaires than the number that you've
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:30.120]   produced.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:36.120]   And again, in Silicon Valley today, I do see this also cascading down into the companies
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.120]   that we're investing in.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:42.000]   Certainly the companies that were on the comp committees of the boardrooms that we're in,
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:45.040]   this is a matter of conversation.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:52.720]   I would say during the heyday of Zerp, I was seeing some really crazy stuff in terms of
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:53.880]   annual dilution.
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:57.440]   And now it's a tough conversation at each of those boards because I think a lot of venture
[00:55:57.440 --> 00:56:03.600]   capital firms and founders woke up and said, "Wow, I just gave away a lot of the business.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:08.840]   I thought that was okay because the valuations had gone from $500 million to $5 billion.
[00:56:08.840 --> 00:56:14.080]   But now that I know I'm really only worth a billion dollars, the consequence of that
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:16.480]   dilution was way more dramatic than I thought."
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:22.280]   And I would just close by once again going back to this notion of independent leadership.
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:28.160]   The only companies I see kind of getting out of this box are ones where you have people
[00:56:28.160 --> 00:56:33.520]   that are thinking from a first principles standpoint, like Bob did at booking.
[00:56:33.520 --> 00:56:40.680]   In the Netflix example I gave, they're only diluting 1.5% a year, which is pretty left
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:45.480]   rail kind of thing if you look at them on one of these charts we're going to post.
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:53.240]   And so it takes someone that really understands this stuff at a fundamental level to be willing
[00:56:53.240 --> 00:56:58.080]   to step outside the box because once again, the comp consultants, maybe even ISS are going
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.840]   to tell you to do what everybody else is doing.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.720]   And I don't think that's going to get you to the finish line.
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:04.720]   Right.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.240]   Thanks for being with us, Bob.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:13.000]   Well, Brad, I thought maybe we'd hit two or three more topics today.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.920]   And wrapping it up, I just thank you once again to Bob.
[00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:20.240]   And I wanted everyone to know that we're going to put a bunch of resources in the show notes.
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:26.840]   We've taken snapshots of 50, 100 different companies, looked at SBC as a percentage of
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.880]   free cash flow, which Brad and his team believe is the most important, but also revenue and
[00:57:31.880 --> 00:57:32.880]   market cap.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.240]   I think those are all useful ways to kind of get a sense of how companies are doing
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.360]   on this issue.
[00:57:38.360 --> 00:57:44.580]   And then lastly, my good friend, Mike Mobison, who many people in the internet finance world
[00:57:44.580 --> 00:57:50.640]   know about, he put out a really great piece on stock-based comp and reading it put a lot
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:53.000]   of thoughts in my head as we went through this.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.760]   So I'll put a pointer out there to that as well.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:58:02.280]   OK, so there's a lot of new stuff happening, Brad, since we talked last.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:08.960]   One of them that's kind of interesting, and I think I saw a photo on the internet of Sundar
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:11.920]   and Tim Cook at a restaurant that may have kicked this off.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:17.960]   But there's a rumor that Apple's talking to Google about leveraging Gemini, I believe.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:19.800]   And tell me what you think of this.
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.840]   Yeah, I mean, I think the news broke yesterday.
[00:58:22.840 --> 00:58:24.520]   Both our stocks were up a bunch on it.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:32.040]   This idea that-- I think the implication of the rumor or the tweet was that Apple was
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:36.920]   somehow maybe outsourcing or partnering with Google on Gemini.
[00:58:36.920 --> 00:58:44.800]   And I tweeted in response to this that I put the probability of them, quote unquote, outsourcing
[00:58:44.800 --> 00:58:47.640]   AI to Gemini at next to zero.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:50.680]   We talked about this on the pod a few weeks ago.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:57.480]   And I think that we-- I go back to that analysis, which is this.
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:59:05.800]   Apple is in this enviable position to be able to build the killer personal assistant that
[00:59:05.800 --> 00:59:10.660]   has memory, that has persistent, that can do transactional thing for us, whether it's
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:16.480]   make a phone call, send a text, book a restaurant reservation, book a hotel, et cetera.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:21.600]   So we suggested that they're going to work on their own native small language model that
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:23.880]   really doesn't need to be Einstein.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:27.500]   It just needs to serve me really well as my personal assistant.
[00:59:27.500 --> 00:59:34.800]   I think what's likely being commingled here is I presuppose that Apple is also talking
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:41.920]   to Google, to Meta, to OpenAI, and others about bringing those models in as part of
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:45.820]   a generative search application that will sit on the deck as well.
[00:59:45.820 --> 00:59:47.960]   So think of that maybe similar to perplexity.
[00:59:47.960 --> 00:59:52.960]   And then, of course, they have their search deal with Google.
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:58.800]   So to me, I don't think anything really changes in my view about Apple.
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:02.160]   I think they continue to be in this really interesting position.
[01:00:02.160 --> 01:00:07.840]   I'm sure they're going to talk about it in June at their developers conference.
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:12.880]   I think it's unlikely that you're going to see some transformative thing get shipped
[01:00:12.880 --> 01:00:13.880]   this fall.
[01:00:13.880 --> 01:00:19.420]   I think you may very well see a generative search application that gets shipped this
[01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:25.960]   fall that may, in fact, have multiple of these answer engines embedded inside it, including
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   Gemini.
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:33.580]   But the final thing I would just say on this is I've been, over the course of the last
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:40.940]   couple months, pretty openly critical in my critique that Google needs to face up to this
[01:00:40.940 --> 01:00:46.380]   innovators dilemma, that needs to make some real changes in terms of how they're going
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:48.100]   to market.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:52.460]   And you and I have those debates all the time.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:59.060]   And I think there is a group of people on Twitter and otherwise who assume that I must
[01:00:59.060 --> 01:01:03.700]   somehow-- that must mean that I'm short Google.
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:08.300]   And we've said many times, this show is not investment advice.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:12.220]   Don't presuppose you know where we stand on a particular stock.
[01:01:12.220 --> 01:01:15.660]   I'm often asking tough questions of stocks that we own.
[01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:18.180]   I mean, go back to Meta.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:19.740]   And in fact, we own Google.
[01:01:19.740 --> 01:01:24.700]   We weren't shorted this week when this news came out.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:30.460]   And so I think it's an important reminder, much like Stan Druckenmiller.
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:34.660]   At this moment in time, when you're in the middle of these phase shifts, mental flexibility
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.420]   is incredibly important.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:43.100]   And we are going to follow the facts, and we may change our opinions on a particular
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:44.100]   stock.
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.100]   I think ultimately for Google, the challenge remains the same.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:50.020]   The challenge for Apple remains the same.
[01:01:50.020 --> 01:01:56.180]   You should imagine that everybody is talking to everybody right now as they try to sort
[01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.940]   out where they're going to compete.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:01:59.940]   But I don't know.
[01:01:59.940 --> 01:02:01.540]   What was your reaction to it, Bill?
[01:02:01.540 --> 01:02:06.820]   Well, it's funny, because I think you can have two reactions that are exactly opposed
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:07.820]   to one another.
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:08.820]   Right.
[01:02:08.820 --> 01:02:10.980]   So you could view it-- you said both stocks were up.
[01:02:10.980 --> 01:02:11.980]   Yes.
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.780]   So that's the interpretation, that this is positive for Apple, that they're maybe getting
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:19.740]   their AI game ready to go.
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:24.600]   You could view it as weakness on Apple, that in order to get AI right, they need to go
[01:02:24.600 --> 01:02:27.420]   talk to Google, and they can't do it on their own.
[01:02:27.420 --> 01:02:33.140]   As we have said before, I think the handset is a remarkable asset in the long-term AI
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:34.140]   race.
[01:02:34.140 --> 01:02:38.020]   I mean, you know, one issue that could come out of this is regulatory.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:41.340]   I mean, if you combine the two of them, that's nearly every handset.
[01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:46.460]   So if the same AI code were running on both, I don't think that'd be great.
[01:02:46.460 --> 01:02:51.620]   I do believe that the handset is so valuable here.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:56.620]   If I were Apple and wanted to prove to the world that they had their AI game together,
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:03:00.740]   and I know this is a bit of a broken record with people, but fix Siri.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:03.860]   Like get Siri involved and release-- But that is the small language model that
[01:03:03.860 --> 01:03:04.920]   I'm talking about, right?
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:07.660]   That is going to be the new back end for Siri.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:09.580]   Like there's no way they're outsourcing that to Google.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:16.620]   And by the way, on that topic, I think voice AI may be more interesting than, say, Sora
[01:03:16.620 --> 01:03:19.260]   or the video stuff that OpenAI released.
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:25.580]   I think more and more people are realizing, because LLMs are language models, that people
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:27.580]   would love to just talk to them.
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:33.620]   You brought up the point that Meta may be more focused on the sunglasses with an earpiece,
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:34.620]   right?
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:35.620]   Right.
[01:03:35.620 --> 01:03:36.620]   And you want to be able to talk to that.
[01:03:36.620 --> 01:03:44.540]   And so for me, the irony of this is, I think voice AI may be a new frontier that you may
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:47.340]   see a bunch of these people race after.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:52.660]   And getting that to work appropriately so that you feel comfortable-- I always like
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:57.260]   to reference the movie Her-- just talking to this thing and not having any errors, I
[01:03:57.260 --> 01:03:58.620]   think that's super interesting.
[01:03:58.620 --> 01:04:01.500]   So we'll see how this all plays out.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.820]   Let's move on to the next topic.
[01:04:02.820 --> 01:04:10.580]   So there's been a lot of conversation in the past few weeks about TikTok and ByteDance.
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:19.300]   And obviously, it very quickly moved to the center of almost all discussion, because it
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:21.220]   involved the House and the Senate.
[01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:23.580]   And it's on the Sunday morning talk shows.
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.700]   It's in every newspaper.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.380]   And it's been discussed quite a bit.
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:30.700]   But I'd love to hear your thoughts, Brad, on this situation.
[01:04:30.700 --> 01:04:35.660]   Yeah, well, I've said publicly before, we were early shareholders in ByteDance.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:39.660]   I think we've been involved almost a decade in the company.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:43.540]   So take everything I share with that grain of salt.
[01:04:43.540 --> 01:04:49.580]   First, I think everybody knows ByteDance is a super large company.
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:51.860]   There's lots of numbers that are rumored out there.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:57.020]   But the reporting suggests that over 90% of its revenues are outside the United States,
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.900]   and over 100% of its profits are outside the United States.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:01.900]   What's that mean?
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:04.940]   Well, I think I've seen other numbers out there that they're doing somewhere between
[01:05:04.940 --> 01:05:10.620]   $8 billion and $10 billion in TikTok US revenue, and that they're losing money on TikTok US.
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:15.200]   So I think that it's important just to understand where that sits in the context of the entire
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:16.200]   business.
[01:05:16.200 --> 01:05:21.820]   Secondly, with respect to myself, I'm a dad, and certainly an American first.
[01:05:21.820 --> 01:05:23.700]   And my kids use TikTok.
[01:05:23.700 --> 01:05:25.540]   They create on TikTok, et cetera.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:29.380]   But I read all the same things everybody else reads.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:33.300]   And I think it's impossible for me to prove or disprove.
[01:05:33.300 --> 01:05:37.500]   And I think there's legitimate debate as to what's going on.
[01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:43.060]   I think there's also lots of legitimate debate about the House bill itself and whether or
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:48.700]   not that's narrowly tailored enough, whether the language needs to be improved, et cetera.
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:53.660]   But clearly, it passed the House by a wide majority.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:57.460]   I think there's a real question as to whether or not that will pass the Senate.
[01:05:57.460 --> 01:06:00.460]   But I think that misses the point a little bit.
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:07.220]   Set all of that aside, what's become clear to me over the course of the past 12 months,
[01:06:07.220 --> 01:06:12.380]   and certainly over the course of the past 30 days, is irrespective of the merits of
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.460]   the matter, right?
[01:06:13.460 --> 01:06:17.220]   This is now in the sovereign domain, right?
[01:06:17.220 --> 01:06:24.020]   AI, over the course of the last 12 months, has gone from an interesting technology to
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:32.260]   literally the leading edge of where we're battling with global sovereigns over trade,
[01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:35.220]   national security, national economic interest.
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:41.840]   So given that, I think it's almost inconceivable for me now to see how TikTok US has a path
[01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:45.240]   forward under kind of the status quo.
[01:06:45.240 --> 01:06:47.140]   So where does that leave us?
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:53.260]   That leaves us, on the one hand, with the proposal that I think President Trump had
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:58.280]   made toward the end of his term, and which I hear bantered about by lots of senators
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:03.640]   and House members, which is some sort of spin to US shareholders, where maybe ByteDance
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:08.020]   swaps some of its ownership or sells some of its ownership to somebody like a Microsoft
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:12.420]   or an Oracle, and the app can continue running in the United States, OK?
[01:07:12.420 --> 01:07:18.060]   I think there are a lot of US regulators that would find that an acceptable outcome.
[01:07:18.060 --> 01:07:22.100]   But I'm increasingly of the mind that the Chinese regulators would not find that an
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:24.660]   acceptable outcome, OK?
[01:07:24.660 --> 01:07:28.940]   And the US regulators won't allow the app to continue as is.
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.340]   So I think there's a real chance that when we're looking at this 12 to 18 months from
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:38.300]   now, that it's an absolute no-go, that they can't find a middle ground, and that the app
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:44.380]   is shut down, which, of course, we saw President Trump tweet, like, the implications of what
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:51.900]   that makes Meta more valuable or more powerful, as he suggests, or perhaps these other US
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.900]   companies.
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:56.340]   But the thing, I guess, that interests me the most is what is—you know, that's just
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:58.500]   the first step, Bill, right?
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:04.940]   Like that's the first move on the AI chessboard between these two sovereigns, if you will.
[01:08:04.940 --> 01:08:11.020]   It's hard for me to see a world where TikTok US is shut down or banned, where there's not
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:13.220]   some response by China.
[01:08:13.220 --> 01:08:19.260]   And I think we just had this conversation about Apple putting Gemini AI on the Apple
[01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.260]   phone.
[01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:26.020]   I'm certain, you know, Apple China is a monstrous business, is a huge business in China.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:30.840]   And I imagine that now that AI is going to be embedded in these phones, that there's
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:36.340]   probably a little bit different conversation that's being had in China about, you know,
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   about that there as well.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:42.780]   So I think we're seeing just the early innings, unfortunately, right?
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:47.780]   I tend to think that global trade is a good thing for human prosperity.
[01:08:47.780 --> 01:08:51.980]   I think it's driven a lot of our global GDP and prosperity over the course of the last
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.980]   20 years.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:59.020]   So I don't celebrate that we're entering what appears to be a global AI Cold War on
[01:08:59.020 --> 01:09:01.820]   the economic front.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:07.620]   And I'm certainly not critical of the fact that US regulators have these concerns.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:09.660]   But unfortunately, I don't see much of a way out here.
[01:09:09.660 --> 01:09:10.780]   I hope I'm wrong.
[01:09:10.780 --> 01:09:16.300]   I hope that, you know, when President Xi was here a few months ago, he said, I don't want
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:17.940]   a Cold War, I don't want a hot war.
[01:09:17.940 --> 01:09:19.060]   I want a partnership.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.100]   But that's not what it looks like from my vantage point today.
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:24.860]   I'll give you a couple of my thoughts.
[01:09:24.860 --> 01:09:29.180]   First of all, I thought our friends over at All In did a really great job of tearing this
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.180]   apart.
[01:09:30.180 --> 01:09:35.660]   And even where they disagreed, I think every single one of them agreed that the data probably
[01:09:35.660 --> 01:09:37.260]   should not be going to the CCP.
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:42.260]   Like I haven't seen anyone said, oh, I'm completely cool with data going to the CCP.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:47.220]   So if everyone's in agreement on that, and I do understand the arguments that maybe the
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:52.380]   House bill is too flexible or too vague or too broad, and you could tighten it up and
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:54.740]   achieve the same things.
[01:09:54.740 --> 01:10:02.620]   As I've told you, I feel like that the company, and the company I'll say is either US TikTok
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:07.340]   or ByteDance, could have done a better job of proving data independence.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:13.180]   And I think they could have hired an auditor, you know, KPMG or Pricewaterhouse or whatever,
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:17.340]   rather than simply saying, oh, it's in Oracle in Texas.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.340]   To me, there's not much certainty in that comment.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:25.140]   I would also say relative to your Apple comment, I do believe Apple has to keep all their data
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:27.660]   locally over there and prove it to the CCP.
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:28.660]   So I think-
[01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:29.660]   But that may not be enough.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:30.660]   No, it may not.
[01:10:30.660 --> 01:10:31.660]   In this new context.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.660]   But I agree with you.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.540]   But I'm just saying from a prosody standpoint, I think they're already doing what is being
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:38.380]   asked here.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:42.740]   And as we all know, and we've said, the social networks here aren't allowed to operate there.
[01:10:42.740 --> 01:10:49.060]   So you could have a, I think you have a pro-China mindset and just still hold the line and say
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:51.300]   fairness is fairness.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:52.500]   So we will see how it plays out.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:56.100]   I'm hopeful that there's a way to get it together.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:57.340]   But who knows?
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:10:59.820]   We will see.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:00.820]   Anything else on that?
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:11.300]   No, I mean, I think that it's, once you start going down this slippery slope, right, you
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:16.540]   know, we have a lot of US companies that have a big footprint in China.
[01:11:16.540 --> 01:11:17.540]   And so-
[01:11:17.540 --> 01:11:19.100]   But you're already down the slippery slope.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:22.260]   Well, I mean, we haven't banned it yet.
[01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:26.780]   So I think if and when this effectively, you know, if this were to get banned in the United
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:31.100]   States, again, I would like to think that that would be, you know, where this ends.
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:36.780]   All I'm suggesting is that ChatGPT only came out 18 months ago.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:40.740]   And you can't use it in China.
[01:11:40.740 --> 01:11:45.620]   The wheels of international relations, I think, turn slowly.
[01:11:45.620 --> 01:11:52.220]   And when we look at, it's first started with silicon, right, with restraints on China's
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:54.220]   ability to get Nvidia chips.
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:12:00.020]   And again, I don't disagree with, you know, our ability to keep our best stuff to ourselves.
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:05.220]   But it's hard to look at the facts on the field and say that this is not, we're not
[01:12:05.220 --> 01:12:11.540]   entering a new phase of global international trade relations, you know, vis-a-vis China.
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:16.020]   Now, one might say that we're just, you know, creating a more fair and balanced playing
[01:12:16.020 --> 01:12:20.820]   field, right, relative to the restrictions that have been imposed on U.S. companies.
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.980]   But I think it would be naive of us to think that there's not going to be, you know, counter
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:26.180]   responses out of China.
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:27.180]   I hope not, but-
[01:12:27.180 --> 01:12:31.740]   I take the other side of it simply because we're not even getting to the point of equality
[01:12:31.740 --> 01:12:32.740]   here.
[01:12:32.740 --> 01:12:35.420]   So anyway, we'll leave it at that.
[01:12:35.420 --> 01:12:39.780]   And then this morning, just this morning, we rarely have news that broke just this morning,
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:44.460]   a very unusual thing has played out with Microsoft and inflection.
[01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.780]   Why don't you tell people what went down?
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:58.060]   Well, inflection, you know, is, you know, just as a reminder, was one of the early LLMs
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:13:00.620]   to be trained on H100s.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:04.860]   They have a consumer product called PI, which stands for personal intelligence, founded
[01:13:04.860 --> 01:13:12.300]   by Mustafa Suleyman, one of the co-founders of DeepMind, you know, and a friend.
[01:13:12.300 --> 01:13:16.180]   And you know, what they did was, you know, as one of the-
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:19.420]   And by the way, just to put in, I think there's another way to frame this.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:26.260]   There were three LLM companies in Silicon Valley that raised over a billion dollars,
[01:13:26.260 --> 01:13:31.580]   although some of that was with credits, but there were three, Anthropic, OpenAI, and this
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:32.580]   one.
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:33.580]   Correct.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:38.940]   And, you know, this is a large startup, but what they were going after was really think
[01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:42.660]   the chat GPT consumer market with PI.
[01:13:42.660 --> 01:13:51.180]   And, you know, today we heard news that Microsoft has effectively hired the employees out of
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.180]   inflection.
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:57.220]   We don't know all the details, you know, of the deal here.
[01:13:57.220 --> 01:14:02.860]   But you know, we looked at investing inflection, as many others did, and, you know, one of
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:08.580]   the reasons that strategic investors have displaced a lot of venture capital investors
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:13.900]   in the LLM game, and we talked about this, I think, on, you know, episode two, is the
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:20.220]   quantum of capital it takes to compete in the LLM space is very high.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:25.260]   And on the other side, understanding the durability of the business model, like in this case,
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:31.720]   getting consumers to pay you, you know, for PI is far from clear, particularly in a world
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:37.020]   where you got to go compete against Apple, you got to compete against Meta and others
[01:14:37.020 --> 01:14:39.500]   who are going to build a personal assistant.
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:42.860]   And so, I think it was a very difficult venture bet to underwrite.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:49.780]   I think it was a logical bet for folks like Microsoft, you know, to underwrite because,
[01:14:49.780 --> 01:14:55.260]   you know, they want to be in the consumer answer engine space, the consumer chatbot
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.260]   space, if you will.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:15:01.400]   I think the most interesting thing out of this, to me, and if you read Satya's tweet
[01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:07.220]   that he sent out this afternoon, is he said he's excited to have them build consumer AI,
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:13.660]   which, you know, he said, like the copilot, that is loved and benefits people from around
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:14.660]   the world.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:16.100]   So, just step back from a second here.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:23.740]   He owns 49% of OpenAI, ChatGPT is charging really hard to be, you know, kind of my personal
[01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:25.820]   copilot, if you will.
[01:15:25.820 --> 01:15:29.740]   And now they have another, you know, another team in the hunt.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:34.460]   So, you know, I think this is smart by Satya and Microsoft.
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:40.460]   Some might view it as hedging their bets a little bit against ChatGPT, but I think it's
[01:15:40.460 --> 01:15:41.980]   great for the consumer.
[01:15:41.980 --> 01:15:46.700]   They're going to be a lot of at-scale players that are vying to be your personal assistant,
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:48.860]   that are vying to answer your questions.
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:53.580]   We just talked about Apple, we talked about Meta AI, Google's certainly going to be in
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:54.580]   that hunt.
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:16:00.020]   And now it looks like Microsoft is doubling down on the consumer copilot, which will bring
[01:16:00.020 --> 01:16:01.860]   even more competition to the table.
[01:16:01.860 --> 01:16:02.860]   What was your takeaway?
[01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:10.340]   Well, look, I mean, I got to tell you, I was floored a bit when I saw this, mainly because
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:12.380]   of the peculiarity of it all.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:21.100]   So to have a company that is one of the three, let's just call it biggest backed AI companies
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:26.700]   in Silicon Valley, not get bought, like if they got bought, that means, "Oh, Microsoft
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:28.220]   thought this was strategic."
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:35.220]   Microsoft, you remember when Facebook brought WhatsApp, it was 10% of market cap.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:39.620]   So 10% of Microsoft's market cap is $300 billion.
[01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:44.060]   So they could have paid $10 billion, and the last round here was at $4 billion.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:49.740]   And you'd go, "Oh, great, you know, everyone loves AI, investors are getting paid, everything
[01:16:49.740 --> 01:16:50.740]   worked out."
[01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.660]   But this isn't everything worked out.
[01:16:52.660 --> 01:16:59.620]   This is employees, all the key employees leaving the company, and the blog post suggests the
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:02.740]   company goes on with a new CEO.
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:08.140]   And to me, I just had to look this up because I don't watch racing, but the yellow flag
[01:17:08.140 --> 01:17:13.420]   comes out when there's a hazard on the track and everyone needs to slow down.
[01:17:13.420 --> 01:17:20.580]   And you look at this Series A here, a well-known venture firm, Greylock, 260 or 250 at a billion
[01:17:20.580 --> 01:17:21.580]   pre.
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:27.220]   These are these AI deals that have remained like Zerp-like, right?
[01:17:27.220 --> 01:17:33.500]   And this is a warning sign that you can't just pay any price for any deal in the AI
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:35.340]   sector and get paid.
[01:17:35.340 --> 01:17:41.460]   And because I don't, you know, I don't see this now, I don't see the current status as
[01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:46.340]   a company that's going to have a venture-like return from here.
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.860]   There's a lot of details, there's a lot of these credit things that are all tied up,
[01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.740]   there's stuff we don't know.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:58.260]   But it's unusual, and I view it as a yellow flag that we should slow down on the track,
[01:17:58.260 --> 01:18:01.180]   on the AI track, and maybe be a little more careful.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:06.580]   Well, one of the things that it brings up too is a conversation you and I were having,
[01:18:06.580 --> 01:18:09.460]   you know, just about LLMs generally, you know.
[01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:16.260]   I spent the last two days down at NVIDIA, you know, GTC, their Global Developers Conference.
[01:18:16.260 --> 01:18:18.940]   It's just extraordinary.
[01:18:18.940 --> 01:18:22.660]   The ecosystem of AI that they are consuming, right?
[01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:24.020]   This is not a chips company.
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:27.580]   This is not just a systems company or a supercomputer company.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:34.100]   They are now expanding on the CUDA stack with a totally new inference software cluster called
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:35.460]   NIMS.
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:42.420]   And in NIMS, you know, they have embedded, you know, open-source models that are, you
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:46.980]   know, highly and tightly integrated with their overall software stack.
[01:18:46.980 --> 01:18:52.860]   And one of the things we've talked about and debated the last 12 months is just the durability.
[01:18:52.860 --> 01:18:57.060]   Like, what's the business model for the LLM?
[01:18:57.060 --> 01:19:02.740]   Is it going to, you know, you have these open-source models by well-financed companies like Meta
[01:19:02.740 --> 01:19:06.700]   that don't seem intent on charging for them.
[01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:13.220]   And when you have companies that are valued at $10, $20, $90 billion, right, around that,
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:16.980]   the real question was about the durability of revenue.
[01:19:16.980 --> 01:19:23.140]   And you know, we have a vibrant debate within Altimeter on this, right?
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:30.560]   So the acronym we all know when it comes to software companies like these LLMs is ARR.
[01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.380]   So everybody wants to know what's their revenue.
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:37.380]   ARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:43.740]   And recurring revenue, like a monopoly cable subscription, gets a really high multiple.
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:45.540]   That's why softwares have gotten high multiples.
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:47.860]   They're very predictable.
[01:19:47.860 --> 01:19:55.380]   But when we look at what's going on in AI, I've banned the use of the term ARR within
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:20:01.140]   Altimeter when we talk about AI revenues, because they're certainly not recurring like
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.140]   a monopoly.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:03.140]   They're consumption-based.
[01:20:03.140 --> 01:20:04.820]   And they have some amount of cogs tied to them.
[01:20:04.820 --> 01:20:05.820]   Right.
[01:20:05.820 --> 01:20:12.780]   So we call them ERR, Experimental Run Rate Revenues, right?
[01:20:12.780 --> 01:20:19.500]   And so when I look at these, you know, one of the things that inflection and these other
[01:20:19.500 --> 01:20:24.440]   models that it's been very challenging for us to get our arms around backing, even though
[01:20:24.440 --> 01:20:29.740]   they have extraordinary founders and are building extraordinary things, is just if you have
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:34.640]   to pay a high price, then you need to have confidence in the durability of those revenues
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:37.420]   and profits on a go-forward basis.
[01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:38.900]   And I think you have some thoughts on this.
[01:20:38.900 --> 01:20:44.460]   Yeah, look, there's nothing that I've spent more time on recently, just trying to learn
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:48.780]   and ask questions, but, you know, both trying to understand how these things work, but also
[01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:50.460]   how they're being used.
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:55.340]   And one thing you constantly hear from developers on LLM, and let's separate this maybe from
[01:20:55.340 --> 01:20:59.740]   the consumer game that I guess—and then there were two or three, right?
[01:20:59.740 --> 01:21:00.740]   You got Microsoft.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:04.220]   I guess you got Google perplexing OpenAI, $20 a month.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:05.500]   That's a whole separate conversation.
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:11.700]   But on this B2B side, the model that just seems so prevalent with all the companies
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:18.980]   I talk to, you might test your thesis against one of the premier models, but then the minute
[01:21:18.980 --> 01:21:25.160]   you go to run it, you then run it on four or five others and see which one—at different
[01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:28.740]   price points and see which one is cost-effective for you.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:34.980]   And the promiscuity is unbelievably high.
[01:21:34.980 --> 01:21:38.180]   Another way of saying that, one of the things that leads to high valuation multiples is
[01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:39.540]   switching costs.
[01:21:39.540 --> 01:21:45.240]   And today, you know, as it stands, I would say if you were to rate these LLMs on their
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:51.620]   switching costs with zero maybe being none and 100 being perfect, I'd say they're at
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:52.620]   two.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:54.780]   Like, it's remarkably low.
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.540]   And there's another huge irony.
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:22:00.260]   Some people believe—and I won't try and make this argument, I'll just say I know
[01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:05.860]   some smart people have said it—that as the context window gets bigger, there'll be less
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:12.340]   training and even less fine-tuning, which means you're just dumping data into the prompt.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:15.580]   And this data is not being dumped in in a structured way.
[01:22:15.580 --> 01:22:19.260]   It's just PDFs or CSV files or whatever.
[01:22:19.260 --> 01:22:20.260]   There is no lock-in.
[01:22:20.260 --> 01:22:22.420]   You just dump it in the next one.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:27.180]   So I think one thing that's imperative in any of these LLM models, if they want to be
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:31.020]   successful in the long run in terms of creating equity value, they've got to find a way
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:32.780]   to get to switching costs.
[01:22:32.780 --> 01:22:35.740]   And I don't know what that is exactly right now.
[01:22:35.740 --> 01:22:40.600]   I think some element of fine-tuning or embedding data or memory like we've talked about.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:42.380]   But I don't think they have them today.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.580]   And maybe this is a sign of that.
[01:22:44.580 --> 01:22:45.580]   I don't know.
[01:22:45.580 --> 01:22:46.580]   It'll be interesting to watch.
[01:22:46.580 --> 01:22:52.900]   Well, I think along those lines, I had dinner this week with one of the heads of data and
[01:22:52.900 --> 01:22:56.460]   AI at one of the largest banks in the United States.
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.980]   And they did what I think a lot of other people did after they saw ChatGPT.
[01:23:00.980 --> 01:23:05.100]   So remember, ChatGPT comes out in Q4 of '22.
[01:23:05.100 --> 01:23:08.940]   The CEOs of all these banks and every other enterprise went home, and that's what the
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:11.180]   conversation was around the holiday table.
[01:23:11.180 --> 01:23:15.480]   So the CEOs or the board came back in Q1 and they said, "Hey, what are we doing in AI?"
[01:23:15.480 --> 01:23:18.380]   And they turned to their tech team and they said, "Let's get something done."
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:27.380]   So in Q2 of 2023, you saw all of these new customers sign up the Azure OpenAI API, right?
[01:23:27.380 --> 01:23:31.760]   Or do it directly with OpenAI because it was the only game in town.
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:39.980]   But quickly, all of the other data platforms, whether you were AWS, whether you're Google,
[01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:45.060]   Snowflake, Databricks, et cetera, they all spun up their own AI capabilities.
[01:23:45.060 --> 01:23:48.840]   Now they all embed free models, whether it's Lama, Mistral, et cetera.
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:51.940]   Even Microsoft now has competitive open models.
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:59.540]   And my hunch is that OpenAI will also be found on some of these data platforms, not just
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:02.100]   on Microsoft.
[01:24:02.100 --> 01:24:06.060]   And so it seems to me the switching cost is not with the LLM.
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.620]   I agree with you on this.
[01:24:07.620 --> 01:24:11.960]   The switching cost is really around where your data resides, right?
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:14.480]   We've heard this talked about, data gravity.
[01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:21.440]   So this particular bank, which had spun up the OpenAI API in Q2, has been playing with
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.640]   it on a big rag over the course of the last year.
[01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:27.160]   But I asked them what their plans were going forward.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.820]   They said, "Oh, we're moving.
[01:24:28.820 --> 01:24:36.360]   We're going to run all of our AI in AWS, right, on open models, on our production data," right?
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:41.480]   So it seems to me that the AI is finding its way back to the data.
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:46.460]   And the only way, I think, for Azure or anybody else to keep this experimental revenue when
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:52.400]   people run to use these models is you have to deliver something sufficiently differentiated
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.700]   that it gets somebody to pull all of their data to you.
[01:24:55.700 --> 01:24:58.000]   And that's a hard road to hoe.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.460]   And I'm reminded – I don't know if I've used this metaphor before, but there was a
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:07.140]   time before digital music where you just couldn't – there was so much music in the world,
[01:25:07.140 --> 01:25:08.140]   you couldn't imagine it.
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:12.680]   And I remember one day back in the Napster days where someone tapped me on the shoulder
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:13.680]   and he said, "Do you see this?"
[01:25:13.680 --> 01:25:18.060]   And he was holding a hard drive and he said, "This is all the music I've ever recorded,"
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:19.780]   and like he just had it.
[01:25:19.780 --> 01:25:25.300]   And to a certain extent, you know, the LLM, it may be – and I've heard this argument
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:30.860]   from some academics – it may be that most of the data, think Wikipedia, everything we
[01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.580]   know is already in there.
[01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:36.940]   And like it's gotten in, you know, small very quickly.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:42.180]   And what – the reason I bring that up relative to what you said is it may be that the open
[01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:49.500]   source LLMs are good enough and that putting them proximate to your data is a smarter play
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:54.780]   than trying to put your data proximate to the leading proprietary LLM.
[01:25:54.780 --> 01:25:59.060]   And if that plays out, that'll be super interesting.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:05.820]   And one thing's for sure, the open source LLM horse is out of the barn, right?
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:07.180]   It's running wild and free.
[01:26:07.180 --> 01:26:11.060]   I mean, and you've got to love the competition.
[01:26:11.060 --> 01:26:16.900]   And you know, again, it's a – you and I have talked about some of the concerns about
[01:26:16.900 --> 01:26:22.460]   regulatory capture as, you know, in preventing this competition.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:26.880]   You know, going back to the conversation about China, it's so important that we protect
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:31.460]   this competition among these models because it's driving down the cost to all enterprises.
[01:26:31.460 --> 01:26:36.020]   It's driving down the cost to all inference, to consumers.
[01:26:36.020 --> 01:26:39.140]   And you know, all I know is it's going to be an exciting few months ahead.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:40.140]   Always.
