[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Why are lumberjacks happier than lawyers?
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.580]   I think by unpacking this,
[00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.880]   we're gonna get some interesting insight
[00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.560]   into how to get more depth and meaning
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.540]   out of almost any type of job.
[00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:23.580]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.740]   the show about working and living deeply
[00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.320]   in a increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.680]   I'm here in my Deep Work HQ.
[00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.100]   I'm joined by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.700]   So Jesse, this weekend,
[00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.980]   I was reading my physical copy of the Washington Post
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.300]   because as I often emphasize on this show,
[00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.240]   in my leisure life, I strive to be as much as possible
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:52.360]   like a depression-era farmer.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.000]   I read newspapers and listen to the radio,
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.880]   and I sit on the porch with a rocking chair
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.960]   holding a pitchfork.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.960]   Maybe not the pitchfork part,
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.620]   but I aspire to be in my leisure life
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.040]   like a depression-era farmer.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.680]   Anyway, so I'm reading the physical newspaper,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.840]   and I come across an interesting article
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.860]   in the business section of the Washington Post.
[00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.020]   This is from Sunday.
[00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.020]   The title is "The Happiest, Least Stressful Jobs on Earth."
[00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.380]   So it looks like here there is new data,
[00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.160]   new data on how people feel
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.080]   about how happy their job makes them,
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.480]   as well as how stressful their life makes them.
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.560]   And I'm looking at this here.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.240]   This is a Bureau of Labor Statistics.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.360]   They were adding these new questions
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.940]   to their standard American Time News survey.
[00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.040]   So they kind of wanted to understand
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.640]   what jobs make us happy, what jobs make us unhappy,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.800]   what jobs stress us out, what jobs don't stress us out.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.240]   I was a little surprised, actually, by the top choice,
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.560]   so what was the happiest, least stressful job
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.580]   from the survey.
[00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.900]   I was less surprised by the bottom,
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.100]   what was the least happy, most stressful job.
[00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.780]   Let me quiz you, Jesse.
[00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.300]   What do you think the happiest, least stressful job
[00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.340]   in America is according to this survey?
[00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.460]   - Probably some volunteer job
[00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.180]   with somebody that's retired, you know?
[00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.780]   - I thought you were gonna say podcast producer.
[00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.020]   (Jesse laughs)
[00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.100]   And the fact that you didn't say podcast producer
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.740]   tells me everything I need to know.
[00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.260]   You're outta here.
[00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.460]   All right, good guess.
[00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.740]   And what about least happy, most stressful job?
[00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.020]   What would you guess?
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.140]   - Most stressful job, I think,
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.140]   is air traffic controllers, aren't they?
[00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.740]   - Okay, and then you think that's also the least happy?
[00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.820]   - Least happy, lawyers.
[00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:45.380]   - So you are 100% correct about least happy.
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.380]   Least happy, most stressful does turn out to be lawyers.
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.340]   The surprising question, the surprising response
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.680]   was happiest, least stressful, lumberjacks.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.520]   - Really?
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.540]   - Lumberjacks.
[00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.540]   Followed closely by various other agricultural jobs,
[00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.780]   so farmers, and then also foresters.
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:06.620]   - Yeah, I guess that's that.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:07.860]   - So if you're like a forestry agent
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:08.740]   or something like that.
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:11.740]   So I thought this was a good, deep question
[00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.820]   for us to dive into in today's episode,
[00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.820]   which is why are lumberjacks happier than lawyers?
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:22.900]   I think by unpacking this,
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.180]   we're gonna get some interesting insight
[00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:25.860]   into how to get more depth and meaning
[00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.220]   out of almost any type of job.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.940]   All right, so let's actually jump into this article
[00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:30.780]   to get an answer.
[00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.300]   I have the physical copy here,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.580]   but we also loaded it up on the tablet.
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.480]   So if you're watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.860]   this is episode 232, you'll see this on your screen.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.820]   If you're just listening, I'll narrate it.
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:46.220]   So I have the article here.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.160]   I should give credit to the writer, of course.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.860]   This is Andrew Van Dam.
[00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:54.020]   This came out on January 6th, 2023 online,
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.020]   the physical paper much more recently.
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.740]   All right, so to start off in this article,
[00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.740]   we get what I was just talking about here.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:04.660]   We have an analysis based on thousands of time journals
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.900]   from the Bureau of Labor Statistics
[00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.180]   American Time Use Survey.
[00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.100]   And they found, the researchers quoted in this article
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.360]   found agriculture, logging and forestry
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:20.180]   have the highest levels of self-reported happiness
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.140]   and the lowest levels of self-reported stress.
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.140]   This is over all major industry categories they looked at.
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.620]   Here's the actual questions they added.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.020]   So in four recent surveys,
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.460]   they added to the Time Use Survey,
[00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:39.420]   instead of just asking what activities are you doing,
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.920]   they were asking people how meaningful their activities were
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.580]   and how happy, sad, stressed, pained and tired
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.300]   they felt on a six point scale.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.360]   So these were the questions they used to get this data.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.560]   All right, some other things I wanna point out
[00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:51.460]   from this article,
[00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:55.160]   healthcare workers and social workers
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.120]   rate themselves as doing meaningful work.
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.480]   In fact, they're at the top
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.440]   of the meaningful work ranking scale,
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.520]   by far the most likely to say they're doing meaningful work,
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.520]   but they rank low on happiness.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.480]   They also rank high on stress.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.500]   If we look at stress in general,
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.800]   the most stressful sectors were finance and insurance.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.820]   The single most stressful occupation, lawyers.
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:20.940]   So interesting.
[00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.220]   Even jobs that felt very meaningful
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.960]   could be low happiness and high stress.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.540]   Jobs like lumberjacks weren't particularly
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.000]   highly ranked on meaning scales,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.260]   but they were happier and they were less stressed.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.420]   Now this is a bit of a puzzle.
[00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:40.960]   I mean, let's give this a name
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.980]   because I like to give things names.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:44.820]   We can call this the lumberjack paradox.
[00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:45.940]   Why is this the case?
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.740]   And the reason why this is a bit of a paradox
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:48.820]   is if we think about it,
[00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:52.060]   I mean, lumberjack jobs and farmers and forestry,
[00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.940]   but we'll focus just on lumberjacks here.
[00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:55.900]   It's not particularly meaningful in the sense
[00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:59.100]   that what I'm doing is connected to a bigger cause
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.220]   that I feel is really important.
[00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.620]   That's rarely the case.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.500]   It's also physically perilous.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.780]   I have this on the screen here.
[00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.960]   They point this out.
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.380]   This job, especially lumberjacks is particularly perilous.
[00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.060]   They report the self-report,
[00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.380]   the highest levels of pain on the job, right?
[00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:16.620]   So it's a physically demanding job.
[00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:18.940]   You're more likely to get hurt on the job.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:22.380]   The actual activity from moment to moment is,
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.620]   often let's say not rote,
[00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.460]   but very, very physical and demanding,
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:31.160]   yet they're happy, yet they're less stressed.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.020]   So what is the answer?
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.820]   Well, when it comes to this particular survey
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.580]   and that particular observation
[00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.500]   of lumberjacks and related jobs
[00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.380]   being happier than white-collar jobs,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:45.860]   the answer they honed in on for this particular example
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.940]   is just what Jesse pointed out.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.000]   They take place outside.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.700]   So when they were doing this time-use survey,
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:56.300]   they found that being in the great outdoors
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:59.140]   ranks in the top three for both happiness and meaning
[00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:03.300]   among locations in which measured activities occurred.
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.140]   Only places of worship consistently rated higher
[00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:06.980]   on those meanings.
[00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:08.100]   So they said, look, our data shows
[00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.940]   that whether you're working or not,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.460]   when you're outside, you're more likely to be happy.
[00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.020]   You're more likely to be less stressed.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.820]   Lumberjacks, farmers, foresters, they're outside a lot.
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.380]   And so they're reaping that benefit throughout the day.
[00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.620]   If you're a lawyer, by contrast, you're not outside.
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.860]   So you don't reap that benefit.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.520]   And you have high stress because of the nature of your job.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.380]   So this leads us to a broader answer
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:33.620]   to the lumberjack paradox.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:34.860]   And this is the thing that,
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:38.120]   the idea that we're gonna explore throughout today's episode,
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.460]   which is the idea that the characteristics of your workday
[00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:46.460]   matter as much as the content of your work.
[00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:50.320]   Especially in American thinking,
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.180]   we tend to focus a lot on the latter.
[00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.380]   What specifically do I do for a job?
[00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.820]   We assume that this is where we're gonna find meaning,
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.100]   it's where we're gonna find happiness,
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:02.580]   and it's gonna be the main thing controlling our stress.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:03.740]   Am I a doctor?
[00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:04.940]   Am I a lumberjack?
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:07.140]   Am I a podcast producer?
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.380]   Or am I a drug dealer?
[00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:12.980]   Similar professions in terms of their drain on society.
[00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.820]   Isn't that right, Jesse?
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.660]   - Yeah. - No, thank you.
[00:08:15.660 --> 00:08:16.980]   I'm just joking, I'm just mad.
[00:08:16.980 --> 00:08:18.940]   I'm still just mad you didn't say podcast producers
[00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.820]   the happiest job on earth.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.940]   So we care a lot in American culture about what is my job.
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.060]   The reality that I think is being emphasized
[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.320]   by the study summarized in the Washington Post article
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.740]   is that the characteristics of your workday,
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.220]   independent of the specific content of your job,
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:38.900]   the characteristics of your workday
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:41.120]   can matter just as much.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:44.380]   Those lumberjacks are happy not because on paper
[00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.520]   there's something abstractly really exciting
[00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.860]   or meaningful about being a lumberjack,
[00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:50.180]   but because of the characteristics of the workday.
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.900]   They're outside, they're fresh air,
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.080]   and other things going on,
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:55.980]   I'm gonna summarize here in a second,
[00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.980]   but the characteristics can play a huge role.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:01.580]   So what I wanted to do here was list,
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.540]   I wrote down four different characteristics of a workday
[00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.260]   that are relatively independent of the content of your job
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.580]   that seem to have a big impact
[00:09:12.580 --> 00:09:15.380]   on how happy you are in your job.
[00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:17.020]   All right, so I wanna go through these four
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:18.060]   because what I wanna do, of course,
[00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.140]   is generalize our toolkit here
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.820]   beyond just telling people quit your lawyer job
[00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.740]   and become a lumberjack.
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:25.520]   Let's have a more nuanced approach on this.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:29.260]   So I'm gonna enumerate four characteristics of workdays
[00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:31.500]   that really has an impact on your subjective experience
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.340]   of work.
[00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:37.100]   Number one, the setting of your work, right?
[00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:39.700]   This is what we got with the lumberjack data.
[00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.820]   Being outside, for example,
[00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.140]   tends to make human beings happier and less stressed.
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.540]   Things like stressful commutes, busy offices,
[00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:48.520]   having an ugly home office,
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:51.540]   it's in your laundry room and it's loud and it's cluttered.
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:53.940]   All of this can matter for how you,
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:09:55.700]   your subjective experience of your workday.
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.080]   So where it is you do your work,
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.880]   what it takes to actually get there.
[00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:03.100]   Number two, the stress generated by your work.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:05.780]   I say this is a characteristic of your workday as well,
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.980]   is how much stress you encounter
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:11.620]   independent of the specific source of this stress.
[00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:15.260]   This also shows up in the data summarized in that article.
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:16.660]   Lawyers and healthcare workers,
[00:10:16.660 --> 00:10:18.060]   one of the reasons why they're not happy
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.460]   is that their jobs have many moments of stress
[00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:24.180]   and humans don't like to be constantly exposed to stress.
[00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.820]   So if your job has these constant rate of moments
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.120]   of your cortisol going up, that heart rate getting going,
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.660]   that feeling of anxiety growing,
[00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.320]   if that's happening all the time,
[00:10:35.320 --> 00:10:38.900]   you are likely to be less happy about that job.
[00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:41.860]   Again, independent of the specifics
[00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:43.700]   of the content of your work.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.720]   I would say the major source of stress is overload,
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.860]   especially in white collar work.
[00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.940]   So this would be your job has too many things coming at you,
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:53.080]   too many things on your plate
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.540]   for you to be able to really juggle.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:57.140]   So you're constantly context shifting, which is painful,
[00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.980]   constantly falling behind on things
[00:10:58.980 --> 00:10:59.980]   that you think need to be done,
[00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:02.100]   not even sure about everything that's on your plate.
[00:11:02.100 --> 00:11:06.820]   That is probably the most common source of acute stress
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:09.480]   in white collar jobs, this type of thing matters.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.100]   The third characteristic of your workday
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:13.940]   that we're gonna talk about
[00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.740]   is the clarity or simplicity of your work.
[00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:19.500]   Humans are upset when we have lots of ambiguous tasks
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.660]   and obligation to deal with
[00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.380]   and it's unclear how to deal with them,
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:25.020]   it's unclear what to do next.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:28.220]   Let me just tell you a specific example from my life
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.220]   that I think highlights this.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:32.100]   It's a trivial thing,
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:35.400]   a logistical and active logistical organization
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.700]   I needed to do with my teaching assistants.
[00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:40.920]   And there was a little bit of ambiguity about how to do it.
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:43.420]   I wasn't quite sure if I had the right information
[00:11:43.420 --> 00:11:46.900]   or it's complicated in the details,
[00:11:46.900 --> 00:11:47.940]   but it's trivial is the main thing
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.860]   I'm trying to emphasize here.
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:51.700]   It was, I don't really know how to take the next step
[00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:53.980]   towards organizing, it was office hours or something like that
[00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:55.180]   because I'm missing some information
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.080]   or something was unclear.
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.940]   That was a huge source of stress for me.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:01.260]   I didn't wanna do it, it was hanging over me,
[00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.940]   something that is on paper, a very simple,
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:05.620]   let me just think this through and send some messages,
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:08.220]   but it was ambiguous what to do next, source of stress.
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:10.820]   So the more of that type of work you have on the plate,
[00:12:10.820 --> 00:12:13.300]   the more stressed you're gonna be.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.780]   If you're constantly context shifting,
[00:12:14.780 --> 00:12:17.540]   constantly trying to figure out how to put out fires,
[00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.140]   whose entire scope you don't quite understand,
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:22.700]   it's gonna hurt your subjective experience of work.
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:26.580]   Remember, this makes me think of the movie "Office Space".
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:28.880]   You know "Office Space", Jesse, the Mike Judge movie?
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:29.720]   - Yeah.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.400]   - Do you remember the ending of that movie?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:33.240]   - No.
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:34.980]   - So for those who don't know, "Office Space",
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:38.580]   the Mike Judge movie, I think this was like 1999 or 2000.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:42.980]   And the main character had this job
[00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:46.100]   at a generic office park, office building,
[00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.420]   doing something vaguely involving software development.
[00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.900]   He filled out TPS reports, et cetera, right?
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:53.220]   So it was a send up, right?
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:57.660]   A send up of the inanity of modern knowledge work.
[00:12:57.660 --> 00:12:59.660]   And I won't spoil the whole plot,
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:03.140]   but where he ends up in the end, he's very happy,
[00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:07.540]   is a construction crew where he's just shoveling debris.
[00:13:07.540 --> 00:13:09.980]   Now it's actually the building, I will spoil it,
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.020]   it is the building of his company
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.820]   because it got burnt down to the ground.
[00:13:14.820 --> 00:13:16.540]   So, but the reason why he's happy
[00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:17.900]   is not because his company burnt down
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:19.820]   because of the simplicity.
[00:13:19.820 --> 00:13:22.580]   He's like, he shows up, I'm moving this stuff into here,
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.020]   this is what you want me to do.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.600]   And he had this sort of great piece about it.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:28.420]   So that's a sending up a true point,
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.460]   which is clarity and simplicity about what you wanna do.
[00:13:31.460 --> 00:13:33.660]   The Lumberjacks have this, of course.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.540]   The job is clear, we're cutting these trees,
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:38.540]   we're moving these logs, here's what has to happen.
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.140]   The final characteristic of a workday that really matters
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:44.620]   for your subjective experience is control over your work.
[00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:46.260]   So this is about having autonomy
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.820]   about your hard and easy periods.
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.780]   Not that your job is always easy, but you can control it.
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.100]   All right, we're gonna have a busy period here
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:53.300]   that I can pull back here.
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.180]   I have the reins of my own career.
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:58.540]   I can slow it down, I can speed it up.
[00:13:58.540 --> 00:14:00.900]   I'm not always being evaluated by a boss.
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:02.900]   I don't always feel like I'm in a performative state
[00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.780]   of trying to act like I'm busy.
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.820]   That sort of autonomy over how you actually
[00:14:07.820 --> 00:14:09.960]   apply your efforts, that's natural.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.780]   When we don't have that, that can also be something
[00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:17.180]   that pulls down our happiness, pushes up our stress.
[00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.260]   All right, so we have four characteristics here.
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:21.140]   The setting, the stress, the clarity,
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:23.300]   and the control of your work.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:27.160]   All of this, again, is agnostic to the content of your job.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:30.300]   These are characteristics that are more general than that
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.020]   and really matter whether or not you're happy
[00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:35.240]   or not really matter about how stressed
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.300]   your job actually makes you.
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.480]   So the practical implication here is that
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:40.980]   when we're thinking about the deep life,
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:43.160]   and in particular, the craft bucket of the deep life,
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:47.280]   how does our work fit into our vision of the deep life,
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:50.020]   we should care as much about the characteristics
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:51.740]   of these jobs as we do the specifics
[00:14:51.740 --> 00:14:54.920]   of what the jobs actually are.
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.680]   We should engineer for the characteristics of our work,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:01.320]   just like we might engineer to get in better shape,
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:03.460]   or just like we might engineer to live in a place
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.980]   that has more activities that make us happy.
[00:15:06.980 --> 00:15:10.520]   We should care and engineer for those characteristics.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:11.660]   So what I wanna do is go through
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.000]   those four characteristics again,
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.540]   and for each, give you a concrete example
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:20.440]   of someone who has engineered their career
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.800]   to emphasize or push that characteristic
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:25.080]   in a good direction, just so we get a sense
[00:15:25.080 --> 00:15:27.520]   of what this type of lifestyle engineering
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.560]   actually looks like.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:32.240]   All right, so let's go back to the setting of the work.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.960]   I mentioned the setting of the work can really matter.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.600]   So I wanna give an, oops, it's the wrong browser.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.680]   I'm gonna give an example here.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.880]   Again, if you're watching at youtube.com/calnewportmedia,
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:41.920]   you'll see this on the screen.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.220]   Otherwise I'll narrate it.
[00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:44.980]   I wanna give an example here.
[00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:49.000]   This is Nate, I guess I'll call him Nate Frugalwoods.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.220]   It's not really his name.
[00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:51.680]   I don't think his name is private,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.640]   but he has a blog, him and his wife, Liz,
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.640]   who I know and who I interviewed
[00:15:56.640 --> 00:15:58.980]   and wrote about in Digital Minimalism.
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.680]   They have a blog called the Frugalwoods.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.560]   They refer to themselves as the Frugalwoods.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.560]   And so I have a picture of Nate and his two daughters
[00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:08.200]   up on the screen now from their website.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.440]   But what I really wanna show was his house.
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:11.840]   So here's what Liz and Nate did.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:15.320]   And I'm gonna focus on Nate's job in particular.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.440]   They were living in Central Square in Cambridge,
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.720]   Massachusetts, so near Harvard and MIT.
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:24.400]   It's actually closer to MIT.
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:26.360]   No, it's in between MIT and Harvard.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:29.200]   They lived there in a row house and they were stressed.
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.840]   He worked in computer programming,
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.540]   IT type stuff for a nonprofit.
[00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:35.760]   She worked in a different policy shop or a nonprofit.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.760]   And they decided they were going to leave the city.
[00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:39.840]   And they moved to the house
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.160]   that I'm showing you on the screen now.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   It's in Vermont, Central Vermont.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.840]   It's 66 acres on a mountaintop,
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:50.040]   beautiful house, showing it on the screen.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.980]   And most of it's forest.
[00:16:51.980 --> 00:16:53.940]   I have another picture to show you here.
[00:16:53.940 --> 00:16:56.520]   Here's, I'm showing very scenic pictures.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.800]   All right, here's what I wanna show.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:00.760]   Most of it's forest, but they have meadows with,
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.600]   they have farms on here, a barn,
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:05.800]   and then they have all these hiking trails
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:06.640]   that they maintain.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.520]   Very scenic, isolated up on this mountainside.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:14.120]   What's interesting about what Nate and Liz did
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   is that Nate kept his job as a computer programmer
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.780]   for this nonprofit because he was good
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.760]   and he had career capital.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:23.320]   And he said, "I wanna work remotely
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:24.800]   "before that was fashionable."
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:27.080]   This farm is isolated, but it has,
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:30.560]   due to rural internet, some rural internet programs,
[00:17:30.560 --> 00:17:33.360]   high-speed fiber for the internet.
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.520]   So he can work from this isolated farm.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.800]   So he worked from this isolated farm,
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:39.620]   still doing his normal job,
[00:17:39.620 --> 00:17:43.140]   but now interspersing this work on the computer screen
[00:17:43.140 --> 00:17:45.740]   with a growing list of outdoor activities
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:47.800]   that he found to be meaningful
[00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.600]   or stress-relieving or engaging.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.880]   And I've heard the whole list from him.
[00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:52.720]   I won't go through it all,
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:54.860]   but he chops a lot of firewood
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:57.480]   because they heat their house off a wood-burning stove.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:17:58.960]   They have this long driveway
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.680]   that's sort of the bane of their existence.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:02.800]   So he's constantly tending to the driveway,
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:04.940]   cutting logs that have fallen across it,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.880]   tending rivets or ruts.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880]   I mean, I don't know about this stuff,
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.720]   but you know what I mean.
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:12.200]   Driving skid steers and doing things with chainsaws.
[00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:13.360]   He grows food.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:15.100]   He manages the chickens.
[00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:18.840]   They started doing sugar mapling.
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.640]   He maintains the trails on the property.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.920]   So like all this outdoor work.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.480]   Whenever I would see a picture of Nate,
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:26.640]   he was almost always in Carhartt coveralls.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:28.400]   So whatever those suits are you wear,
[00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:30.520]   those Carhartt suits when you're living in New England
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.600]   and working outside.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.680]   And he just back and forth,
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:34.620]   working on that stuff, working, taking breaks,
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:37.600]   ending his work early, going out and doing that.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.540]   This is someone who engineered the setting
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:42.040]   in which their work happened in an extreme way.
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:43.040]   He's a happy guy.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:44.680]   He loves doing all that stuff.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.240]   When I see how much he loves doing all that stuff,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.020]   I feel bad for 10 year ago,
[00:18:50.020 --> 00:18:52.340]   Nate living in Central Square in a small row house,
[00:18:52.340 --> 00:18:53.280]   that version of him.
[00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:56.300]   He must've been way less happy than he realized.
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:18:58.300]   All right, example number two.
[00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:03.140]   Let's talk about controlling stress in your job.
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.020]   I'm gonna point towards Paul Jarvis here.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.240]   So those who are watching the YouTube channel will see,
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.940]   I've loaded an article from Bench
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:15.280]   called "Entrepreneur on the Island,
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:17.600]   a Conversation with Paul Jarvis."
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.840]   There's a picture of Paul here.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.680]   It's probably a theme you're probably seeing here, Jesse.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.260]   He's in the woods, walking a path in a field on his property
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:28.100]   towards a greenhouse that him and his wife
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.640]   use to grow vegetables.
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:32.620]   I like the outdoor rural settings.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:35.420]   Here's what, you may recognize the name Paul
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.560]   'cause I've talked about him before on the show.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:39.080]   He wrote a book that I blurbed
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.840]   that was called "A Company of One,"
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:42.940]   where he made the argument
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.540]   that you shouldn't grow your small business
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:46.380]   as you get better.
[00:19:46.380 --> 00:19:49.600]   Instead, use that career capital you're growing
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.920]   to make your business have a smaller footprint on your life.
[00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.420]   So if you get really good at what you do,
[00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:56.380]   instead of saying, "Great, I can triple my business
[00:19:56.380 --> 00:19:57.700]   and hire five people,"
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:19:59.660]   you say, "Great, I can work half the hours
[00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:00.780]   and make the same money."
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:02.140]   So it was a really cool book.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:03.420]   I thought it was a really good idea.
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.480]   Well, anyways, he has done this in his own life.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:08.660]   So he was a web developer and he was good at it.
[00:20:08.660 --> 00:20:10.700]   But dealing with clients for Paul,
[00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:14.220]   like a lot of people, is a stress vector.
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.960]   There's demands that you have to answer.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:18.820]   There's personalities that sometimes clash with your own,
[00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.700]   and there's an unpredictability about it.
[00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.460]   And if you're like Paul or someone like me,
[00:20:22.460 --> 00:20:24.620]   that unpredictability stresses you out.
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:27.140]   That was a big source of stress.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.260]   So he shifted from client work to now he does more,
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:35.060]   I would call it like esoteric one-off projects.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:37.820]   He'll build a software tool, he'll write a book,
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:40.460]   he has a newsletter, he'll build a different software tool.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.460]   And then that tool, eventually,
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.740]   he'll move on and do something else.
[00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:46.580]   So it's things that he completely controls the schedule for.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.180]   Now it's not highly lucrative work,
[00:20:48.180 --> 00:20:51.460]   but that's fine because him and his wife moved
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:54.740]   to this rural plot of land on Victoria Island
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:20:56.300]   off of Vancouver,
[00:20:56.300 --> 00:20:58.540]   that again has good enough internet for him to do his work,
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:21:00.060]   but they live cheap.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.420]   It's near a surf break, she likes to surf.
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:05.940]   He has a greenhouse, they tend their land,
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.880]   and he works on projects on his own schedule.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.700]   So this is someone who, again, engineered
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:12.940]   the characteristics of their workday
[00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:16.860]   away from what they identified as specific sources of stress.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.540]   Let's look now at the third characteristic
[00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:25.540]   we mentioned before, the clarity or simplicity of your work.
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:28.260]   So I'm pulling up here a blog post I wrote
[00:21:28.260 --> 00:21:30.980]   about John Grisham, the author John Grisham.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.140]   We've talked about him recently before on the show,
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:35.500]   but I think he's a great example of this.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:40.500]   He has a very simplified approach to life as an author.
[00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:45.700]   He doesn't have 15 different irons in the fire.
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.860]   He's not trying to develop television shows
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.460]   and write movie scripts and direct and have products
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.800]   and build a James Patterson style partnership deal
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:55.600]   with his publisher where he has seven authors
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.500]   working under him.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.180]   And they publish 10 books a year
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.540]   that are all John Grisham Presents.
[00:21:59.540 --> 00:22:01.220]   He doesn't wanna do any of that.
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:03.660]   He wants to write one book a year
[00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:05.620]   that makes him more than enough money,
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:06.580]   and then he wants to go on
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.660]   and do other things with his life.
[00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:12.660]   So in this article on my blog, which is from May of 2017,
[00:22:12.660 --> 00:22:15.980]   I summarize some things I learned deep diving
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:17.540]   on Grisham's routines.
[00:22:17.540 --> 00:22:20.220]   And I'll just point out a couple things here.
[00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:21.980]   Grisham primarily writes his novels
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.620]   during the winter months on his farm.
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:26.380]   During this period, he works five days a week,
[00:22:26.380 --> 00:22:29.860]   starting at seven and typically ending by 10.
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:34.860]   So you do that math, that is a 15 hour a week work week.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:37.500]   He writes in a period outbuilding on his property
[00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:39.700]   that used to house an antebellum summer kitchen.
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:41.140]   He and his wife refurbished the kitchen
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:43.820]   to maintain his period details,
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:46.260]   adding only electricity and air conditioning.
[00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:49.180]   Crucially, it has no internet.
[00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:50.620]   Grisham says, "I don't want the distraction.
[00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:53.020]   "I don't work online, I keep it offline."
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.900]   Grisham maintains strict rituals for his writing.
[00:22:55.900 --> 00:22:58.940]   He starts work on a novel on the same day each year,
[00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.820]   starts writing each day at the same time.
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:02.140]   He works on the same computer.
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:05.180]   He drinks the same type of coffee from the same cup.
[00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.100]   He always starts a new novel on January 1st
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:08.980]   and is usually done by the end of March.
[00:23:08.980 --> 00:23:10.620]   Then he shifts over to editing.
[00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:12.340]   He aims to have the manuscript polished
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.340]   and submitted by July,
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:15.860]   which leaves him half the year to do other things.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.740]   So this is someone who engineered the characteristics
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:24.020]   of their workday towards simplicity.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:26.180]   And that was a conscious decision he made.
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:28.780]   Clearly he had a lot of other options.
[00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:31.900]   Final example is about having control
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:33.540]   over how your work unfolds.
[00:23:33.540 --> 00:23:36.660]   We saw a little bit of that with Paul Jarvis.
[00:23:36.660 --> 00:23:40.340]   Another example is friend of the show, Ginny Blake.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:42.580]   I've loaded up here on the page.
[00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:45.300]   So if you read her latest book, "Free Time,"
[00:23:45.300 --> 00:23:48.300]   and there's an interview I did with her on this show,
[00:23:48.300 --> 00:23:49.980]   God, it must've been a year or so ago, I don't know.
[00:23:49.980 --> 00:23:51.260]   I lose track of time with this show,
[00:23:51.260 --> 00:23:54.540]   but I have had Ginny on the show to talk about this.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.380]   In her book, "Free Time,"
[00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:58.420]   she talks about how she left her job at Google,
[00:23:58.420 --> 00:24:00.300]   started a company.
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.500]   The company got to be too demanding,
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.900]   a source of stress, a source of unease.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:10.220]   So she simplified it around sustainability.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.740]   What makes this company maximally sustainable?
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.660]   And I wrote down some things here.
[00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:21.060]   She works with what she calls a delightfully teeny team,
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:24.220]   which is not too many people.
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:26.540]   She doesn't want a huge amount of employees.
[00:24:26.540 --> 00:24:28.900]   She is very into processes now.
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.580]   She does not wanna be a bottleneck
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:32.220]   for any of the things their company does.
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:33.700]   So she focuses more, for example,
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.140]   on licensing her material,
[00:24:35.140 --> 00:24:38.060]   as opposed to doing individualized coaching
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.580]   of different clients.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:40.940]   She has a huge amount of control
[00:24:40.940 --> 00:24:42.260]   over her workload and schedule,
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:44.620]   which is, I think, best exemplified by the fact
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:47.580]   that she takes off two months each year to not work.
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:50.380]   She's built her schedule around that.
[00:24:50.380 --> 00:24:54.380]   Now, as she says, she could be making more money
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:56.940]   if she was, whatever, hammering the big keynotes
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.180]   or the one-on-one consulting,
[00:24:59.180 --> 00:25:00.660]   but her goal is not to make more money.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:03.060]   It's to make enough money with a job
[00:25:03.060 --> 00:25:04.420]   that's very sustainable and interesting.
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.620]   So again, she engineered the characteristics of her work.
[00:25:07.620 --> 00:25:08.780]   Here's the point I wanna make
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:10.580]   about all four of those examples.
[00:25:10.580 --> 00:25:14.420]   We don't know this if we just write down
[00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.100]   what is these people's jobs.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:18.940]   These type of details are not captured there.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:20.260]   If I say, what are these people's jobs?
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:22.420]   I would say Nate is a computer programmer.
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.940]   Paul Jarvis is a software developer.
[00:25:24.940 --> 00:25:26.100]   John Grisham is a writer.
[00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.820]   Jenny Blake runs a small business consulting company.
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:32.740]   There are so many different ways
[00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:35.340]   you could experience those four jobs I just mentioned.
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:36.940]   In the examples I gave,
[00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:39.140]   the characteristics of the workdays
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.740]   that these individuals experience
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.720]   were engineered radically to make that experience better.
[00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:47.260]   So the content of your job is not the sole determinant
[00:25:47.260 --> 00:25:48.320]   of how you experience it.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.940]   You can engineer these characteristics,
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.480]   and by doing so, really change how you experience your job.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.840]   All right, so we don't have to become lumberjacks,
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:57.420]   but we do have to care about
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:01.420]   whatever our equivalent is of working outside.
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.100]   How we work matters as much as what we work on.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:09.820]   So Jesse, that's my conclusion from that piece.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.060]   - I like it.
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:11.900]   Well summarized.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.800]   - Outdoor matters, but this other stuff matters too.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.840]   And I think we get stuck,
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.460]   young people get stuck on that in particular.
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:21.120]   They really get stuck on just what is my job,
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:23.100]   or what do I want my job to be,
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:26.660]   as opposed to how do I want it to actually feel.
[00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.240]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.700]   So what I wanna do is, as we now do,
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.800]   I have five questions and case studies I pulled
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.640]   that are all relevant to this general topic
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.840]   of engineering the characteristics of your workday.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:40.960]   So I wanna do five questions,
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.320]   and then at the end we'll switch gears
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.900]   and I'll talk about the books I read in December.
[00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:48.620]   First, however, I wanna mention a brand new sponsor
[00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:50.020]   of the Deep Questions podcast.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.920]   I'm excited about this one.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:55.080]   This is Huel, H-U-E-L.
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:58.240]   Huel Black Edition is the product
[00:26:58.240 --> 00:26:59.360]   I wanna talk about in particular.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:02.000]   It's a high protein, nutritionally complete meal
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.440]   in a convenient shake.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:05.920]   So this is a meal replacement shake.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.000]   It has everything your body needs in just two scoops,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.040]   including 27 essential vitamins,
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:12.640]   minerals, and 40 grams of protein.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.120]   This is why I was interested in having Huel,
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.440]   and in particular their Huel Black Edition product
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:21.580]   as a sponsor, is because, as I've mentioned
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:23.580]   multiple times on this show,
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.300]   the way I deal with food and nutrition
[00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:29.040]   is that during my work hours, my fixed work hours,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:31.840]   I want to automate eating.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.680]   I don't wanna think about it.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:37.640]   I don't want this to be a source of energy drain.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:39.000]   I don't want it to be a time sink.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.280]   Oh, I'm gonna go walk halfway across town
[00:27:42.280 --> 00:27:44.040]   to a restaurant or something like this.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:46.840]   I automate my eating so I don't have to think about it.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.280]   And as long as I'm automating it,
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:50.400]   then I might as well automate it towards something
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.760]   that's gonna be maximal energy and good for me.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:57.440]   So Huel works perfectly into that plan.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:00.060]   I think the, arguably, at least in my opinion,
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:01.120]   the most effective way to use it
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:03.360]   is just for a breakfast replacement.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.820]   One scoop, you get your 200 calories.
[00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:07.480]   Two scoops, you get 400 calories,
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:09.560]   which is about a standard meal.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.280]   You have all of those vitamins you need.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.680]   You have all that protein you need.
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.600]   You get vitamin C, calcium, omega-3, iron, magnesium,
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.980]   the stuff you need, the energy you need,
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.760]   not all the sugar, not all the stuff
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.740]   that's gonna make you run down.
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:21.600]   And it takes a minute.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:24.560]   You just scoop in the shaker.
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:25.560]   You got it.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:26.380]   You take it.
[00:28:26.380 --> 00:28:27.960]   You move on with your day.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.540]   So my thought is if you're gonna enjoy eating,
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:32.480]   enjoy eating.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.280]   Wait when the workday is over.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:35.640]   You know, take your time.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.880]   Let that be a source of relaxation.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.640]   Let that be a ritualistic aspect.
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:42.300]   But when you're in the middle of getting after it,
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:44.560]   you're time blocking, you're working,
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:45.640]   automate your food.
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:48.200]   That's where something like Huel, I think,
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.760]   plays or could potentially play a really big role.
[00:28:51.760 --> 00:28:54.360]   It's also cost effective.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:57.920]   $2.50, it works out to about $2.50
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.680]   for each 400 calorie meal.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.440]   They give you that shaker I talked about
[00:29:01.440 --> 00:29:04.440]   for making the protein shake.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.160]   They'll give you one of those as well
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:11.920]   when you order at Huel.com/questions.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.700]   So that's Huel.com/questions.
[00:29:14.700 --> 00:29:16.280]   Go to that URL with the slash questions
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:19.760]   to get the free shaker when you order.
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.160]   When you're working, don't think about food.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:23.520]   Use something like Huel.
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:26.800]   When you're done working, then you can care about it.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.760]   All right, another sponsor I wanna mention.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:32.120]   This is a product that we use heavily here in my life
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:36.580]   and at my media company, and that is Notion.
[00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:41.720]   So Notion is one of these electronic note-taking companies
[00:29:41.720 --> 00:29:44.800]   that is not nearly a detailed enough explanation
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:46.320]   of everything that Notion does.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:47.820]   This is what you need to know.
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:49.360]   There's a lot of these companies
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.000]   that offer interesting products
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.240]   for building sort of roughly Zettelkasten-inspired
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:58.080]   note-taking database interfaces, et cetera.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.760]   Notion is the one I use most often.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.400]   It's the one that the people I know
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.320]   who are into this type of technology use most often.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.880]   Here's a couple of different ways we use it.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.480]   It's how we interact, ironically,
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:12.440]   given that I'm reading the ad.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.920]   It's how we interact with our ad agency.
[00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:19.380]   They built a custom Notion view where what happens is
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.040]   every ad we're supposed to do has its own entry
[00:30:22.040 --> 00:30:25.440]   in this underlying database, but using the magic of Notion,
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.440]   we can display it all sorts of different ways.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.240]   So there's a calendar view where we can just see
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:31.480]   what are the ads we're supposed to read today?
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:33.000]   There's a view by sponsor.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.080]   What are all the different ads that we have done
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:37.920]   for this particular sponsor?
[00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.760]   The click on one of these items,
[00:30:39.760 --> 00:30:41.400]   we see all the information about the ad.
[00:30:41.400 --> 00:30:42.900]   Here's the script.
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:44.400]   It's where we can go back in.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.920]   Jesse does this each week and says,
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.200]   "Here's the timestamp on where the ad showed up.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:50.520]   The sponsors have their own views to quickly pull out.
[00:30:50.520 --> 00:30:53.360]   Can I see all the reads of my ads among different shows?"
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:56.560]   All of this is very useful,
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.800]   simple to build in a tool like Notion.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:00.160]   Here's a completely different use.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.360]   So I recently talked with Jenny Blake
[00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:03.440]   and we actually recorded this.
[00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:07.020]   I haven't released it yet on the podcast, but we plan to.
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:09.200]   She walked me through how to build
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.920]   a idea database using Notion.
[00:31:11.920 --> 00:31:13.320]   Blew my mind.
[00:31:13.320 --> 00:31:15.280]   I was like, "I am absolutely going to do this."
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:17.480]   She was showing me step-by-step
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:19.720]   how she did it with her own idea database
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:21.040]   where you can have different ideas
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:22.560]   with different categories that link together
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.480]   that you view in different ways.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.220]   Flexible, powerful.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.440]   If you need to keep track of information,
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:31.960]   collaborate with other people on your teams or clients,
[00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.280]   you need a tool like Notion.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.620]   This is why I wanted them to be a sponsor of the show
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:38.900]   because I think they do it best.
[00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:41.120]   Now, here's the way they say it.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.720]   Whether you're starting a new gym routine,
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.000]   organizing a trip with friends,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.200]   or even planning your company goals,
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:48.160]   Notion is a flexible, collaborative workspace
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.600]   that helps you make meaningful progress
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:51.000]   in every part of your life.

[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:29.240]   All right, so now we're gonna do some questions.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:30.960]   Again, I'm trying to make the questions we pull
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:33.160]   be relevant to today's deep question.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.360]   Today's deep question is about
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.400]   engineering the characteristics of your work
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:40.640]   to make your work more happy and less stressful.
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:42.560]   All right, what's our first question, Jesse?
[00:32:42.560 --> 00:32:44.240]   - All right, first question is from Yosef,
[00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:46.200]   a 36-year-old programmer.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.360]   "I like my current job as an AI developer,
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:50.800]   "but I'm considering learning web development.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.720]   "My motivation is lifestyle design.
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:55.140]   "Data and AI are mostly related to large companies,
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:32:57.580]   "which means working as a full-time employee.
[00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.140]   "Web development is more flexible
[00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:01.640]   "and suitable for freelancing or consulting,
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:03.660]   "doing multiple small projects.
[00:33:03.660 --> 00:33:04.740]   "You could be your own boss,
[00:33:04.740 --> 00:33:06.320]   "leaving me time to follow my passions
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.200]   "like music and philosophy.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.580]   "What should I do?"
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:12.840]   - Standard question when thinking about
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:15.000]   happiness in your careers is,
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:16.720]   "Should I leave my current job
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:20.140]   "to go to another job that's more flexible?"
[00:33:20.140 --> 00:33:23.760]   There's a story I tell in my book,
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:26.740]   "So Good You Can't," what is it?
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.020]   "So Good I," why can't I remember my own book title, Jesse?
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:30.500]   "So Good You Can't Ignore You."
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.320]   - They can't.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.160]   - They can't ignore you.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:33.000]   - Yeah.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.500]   - So good they can't ignore you.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:37.060]   Let me remember my own books.
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.000]   I don't know if that's a good sign,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:39.860]   maybe it means I'm productive,
[00:33:39.860 --> 00:33:42.020]   or maybe it means I'm getting old.
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:45.060]   All right, so in "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:48.020]   in that book, I talk about this exact question,
[00:33:48.020 --> 00:33:52.100]   and I tell a story, and I believe the woman's name
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:56.540]   was Lisa, and she was, I'm trying to remember here,
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:58.620]   I think in marketing or something like this.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.100]   So she was in marketing, her particular position
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.220]   was somewhat stressful, and she's like,
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.700]   "I want more control over my time,
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.020]   "I want a more flexible, slower-paced job."
[00:34:09.020 --> 00:34:13.800]   And so she took a yoga instructor certification course,
[00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:16.960]   quit her marketing job to become a yoga instructor.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.580]   And the point I made in that book
[00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:22.780]   is that within whatever it was, six months,
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.380]   that had not worked nearly enough to replace her income,
[00:34:26.380 --> 00:34:29.700]   and she was actually on food stamps at that point.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:32.940]   And the argument I made is, you have to be careful
[00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:36.240]   just thinking about, what is this job gonna offer me?
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:38.020]   Oh, a yoga instructor, that's more flexible,
[00:34:38.020 --> 00:34:39.420]   that's less stressful, I don't have to do email.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.940]   That's fine, but what do you have to offer
[00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.500]   to the world of yoga instructing?
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:46.260]   And in this point, in this particular example,
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:48.320]   Lisa just had an online certification.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:49.580]   There's a lot of yoga instructors,
[00:34:49.580 --> 00:34:51.180]   it's a very competitive business.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.760]   She was not able to offer enough in that marketplace
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:55.740]   to actually build up the sort of demand
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:57.780]   that would allow her to have a stable income
[00:34:57.780 --> 00:35:01.460]   and actually live this much more flexible life.
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.580]   The answer I then concluded is,
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:07.340]   you have to care about career capital.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:12.020]   Career capital is my term for the rare and valuable skills
[00:35:12.020 --> 00:35:14.820]   that you possess, the things that are of actual value
[00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.780]   to the marketplace of jobs.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:20.820]   So if you have career capital, rare and valuable skills,
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:22.640]   that gives you leverage, you can use that leverage
[00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:25.380]   to try to get in your work things that you desire.
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:27.440]   So this, Joseph, is how I want you
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.660]   to think about more autonomy.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.960]   Having more autonomy while still being financially sound
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:37.040]   is very desirable.
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:39.480]   Lots of people want that in their work,
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.100]   so you should expect a need, a substantial amount
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.720]   of career capital to offer in return.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.980]   Just because you want your job to be more flexible
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:48.860]   doesn't mean you actually can get that in your life
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:50.980]   unless you have something to offer in return.
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:52.620]   So I want you to do this calculus
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:54.560]   in thinking through what you're doing with your career
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.580]   through the lens of career capital.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.840]   Right now, you're working on AI development,
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:00.640]   data science and AI development.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:02.240]   If you shifted to web development,
[00:36:02.240 --> 00:36:03.180]   you're starting from scratch.
[00:36:03.180 --> 00:36:05.140]   That's a very competitive marketplace.
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.860]   To make a good living as a web developer
[00:36:06.860 --> 00:36:09.380]   and enjoy flexibility, you have to be really good
[00:36:09.380 --> 00:36:10.500]   at what you do.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:11.780]   And even if you're really good at what you do,
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:12.880]   you might not get it.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.540]   Remember earlier in the program,
[00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:17.220]   I gave the example of Paul Jarvis,
[00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:18.700]   who was a very good web developer,
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.140]   but still eventually switched to living cheaply
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:23.660]   and doing one-off software projects
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:25.540]   because the stress of dealing with the clients
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:27.820]   was something he was just done with.
[00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.260]   But let's say you do get really good,
[00:36:29.260 --> 00:36:30.460]   you can pick and choose your clients,
[00:36:30.460 --> 00:36:32.840]   you do two at a time, they pay you really good money,
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:34.320]   you take a few months off,
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:35.740]   that's gonna require a lot of work.
[00:36:35.740 --> 00:36:36.640]   You're gonna have to be better
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.940]   than a lot of other web developers.
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:39.500]   So think through what would really be involved
[00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:40.720]   in getting that good.
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:42.500]   Don't delude yourself into thinking,
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.340]   hey, if I do a summer course online in web development,
[00:36:45.340 --> 00:36:47.460]   that'll be me by the fall.
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.460]   So think about this all through the context
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.340]   of career capital.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.700]   The flip side to that is in addition
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:55.860]   to just trying to evaluate
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.300]   how much skill would I really need
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:00.460]   for this other job to give me these traits I want,
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.260]   these characteristics I want,
[00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:05.300]   ask the question of, in my current job,
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:07.420]   with my current career capital,
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:08.980]   which for you has to do with your ability
[00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:10.840]   to do AI relevant programming,
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.580]   are there other ways I can apply this leverage?
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.740]   And they might be unusual,
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:16.880]   and they might be somewhat radical,
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.140]   but if I was to really take my skills
[00:37:19.140 --> 00:37:22.020]   in my current profession out for a spin,
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.660]   what is the full range of possible modifications
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:29.420]   or ways forward I might be able to imagine or ask for?
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:32.180]   That's often the more fruitful direction.
[00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:33.980]   I'm an in-demand AI programmer.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:35.460]   They really like me here.
[00:37:35.460 --> 00:37:37.220]   Hey, like Nate Frugalwoods,
[00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:38.940]   who we talked about in the first segment of the show,
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:40.580]   I'm moving up to the mountains in Vermont,
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:41.820]   but I've got good fiber,
[00:37:41.820 --> 00:37:43.740]   and I'm gonna work project-based,
[00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:44.980]   but I'm done at three every day
[00:37:44.980 --> 00:37:47.580]   because I have to chop wood.
[00:37:47.580 --> 00:37:50.540]   That's often where you're likely to find
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.500]   the tractable solutions
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:54.180]   because you already have the capital,
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.460]   the career capital developed.
[00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:56.820]   It doesn't mean you might not be able
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:58.460]   to develop new capital in another area.
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:00.780]   You just have to correctly assess
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:03.000]   how long of a path that's going to be.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.640]   So that would be my advice, Joseph,
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.040]   is in addition to thinking about what is really required
[00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:10.100]   to be a really autonomous web developer,
[00:38:10.100 --> 00:38:13.340]   ask, if I get even better at what I'm doing now,
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:15.260]   are there options I'm not thinking about?
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.220]   They might be non-standard.
[00:38:17.220 --> 00:38:20.500]   You might be the only person at your company doing that,
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:23.520]   but if you're good and they want you,
[00:38:23.520 --> 00:38:25.300]   you would be surprised by how many options
[00:38:25.300 --> 00:38:27.180]   you actually have for manipulating
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:29.180]   or modifying the characteristics of your workday
[00:38:29.180 --> 00:38:30.580]   to be things you enjoy more.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:36.340]   All right, so good, they can't ignore you.
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.180]   That makes sense.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:39.820]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:38:39.820 --> 00:38:41.380]   - All right, next question's from Nick,
[00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.180]   a 28-year-old personal trainer.
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.420]   Hi, Cal and Jessie, I have a question about my career
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.420]   as a strength and conditioning coach
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.340]   and my interest in creating a deep life.
[00:38:50.340 --> 00:38:51.940]   I love the training side of what I do,
[00:38:51.940 --> 00:38:54.580]   but I work long hours and my pay is stagnant,
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.280]   so I'm starting to resent my boss and the company.
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:00.900]   Unfortunately, there are no better gyms for me to go.
[00:39:00.900 --> 00:39:04.080]   I'm currently looking for adjunct teaching positions.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:05.600]   I have a master's degree,
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.940]   but I'm not sure about leaving fitness.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:10.220]   Many personal trainers build an online
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.420]   or contracting business,
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.940]   but these take months or years to build.
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.300]   Any advice you may have is appreciated.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:21.580]   - Well, Nick, I think your solution is I'm gonna hire you.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:23.820]   We're gonna work two hours a day
[00:39:23.820 --> 00:39:28.820]   into building the "Scarsguard" body from the "Viking" movie.
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.660]   And that's just what we're gonna do.
[00:39:30.660 --> 00:39:32.220]   It's just me and you,
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:34.220]   and I'm just gonna get unreasonably large.
[00:39:34.220 --> 00:39:37.780]   Actually, Jessie, yesterday, my sons and I were watching
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:41.220]   a series on Disney+ called "Limitless."
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:43.060]   I mentioned this to you maybe with Chris Hemsworth,
[00:39:43.060 --> 00:39:44.140]   the guy who plays Thor.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.060]   Yeah, and this particular episode,
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:48.460]   it kind of overlapped him starting
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:50.080]   to film the new Thor movie,
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:51.860]   so they kind of gave some insight
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:53.820]   into how he prepares for those movies.
[00:39:53.820 --> 00:39:54.660]   So let's give us some insight
[00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:56.380]   into what Nick and I will be doing together.
[00:39:56.380 --> 00:39:58.980]   It turns out, I mean, he stays in good shape
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:01.900]   because he's been doing these movies for a decade.
[00:40:01.900 --> 00:40:04.220]   He has to add, in the six-month period
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:07.540]   before one of these shoots, 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.180]   - Really? - 30 pounds of muscle,
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:13.860]   which means he has to eat, he eats like 10 meals a day.
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:15.220]   - Wow. - Yeah.
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.940]   And then the other thing we learned from that
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:21.940]   is when they're on set, if it's a shirtless scene,
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:25.300]   there is a long weightlifting session he has to do
[00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.320]   right before he goes on camera to get pumped.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:32.060]   So they're doing all of these curls and pull-ups
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:33.540]   and all this type of stuff right before they run
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:35.340]   and get on camera so that they have,
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:38.300]   he has the pumped muscles, I mean,
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.620]   I don't know how that works.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.940]   And then also they dehydrate themselves.
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:43.260]   - That's interesting. - So they're like bodybuilders.
[00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:45.980]   They're super dehydrated so that the veins will pop
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.940]   and then they pump up right before
[00:40:47.940 --> 00:40:50.020]   and then they have like 30 extra pounds of muscle
[00:40:50.020 --> 00:40:52.220]   that's almost impossible to maintain
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:40:54.820]   because of how much food they have to eat to keep it there.
[00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:58.340]   So anyways, Nick, you and I, that's what we're doing.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.180]   All that.
[00:40:59.180 --> 00:41:02.900]   Just me, I'll be like the liver king.
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.780]   Still doing the same podcast material.
[00:41:06.780 --> 00:41:10.620]   No shirt, four muscles, 20 minutes of pumping up
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.220]   right before every episode so they can get veiny.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:14.900]   I mean, I think this is what the audience
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:16.980]   is looking for, Jesse, when it comes to content
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:21.020]   about living deeply is veiny muscles.
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.700]   All right, Nick, let me give you my first reaction
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.260]   from your question is that my concern is that you're
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:30.100]   in your mind right now taking a,
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.860]   what is essentially a random walk
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.780]   through the career space.
[00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:37.380]   You're just bouncing off one idea to another.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:39.780]   I don't know, I guess I could be an adjunct professor
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:41.580]   or maybe I could just do like an online thing
[00:41:41.580 --> 00:41:44.220]   but that seems like really hard and I don't like my boss
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:46.180]   but there's no other gym so I can't do anything else.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:47.980]   You're just ping ponging.
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:50.900]   You're ping ponging off a different career ideas
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:54.020]   without any actual grounding in research
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.020]   or systematic thinking.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:57.860]   So what I wanna do is first of all, slow you down
[00:41:57.860 --> 00:42:01.500]   and say, okay, you're unhappy in your current situation.
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:03.020]   That I get.
[00:42:03.020 --> 00:42:05.660]   You don't like your boss and the way he's treating you.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:07.100]   That's an issue.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:08.380]   Yeah, my book's so good they can't ignore you.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.900]   I really talk about that as being one
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.860]   of the small number of things that really disqualifies
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:13.500]   a job regardless of all the other attributes.
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:15.700]   So we need to find you something different
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:18.020]   but we have to take our time here.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.780]   I don't want you to jump haphazardly
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:21.380]   from one thing to another.
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:24.340]   So number one, go through the lifestyle-centric
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:26.860]   career planning exercise we always talk about.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.020]   Really lock in your vision of what you want
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.740]   your ideal lifestyle to be like.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:33.380]   All aspects of your life, not just work.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:36.180]   Now we have a target that we're working backwards
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:38.900]   from when thinking through different career opportunities.
[00:42:38.900 --> 00:42:43.180]   Our goal now is not just, is this a thing I could do?
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:46.140]   Our goal is, is this on a path I can articulate
[00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:48.420]   that brings me closer to my ideal lifestyle?
[00:42:48.420 --> 00:42:50.940]   And that might lead you to very different options.
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.140]   Next, as you explore these different options,
[00:42:54.140 --> 00:42:56.860]   pretend you're a business journalist
[00:42:56.860 --> 00:42:59.100]   and you're writing an article on the reality
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:01.380]   of that industry, talk to people.
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:02.700]   What is the job really like?
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:03.980]   What's the pay like?
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:07.940]   How does it fit into their overall income streams?
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:09.940]   What's it like being an adjunct professor?
[00:43:09.940 --> 00:43:11.700]   What do these people do in addition?
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:13.260]   Are any of these people happy?
[00:43:13.260 --> 00:43:15.420]   Or do they have a lot of complaints about it?
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.460]   What's going on with people doing online coaching?
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:19.660]   Who's successful and who's not successful?
[00:43:19.660 --> 00:43:21.180]   Can you build a whole livelihood on it?
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.460]   Or is it just an adjunct?
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:24.980]   All right, you say there's no gyms nearby.
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:27.500]   Where are there gyms you would like to work?
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:29.460]   Maybe they're in different parts of the country,
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.220]   but that's actually a part of the country
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.540]   that might satisfy some of the other things
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:36.700]   on your list that goes into your ideal lifestyle.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:38.460]   Maybe you need to leave where you're living.
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:40.060]   And maybe there's something holding you back there.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.140]   Like, well, there's whatever, one family member there,
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:43.620]   but what if you moved over here?
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:45.780]   And then you had access to outdoor fitness
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:47.500]   and you could start an online presence
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.280]   from which you could build an online coaching.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:51.220]   Meanwhile, there's gyms there that are hiring.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.360]   So you could start doing personal training there
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:54.200]   with an adjunct.
[00:43:54.200 --> 00:43:55.540]   I mean, you could start to get options
[00:43:55.540 --> 00:43:59.100]   that are grounded in research on the reality of options
[00:43:59.100 --> 00:44:02.060]   and guided by your vision of an ideal lifestyle.
[00:44:02.060 --> 00:44:04.580]   So this is what I'm trying to get you to do here, Nick,
[00:44:04.580 --> 00:44:08.300]   is to slow down and be more systematic.
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:09.660]   Don't bounce.
[00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:11.780]   Don't just random, that's no good, that's good.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:12.620]   Maybe I should just do that.
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:13.440]   Let me fixate on this.
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:14.540]   I see that all the time.
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:17.140]   Someone just fixates on an idea
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:21.300]   that doesn't really necessarily make sense.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:22.920]   It has all these other issues that come with it.
[00:44:22.920 --> 00:44:24.460]   It's going to make these parts of their life worse
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:26.460]   if they fix this, but if you're just bouncing around,
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:28.060]   we're just going to stick to things randomly.
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:31.660]   So let's get more systematic, lifestyle articulation,
[00:44:31.660 --> 00:44:35.220]   research options, consider different locations,
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.260]   and then really work through things carefully.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.760]   What's going to get me closer to my ideal lifestyle?
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:42.660]   The combination of decisions you come up with in the end
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:43.540]   might be very different
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.380]   than anything you're considering now.
[00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:49.460]   - Strength and conditioning coaches are hard,
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:52.660]   especially for the ones at small colleges
[00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:53.500]   and stuff like that.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:55.580]   It's a hard job or it's hard to get?
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:56.820]   - It's a hard job.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:58.940]   You have to be there really long hours.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.940]   - I edited the question down,
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:04.140]   but he talked about evening hours.
[00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.980]   He's there a lot.
[00:45:04.980 --> 00:45:05.820]   - Yeah.
[00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:07.740]   And then the other thing about those coaches,
[00:45:07.740 --> 00:45:10.820]   you have to be so energetic for each client.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.540]   - Why do you, what's the appeal of that job?
[00:45:13.540 --> 00:45:16.300]   Is that on a trajectory towards,
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:17.820]   I could be a strength and conditioning coach
[00:45:17.820 --> 00:45:21.180]   for a D1 sports program or something?
[00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:22.020]   What's the--
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:25.140]   - If it's at a college, yeah, that's the dream.
[00:45:25.140 --> 00:45:29.180]   I think there's five college strength and conditioning
[00:45:29.180 --> 00:45:31.940]   coaches or whatever that make over a million dollars a year.
[00:45:31.940 --> 00:45:35.700]   - Right, so there is a winner take all
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:37.100]   kind of trajectory in there.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:40.260]   So you should understand that as well.
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:41.340]   This is the thing about those trajectories,
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:44.180]   is figuring out am I actually on this trajectory or not?
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:47.460]   Or have I already started, I'm over at this small college,
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:48.540]   if this is where I'm starting,
[00:45:48.540 --> 00:45:51.700]   I'm never going to be the Notre Dame
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:54.980]   or USD head strength and conditioning coach.
[00:45:54.980 --> 00:45:56.460]   - Yep, yeah.
[00:45:56.460 --> 00:45:57.300]   - Interesting.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.140]   All right, what do we got next?
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:01.860]   - Oh, we got a question from Ben.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.180]   Hey Cal, I'm curious,
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:04.860]   what does your typical workday look like?
[00:46:04.860 --> 00:46:06.660]   Is it closer to a typical nine to five
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:09.700]   or are you up early burning the midnight oil?
[00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:13.180]   - Well, Ben, I'll tell you about my workday in a second,
[00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:17.540]   but I gotta say, I was having fun walking over here,
[00:46:17.540 --> 00:46:20.340]   imagining what my critics think
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:21.700]   my typical workday is like.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:24.220]   So I know that I do have some critics out there
[00:46:24.220 --> 00:46:26.660]   that are pretty vocal and their assumptions
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:29.500]   about my workday are probably quite different
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.140]   from the reality.
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.060]   So I thought it'd be fun to go through a critics assumption
[00:46:35.060 --> 00:46:38.380]   about what Cal Newport's normal workday works like.
[00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:39.860]   So I would say the critics would probably assume
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.820]   that I'm up at something like 4.30 in the morning.
[00:46:42.820 --> 00:46:45.100]   This is when the head of my extensive household staff
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.100]   would come in and prep me
[00:46:46.100 --> 00:46:48.540]   on what was gonna happen in the day.
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:50.900]   Maybe the head of the household staff would say,
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:53.740]   Dr. Newport, I wanted to tell you something
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:54.700]   about one of your children.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:58.260]   And I would say, enough, away with you.
[00:46:58.260 --> 00:47:01.100]   Do not bother me with such trivialities.
[00:47:01.100 --> 00:47:03.860]   I have productive work to do.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:07.500]   My worth and meaning as a person is based off of the labor
[00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:09.620]   that I produce for the owners of capital.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.700]   Do you not realize this?
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:11.700]   Away with you.
[00:47:11.700 --> 00:47:12.820]   After that, I would then go
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:15.540]   to my extensive underground lair,
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.660]   paid for by a massive inheritance
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:20.300]   that I came into very young in my life.
[00:47:20.300 --> 00:47:21.940]   In this underground lair,
[00:47:21.940 --> 00:47:25.340]   I would don minority report style art,
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.820]   augmented reality goggles,
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:28.940]   where I would have a souped up Trello board
[00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:30.660]   where I could move cards around,
[00:47:30.660 --> 00:47:33.620]   like Tom Cruise in "Minority Report" at extreme speeds.
[00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:37.500]   Next to me would be a coach who I insist dress
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:39.740]   like early 20th century labor consultant,
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:41.940]   Frederick Winslow Taylor,
[00:47:41.940 --> 00:47:44.580]   including the mustache, with a stopwatch,
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:46.740]   looking for any inefficiencies in my action.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:50.820]   Because again, as I would tell people frequently
[00:47:50.820 --> 00:47:53.180]   and declaratively throughout my day,
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:56.660]   my worth as a person is defined by my labor,
[00:47:56.660 --> 00:48:01.100]   which I owe to the owners of capital.
[00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.540]   I would take a break maybe around lunchtime.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.420]   This is when James Clear and Tim Ferriss would come over.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.980]   We'll take supplements and weight lift for two hours
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:10.740]   before confidently convincing each other
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.740]   that we understand how everything in the world
[00:48:12.740 --> 00:48:14.420]   should be done.
[00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:17.900]   Another couple hours of quick work on my Trello board.
[00:48:17.900 --> 00:48:20.060]   At this point, I would then take some time
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:22.100]   to go to whatever manuscript of a book
[00:48:22.100 --> 00:48:23.740]   I'm currently writing,
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:26.140]   and then look for any examples that feature women
[00:48:26.140 --> 00:48:28.980]   that I could swap out for examples featuring men instead.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.740]   So I'll go through and do that swapping out.
[00:48:31.740 --> 00:48:35.140]   Patriarchy preserved, I'll then return to more work.
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:37.020]   Maybe by the evening, I'll take some time
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:40.380]   to just stare at a poster of Mark Zuckerberg
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:44.020]   and just mutter, "You,
[00:48:44.020 --> 00:48:44.860]   you."
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.460]   Five minutes FaceTiming with my family,
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:52.500]   seven more hours of work, boom, 2 a.m. I'm back in bed.
[00:48:52.500 --> 00:48:55.540]   That is what I imagine my critics think
[00:48:55.540 --> 00:48:58.460]   my workday is actually like.
[00:48:58.460 --> 00:49:01.420]   The reality is much less interesting.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:04.960]   From the very earliest days of my grad student career,
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.100]   I've maintained what I call fixed schedule productivity,
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:09.580]   where I fix in advance the hours I wanna work,
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:11.300]   and then work backwards to make my career
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:13.060]   fit into those hours.
[00:49:13.060 --> 00:49:17.140]   For me, that is roughly nine to five.
[00:49:17.140 --> 00:49:18.900]   So when I drop my kids off at the bus stop,
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.540]   I'm usually home by like 8.30,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:23.220]   but then it takes some time,
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.300]   maybe I shower, some of the things.
[00:49:24.300 --> 00:49:26.620]   So usually I'm starting work by nine,
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:27.860]   and I like to be done by five,
[00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:29.540]   though I'm often done earlier.
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.880]   When I'm writing, I'll also put in writing sessions
[00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:32.880]   on Sunday mornings.
[00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:35.180]   I'll occasionally also do like an evening writing session
[00:49:35.180 --> 00:49:36.580]   for my newsletter or something like this.
[00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:37.860]   That's just an old tradition of mine,
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:41.140]   but that's 90 minutes once a week.
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:43.700]   What I do during those roughly nine to five schedule,
[00:49:43.700 --> 00:49:46.380]   it just depends on the time of year.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:48.260]   So if it's the summer,
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:50.280]   or like it was last semester for me
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.740]   when I had a teaching release and I was writing a book,
[00:49:52.740 --> 00:49:54.660]   those days are gonna be very heavily focused
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:57.140]   on three to four hours of deep work writing
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:49:58.640]   right off the bat,
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.800]   than anything else that has to be done
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:02.740]   before I shut down for the day.
[00:50:02.740 --> 00:50:04.980]   Other parts of the year look different.
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.140]   Right now, for example, I'm in a teaching semester,
[00:50:08.140 --> 00:50:10.980]   I'm not writing a book, I just submitted my manuscript.
[00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:12.460]   And so I have a much more standard
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.500]   sort of professor schedule.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.020]   And Jesse, I actually brought my computer.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.940]   So I thought what I would do is I'm gonna grab it
[00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:21.880]   and just, I'll load up my calendar for this week.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.140]   I'm not gonna show it to you,
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:25.620]   but I will walk through and just quickly summarize
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.460]   like what each of my days looks like if this is helpful.
[00:50:28.460 --> 00:50:31.780]   All right, so I've grabbed my calendar now
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.260]   for those who are watching the YouTube channel.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.320]   You see, I'm looking down at my screen.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:39.660]   So for this time of year,
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:41.300]   where I'm just sort of in a normal teaching semester,
[00:50:41.300 --> 00:50:42.260]   not book writing.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:46.620]   All right, here was my week.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:48.180]   Let's look at the things around the calendar.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.940]   Monday was Martin Luther King Day,
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:51.980]   the Monday of the week we're recording this.
[00:50:51.980 --> 00:50:55.460]   So there was actually, I didn't have to teach,
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:58.460]   nothing on my calendar actually for that Monday.
[00:50:58.460 --> 00:51:03.460]   Tuesday was also a very light day in terms of appointments.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:06.620]   So I don't even remember what I did on Tuesday.
[00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.220]   I think I watched a movie in the afternoon.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:11.700]   I think I actually over lunch,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:16.620]   I watched "Downhill Racer" with Robert Redford, 1969.
[00:51:16.620 --> 00:51:19.580]   Fantastic sports movie, I highly recommend it.
[00:51:19.580 --> 00:51:21.180]   Wednesday was a teaching day.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.900]   So I did some work on my course in the morning,
[00:51:24.900 --> 00:51:28.740]   drove into campus at 10, taught, office hours, taught,
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.980]   came home, worked out, day was over.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:35.020]   Today, I was actually up early today
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.380]   'cause my oldest kid had a early morning
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:39.700]   orthodontics appointment, so I woke up.
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:40.940]   My wife still came to that.
[00:51:40.940 --> 00:51:42.820]   And while I was waiting for my other kids to wake up,
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:45.740]   I actually did some podcast work in the morning.
[00:51:45.740 --> 00:51:48.540]   Then I did some administrative work, now we're podcasting.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:50.220]   And then I'm gonna do a relatively early shutdown
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.420]   and workout before I pick up one of my other kids at three.
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:55.180]   Tomorrow, I'm going in for,
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:57.780]   oh, tonight I'm also gonna do some writing.
[00:51:57.780 --> 00:51:59.540]   I'm kicking off a new New Yorker piece.
[00:51:59.540 --> 00:52:00.620]   So I'm gonna do writing probably
[00:52:00.620 --> 00:52:02.260]   at the local coffee shop tonight
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.900]   because I need to get out of my normal routine
[00:52:04.900 --> 00:52:06.700]   to get something hard started.
[00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:08.460]   Tomorrow, I'm going to campus for a faculty meeting
[00:52:08.460 --> 00:52:09.780]   and then adventure working.
[00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:12.260]   So I'm gonna go to a scenic library to continue writing.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:13.100]   That's my week.
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:14.020]   So it's like not that interesting.
[00:52:14.020 --> 00:52:16.380]   No day am I working past four or five.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:18.620]   Some days I have appointments,
[00:52:18.620 --> 00:52:20.140]   other days I have less appointments.
[00:52:20.140 --> 00:52:22.140]   So it's not exciting.
[00:52:22.140 --> 00:52:24.460]   - Where's your adventure writing gonna be?
[00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:25.940]   - I don't know.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.420]   It depends how crowded various libraries are.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:30.100]   I think we're early enough in the semester
[00:52:30.100 --> 00:52:31.660]   that I might still have options.
[00:52:31.660 --> 00:52:32.500]   - You mean at school?
[00:52:32.500 --> 00:52:33.540]   - Yeah. - Oh, okay.
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:35.180]   - 'Cause my thought is if I'm going into Georgetown
[00:52:35.180 --> 00:52:37.500]   for a meeting, I might as well take advantage
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:40.100]   of the fact that I'm in a new location
[00:52:40.100 --> 00:52:41.900]   to work in interesting places.
[00:52:41.900 --> 00:52:44.140]   So I like, for example, the bioethical library
[00:52:44.140 --> 00:52:46.220]   in Healy Hall at Georgetown.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:49.260]   If that's crowded, I'll go to a lesser used floor
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:52.340]   of the main library on campus.
[00:52:52.340 --> 00:52:55.220]   If I have thinking to do, I like to walk.
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:58.260]   So there's these trails that go up through Glover Park,
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.360]   down from the canal up through Glover Park,
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:03.740]   intersected by Reservoir Road.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:05.340]   I love those trails, I used to live by them.
[00:53:05.340 --> 00:53:07.700]   So I'll often leave campus and walk up and down those
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:09.060]   if I have thinking to do.
[00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.980]   When the weather's nicer, I have a bunch of outdoor spots
[00:53:11.980 --> 00:53:13.980]   on campus where I'll bring my laptop to write.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.380]   It's too cold this time of year.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:19.300]   But you know, I'm writing a hard article
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:23.300]   and it's hard to get started and get a hard article going.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:25.460]   So I like to do this trick whenever possible,
[00:53:25.460 --> 00:53:29.900]   use interesting locations to try to get the juices flowing.
[00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:32.140]   If you're on chapter seven of a book,
[00:53:32.140 --> 00:53:34.780]   six months into the writing, you're just, let's just go.
[00:53:34.780 --> 00:53:37.020]   You know, you start each morning at your office.
[00:53:37.020 --> 00:53:38.220]   When you're starting something, you're like,
[00:53:38.220 --> 00:53:41.260]   this needs to be, I don't know how I'm gonna even do this.
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:44.060]   You know, you wanna be at the whatever,
[00:53:44.060 --> 00:53:46.620]   at the coffee shop or in the woods
[00:53:46.620 --> 00:53:48.580]   or somewhere kind of interesting to shake it out.
[00:53:48.580 --> 00:53:49.660]   But the reality here, Ben,
[00:53:49.660 --> 00:53:52.280]   is my workday is not that interesting.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:54.180]   I don't work crazy hours.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:55.540]   Now, the two things I will say is,
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:58.620]   during my actual work hours, I'm locked in.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.020]   I time block plan, I don't waste time.
[00:54:01.020 --> 00:54:02.820]   I mentioned that I watched a movie on Tuesday.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:05.100]   That was scheduled well in advance.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:08.060]   This 90 minute block that I'm going to sit
[00:54:08.060 --> 00:54:09.140]   and watch this movie,
[00:54:09.140 --> 00:54:10.980]   it's not something I just casually did
[00:54:10.980 --> 00:54:12.380]   because I was procrastinating.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:14.560]   So I do work really hard when I'm working,
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.060]   but I don't work an unusual amount of hours.
[00:54:17.060 --> 00:54:20.020]   The key to my apparent productivity
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:24.460]   is that over time, a lot of things pile up.
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.660]   So when I work, I work hard.
[00:54:25.660 --> 00:54:27.500]   I'm careful about what I work on.
[00:54:27.500 --> 00:54:30.500]   I am usually working on a couple things at a time.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.160]   I keep making slow but steady progress
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.420]   on multiple things at a time and things finish.
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:36.380]   And then you look at the end of the year
[00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:37.420]   and say you wrote all these articles
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:39.260]   and finished this book and did all these things,
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.940]   but they weren't being done simultaneously.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.860]   It's just the steady application
[00:54:43.860 --> 00:54:45.620]   of a reasonable amount of intense effort
[00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:48.020]   over time aggregates to some pretty cool results.
[00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:53.500]   All right, let's do, I have a case study.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:54.420]   Let's do one more question,
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.400]   and then I have a case study I want to share.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.240]   - Sounds good.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:59.220]   - All right, next question is from Moritz,
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:00.980]   a high school student from Germany.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:03.780]   "I worry that to create the career I want,
[00:55:03.780 --> 00:55:05.720]   "I need to be really skilled at something.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:08.180]   "I worry that I don't really have found an activity
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:10.940]   "which I find so fulfilling as to accomplish that.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:14.220]   "Do you have any recommendations on getting started?"
[00:55:14.220 --> 00:55:15.700]   - Well, Moritz, it's good that you're thinking
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.460]   about this at an early age.
[00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:18.740]   I also want to reassure you
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.640]   that you're still at an early enough age
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.400]   that you should not need to have
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:25.380]   your whole career figured out.
[00:55:26.300 --> 00:55:28.440]   Now, I think what you're expressing here
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:31.480]   is maybe the German equivalent
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:34.180]   of the follow your passion mentality
[00:55:34.180 --> 00:55:36.800]   that's here in America.
[00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:39.640]   At the core of follow your passion is this notion
[00:55:39.640 --> 00:55:41.240]   that you can figure out in advance
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.240]   at the beginning of your career journey
[00:55:43.240 --> 00:55:45.060]   what it is that you're best suited to do,
[00:55:45.060 --> 00:55:47.640]   and therefore use that certainty to actually guide you
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.920]   through the work required to get there.
[00:55:49.920 --> 00:55:53.760]   My big argument is that that's rarely the case.
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:57.160]   Really cool careers that are meaningful,
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.240]   that require a lot of skill, that create impact,
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.260]   they often unfold more haphazardly
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:03.140]   and in a less predictable fashion
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.740]   than most young people imagine.
[00:56:05.740 --> 00:56:08.380]   So as a high school student,
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:12.820]   I would focus on figuring out how to be a student,
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:14.500]   treating it like a job,
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.580]   letting that open up various university opportunities.
[00:56:17.580 --> 00:56:19.340]   As you go to university opportunities,
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:21.380]   choose a field of study that matches the skills
[00:56:21.380 --> 00:56:23.940]   you already have and interest of yours.
[00:56:23.940 --> 00:56:25.800]   Do well at the university level.
[00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:27.640]   Again, treat your studying like a job,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.740]   the type of things I talk about in my book,
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:31.820]   how to become a straight A student,
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:36.360]   be efficient, autopilot schedule, time control, et cetera.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.440]   That's gonna open up opportunities.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.680]   Choose an opportunity that is well-matched to your skills.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:43.040]   You're getting, at this point now,
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:46.080]   the career capital you built up in college or university,
[00:56:46.080 --> 00:56:48.040]   you're actually now really able to deploy it
[00:56:48.040 --> 00:56:51.000]   and use it as leverage, and that's interesting to you,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.960]   and that has interesting opportunities down the line
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.600]   if and when you continue to get good,
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:57.120]   and then just start doing that.
[00:56:57.120 --> 00:56:59.880]   I mean, really, it's often not until you're five years in
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:02.120]   to a career opportunity out of a university
[00:57:02.120 --> 00:57:04.800]   that was well-suited to your skills and interesting
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:07.060]   that you really get to start doing cool things,
[00:57:07.060 --> 00:57:08.280]   that you've built up enough skill
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:10.640]   that now you can shift your job role
[00:57:10.640 --> 00:57:12.800]   or go over to another company or start your own thing.
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:14.440]   So that's down the line.
[00:57:14.440 --> 00:57:17.880]   Right now, just be a good high school student,
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:22.880]   get to university, figure out how to ace that particular job,
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.560]   open up opportunities, choose an interesting one,
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:28.440]   put your head down, do really well,
[00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:29.680]   look up after a few years and say,
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:32.640]   "Okay, now I'm ready to take my career capital
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:34.040]   "out for a spin,"
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:36.440]   and that's when things really do start to get interesting.
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:41.500]   Jesse, I think I have it in the library,
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:45.120]   but the German edition of "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:46.920]   maybe this says something about Germany,
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:48.480]   but in America, the book is called
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:49.520]   "So Good They Can't Ignore You,"
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:51.520]   it's focusing on the positive.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:55.180]   The German edition, it's a newspaper on the cover
[00:57:55.180 --> 00:57:57.680]   and the headline translates to,
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:00.080]   I think it's called "The Dream Job Delusion."
[00:58:00.080 --> 00:58:02.640]   I like that, it's very German.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:04.680]   So the Americans are like, "Yeah, be so good
[00:58:04.680 --> 00:58:05.900]   "and you're gonna find meaning,
[00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:07.560]   "but this is just an alternative way,"
[00:58:07.560 --> 00:58:10.940]   and the Germans are like, "Ah, that dream job delusion?
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:14.480]   "You delusion to think the dream job,
[00:58:15.740 --> 00:58:17.260]   "that's not how it works.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:21.900]   "Efficiency, efficient effort applied
[00:58:21.900 --> 00:58:23.940]   "towards a pragmatic goal.
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:28.100]   "For a dream job is delusion."
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.940]   Bon, I don't know, bon is,
[00:58:29.940 --> 00:58:32.620]   I don't know what that means, road or something like that.
[00:58:32.620 --> 00:58:34.660]   Oh, well, let me do a quick case study
[00:58:34.660 --> 00:58:36.120]   before we get to the books I read.
[00:58:36.120 --> 00:58:37.060]   All right, so our final case study,
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.700]   again, all of these questions and case studies
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:40.200]   are trying to relate to the central theme
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.240]   of today's episode, which is engineering
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.140]   the characteristics of your workday
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:48.220]   to be more satisfying.
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:49.820]   All right, this one comes from Dana,
[00:58:49.820 --> 00:58:52.420]   a 40-year-old lawyer from British Columbia.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:55.700]   So she, Dana, or it might be a he, I'm not sure,
[00:58:55.700 --> 00:58:58.640]   wants to redeem the profession of law.
[00:58:58.640 --> 00:59:00.060]   We said earlier in this episode
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:02.780]   that it ranked last in terms of happiness,
[00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:05.220]   ranked last in terms of stress,
[00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:07.780]   so it's the most stressful, least hapful job.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:09.260]   Are all lawyers doomed?
[00:59:09.260 --> 00:59:10.820]   Dana says, "Not necessarily."
[00:59:10.820 --> 00:59:13.000]   Let's listen to this case study.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.620]   She says, "I work as a lawyer in civil litigation
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:17.640]   "in a small firm.
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:21.080]   "It is a deadline-driven client service profession.
[00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:22.500]   "Your suggestion that people focus
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:24.580]   "on lifestyle-centric career design,
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:26.780]   "where you try to figure out how work fits into your life,
[00:59:26.780 --> 00:59:28.800]   "has been very informative.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.800]   "For example, I have turned down jobs
[00:59:30.800 --> 00:59:32.940]   "as well as offers of partnership in this firm
[00:59:32.940 --> 00:59:35.900]   "because they offered less freedom in my schedule.
[00:59:35.900 --> 00:59:38.100]   "At present, I work more as a contractor
[00:59:38.100 --> 00:59:41.980]   "who can dictate my schedule and quota of cases.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:43.620]   "If I took a more traditional path
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:45.480]   "of buying into a partnership,
[00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:47.060]   "then I'd probably have to take out a loan
[00:59:47.060 --> 00:59:49.320]   "or be paying money to the partners for a share.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.200]   "Alternatively, if I went into the public sector
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.180]   "or a larger firm, then I would lose autonomy.
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.640]   "I have found that lifestyle-centric career planning
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.600]   "is indispensable."
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:01.840]   That's what it looks like
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.860]   when you engineer the characteristics of your workday.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:07.980]   You reject the inertia towards what everyone else is doing
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:09.180]   and say instead,
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:11.120]   "These are the characteristics I want in my job.
[01:00:11.120 --> 01:00:12.520]   "I'm pretty good.
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:13.520]   "I have some leverage.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:16.680]   "I have some say over how my working life unfolds.
[01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:19.520]   "What can I do to get more of these and less of that?"
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.820]   And for Dana, the lawyer, she said,
[01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:24.320]   "Okay, I know everyone else thinks being a partner
[01:00:24.320 --> 01:00:26.400]   "is the ultimate goal because I guess ultimately
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:29.060]   "that's the highest prestige and/or the highest income,
[01:00:29.060 --> 01:00:29.900]   "but who cares?
[01:00:29.900 --> 01:00:33.060]   "I make more than enough money as a non-partner lawyer.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:34.120]   "What I want is autonomy.
[01:00:34.120 --> 01:00:35.600]   "So no, I don't wanna be a partner.
[01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:36.680]   "I wanna stay right here.
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:37.600]   "I want my relationship
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.240]   "to be a contractor-type relationship
[01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.360]   "where I tell you how many cases I wanna take on
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.760]   "and then I will do those cases really well.
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.420]   "I will control my workload.
[01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.440]   "I'm happy with the money I make here."
[01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:50.080]   That's engineering the characteristics.
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.840]   Now, I didn't read these details in the episode,
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:54.880]   but Dana sent a huge amount of information
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:57.640]   about her organizational systems
[01:00:57.640 --> 01:00:59.540]   that her and her legal assistant use.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:01.440]   That's the other aspect of that
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.800]   is she's really dialed in.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:03.980]   It's really kind of cool.
[01:01:03.980 --> 01:01:05.160]   I mean, it's insider baseball,
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:06.760]   so I didn't wanna get into all the details on the show,
[01:01:06.760 --> 01:01:09.200]   but they have these really detailed systems
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:11.600]   for keeping track of each case,
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.680]   what needs to be done each week.
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.200]   They group together tasks by type
[01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:17.680]   so that if the legal assistant's gonna go
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.460]   pull records for one case,
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:21.800]   she can see all the other cases that need records pulled
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.360]   so she can do it all at once.
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:25.720]   They have a system they use
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:27.600]   to pass notes back and forth on cases
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.100]   without having to just interrupt each other.
[01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.560]   They use Agile-style weekly check-in planning.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.260]   So that's the other aspect of this
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:35.680]   is that Dana plugged in the organizational systems
[01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.080]   to try to shave the rough stress edges off
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.560]   of the work that she does do.
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.040]   Let's get the processes dialed in.
[01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:44.480]   Let's make this less haphazard.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:47.000]   Let's make this less interrupt-driven.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.600]   That's controlling the characteristics of your workday.
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:52.300]   So I thought that was a good example to end on.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:01:55.660]   All right, so that's our discussion of today's theme.
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:57.640]   I wanna end the show by talking about
[01:01:57.640 --> 01:01:59.240]   the books I read in December.
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:02.720]   First, I wanna talk about another sponsor of this show.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:05.960]   This show is sponsored by BetterHelp.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:09.680]   Now, we talk a lot on this show about
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.760]   treating your brain as something that needs to be
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:15.840]   trained and protected and fed
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:17.840]   in the same way that you might do that with your body.
[01:02:17.840 --> 01:02:19.360]   You need to give it good ideas,
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:21.760]   high-quality ideas in the forms of books.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.600]   You need to set up the proper conditions for it
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.120]   to be able to concentrate.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:26.120]   If you wanna do deep work,
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:28.280]   you have to have locations where you work.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:29.720]   You have to have rituals around your work.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:31.320]   You have to have systems around your work
[01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:35.760]   so that you can make your mind more comfortable focusing.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.720]   Well, another thing that we have to care about
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:40.880]   if you wanna function in a cognitive economy
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.440]   is what about how you deal with negative thoughts,
[01:02:44.440 --> 01:02:48.520]   stress, anxiety, ruminations,
[01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:51.720]   thought stuff that can draw your attention away,
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:54.760]   make you unhappy, make it difficult to execute.
[01:02:54.760 --> 01:02:58.800]   This is something else you need to work on systematically.
[01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:02.960]   Therapy is what is going to work here.
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:06.320]   Therapy is like the personal trainer for your brain
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.960]   that helps you learn through practice,
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.800]   evidence-based and experience-based practice
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:13.600]   how to actually deal with the difficult things
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.000]   that pop up in our mental lives.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.080]   So if you're thinking of giving therapy a try,
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:22.680]   better help is a great option.
[01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:27.680]   It's convenient, flexible, affordable, and entirely online.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.800]   You just fill out a brief questionnaire
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.720]   to get matched with a licensed therapist
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.000]   and you can switch therapist anytime
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.160]   for no additional charge.
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.920]   If you have anything in your cognitive life right now
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:42.480]   that really is a drag on you,
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:47.320]   the anxiety, stress, rumination, a hedonic affect,
[01:03:47.320 --> 01:03:51.360]   you have any of this going on in your life right now,
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.960]   go to BetterHelp.

[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.160]   I also wanna briefly mention our friends at Policy Genius.
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:26.280]   If you have a family like I do,
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.840]   you have a million things to do.
[01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:32.680]   One of those things is having good life insurance.
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:34.840]   This is something that we often procrastinate on
[01:04:34.840 --> 01:04:37.240]   because we don't really know how to get started.
[01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.480]   Where do we go?
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.840]   Who do we talk to to actually get this in place?
[01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:46.440]   This is where Policy Genius can help.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:50.600]   It was built to modernize the life insurance industry.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.240]   Their technology makes it easy to compare
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:54.220]   life insurance quotes from top companies
[01:04:54.220 --> 01:04:57.200]   like AIG and Prudential in just a few clicks
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:59.120]   to find your lowest price.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:01.320]   With Policy Genius, you can find life insurance policies
[01:05:01.320 --> 01:05:05.840]   that start at just $17 per month for $500,000 of coverage.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.040]   If you don't have life insurance and you have a family,
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:12.720]   you need it, Policy Genius is gonna make this easy.
[01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.320]   Look, we just went through this again.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:15.760]   My wife and I just went through it again
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.200]   where we sat down with our advisor
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.600]   and figured out what we had to adjust our numbers to.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:22.760]   So I know how complicated and confusing the industry can be
[01:05:22.760 --> 01:05:26.360]   if you don't use something like Policy Genius
[01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:27.960]   that makes it simple.
[01:05:27.960 --> 01:05:30.920]   So your loved ones deserve a financial safety net.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:34.200]   You deserve a smarter way to find and buy life insurance.
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:35.920]   So head to policygenius.com

[01:05:42.320 --> 01:05:46.880]   All right, Jesse, it's late, but better late than never.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:48.640]   This final segment, I wanna mention the books
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:51.720]   I read in December, 2022.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:57.920]   As you might recall, December for me is Thriller December.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.520]   It is the month in which I like to read adventure
[01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.560]   or thriller novels.
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.040]   That's the genre that I'd say genre I really like.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.360]   There's a lot of holidays in December.
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.040]   So it's a tradition of mine is to read more thrillers
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.360]   than normal in December.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.600]   So I read three thrillers in December, Jesse,
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.040]   and I will go through them all right now.
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:17.640]   All right, the first one I read,
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:21.900]   The Apollo Murders by Chris Hadfield.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:25.920]   This is a action thriller that takes place
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:28.200]   in an alternative timeline.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:30.240]   So it's in the seventies
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:33.200]   and it's positing an alternative timeline
[01:06:33.200 --> 01:06:35.720]   where we did a few more Apollo programs.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.320]   And I don't wanna give too many details away
[01:06:38.320 --> 01:06:42.120]   other than there's gun battles happening in space
[01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:43.720]   with the Soviets.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.800]   What was cool about this book, what attracted me to it
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.520]   is that Chris Hadfield, the author, is an astronaut.
[01:06:49.480 --> 01:06:53.840]   So this actually has realistic details
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:58.520]   of how all the 1970s era Apollo space program
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:00.120]   technology actually worked.
[01:07:00.120 --> 01:07:03.480]   He actually understands space and what this world is like.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.560]   So I liked that idea that it was written by an astronaut,
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:06.840]   a book about astronaut murders.
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:08.120]   It's pretty good.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:11.320]   The next one I read was Recursion by Blake Crouch.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:14.600]   I wanna flag this book for a second
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:16.960]   because I read a lot of thrillers.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:22.680]   Recursion is about as platonic of an example
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:27.520]   I have found of perfection in pacing.
[01:07:27.520 --> 01:07:32.520]   It's like a masterclass in thriller structure and pacing.
[01:07:32.520 --> 01:07:37.360]   Really that this piece of it is brilliantly done.
[01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.240]   It's datelined chapters
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:42.280]   and you're moving back and forth between two timelines
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:44.000]   and those timelines kind of catch up
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.680]   and the way it moves back and forth, back and forth
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:51.480]   and ratchets up is just a precision plot construction.
[01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:54.160]   It's a book that's really hard to put down
[01:07:54.160 --> 01:07:55.600]   once you pick it up.
[01:07:55.600 --> 01:07:56.880]   I was really impressed by it.
[01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.000]   I mean, actually I was so impressed by it
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.160]   that I was a little bit disappointed
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:01.920]   when I went back to read a prior book of Blake's,
[01:08:01.920 --> 01:08:05.520]   which was good, but man with Recursion,
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.640]   he has the pacing just locked in.
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.960]   It's the best thriller pacing I've read.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:13.120]   One of the best thriller pacing I've probably ever read.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:14.440]   - When was it written?
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:15.480]   - This book would have been, I don't know,
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:17.720]   the last 10 years or something like that.
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:21.480]   It's like a time, I won't give away everything that happens,
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.840]   but the way it opens is it's playing with time.
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.360]   So he's a techno thriller writer.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.200]   He's like our age.
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:31.560]   He's not like, I used to say relatively young.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:33.600]   I guess we're not that young anymore,
[01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.200]   but there's this virus sort of happening
[01:08:36.200 --> 01:08:40.480]   where people are having memories of different lives
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:43.440]   suddenly appear and it seems to be contagious.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:46.880]   Like people nearby have the same thing happen.
[01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:49.120]   And there's a detective that's trying to unwind
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.220]   like what's going on.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:54.600]   And then it starts to unravel.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:08:56.960]   And then you get a plot line from back in time
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.680]   and it catches up and then it gets crazy at the end.
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:02.600]   Anyways, perfection in structure and pacing.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   The last thriller I read in December
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.520]   was The Last Juror by John Grisham.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:08.400]   I just had it from a little free library
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.320]   here in Tacoma Park.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:15.240]   Here's the thing about being a writer like John Grisham.
[01:09:15.240 --> 01:09:17.800]   If you have that one or two huge successes early on,
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:19.320]   you can just keep writing books
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.600]   that don't have to be blockbusters.
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:26.560]   Like if The Last Juror was written by someone else,
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:29.720]   like that's nice.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.160]   But because he wrote The Firm,
[01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:35.240]   because he wrote The Pelican Brief and The Client
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.960]   and he became such a superstar,
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.200]   you could just write these books
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:40.200]   where they don't have to be bangers.
[01:09:40.200 --> 01:09:41.040]   It's just interesting.
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.120]   It's just, it's a guy starting up a newspaper
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:46.480]   in the small Mississippi town that he likes to write about.
[01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:50.520]   And there's a trial and 20 years later,
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.000]   like some of the jurors start dying out,
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:53.900]   like getting killed, right?
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:55.800]   And then they kind of figure out what's going on.
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.280]   That's the book, but I enjoyed it.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.120]   I enjoyed it.
[01:10:00.120 --> 01:10:03.200]   But if this was the book you ran instead of The Firm,
[01:10:03.200 --> 01:10:04.760]   you wouldn't know the name John Grisham.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.980]   So it's a good gig if you can get it.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:08.800]   There's another thriller I didn't quite finish
[01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:10.280]   in December, so I'll get to that in the January.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.720]   So I really read four in December,
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:15.180]   but the fifth one I didn't finish until into January.
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.920]   So we'll get it with the next list.
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:20.480]   All right, I read two other books as well, non-thrillers.
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:22.800]   One was called Living with Frankenstein
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:24.920]   by Steven Schoen.
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:28.200]   This is, I'm working on some things
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:29.240]   with artificial intelligence.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:32.560]   So this is like a small philosophical tract
[01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:34.640]   about machine sentience.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.000]   And this is like a gentleman scholar
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.720]   has this thesis about what does it really mean
[01:10:41.720 --> 01:10:43.400]   for technology to be conscious,
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.760]   and he has a much lower bar for that,
[01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:46.480]   and things were already there.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:48.380]   I needed it for something I was doing.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:51.360]   What I enjoyed more was John Meacham's
[01:10:51.360 --> 01:10:52.680]   And There Was Light.
[01:10:52.680 --> 01:10:55.360]   It was John Meacham's new Lincoln biography.
[01:10:55.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   It was very good, very good.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:11:00.040]   So Meacham is taking a,
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:02.200]   he's looking at Lincoln through the lens
[01:11:02.200 --> 01:11:06.560]   of in part ethics and in part religion.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:10.080]   So the virtue ethics worldview of Lincoln,
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:11.880]   and then also the impact of religions on Lincoln.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:13.480]   I think the early part of Lincoln's life,
[01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.080]   I really enjoyed the way this Meacham treated it
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:17.520]   because what he does good in this book,
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.680]   and I've read a lot of Lincoln books.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.160]   What he does good in this book is set context.
[01:11:22.160 --> 01:11:24.280]   So there's a lot of primary sources
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:25.920]   that he pulls from to set the context.
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:28.760]   So it's one of the better, for example,
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:31.120]   depictions of Southern culture
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:35.080]   during the pre-war period.
[01:11:35.080 --> 01:11:38.000]   Because he pulls from sermons and newspapers
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   and headlines to try to really understand
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.680]   the reactionary culture that was emerging in the South
[01:11:44.680 --> 01:11:46.360]   in defense of slavery.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.920]   And understanding that really helps make sense
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:50.640]   of some of the big historical things that happened.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:53.480]   He goes to primary sources to get there.
[01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.200]   Another thing I learned from Meacham,
[01:11:55.200 --> 01:11:56.720]   which was really interesting, was,
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.120]   I didn't know this, and I read a lot of Lincoln,
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:02.340]   that Lincoln's family, when he was a young kid,
[01:12:02.340 --> 01:12:06.220]   was attending a church, one of these rural churches,
[01:12:06.220 --> 01:12:09.260]   that was, it's very anti-slavery.
[01:12:09.260 --> 01:12:12.380]   So he was exposed to anti-slavery thinking,
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:15.900]   in part because of, this was the early exposure
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.200]   he had to it, was in church, which I hadn't heard.
[01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:21.060]   I had heard about the, there's a labor argument.
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:26.020]   His dad was a working, poor, working class white
[01:12:26.020 --> 01:12:29.480]   in Illinois, were worried about the economic ramifications
[01:12:29.480 --> 01:12:31.680]   of slave labor coming into their state.
[01:12:31.680 --> 01:12:33.020]   So I had heard that piece of it.
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:35.020]   So he grew up in an anti-slavery household,
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:38.780]   but he was inculcated with a religious anti-slavery message.
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:42.260]   And Meacham went back and found, here's the preacher,
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:43.620]   and here's the type of things they talked about.
[01:12:43.620 --> 01:12:45.420]   So I thought that was all good.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:47.460]   Once they get to the war, and the presidency,
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.700]   it's like, (imitates explosion)
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.980]   real fast.
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:52.220]   He just covers it in 70 pages.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:55.420]   It just, it moves by really fast, but enjoyed it.
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.220]   All right, Jesse, those were my five books from December.
[01:12:58.220 --> 01:13:01.540]   Next month, we will talk about the five books I read
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.380]   in January.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.120]   We'll try to do a little bit sooner next time.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.420]   All right, well, that's all the time we have
[01:13:05.420 --> 01:13:06.360]   for today's episode.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:09.540]   We'll be back next week with a new episode.
