[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   In yourself and in your observation of people
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.660]   that you've worked with,
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.880]   did you ever sense that just being hard driving
[00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.900]   was kind of, it was great, but it was limiting?
[00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.180]   Like, did you ever sense that like,
[00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.820]   by liking the people you work with,
[00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.380]   you could perform much better?
[00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.740]   Even if they perhaps were not as hard,
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.080]   to kind of borrow the common parlance around this,
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.840]   they weren't as hard as everybody else,
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.040]   that because you like each other so, so much,
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.000]   that you can kind of do anything.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Well, if you have a team of 10 people
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.520]   and you all have a great relationship
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.720]   and you get along well, and you're going against my team
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.640]   and we all hate each other and who's gonna win?
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.840]   The team that loves each other is gonna win, I would hope.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.920]   It's not even close.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.760]   It's not even close.
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.440]   As a matter of fact, if you work for me
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200]   and you don't like me,
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000]   what kind of performance are you gonna give me?
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.920]   It's gonna be tough.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.680]   What if you love me and I've looked out for you
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.880]   and I've done everything for you
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.000]   and I've taken care of you,
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.400]   what kind of performance are you gonna give me?
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.240]   - I'm like a dog, I'd die for you.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.320]   - So yeah, and you know, earlier you asked about
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.240]   the human animal and human nature,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.920]   and this is part of leadership.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.960]   I got asked this question the other day
[00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320]   by, I was working with a company,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.080]   and the guy says, you know, how do I identify,
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.600]   what are the characteristics of someone that can execute
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.800]   and how do I identify those characteristics in a person
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.960]   so that I can get those people?
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.720]   And I said, well, first of all,
[00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.520]   the characteristics are the characteristics
[00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.440]   that everybody's, you know, obviously someone that's driven,
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.440]   someone that can communicate well,
[00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.640]   someone that's gonna make things happen.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.620]   Those are pretty simple to know.
[00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.640]   We know what they are.
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:40.520]   How do you identify them?
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.240]   It's pretty simple as well.
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.400]   I give you a task.
[00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.680]   I give Andrew a task.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.040]   It's a pretty simple task.
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.680]   If you get it done, cool.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.840]   Give you a little bit more complex task.
[00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:50.680]   Do you get it done?
[00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.500]   Yes.
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.960]   I give the same task to Fred.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:53.800]   He doesn't get it done.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.120]   He comes back with a bunch of questions.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.080]   He slow rolls it.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.800]   He's got all kinds of excuses and problems.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.480]   I give you an even more complex task.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.280]   You come back, you get it done,
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.120]   and then I'm gonna realize, okay,
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.920]   Andrew's the guy that makes things happen.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.620]   He's a guy that can actually execute.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.600]   And it's a little bit what you said.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.060]   I mean, there's certain breeds of dogs,
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.480]   but even that is, they're not as different
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.040]   as human beings are, right?
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.520]   And there are some, so now there are some guys,
[00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.360]   I've got Andrew who will make things happen.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.000]   Here's the problem with Andrew.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.480]   When I say, hey, Andrew, here's this nebulous idea
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.960]   that I have, can you turn this into a reality?
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.680]   And you're like, where do I start?
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.120]   I'm not sure where you want me to go.
[00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.360]   Meanwhile, I gave it to the guy
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.140]   that didn't make anything happen
[00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.280]   with specific tasks that I gave him.
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.000]   And he comes back and says, you know, I say,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.040]   hey, I got this nebulous idea.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.800]   Can you see what you, he goes, oh yeah.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.440]   And all of a sudden he takes it and he says,
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.100]   hey, I figured out a way to make this happen.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.800]   So you might have someone that's very good at executing,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.980]   but they're not very creative.
[00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.640]   I might have somebody that's very creative,
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.480]   but they're not very good at executing.
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.640]   So what do I do?
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.040]   I build a team where I've got Andrew and Fred
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.200]   and they work together.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.180]   And Fred comes up with good ideas
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.940]   and we bring them to Andrew and Andrew goes and executes him.
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:12.160]   So that's what we're doing from a leadership perspective
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   is we're letting people's nature execute
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.520]   and we're putting people into roles
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.360]   where their nature is beneficial.
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.760]   I'm not gonna take someone that's shy and introverted
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.120]   and put them out in the lead sales role.
[00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:29.960]   I'm not gonna take somebody that's boisterous
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.600]   and extroverted and put them into a cubicle
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.200]   where they're gonna be looking at spreadsheets all day.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.760]   Clearly I'm not gonna do that.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.320]   So what we have to do as leaders
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.840]   is we have to find the right people for the right role
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:42.500]   and we place them into those roles.
[00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.120]   Now, does it mean that I abandon all hope
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.400]   that the guy that's an introvert
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.480]   will ever develop more communication skills?
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:50.880]   No, I'm still gonna work with him.
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.240]   And over time we'll get him a little bit moving
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.700]   in the right direction.
[00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.480]   But I'm not gonna take somebody that's a total introvert
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.200]   and turn them into a lead sales guy.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.520]   That's not going to happen
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.500]   any more than I'm gonna change a tiger stripes.
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.120]   So that's what we have to do
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.520]   is we have to help people as leaders.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.280]   We have to help people find the role
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.680]   and find the thing that they're good at.
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.500]   Now, does that mean if I have someone that loves their job,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.160]   they're gonna do better at it?
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.560]   Absolutely.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.440]   Does it mean that if I have somebody
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:27.360]   that's driven just by achievement,
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:29.120]   that they're gonna be good at their job?
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.400]   No, in fact, well, they can be.
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.560]   There's gonna be certain roles I can put them in, right?
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:35.080]   If I've got a sales number I need to hit
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.480]   and Andrew's super into achievement,
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.280]   he wants to be the golden child
[00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.000]   and wants to have his picture on the magazine
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.280]   that we put out about our industry.
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.880]   Cool, I can throw this task at you
[00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.300]   and you're gonna go and get it.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.760]   The problem is if there's something
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.980]   that's gonna take more perseverance
[00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.360]   and the reward isn't that high, or it's a long-term goal,
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.800]   you're probably not the right guy for the job.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   So liking your job is absolutely critical.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.760]   And if you love your job,
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.040]   you're gonna be able to most likely excel at it.
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:11.480]   Now, you could be an unfortunate person
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.080]   that loves your job and is not good at it.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.560]   That happens occasionally, right?
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:18.440]   - Yeah, but it seems, it sure does, but it seems pretty rare.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.200]   - It reminds me of your skateboarding career.
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.080]   You love skateboarding, but you just weren't that good at it.
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:23.920]   - I wasn't that good at it.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.280]   But you know what I loved more than skateboarding?
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.060]   I loved the community I was in.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.560]   I loved the community I was in.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.200]   And I probably would have gone to the industry side
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.640]   or worked on a company side
[00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:35.800]   and not been on the actual skateboard side
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.400]   or just skateboard for fun.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.040]   So there's a guy in the skateboard community,
[00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.040]   his name is Jim Thiebaud,
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.440]   and he's kind of the not so hidden secret in that community.
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:46.560]   He's an amazing guy and he sort of early on
[00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.360]   left professional skateboarding to run a company,
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.880]   Real Deluxe, a bunch of other companies.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:51.740]   He's an amazing guy.
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:53.800]   And he told me, we'd become friends recently,
[00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:55.800]   and he said, he realized he wasn't gonna be
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:56.880]   one of the big guys,
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.580]   but he knew he wanted to be in this community.
[00:05:58.580 --> 00:05:59.960]   So he found his place.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.800]   And I think everyone in skateboarding looks to Jim
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   as like the guy who cares, he truly cares
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.440]   about the sport and about the people.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:10.240]   And so he learned to kind of just wrap his arms
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.600]   and his heart around the whole thing, and it just works.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.980]   And so I do think everyone has a certain place
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.520]   in a community or in a team.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.080]   I think that as you're describing this,
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.280]   I have to imagine that people are listening and thinking,
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:26.740]   like, wow, this team thing is awesome.
[00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:28.120]   Like, it's just amazing.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.600]   I wish I had that, right?
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:31.400]   I'm fortunate to have that in my podcast.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.680]   I've had that in my lab, certainly in my podcast team.
[00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:36.940]   I would say, these guys go, I go.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:40.740]   Like, it's not just people that press buttons
[00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:42.680]   and run equipment, take photos, like, they go, I go.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   Like, they go, it's over.
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:44.960]   And I'm fine with that.
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.160]   I actually love that because it's, yes,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:49.500]   it's about the podcast and about the information
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:50.340]   and getting it out there,
[00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.720]   but it's as much about the team and working together
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.440]   just like it was with skateboarding.
[00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:57.620]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.200]   (upbeat music)
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.920]   (upbeat music)
