[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.440]   So I would trust a local for those local activities.
[00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.960]   I would not trust somebody who is a generalist.
[00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.160]   I'll tell you very honestly,
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.220]   when we work in a market that we don't know so well,
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.360]   we work through a destination management company,
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.240]   a destination expert who really knows that little village,
[00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.440]   that little town and how to make things happen.
[00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.240]   The reason for that is that the internet,
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.800]   ChatGPTNL, can kind of answer generic questions for you
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.720]   on a very high level about something.
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.800]   But when you wanna know what is the best bakery
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.160]   in a certain town and why, you need to go to a local.
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.000]   You need to go to somebody who has
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   on-the-ground experience.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.760]   If you're staying at an Airbnb or a Vrbo,
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.880]   all the time, reach out to those hosts and say,
[00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.200]   "Hey, hi, this is who I am, this is my family,
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.220]   "this is what we're coming to do.
[00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.080]   "What do you recommend for X, Y, and Z?
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.880]   "We wanna wake up in the morning and go to do this.
[00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.100]   "Is this a good idea?"
[00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.440]   We're staying in Monaco at the end of the month,
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.860]   and just for one night.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.680]   And I'm like, we've got five hours basically
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.800]   to see all of the highlights of Monaco
[00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.080]   from a local's perspective.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.360]   I don't wanna go to the casino only.
[00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.120]   I wanna do what a local would do.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.160]   How do you do that?
[00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.560]   I have an awesome itinerary back 24 hours later.
