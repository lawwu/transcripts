[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060]   Are there times to avoid or times you think Mexico really shines?
[00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.840]   You've got, in general, rainy and dry season throughout all of Mexico.
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:12.720]   The rainy season spans from about June through October, with the worst of it
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:15.320]   being late August into late October.
[00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.120]   You probably want to avoid that, but even the early parts of the rainy
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.080]   season, June, July, even early August, we kind of look at it as the green season.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:24.640]   But it's lower prices.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.560]   That's kind of a travel hack.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.720]   What most people think is, is rainy season, but it only has a little bit
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.640]   of thundershowers in the late afternoon.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.360]   But generally you've got nice weather and much better prices, less
[00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.080]   people, more availability, and that goes for everything.
