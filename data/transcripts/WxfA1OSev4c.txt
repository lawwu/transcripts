[00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.540]   "He was a member of both the Supernova Cosmology Project

[00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.860]   "which used observations of the extragalactic supernova
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.940]   "to discover that the universe is accelerating,
[00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.620]   "and that this implies the existence of dark energy.

[00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.640]   And now, here's my conversation with Alex Filippenko.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.340]   Let's start by talking about the biggest possible thing,
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.300]   the universe.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.140]   - Sure.
[00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.580]   - Will the universe expand forever or collapse on itself?
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.060]   - Well, you know, that's a great question.
[00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.620]   That's one of the big questions of cosmology.
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.660]   And of course, we have evidence
[00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.980]   that the matter density is sufficiently low
[00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.020]   that the universe will expand forever.
[00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.640]   But not only that, there's this weird repulsive effect.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.100]   We call it dark energy for want of a better term.
[00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.860]   And it appears to be accelerating
[00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.740]   the expansion of the universe.
[00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.580]   So if that continues, the universe will expand forever.
[00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.840]   But it need not necessarily continue.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.700]   It could reverse sign,
[00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.540]   in which case the universe could,
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.100]   in principle, collapse at some point in the far, far future.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.860]   - So like, in terms of investment advice,
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.860]   if you were to give me,
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.380]   and then to bet all my money on one or the other,
[00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.420]   where does your intuition currently lie?
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.260]   - Well, right now I would say that it would expand forever,
[00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.380]   because I think that the dark energy
[00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.020]   is likely to be just quantum fluctuations of the vacuum.
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:15.860]   The vacuum zero energy state is not a state of zero energy.
[00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.380]   That is, the ground state is a state of some elevated energy
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.060]   which has a repulsive effect to it.
[00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.740]   And that will never go away,
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.980]   because it's not something that changes with time.
[00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.900]   So if the universe is accelerating now,
[00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.740]   it will forever continue to do so.
[00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:32.980]   - And yet, I mean,
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.060]   you so effortlessly mentioned dark energy.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.380]   Do we have any understanding of what the heck that thing is?
[00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:40.200]   - Well, not really.
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.460]   But we're getting progressively better
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.060]   observational constraints.
[00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.540]   So, you know, different theories of what it might be
[00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.940]   predict different sorts of behavior
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.660]   for the evolution of the universe.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.580]   And we've been measuring the evolution of the universe now.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.100]   And the data appear to agree with the predictions
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.100]   of a constant density vacuum energy, a zero point energy.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.260]   But one can't prove that that's what it is,
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.100]   because one would have to show that the numbers,
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.460]   that the measured numbers agree with the predictions
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.180]   to an arbitrary number of decimal places.
[00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.580]   And of course, even if you've got eight, nine, 10,
[00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.020]   12 decimal places, what if in the 13th one,
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.940]   the measurements significantly differ from the prediction?
[00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.940]   Then the dark energy isn't this vacuum state,
[00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.260]   ground state energy of the vacuum.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.380]   And so then it could be some sort of a field,
[00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.380]   some sort of a new energy, a little bit like light,
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.860]   like electromagnetism, but very different from light,
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.340]   that fills space.
[00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.300]   And that type of energy could in principle change
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.580]   in the distant future.
[00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.340]   It could become gravitationally attractive for all we know.
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.300]   There is a historical precedent to that.
[00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.420]   And that is that the inflation
[00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.060]   with which the universe began
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.420]   when the universe was just a tiny blink of an eye old,
[00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:08.660]   a trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second,
[00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:10.100]   you know, the universe went whoosh,
[00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.260]   it exponentially expanded.
[00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:16.340]   That dark energy like substance, we call it the inflaton,
[00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:18.700]   that which inflated the universe,
[00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:22.260]   later decayed into more or less normal,
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.540]   gravitationally attractive matter.
[00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:27.780]   So the exponential early expansion of the universe
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.620]   did transition to a deceleration,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:33.140]   which then dominated the universe
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:34.940]   for about 9 billion years.
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.820]   And now this small amount of dark energy
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.740]   started causing an acceleration
[00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:43.420]   about 5 billion years ago.
[00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:45.860]   And whether that will continue or not
[00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.780]   is something that we'd like to answer,
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:50.900]   but I don't know that we will anytime soon.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.340]   - So there could be this interesting field
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.900]   that we don't yet understand that's morphing over time,
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.580]   that's changing the way the universe is expanding.
[00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:03.260]   I mean, it's funny that you were thinking
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.260]   through this rigorously like an experimentalist.
[00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.100]   - Yeah.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.180]   - What about like the fundamental physics of dark energy?
[00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:16.180]   Is there any understanding of what the heck it is?
[00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:21.140]   Or is this the kind of the God of the gaps
[00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:22.820]   or the field of the gaps?
[00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:25.420]   So like there must be something there
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.900]   because of what we're observing.
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.060]   - I'm very much a person who believes
[00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.580]   that there's always a cause, you know,
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:36.580]   there are no miracles of a supernatural nature.
[00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.980]   Okay.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:42.020]   So, I mean, there are two broad categories,
[00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.180]   either it's the vacuum zero point energy,
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.060]   or it's some sort of a new energy field
[00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:50.380]   that pervades the universe.
[00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.500]   The latter could change with time.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.860]   The former, the vacuum energy cannot.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.220]   So if it turns out that it's one of these new fields
[00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:00.940]   and there are many, many possibilities,
[00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.140]   they go by the name of, you know,
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.380]   quintessence and things like that.
[00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.340]   But there are many categories of those sorts of fields.
[00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.140]   We try with data to rule them out
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:16.300]   by comparing the actual measurements with the predictions.
[00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.820]   And some have been ruled out,
[00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:21.860]   but many, many others remain to be tested.
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.340]   And the data just have to become a lot better
[00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:27.180]   before we can rule out most of them
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:31.900]   and become reasonably convinced that this is a vacuum energy.
[00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:34.100]   - So there is hypotheses for different fields?
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:35.140]   - Oh yeah. - Like with names
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:35.980]   and stuff like that? - Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.620]   You know, generically quintessence
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.900]   like the Aristotelian fifth essence,
[00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.700]   but there are many, many versions of quintessence.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:44.420]   There's K-essence.
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:47.020]   There's even ideas that, you know,
[00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.740]   this isn't something from within this dark energy,
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:53.700]   but rather there are a bunch of, say, bubble universes
[00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:55.380]   surrounding our universe.
[00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:57.180]   And this whole idea of the multiverse
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.460]   is not some crazy madman type idea anymore.
[00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:02.580]   It's, you know, real card-carrying physicists
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.060]   are seriously considering this possibility of a multiverse.
[00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.660]   And some types of multiverses could have, you know,
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:10.540]   a bunch of bubbles on the outside,
[00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:15.100]   which gravitationally act outward on our bubble
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:17.580]   because gravity or gravitons,
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.540]   the quantum particle that is thought to carry gravity
[00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:23.700]   is thought to traverse the bulk,
[00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.740]   the space between these different little bubble membranes
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.580]   and stuff.
[00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.820]   And so it's conceivable that these other universes
[00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:31.340]   are pulling outward on us.
[00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.620]   That's not a favored explanation right now,
[00:08:33.620 --> 00:08:37.900]   but really nothing has been ruled out.
[00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.300]   No class of models has been ruled out completely.
[00:08:41.300 --> 00:08:44.460]   Certain examples within classes of models
[00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:45.740]   have been ruled out.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:50.180]   But in general, I think we still have really a lot to learn
[00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.900]   about what's causing this observed acceleration
[00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.380]   of the expansion of the universe,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:09:00.300]   be it dark energy or some forces from the outside
[00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:05.140]   or perhaps, you know, I guess it's conceivable that,
[00:09:05.140 --> 00:09:07.020]   and sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night
[00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.900]   screaming that dark energy,
[00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.460]   that which causes the acceleration and dark matter,
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.300]   that which causes galaxies and clusters of galaxies
[00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.180]   to be bound gravitationally,
[00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.020]   even though there's not enough visible matter to do so.
[00:09:21.020 --> 00:09:26.020]   Maybe these are our 20th and 21st century
[00:09:26.020 --> 00:09:28.220]   Ptolemaic epicycles.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.500]   So Ptolemy had a geocentric and Aristotelian view of the world.
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.340]   Everything goes around Earth.
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:38.900]   But in order to explain the backward motion of planets
[00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.500]   among the stars that happens every year or two,
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.940]   or sometimes several times a year for Mercury and Venus,
[00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:47.660]   you needed the planets to go around in little circles
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:52.100]   called epicycles, which themselves then went around Earth.
[00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.980]   And in this part of the epicycle
[00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.940]   where the planet is going in the direction opposite
[00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.340]   to the direction of the overall epicycle,
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.460]   it can appear in projection
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:05.540]   to be going backward among the stars,
[00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.940]   so-called retrograde motion.
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:10.260]   And it was a brilliant mathematical scheme.
[00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:14.460]   In fact, he could have added epicycles on top of epicycles
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.620]   and reproduce the observed positions of planets
[00:10:17.620 --> 00:10:19.620]   to arbitrary accuracy.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.140]   And this is really the beginning
[00:10:21.140 --> 00:10:24.580]   of what we now call Fourier analysis, right?
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:27.740]   Any periodic function can be represented
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:31.540]   by a sum of sines and cosines of different periods,
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:33.460]   amplitudes, and phases.
[00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:36.260]   So it could have worked arbitrarily well.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:39.820]   But other data show that, in fact,
[00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.980]   Earth is going around the sun.
[00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.780]   So are dark energy and dark matter
[00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:48.460]   just these band-aids that we now have
[00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:50.740]   to try to explain the data,
[00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.980]   but they're just completely wrong?
[00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:54.660]   That's a possibility as well.
[00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:58.060]   And as a scientist, I have to be open to that possibility
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:10:59.740]   as an open-minded scientist.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:03.220]   - How do you put yourself in the mindset of somebody
[00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:05.780]   that, or a majority of the scientific community,
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.140]   or a majority of people believe
[00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:09.620]   that the Earth, everything rotates around Earth,
[00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:13.500]   how do you put yourself in that mindset
[00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   and then take a leap to propose a model
[00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:23.180]   that the sun is, in fact,
[00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:25.940]   at the center of the solar system?
[00:11:25.940 --> 00:11:27.620]   - Sure, I mean, so that puts us back
[00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.900]   in the shoes of Copernicus, right?
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:34.900]   500 years ago, where he had this philosophical preference
[00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:38.980]   for the sun being the dominant body
[00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.300]   in what we now call the solar system.
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.100]   The observational evidence,
[00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:47.380]   in terms of the measured positions of planets,
[00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.620]   was not better explained
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:53.380]   by the heliocentric sun-centered system.
[00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.820]   It's just that Copernicus saw that the sun
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:58.540]   is the source of all our light and heat.
[00:11:58.540 --> 00:11:59.980]   - Oh, wow, interesting.
[00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:03.820]   - And he knew from other studies that it's far away,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.300]   so the fact that it appears as big as the moon
[00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:08.220]   means it's actually way, way bigger,
[00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:09.340]   because even at that time,
[00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:12.660]   it was known that the sun is much farther away than the moon.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.180]   So he just felt, wow, it's big, it's bright.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:18.580]   What if it's the central thing?
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:23.080]   But the observed positions of planets at the time,
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.540]   in the early to mid 16th century,
[00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:30.040]   under the heliocentric system, was not a better match,
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:32.360]   at least not a significantly better match
[00:12:32.360 --> 00:12:35.160]   than Ptolemy's system, which was quite accurate
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.260]   and lasted 1,500 years.
[00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:38.460]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.100]   - That's so fascinating to think
[00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:44.060]   that the philosophical predispositions
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:45.900]   that you bring to the table are essential.
[00:12:45.900 --> 00:12:48.500]   So you have to have a young person come along
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:51.260]   that has a weird infatuation with the sun.
[00:12:51.260 --> 00:12:52.700]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:54.940]   - Like almost philosophically is,
[00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.340]   like however their upbringing is,
[00:12:57.340 --> 00:13:00.660]   they're more ready for whatever the more,
[00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:02.680]   the simpler answer is. - Right.
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:07.060]   - Oh, that's kind of sad.
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.700]   It's sad from an individual descendant of ape perspective,
[00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:15.700]   because then that means, like me, you as a scientist,
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:19.100]   you're stuck with whatever the heck philosophies
[00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:20.060]   you brought to the table,
[00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:22.940]   and you might be almost completely unable
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.660]   to think outside this particular box you've built.
[00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:27.500]   - Right, this is why I'm saying that, you know,
[00:13:27.500 --> 00:13:30.900]   as an objective scientist, one needs to have an open mind
[00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:34.060]   to crazy-sounding new ideas. - Exactly, yeah.
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.260]   - And, you know, even Copernicus was very much a man
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:40.140]   of his time and dedicated his work to the pope.
[00:13:40.140 --> 00:13:43.100]   He still used circular orbits.
[00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:46.140]   The sun was a little bit off-center, it turns out,
[00:13:46.140 --> 00:13:48.700]   and a slightly off-center circle
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.180]   looks like a slightly eccentric elliptical orbit.
[00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:54.500]   So then when Kepler, in fact,
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.100]   showed that the orbits are actually, in general,
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:14:01.620]   ellipses, not circles, the reason that, you know,
[00:14:01.620 --> 00:14:05.740]   he needed Tuco Brahe's really great data
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:07.620]   to show that distinction
[00:14:07.620 --> 00:14:09.820]   was that a slightly off-center circle
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:13.500]   is not much different from a slightly eccentric ellipse.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:15.620]   And so there wasn't much difference
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:19.740]   between Kepler's view and Copernicus's view,
[00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:24.580]   and Kepler needed the better data, Tuco Brahe's data.
[00:14:24.580 --> 00:14:29.580]   And so that's, again, a great example of science
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:32.700]   and observations and experiments
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:34.660]   working together with hypotheses,
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.940]   and they kind of bounce off each other.
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.180]   They play off of each other,
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.700]   and you continually need more observations.
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:45.700]   And it wasn't until Galileo's work around 1610
[00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:50.980]   that actual evidence for the heliocentric hypothesis emerged.
[00:14:50.980 --> 00:14:54.020]   It came in the form of Venus, the planet Venus,
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.900]   going through all of the possible phases,
[00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:01.180]   from new to crescent to quarter to gibbous to full
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:03.700]   to waning gibbous, third quarter, waning crescent,
[00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:04.940]   and then new again.
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.180]   It turns out in the Ptolemaic system,
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:09.980]   with Venus between Earth and the sun,
[00:15:09.980 --> 00:15:12.740]   but always roughly in the direction of the sun,
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.460]   you could only get the new and crescent phases of Venus.
[00:15:17.460 --> 00:15:21.540]   But the observations showed a full set of phases.
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.660]   And moreover, when Venus was gibbous or full,
[00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:26.580]   that meant it was on the far side of the sun.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:29.740]   That meant it was farther from Earth than when it's crescent
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.940]   so it should appear smaller, and indeed it did.
[00:15:32.940 --> 00:15:36.620]   So that was the nail in the coffin, in a sense.
[00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:39.140]   And then, you know, Galileo's other great observation
[00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:42.460]   was that Jupiter has moons going around it,
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.300]   the four Galilean satellites.
[00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.820]   And even though Jupiter moves through space,
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:49.380]   so too do the moons go with it.
[00:15:49.380 --> 00:15:51.820]   So first of all, Earth is not the only thing
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:53.740]   that has other things going around it.
[00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:58.220]   And secondly, Earth could be moving, as Jupiter does,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:01.140]   and, you know, things would move with it.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.780]   We wouldn't fly off the surface
[00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:04.260]   and our moon wouldn't be left behind
[00:16:04.260 --> 00:16:05.220]   and all this kind of stuff.
[00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:07.980]   So that was a big breakthrough as well,
[00:16:07.980 --> 00:16:10.700]   but it wasn't as definitive, in my opinion,
[00:16:10.700 --> 00:16:13.460]   as the phases of Venus.
[00:16:13.460 --> 00:16:15.100]   - Perhaps I'm revealing my ignorance,
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.260]   but I didn't realize how much data they were working with.
[00:16:18.260 --> 00:16:19.100]   - Yeah.
[00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:22.340]   - So there's, so it wasn't Einstein
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:26.940]   or Freud thinking in theories.
[00:16:26.940 --> 00:16:29.740]   It was a lot of data and you're playing with it
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:31.380]   and seeing how to make sense of it.
[00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:33.420]   So it isn't just coming up
[00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:36.180]   with completely abstract thought experiments.
[00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.020]   - Yeah.
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.260]   - It's looking at the data.
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.380]   - Sure, and you look at Newton's great work, right?
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:41.780]   The Principia.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.620]   It was based in part on Galileo's observations
[00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.540]   of balls rolling down inclined planes,
[00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.100]   supposedly falling off the Leaning Tower of Pisa,
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.140]   but that's probably apocryphal.
[00:16:53.140 --> 00:16:58.140]   In any case, you know, the Inquisition actually did,
[00:16:58.540 --> 00:17:02.860]   or the Roman Catholic Church did history a favor,
[00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.000]   not that I'm condoning them,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.460]   but they placed Galileo under house arrest.
[00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:07.300]   - Yeah.
[00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:09.840]   - And that gave Galileo time to publish,
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:13.400]   to assemble and publish the results of his experiments
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:15.520]   that he had done decades earlier.
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.540]   It's not clear he would have had time to do that, you know,
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:21.300]   had he not been under house arrest.
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.540]   And so Newton, of course,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.620]   very much used Galileo's observations.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:31.940]   - Let me ask the old Russian overly philosophical question
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.140]   about death.
[00:17:33.140 --> 00:17:36.420]   So we're talking about the expanding universe.
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.380]   - Sure.
[00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:40.120]   - How do you think human civilization will come to an end
[00:17:40.120 --> 00:17:43.520]   if we avoid the near-term issues we're having?
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:47.140]   Will it be our sun burning out?
[00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:48.420]   Will it be comets?
[00:17:48.420 --> 00:17:49.260]   - Oh, okay.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:52.500]   - Will it be, what is it?
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:54.900]   Do you think we have a shot at reaching
[00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:58.780]   the heat death of the universe?
[00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:03.180]   - Yeah, so we're gonna leave out the anthropogenic-
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.980]   - Nuclear war. - Causes of our
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:07.140]   potential destruction.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:07.980]   - Yes.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:09.740]   - Which I actually think are greater
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:14.340]   than the celestial causes.
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:15.180]   So-
[00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:16.180]   - So if we get lucky.
[00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:17.020]   - Yeah, if we get lucky.
[00:18:17.020 --> 00:18:18.220]   - And intelligent, I don't know.
[00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:21.180]   - Yeah, so no way will we as humans
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.380]   reach the heat death of the universe.
[00:18:23.380 --> 00:18:26.780]   I mean, it's conceivable that machines,
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:29.820]   which I think will be our evolutionary descendants,
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:32.140]   might reach that, although even they
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.580]   will have less and less energy with which to work
[00:18:34.580 --> 00:18:37.300]   as time progresses, because eventually
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:40.140]   even the lowest mass stars burn out,
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.780]   although it takes them trillions of years to do so.
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:47.420]   So the point is that certainly on Earth,
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:52.180]   there are other celestial threats, existential threats,
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:56.860]   comets, exploding stars, the sun burning out.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:59.300]   So we will definitely need to move away
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:02.260]   from our solar system to other solar systems.
[00:19:02.260 --> 00:19:07.260]   And then the question is, can they keep on propagating
[00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:10.580]   to other planetary systems sufficiently long?
[00:19:10.580 --> 00:19:15.380]   In our own solar system, the sun burning out
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:19.460]   is not the immediate existential threat.
[00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:22.940]   That'll happen in about 5 billion years
[00:19:22.940 --> 00:19:24.420]   when it becomes a red giant.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:26.460]   Although I should hasten to add
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:29.060]   that within the next 1 or 2 billion years,
[00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.260]   the sun will have brightened enough
[00:19:31.260 --> 00:19:36.260]   that unless there are compensatory atmospheric changes,
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:39.140]   the oceans will evaporate away.
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:41.580]   And you need much less carbon dioxide
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:44.340]   for the temperatures to be maintained roughly
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.580]   at their present temperature,
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.780]   and plants wouldn't like that very much.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.540]   So you can't lower the carbon dioxide content too much.
[00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.380]   So within 1 or 2 billion years,
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:56.140]   probably the oceans will evaporate away.
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:59.420]   But on a sooner timescale than that,
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:01.700]   I would say an asteroid collision
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:04.180]   leading to a potential mass extinction,
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.660]   or at least an extinction of complex beings
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.900]   such as ourselves that require quite special conditions,
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:14.300]   unlike cockroaches and amoebas, to survive.
[00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:20.260]   One of these civilization-changing asteroids
[00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:23.900]   is only one kilometer or so in diameter and bigger,
[00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:28.780]   and a true mass extinction event is 10 kilometers or larger.
[00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:31.740]   Now, it's true that we can find and track
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:34.940]   the orbits of asteroids that might be headed toward Earth.
[00:20:34.940 --> 00:20:38.580]   And if we find them 50 or 100 years before they impact us,
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:41.140]   then clever applied physicists and engineers
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:43.380]   can figure out ways to deflect them.
[00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:45.940]   But at some point, some comet will come in
[00:20:45.940 --> 00:20:48.460]   from the deep freeze of the solar system.
[00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:52.700]   And there we have very little warning, months to a year.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.020]   - What's a deep freeze, Sarge?
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.900]   - Oh, the deep freeze is sort of out beyond Neptune.
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.140]   There's this thing called the Kuiper Belt,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:03.580]   and it consists of a bunch of dirty ice balls
[00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.820]   or icy dirt balls.
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.740]   It's the source of the comets
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:08.780]   that occasionally come close to the sun.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:11.660]   And then there's a even bigger area
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:13.020]   called the scattered disk,
[00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:14.540]   which is sort of a big donut
[00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.580]   surrounding the solar system way out there
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.780]   from which other comets come.
[00:21:17.780 --> 00:21:19.460]   And then there's the Oort cloud,
[00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:24.460]   W-O-O-R-T after Jan Oort, a Dutch astrophysicist.
[00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:29.020]   And it's the better part of a light year away from the sun.
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:31.980]   So a good fraction of the distance to the nearest star,
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:34.300]   but that's like a trillion or 10 trillion
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:38.420]   comet-like objects that occasionally get disturbed
[00:21:38.420 --> 00:21:39.980]   by a passing star or whatever.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:41.980]   And most of them go flying out of the solar system,
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.380]   but some go toward the sun.
[00:21:44.380 --> 00:21:46.900]   And they come in with little warning.
[00:21:46.900 --> 00:21:49.900]   By the time we can see them,
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:53.060]   they're only a year or two away from us.
[00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:55.500]   And moreover, not only is it hard
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:59.180]   to determine their trajectories sufficiently accurately
[00:21:59.180 --> 00:22:01.940]   to know whether they'll hit a tiny thing like Earth,
[00:22:01.940 --> 00:22:06.940]   but outgassing from the comet of gases,
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:08.780]   when the ices sublimate,
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:12.260]   that outgassing can change the trajectory
[00:22:12.260 --> 00:22:14.420]   just because of conservation of momentum, right?
[00:22:14.420 --> 00:22:15.580]   It's the rocket effect.
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:17.380]   Gases go out in one direction,
[00:22:17.380 --> 00:22:18.980]   the object moves in the other direction.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:22.420]   And so since we can't predict how much outgassing
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:25.020]   there will be and in exactly what direction,
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:28.020]   because these things are tumbling and rotating and stuff,
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:30.500]   it's hard to predict the trajectory
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:33.180]   with sufficient accuracy to know that it will hit.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.680]   And you certainly don't want to deflect a comet
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.340]   that would have missed,
[00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:41.900]   but you thought it was gonna hit and end up having it hit.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:44.940]   That would be like the ultimate Charlie Brown, you know,
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:47.180]   goat instead of trying to be the hero, right?
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.380]   He ended up being the goat.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:52.260]   - What would you do if,
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:56.000]   it seemed like in a matter of months
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.900]   that there is some non-zero probability,
[00:22:58.900 --> 00:23:02.340]   maybe a high probability that there would be a collision?
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:04.260]   So from a scientific perspective,
[00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.820]   from an engineering perspective,
[00:23:05.820 --> 00:23:08.020]   I imagine you would actually be in the room
[00:23:08.020 --> 00:23:10.340]   of people deciding what to do.
[00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:12.620]   What, philosophically too.
[00:23:12.620 --> 00:23:13.540]   - It's a tough one, right?
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.980]   Because if you only have a few months,
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:19.240]   that's not much time in which to deflect it.
[00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:24.240]   Early detection and early action are key
[00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:26.700]   'cause when it's far away,
[00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:30.220]   you only have to deflect it by a tiny little angle.
[00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:31.940]   And then by the time it reaches us,
[00:23:31.940 --> 00:23:36.100]   the perpendicular motion is big enough to, you know,
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:37.060]   to miss Earth.
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.340]   All you need is one radius
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:40.260]   or one diameter of the Earth, right?
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:43.380]   That actually means that all you would need to do
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:48.180]   is slow it down so it arrives four minutes later
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:50.940]   or speed it up so it arrives four minutes earlier
[00:23:50.940 --> 00:23:55.940]   and Earth will have moved through one radius in that time.
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.240]   So it doesn't take much,
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:24:00.300]   but you can imagine if a thing is about to hit you,
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:03.460]   you have to deflect it 90 degrees or more, right?
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.020]   You know, and you don't have much time to do so
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.820]   and you have to slow it down or speed it up a lot
[00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:09.140]   if that's what you're trying to do to it.
[00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:12.300]   And so decades is sufficient time,
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:14.540]   but months is not sufficient time.
[00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.780]   So at that point, I would think the name of the game
[00:24:18.780 --> 00:24:21.240]   would be to try to predict where it would hit.
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:25.120]   And if it's in a heavily populated region,
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:31.560]   try to start an orderly evacuation perhaps.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.940]   But you know, that might cause just so much panic
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.860]   that I'm, how would you do it with New York City
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:41.380]   or Los Angeles or something like that, right?
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:43.940]   - I might have a different opinion a year ago.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:48.940]   I'm a bit disheartened by, you know, in the movies,
[00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:53.120]   there's always extreme competence from the government.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.420]   - Competence, yeah.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:56.260]   - Competence, yeah.
[00:24:56.260 --> 00:24:58.900]   - Right, but we expect extreme incompetence,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:24:59.740]   if anything, right?
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.100]   - Yes, now, so I'm quite disappointed.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.100]   But sort of from a medical perspective,
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:07.580]   I think you're saying there in a scientific one,
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.940]   it's almost better to get better and better,
[00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:13.140]   maybe telescopes and data collection
[00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:15.500]   to be able to predict the movement of these things
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:17.980]   or like come up with totally new technologies.
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:21.460]   Like you can imagine actually sending out
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.100]   like probes out there to be able to sort of almost
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.260]   have little finger sensors throughout our solar system
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:29.820]   to be able to detect stuff.
[00:25:29.820 --> 00:25:30.660]   - Well, that's right.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:33.020]   Yeah, monitoring the asteroid belt is very important.
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.420]   99% of the so-called near-Earth objects
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:39.220]   ultimately come from the asteroid belt.
[00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.180]   And so there we can track the trajectories.
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.380]   And even if there's, you know, a close encounter
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.420]   between two asteroids,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.100]   which deflects one of them toward Earth,
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:49.660]   it's unlikely to be on a collision course with Earth
[00:25:49.660 --> 00:25:50.980]   in the immediate future.
[00:25:50.980 --> 00:25:53.280]   It's more like, you know, tens of years.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.780]   So that gives us time.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:58.060]   But we would need to improve our ability
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:01.020]   to detect the objects that come in from a great distance.
[00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:04.060]   Unfortunately, those are much rarer.
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:07.700]   The comets come in, you know, 1% of the collisions
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.260]   perhaps are with comets that come in
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.220]   without any warning, Harvey.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.780]   And so that might be more like, you know,
[00:26:18.780 --> 00:26:21.840]   a billion or 2 billion years before one of those hits us.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:26.900]   So maybe we have to worry about the sun getting brighter
[00:26:26.900 --> 00:26:28.340]   on that time scale.
[00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:29.940]   I mean, there's the possibility
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:33.380]   that a star will explode near us
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.540]   in the next couple of billion years.
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:40.540]   But over the course of the history of life on Earth,
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:45.900]   the estimates are that maybe only one
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:50.180]   of the mass extinctions, you know,
[00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:54.020]   was caused by a star blowing up in particular,
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.300]   a special kind called a gamma ray burst.
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:01.300]   And I think it's the Ordovician-Sulurian extinction,
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:06.260]   420 or so, 440 million years ago,
[00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.820]   that is speculated to have come from one of these
[00:27:08.820 --> 00:27:12.140]   particular types of exploding stars called gamma ray bursts.
[00:27:12.140 --> 00:27:15.500]   But even there, the evidence is circumstantial.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   So those kinds of existential threats are reasonably rare.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:25.700]   The greater danger I think is civilization changing events.
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:29.620]   Where it's a much smaller asteroid,
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.740]   which those are harder to detect.
[00:27:31.740 --> 00:27:36.740]   Or a giant solar flare that shorts out the grid
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.300]   in all of North America, let's say.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:44.100]   Now, you know, astronomers are monitoring the sun 24/7
[00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:45.300]   with various satellites.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:48.180]   And we can tell when there's a flare
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:50.460]   or a coronal mass ejection.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.380]   And we can tell that in a day or two,
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:55.940]   a giant bundle of energetic particles will arrive
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:58.020]   and twang the magnetic field of earth
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:27:59.300]   and send all kinds of currents
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:01.220]   through long distance power lines.
[00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:04.380]   And that's what shorts out the transformers.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:07.460]   And transformers are, you know, expensive
[00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.900]   and hard to replace and hard to transport
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:10.740]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:14.780]   So if we can warn the power companies
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:16.500]   and they can shut down the grid
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.580]   before the big bundle of particle hits,
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.300]   then we will have mitigated much of this.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:23.980]   Now for a big enough bundle of particles,
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.100]   you can get short circuits even over small distance scales.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.380]   So not everything will be saved,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.540]   but at least the whole grid might not go out.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:35.500]   So again, you know, astronomers,
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:38.740]   I like to say support your local astronomer.
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:41.380]   They may help someday save humanity
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.100]   by telling the power companies to shut down the grid,
[00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:49.020]   finding the asteroid 50 or a hundred years before it hits,
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:52.180]   then having clever physicists and engineers deflect it.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:55.580]   So many of these cosmic threats,
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:57.060]   cosmic existential threats,
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:01.500]   we can actually predict and do something about
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.220]   or observe before they hit and do something about.
[00:29:05.220 --> 00:29:07.420]   So, you know. - It's terrifying
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.820]   to think that people would listen to this conversation.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.260]   It's like when you listen to Bill Gates
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:15.660]   talk about pandemics in his TED Talk a few years ago
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.780]   and realizing we should have supported
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.180]   our local astronomer more.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.580]   - Well, I don't know whether it's more,
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.260]   because as I said, I actually think human-induced threats
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.300]   or things that occur naturally on Earth,
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.940]   either a natural pandemic
[00:29:28.940 --> 00:29:32.100]   or perhaps, you know, a bioengineering type pandemic
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.980]   or, you know, something like a super volcano, right?
[00:29:34.980 --> 00:29:37.860]   There was one event, Toba,
[00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:41.700]   I think it was 70 plus thousand years ago
[00:29:41.700 --> 00:29:46.020]   that caused a gigantic decrease in temperatures on Earth
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.020]   because it sent up so much soot that it blocked the sun, right?
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:53.620]   It's the nuclear winter type disaster scenario
[00:29:53.620 --> 00:29:55.260]   that some people, including Carl Sagan,
[00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:57.100]   talked about decades ago.
[00:29:57.100 --> 00:30:00.340]   But we can see in the history of volcanic eruptions,
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:02.180]   even more recently in the 19th century,
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:03.700]   Tambora and other ones,
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.260]   you look at the record
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:08.900]   and you see rather large dips in temperature
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.060]   associated with massive volcanic eruptions.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:13.860]   Well, these super volcanoes,
[00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.860]   one of which, by the way, exists under Yellowstone,
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.060]   you know, in the central US.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.500]   I mean, it's not just one or two states,
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.540]   it's a gigantic region.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:27.780]   And there's controversy as to whether it's likely to blow
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.780]   anytime in the next hundred thousand years or so.
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.460]   But that would be perhaps not a mass extinction
[00:30:33.460 --> 00:30:34.860]   'cause you really need to,
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.180]   or perhaps not a complete existential threat
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:38.700]   because you have to get rid of
[00:30:38.700 --> 00:30:41.460]   sort of the very last humans for that.
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.460]   But at least getting rid of,
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:45.940]   you know, killing off so many humans,
[00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:48.300]   truly billions and billions of humans.
[00:30:48.300 --> 00:30:50.420]   The one, there have been ones
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.180]   tens of thousands of years ago,
[00:30:53.180 --> 00:30:57.180]   including this one, Toba I think it's called,
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:30:59.940]   where it's estimated that the human population
[00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.700]   was down to 10,000 or 5,000 individuals,
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:05.060]   something like that, right?
[00:31:05.060 --> 00:31:08.220]   If you have a 15 degree drop in temperature
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.380]   over quite a short time,
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.780]   it's not clear that even with today's advanced technology,
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:15.740]   we would be able to adequately respond,
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:18.100]   at least for the vast majority of people.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:20.500]   Maybe some would be in these underground caves
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.620]   where you'd keep the president
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:24.020]   and a bunch of other important people, you know,
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.380]   but the typical person is not gonna be protected
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:31.420]   when all of agriculture is cut off, right?
[00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:32.900]   And when- - It could be hundreds
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:36.820]   of millions or billions of people starving to death.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.100]   - Exactly, that's right.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.420]   They don't all die immediately,
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.620]   but they use up their supplies,
[00:31:42.620 --> 00:31:44.180]   or again, this electrical grid.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.620]   - First of toilet paper.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:49.060]   - There you go, dash that toilet paper, you know,
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:50.100]   or the electrical grid.
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:54.260]   I mean, imagine North America without power for a year,
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:56.460]   right, I mean, we've become so dependent.
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.180]   We're no longer the cave people.
[00:31:58.180 --> 00:32:00.140]   They would do just fine, right?
[00:32:00.140 --> 00:32:02.420]   What do they care about the electrical grid, right?
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.140]   What do they care about agriculture?
[00:32:04.140 --> 00:32:05.900]   They're hunters and gatherers,
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:10.540]   but we now have become so used to our way of life
[00:32:10.540 --> 00:32:12.820]   that the only real survivors would be
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:14.940]   those rugged individualists who live somewhere
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:17.140]   out in the forest or in a cave somewhere,
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:20.380]   completely independent of anyone else.
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:22.380]   - Yeah, I've recently, I recommend it.
[00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:25.780]   It's totally new to me, this kind of survivalist folks,
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:28.900]   but there's a few shows, there's a lot of shows of those,
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:32.780]   but I saw one on Netflix and I started watching them,
[00:32:32.780 --> 00:32:36.660]   and they make a lot of sense.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:40.620]   They reveal to you how dependent we are
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.820]   on all aspects of this beautiful systems
[00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:44.060]   we human have built.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:44.900]   - Right.
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:46.780]   - And how fragile they are.
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:48.220]   - Incredibly fragile.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:51.980]   - And this whole conversation is making me realize
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.140]   how lucky we are.
[00:32:53.140 --> 00:32:54.580]   - Oh, we're incredibly lucky,
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:58.300]   but we've set ourselves up to be very, very fragile,
[00:32:58.300 --> 00:33:03.020]   and we are intrinsically complex biological creatures
[00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:06.420]   that, except for the fact that we have brains and minds
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.980]   with which we can try to prevent some of these things
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:14.300]   or respond to them, we as a living organism
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.500]   require quite a narrow set of conditions
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:18.660]   in order to survive.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:20.220]   We're not cockroaches.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.240]   We're not gonna survive a nuclear war.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:26.780]   - So we're kind of, there's this beautiful dance between,
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:28.900]   we've been talking about astronomy,
[00:33:28.900 --> 00:33:33.900]   that astronomy, the stars, inspires everybody.
[00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.820]   And at the same time, there's this pragmatic aspect
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.900]   that we're talking about.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.900]   And so I see space exploration as the same kind of way,
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.420]   that it's reaching out to other planets,
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.580]   reaching out to the stars, this really beautiful idea.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:51.900]   But if you listen to somebody like Elon Musk,
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:56.700]   he talks about space exploration as very pragmatic,
[00:33:56.700 --> 00:34:01.180]   like we have to be, (laughs)
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.700]   he has this ridiculous way of sounding
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.300]   like an engineer about it, which is like,
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.340]   it's obvious we need to become a multi-planetary species
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.440]   if we were to survive long-term.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:15.440]   So maybe both philosophically, in terms of beauty,
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.260]   and in terms of practical,
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:21.180]   what's your thoughts on space exploration,
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.420]   on the challenges of it,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.820]   on how much we should be investing in it,
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:27.620]   and on a personal level, how excited you are
[00:34:27.620 --> 00:34:32.060]   by the possibility of going to Mars, colonizing Mars,
[00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:34.660]   and maybe going outside the solar system?
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.480]   - Yeah, great question.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.340]   There's a lot to unpack there, of course.
[00:34:39.340 --> 00:34:40.860]   - Sorry, sorry. (laughs)
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:44.440]   - Humans are, by their very nature, explorers, pioneers.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.940]   They wanna go out, climb the next mountain,
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:51.060]   see what's behind it, explore the ocean depths,
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.400]   explore space.
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.220]   This is our destiny, to go out there,
[00:34:54.220 --> 00:34:57.900]   and of course, from a pragmatic perspective,
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:35:02.780]   yes, we need to plant our seeds elsewhere, really,
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:05.460]   because things could go wrong here on Earth.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:09.320]   Now, some people say that's an excuse
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.220]   to not take care of our planet.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.380]   Well, we say we're elsewhere,
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.260]   and so we don't have to take good care of our planet.
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:18.140]   No, we should take the best possible care of our planet.
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.820]   We should be cognizant of the potential impact
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:21.940]   of what we're doing.
[00:35:21.940 --> 00:35:26.740]   Nevertheless, it's prudent to have us be elsewhere as well.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:29.780]   So in that regard, I actually agree with Elon.
[00:35:29.780 --> 00:35:32.380]   It'd be good to be on Mars.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.060]   That would be yet another place for us to,
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.100]   from which to explore still further.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:39.580]   - Would that be a good next step?
[00:35:39.580 --> 00:35:41.300]   - Well, it's a good next step.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:43.500]   I happen to disagree with him
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:45.860]   as to how quickly it will happen.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.060]   Right, I mean, I think he's very optimistic.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.660]   Now, you need visionary people like Elon
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:52.740]   to get people going and to inspire them.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:55.780]   I mean, look at the success he's had with multiple companies.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:36:00.180]   So maybe he gives this very optimistic timeline
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.580]   in order to be inspirational to those
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.220]   who are going out there.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.740]   And certainly his success with the rocket that is reusable,
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:10.460]   'cause it landed upright and all that.
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:12.700]   I mean, that's a game changer.
[00:36:12.700 --> 00:36:14.260]   It's sort of like every time you flew
[00:36:14.260 --> 00:36:16.300]   from San Francisco to Los Angeles,
[00:36:16.300 --> 00:36:18.020]   you discard the airplane, right?
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:20.140]   I mean, that's crazy, right?
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:21.700]   So that's a game changer.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.060]   But nevertheless, the timescale over which he thinks
[00:36:25.060 --> 00:36:28.140]   that there could be a real thriving colony on Mars,
[00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:30.540]   I think is far too optimistic.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:32.860]   - What's the biggest challenges to you?
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:35.700]   One is just getting rockets, not rockets,
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:39.180]   but people out there, and two is the colonization.
[00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:40.260]   - Yeah.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.620]   - Do you have thoughts about this,
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:44.540]   the challenges of this kind of prospect?
[00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:47.540]   - Yeah, I haven't thought about it in great detail
[00:36:47.540 --> 00:36:51.540]   other than recognizing that Mars is a harsh environment.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:53.300]   You don't have much of an atmosphere there.
[00:36:53.300 --> 00:36:56.020]   You've got less than a percent of Earth's atmosphere.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:59.700]   So you'd need to build some sort of a dome right away,
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:02.180]   right, and that would take time.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:05.460]   You need to melt the water that's in the permafrost
[00:37:05.460 --> 00:37:09.500]   or have canals dug from which you transport it
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.820]   from the polar ice caps.
[00:37:11.820 --> 00:37:14.620]   - You know, I was reading recently in terms of like,
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.220]   what's the most efficient source of nutrition
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:20.180]   for humans that were to live on Mars,
[00:37:20.180 --> 00:37:21.660]   and people should look into this,
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:23.540]   but it turns out to be insects.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:25.020]   - Insects, yeah.
[00:37:25.020 --> 00:37:28.740]   - So you wanna build giant colonies of insects
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:29.580]   and just be eating them.
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:30.940]   - Yeah, insects have a lot of protein, right?
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.140]   - Yeah, a lot of protein, and they're easy to grow.
[00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:36.180]   Like, you can think of them as farming.
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:39.180]   - Right, but it's not gonna be as easy
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.300]   as growing a whole plot of potatoes
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:44.100]   like in the movie "The Martian," you know, or something.
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.260]   - It's not gonna be that easy, but you know,
[00:37:46.260 --> 00:37:48.340]   so there's this thin atmosphere.
[00:37:48.340 --> 00:37:49.580]   It's got the wrong composition.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.700]   It's mostly carbon dioxide.
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:54.740]   There are these violent dust storms.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:57.700]   The temperatures are generally cold.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:59.340]   You know, you'd need to do a lot of things.
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.180]   You need to terraform it, basically,
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:03.300]   in order to make it nicely livable
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:05.820]   without some dome surrounding you,
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.460]   and if you insist on a dome,
[00:38:08.460 --> 00:38:11.220]   well, that's not gonna house that many people, right?
[00:38:12.380 --> 00:38:14.820]   - So let's look briefly, then.
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:18.540]   We're looking for a new apartment to move into,
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:20.620]   so let's look outside the solar system.
[00:38:20.620 --> 00:38:25.180]   Do you think, you've spoken about exoplanets as well.
[00:38:25.180 --> 00:38:29.740]   Do you think there's possible homes out there for us
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:31.780]   outside of our solar system?
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:34.580]   - There are lots and lots of homes, possible homes.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:37.540]   I mean, there's a planetary system
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:40.300]   around nearly every star you see in the sky,
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.860]   and one in five of those is thought to have
[00:38:42.860 --> 00:38:45.820]   a roughly Earth-like planet.
[00:38:45.820 --> 00:38:47.380]   - And that's a relatively new--
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.300]   - Yeah, it's a new discovery.
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:49.860]   I mean, the Kepler satellite,
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:52.940]   which was flying around above Earth's atmosphere,
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:38:55.260]   was able to monitor the brightness of stars
[00:38:55.260 --> 00:38:57.060]   with exquisite detail,
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.420]   and they could detect planets crossing the line of sight
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:03.580]   between us and the star,
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:06.500]   thereby dimming its light for a short time,
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.220]   ever so slightly, and it's amazing.
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:11.260]   So there are now thousands and thousands
[00:39:11.260 --> 00:39:13.180]   of these exoplanet candidates,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:17.140]   of which something like 90% are probably genuine exoplanets.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:22.140]   And you have to remember that only about 1% of stars
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.140]   have their planetary system oriented
[00:39:25.140 --> 00:39:27.300]   edge-on to your line of sight,
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:31.260]   which is what you need for this transit method to work.
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:33.420]   Some arbitrary angle won't work,
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:36.100]   and certainly perpendicular to your line of sight,
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.020]   that is in the plane of the sky won't work
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.860]   because the planet is orbiting the star
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:43.580]   and never crossing your line of sight.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:48.220]   So the fact that they found planets orbiting
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:51.260]   about 1% of the stars that they looked at
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:54.740]   in this field of 150-plus thousand stars,
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:39:57.620]   they found planets around 1%,
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.940]   you then multiply by the inverse of 1%,
[00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.620]   which is, you know, right?
[00:40:02.620 --> 00:40:06.900]   1% is about how many, what, the fraction of the stars
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:10.580]   that have their planetary system oriented the right way.
[00:40:10.580 --> 00:40:13.380]   And that already, back of the envelope calculation,
[00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:17.300]   tells you that of order, 50 to 100% of all stars
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.180]   have planets, okay?
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:20.620]   And then they've been finding these earth-like planets,
[00:40:20.620 --> 00:40:21.660]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:23.740]   So there are many potential homes.
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.540]   The problem is getting there, okay?
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:30.300]   So then a typical bright star, Sirius,
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.900]   the brightest star in the sky,
[00:40:31.900 --> 00:40:33.220]   maybe not a typical bright star,
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.460]   but it's 8.7 light years away, okay?
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:42.460]   So that means the light took 8.7 years to reach us.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:47.340]   We're seeing it as it was about nine years ago, okay?
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:49.300]   So then, you know, you ask,
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.300]   how long would a rocket take to get there
[00:40:52.300 --> 00:40:56.860]   at Earth's escape speed, which is 11 kilometers per second?
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:59.580]   Okay, and it turns out it's about a quarter
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:01.420]   of a million years, okay?
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.940]   Now that's 10,000 generations, okay?
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.260]   Let's say a generation of humans is 25 years, right?
[00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.860]   So you'd need this colony of people
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:14.540]   that is able to sustain itself, all their food,
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:16.860]   all their waste disposal, all their water,
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:18.540]   all their recycling of everything.
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:22.220]   For 10,000 generations, they have to commit themselves
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:25.780]   to living on this vehicle, right?
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.740]   I just don't see it happening.
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:31.100]   What I see potentially happening,
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:33.020]   if we avoid self-destruction,
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:36.100]   intentional or unintentional here on Earth,
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.860]   is that machines will do it,
[00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.900]   robots that can essentially hibernate.
[00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:42.660]   They don't need to do much of anything
[00:41:42.660 --> 00:41:44.580]   for a long, long time as they're traveling.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:47.460]   And moreover, if some energetic charged particle,
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:51.500]   some cosmic ray hits the circuitry, it fixes itself, right?
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:52.740]   Machines can do this.
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:57.900]   I mean, it's a form of artificial intelligence.
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:42:00.020]   You just tell the thing, fix yourself, basically.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:02.660]   And then when you land on the planet,
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:04.900]   start producing copies of yourself,
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:07.980]   initially from materials that were perhaps sent,
[00:42:07.980 --> 00:42:10.020]   or you just have a bunch of copies there.
[00:42:10.020 --> 00:42:13.460]   And then they set up factories with which to do this.
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.060]   I mean, this is very, very futuristic,
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.380]   but it's much more feasible, I think,
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:24.380]   than sending flesh and blood over interstellar distances,
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:28.340]   a quarter of a million years to even the nearest stars.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:30.980]   You're subject to all kinds of charged particles
[00:42:30.980 --> 00:42:32.100]   and radiation.
[00:42:32.100 --> 00:42:34.260]   You have to shield yourself really well.
[00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.620]   That's, by the way, one of the problems of going to Mars
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:39.900]   is that it's not a three-day journey like going to the moon.
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:43.220]   You're out there for the better part of a year or two,
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:46.780]   and you're exposed to lots of radiation,
[00:42:46.780 --> 00:42:51.420]   which typically doesn't do well with living tissue, right?
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.420]   Or living tissue doesn't do well with the radiation, okay?
[00:42:54.420 --> 00:42:58.540]   - And the hope is that the robots, the AI systems
[00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:03.540]   might be able to carry the fire of consciousness,
[00:43:03.540 --> 00:43:07.700]   whatever makes us humans,
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.980]   like a little drop of whatever makes us humans so special,
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.700]   not to be too poetic about it.
[00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:14.580]   - No, but I like being poetic about it,
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.420]   because it's an amazing question.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:20.420]   Is there something beyond just the bits,
[00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:22.300]   the ones and zeros to us?
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:23.740]   It's an interesting question.
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.300]   I like to think that there isn't anything,
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:29.460]   and that how beautiful it is that our thoughts,
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:31.780]   our emotions, our feelings, our compassion
[00:43:31.780 --> 00:43:35.700]   all come from these ones and zeros, right?
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:38.580]   That, to me, actually is a beautiful thought.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:43.300]   And the idea that machines, silicon-based life, effectively,
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:46.380]   could be our natural evolutionary descendants,
[00:43:46.380 --> 00:43:49.820]   not from a DNA perspective, but they are our creations,
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.860]   and they then carry on.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:54.180]   That, to me, is a beautiful thought in some ways,
[00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:56.700]   but others find it to be a horrific thought, right?
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.380]   - So that's exciting to you.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.260]   It is exciting to me as well,
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.380]   because to me, from purely an engineering perspective,
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:07.900]   I believe it's impossible to create,
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:12.700]   like whatever systems we create that take over the world,
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.460]   it's impossible for me to imagine that those systems
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:19.740]   will not carry some aspect of what makes humans beautiful.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:23.500]   So a lot of people have these kind of paperclip ideas
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.180]   that we'll build machines that are cold inside,
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:29.220]   or philosophers call them zombies,
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:35.940]   that naturally the systems that will out-compete us
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:40.940]   on this earth will be cold and non-conscious,
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.980]   not capable of all the human emotions
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:48.660]   and empathy and compassion and love and hate.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:52.980]   The beautiful mix of what makes us human.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:56.460]   But to me, intelligence requires all of that.
[00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:59.020]   So in order to out-compete humans,
[00:44:59.020 --> 00:45:02.020]   you better be good at the full picture.
[00:45:02.020 --> 00:45:05.420]   - Right, so artificial general intelligence, in my view,
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   encompasses a lot of these attributes
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:09.740]   that you just talked about.
[00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:11.740]   - Yeah, I tend to-- - Like curiosity,
[00:45:11.740 --> 00:45:13.500]   inquisitiveness, you know, right?
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.700]   - It might look very different than us humans,
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:17.740]   but it will have some of the magic.
[00:45:17.740 --> 00:45:21.460]   But it'll also be much more able to survive
[00:45:21.460 --> 00:45:23.980]   the onslaught of existential threats
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.180]   that either we bring upon ourselves
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:28.180]   or don't anticipate here on earth,
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:30.660]   or that occasionally come from beyond.
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.740]   And there's nothing much we can do
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:35.020]   about a supernova explosion that just suddenly goes off.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:38.460]   And really, if we wanna move to other planets
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.460]   outside our solar system, I think realistically,
[00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.460]   that's a much better option than thinking
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:48.460]   that humans will actually make these gigantic journeys.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.740]   And, you know, then I do this calculation for my class.
[00:45:51.740 --> 00:45:54.180]   You know, Einstein's special theory of relativity
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:56.740]   says that you can do it in a short amount of time
[00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:58.220]   in your own frame of reference
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:00.460]   if you go close to the speed of light.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:02.980]   But then you bring in E equals mc squared,
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.660]   and you figure out how much energy it takes
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.620]   to get you accelerated to close enough
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:11.780]   to the speed of light to make the time scale short
[00:46:11.780 --> 00:46:13.780]   in your own frame of reference.
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:17.300]   And the amount of energy is just unfathomable, right?
[00:46:17.300 --> 00:46:21.180]   We can do it at the Large Hadron Collider with protons.
[00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:24.460]   You know, we can accelerate them to 99.9999%
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:27.420]   of the speed of light, but that's just a proton.
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:29.660]   We're gazillions of protons, okay?
[00:46:29.660 --> 00:46:31.580]   And that doesn't even count the rocket
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.780]   that would carry us the payload.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.580]   And you would need to either store the fuel in the rocket,
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.380]   which then requires even more mass for the rocket,
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.500]   or collect fuel along the way,
[00:46:43.500 --> 00:46:44.820]   which is difficult.
[00:46:44.820 --> 00:46:47.820]   And so getting close to the speed of light, I think,
[00:46:47.820 --> 00:46:49.460]   is not an option either,
[00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.140]   other than for a little tiny thing like,
[00:46:52.140 --> 00:46:54.100]   Yuri Milner and others are thinking about
[00:46:54.100 --> 00:46:56.180]   this star shot project
[00:46:56.180 --> 00:46:58.220]   where they'll send a little tiny camera
[00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:00.940]   to Alpha Centauri 4.2 light years away.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.300]   They'll zip past it,
[00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.540]   take a picture of the exoplanets that we know orbit
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.380]   that three or more star system, and-
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.220]   - Say hello real quick. - Say hello real quickly,
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:12.620]   and then send the images back to us, okay?
[00:47:12.620 --> 00:47:14.700]   So that's a tiny little thing, right?
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:16.980]   Maybe you can accelerate that to,
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:19.540]   they're hoping 20% of the speed of light
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:22.620]   with a whole bunch of high-powered lasers aimed at it.
[00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:23.980]   It's not clear that other countries
[00:47:23.980 --> 00:47:25.940]   will allow us to do that, by the way.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:27.460]   But that's a very forward-looking thought.
[00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:29.860]   I mean, I very much support the idea,
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:30.980]   but there's a big difference
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:33.140]   between sending a little tiny camera
[00:47:33.140 --> 00:47:36.580]   and sending a payload of people with equipment
[00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:41.580]   that could then mine the resources on the exoplanet
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.260]   that they reach and then go forth and multiply, right?
[00:47:46.260 --> 00:47:49.460]   - Well, let's talk about the big galactic things
[00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:52.900]   and how we might be able to leverage them to travel fast.
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:54.820]   I know this is a little bit science fiction,
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:59.820]   but ideas of wormholes and ideas at the edge of black holes
[00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:08.140]   that reveal to us that this fabric of space-time
[00:48:08.140 --> 00:48:11.860]   could be messed with.
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:12.700]   - Yeah.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:16.900]   - Perhaps, is that at all an interesting thing for you?
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:20.060]   I mean, in looking out at the universe
[00:48:20.060 --> 00:48:21.980]   and studying it as you have,
[00:48:21.980 --> 00:48:26.580]   is that also a possible, like a dream for you
[00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:28.100]   that we might be able to find clues
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:31.420]   how we can actually use it to improve our transportation?
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:32.540]   - It's an interesting thought.
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.820]   I'm certainly excited by the potential physics
[00:48:36.820 --> 00:48:40.860]   that suggests this kind of faster-than-light travel
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:44.060]   effectively or cutting the distance
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.900]   to make it very, very short through a wormhole
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:47.860]   or something like that.
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:48.780]   - Possible? No?
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:51.100]   - Well, call me not very imaginative,
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:53.940]   but based on today's knowledge of physics,
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:48:56.780]   which I realize people have gone down that rabbit hole.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:59.620]   And a century ago, Lord Kelvin,
[00:48:59.620 --> 00:49:01.540]   one of the greatest physicists of all time,
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.740]   said that all of fundamental physics is done.
[00:49:04.740 --> 00:49:06.140]   The rest is just engineering.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:07.140]   And guess what?
[00:49:07.140 --> 00:49:09.820]   Then came special relativity, quantum physics,
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:12.260]   general relativity, how wrong he was.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.980]   So let me not be another Lord Kelvin.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:18.420]   On the other hand, I think we know a lot more now
[00:49:18.420 --> 00:49:20.540]   about what we know and what we don't know
[00:49:20.540 --> 00:49:23.100]   and what the physical limitations are.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:26.620]   And to me, most of these schemes, if not all of them,
[00:49:26.620 --> 00:49:30.140]   seem very far-fetched, if not impossible.
[00:49:30.140 --> 00:49:33.220]   So travel through wormholes, for example.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:37.420]   You know, it appears that for a non-rotating black hole,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:39.620]   that's just a complete no-go
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.620]   because the singularity is a point-like singularity
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:46.060]   and you have to reach it to traverse the wormhole
[00:49:46.060 --> 00:49:49.540]   and you get squished by the singularity, okay?
[00:49:49.540 --> 00:49:51.300]   Now, for a rotating black hole,
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:53.740]   it turns out there is a way to pass through
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:56.780]   the event horizon, the boundary of the black hole,
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:50:00.020]   and avoid the singularity and go out the other side
[00:50:00.020 --> 00:50:04.140]   or even traverse the donut hole-like singularity.
[00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:05.500]   In the case of a rotating black hole,
[00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:06.780]   it's a ring singularity.
[00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.860]   So there's actually two theoretical ways
[00:50:08.860 --> 00:50:11.260]   you could get through a rotating black hole
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:12.940]   or a charged black hole,
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.980]   not that we expect charged black holes to exist in nature
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:19.060]   because they would quickly bring in the opposite charge
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:20.900]   so as to neutralize themselves.
[00:50:20.900 --> 00:50:23.340]   But rotating black holes, definitely a reality.
[00:50:23.340 --> 00:50:25.580]   We now have good evidence for them.
[00:50:25.580 --> 00:50:28.620]   Do they have traversable wormholes?
[00:50:28.620 --> 00:50:31.220]   Probably not because it's still the case
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:34.860]   that when you go in, you go in with so much energy
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:39.460]   that it either squeezes the wormhole shut
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:42.460]   or you encounter a whole bunch of incoming
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:46.020]   and outgoing energy that vaporizes you.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:48.420]   It's called the mass inflation instability
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.780]   and it just sort of vaporizes you.
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.300]   Nevertheless, you could imagine,
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:53.740]   well, you're in some vapor form,
[00:50:53.740 --> 00:50:54.860]   but if you make it through,
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:50:58.180]   maybe you could reform or something.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.380]   - So it's still information.
[00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:00.420]   - Yeah, it's still information.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:01.620]   It's scrambled information,
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:04.420]   but there's a way maybe of bringing it back, right?
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:07.620]   But then the thing that really bothers me
[00:51:07.620 --> 00:51:11.820]   is that as soon as you have this possibility
[00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:13.780]   of traversal of a wormhole,
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:16.500]   you have to come to grips with a fundamental problem.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:20.300]   And that is that you could come back to your universe
[00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:23.500]   at a time prior to your leaving
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.260]   and you could essentially prevent your grandparents
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:27.420]   from ever meeting.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:29.380]   This is called the grandfather paradox, right?
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.940]   And if they never met and if your parents were never born
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:33.780]   and if you were never born,
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:37.140]   how would you have made the journey
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:42.140]   to prevent the history from allowing you to exist, right?
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:48.100]   It's a violation of causality of cause and effect.
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:49.980]   Now, physicists such as myself
[00:51:49.980 --> 00:51:54.620]   take causality violation very, very seriously.
[00:51:54.620 --> 00:51:55.620]   We've never seen it.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:56.660]   - You took a stand.
[00:51:56.660 --> 00:51:59.460]   - Yeah, I mean, it's one of these, right,
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:01.460]   back to the future type movies, right?
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:04.020]   And you have to work things out in such a way
[00:52:04.020 --> 00:52:06.500]   that you don't mess things up, right?
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.020]   Some people say that, well, you come back to the universe,
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:10.900]   but you come back in such a way
[00:52:10.900 --> 00:52:13.980]   that you cannot affect your journey.
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:19.140]   But then, I mean, that seems kind of contrived to me.
[00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:21.900]   Or some say that you end up in a different universe.
[00:52:21.900 --> 00:52:25.420]   And this also goes into the many different types
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.020]   of the multiverse hypothesis
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:29.220]   and the many worlds interpretation and all that.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:31.500]   But again, then it's not the universe
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:33.820]   from which you left, right?
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:36.980]   And you don't come back to the universe from which you left.
[00:52:36.980 --> 00:52:40.420]   And so you're not really going back in time
[00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:42.060]   to the same universe.
[00:52:42.060 --> 00:52:44.300]   And you're not even going forward in time,
[00:52:44.300 --> 00:52:46.580]   necessarily, then, to the same universe, right?
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:48.780]   You're ending up in some other universe.
[00:52:48.780 --> 00:52:52.620]   So what have you achieved, right?
[00:52:52.620 --> 00:52:55.900]   - You've traveled. - You've traveled.
[00:52:55.900 --> 00:52:59.180]   - You ended up in a different place than you started.
[00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:00.780]   - Well- - In more ways than one.
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:03.100]   - Yeah, and then there's this idea,
[00:53:03.100 --> 00:53:04.500]   the Alcubierre drive,
[00:53:04.500 --> 00:53:08.260]   where you warp space-time in front of you
[00:53:08.260 --> 00:53:10.340]   so as to greatly reduce the distance
[00:53:10.340 --> 00:53:12.700]   and you can expand the space-time behind you.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.980]   So you're sort of riding a wave through space-time.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:17.540]   But the problem I see with that,
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.180]   beyond the practical difficulties
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:20.420]   and the energy requirements,
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:23.380]   and by the way, how do you get out of this bubble
[00:53:23.380 --> 00:53:26.540]   through which you're riding this wave of space-time?
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.140]   And Miguel Alcubierre acknowledged all these things.
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.780]   He said, "This is purely theoretical,
[00:53:30.780 --> 00:53:31.780]   "fanciful, and all that."
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:34.220]   But a fundamental problem I see
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:38.300]   is that you'd have to get to those places in front of you
[00:53:38.300 --> 00:53:41.500]   so as to change the shape of space-time
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.620]   so as to make the journey quickly.
[00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:47.620]   But to get there, you got there in the normal way
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:50.620]   at a speed considerably less than that of light.
[00:53:50.620 --> 00:53:53.580]   So in a sense, you haven't saved any time, right?
[00:53:53.580 --> 00:53:56.340]   You might as well have just taken that journey
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:53:58.300]   and gotten to where you were going.
[00:53:59.300 --> 00:54:00.540]   - Yeah, there's-- - Right?
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:01.620]   What have you done?
[00:54:01.620 --> 00:54:03.780]   It's not like you snap your fingers and say,
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:06.340]   "Okay, let that space there be compressed,
[00:54:06.340 --> 00:54:08.620]   "and then I'll make it over to Alpha Centauri
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:09.900]   "in the next month."
[00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:12.420]   You can't snap your fingers and do that.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:15.700]   - Yeah, but we're sort of assuming
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:17.500]   that we can fix all the biological stuff
[00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.580]   that requires for humans to persist
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:22.180]   through that whole process,
[00:54:22.180 --> 00:54:24.300]   because ultimately, it might boil down
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:27.980]   to just extending the life of the human in some form,
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:29.180]   whether it's through the robot,
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:30.900]   through the digital form,
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.300]   or actually just figuring out genetically
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.460]   how to live forever.
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.700]   - That's right. - 'Cause that journey
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:37.540]   that you mentioned, the long journey,
[00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:42.540]   might be different if somehow our understanding of genetics,
[00:54:42.540 --> 00:54:44.740]   of our understanding of our own biology,
[00:54:44.740 --> 00:54:46.860]   all that kind of stuff would,
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:48.700]   that's another trajectory that would possibly--
[00:54:48.700 --> 00:54:51.500]   - If you could put us into some sort of suspended animation,
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:52.860]   you know, hibernation or something,
[00:54:52.860 --> 00:54:55.220]   and greatly increase the lifetime,
[00:54:55.220 --> 00:54:57.740]   and so these 10,000 generations I talked about,
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:54:58.580]   what do they care?
[00:54:58.580 --> 00:55:01.700]   It's just one generation, and they're asleep, okay?
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:04.340]   - Long nap. - So then you can do it.
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:05.500]   It's still not easy, right?
[00:55:05.500 --> 00:55:06.940]   'Cause you've got some big old huge colony,
[00:55:06.940 --> 00:55:09.500]   and that just through E equals MC squared, right?
[00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:13.380]   That's a lot of mass, that's a lot of stuff to accelerate.
[00:55:13.380 --> 00:55:18.020]   The Newtonian kinetic energy is gigantic, right?
[00:55:18.020 --> 00:55:20.140]   So you're still not home free,
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.100]   but at least you're not trying to do it
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:26.060]   in a short amount of clock time, right?
[00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:28.420]   Which if you look at E equals MC squared,
[00:55:28.420 --> 00:55:32.220]   requires truly unfathomable amounts of energy,
[00:55:32.220 --> 00:55:34.420]   because the energy is sort of,
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:37.540]   it's your rest mass, M naught C squared,
[00:55:37.540 --> 00:55:40.740]   divided by the square root of one minus V squared
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:41.980]   over C squared.
[00:55:41.980 --> 00:55:43.740]   And if your listeners wanna just sort of
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:45.700]   stick into their pocket calculator,
[00:55:45.700 --> 00:55:48.900]   as V over C approaches one,
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:51.500]   that one over the square root of one minus V squared
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.060]   over C squared approaches infinity.
[00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:56.580]   So if you wanted to do it in zero time,
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.340]   you'd need an infinite amount of energy.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:01.140]   That's basically why you can't reach,
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:03.460]   let alone exceed the speed of light
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:07.780]   for a particle moving through a preexisting space.
[00:56:07.780 --> 00:56:11.540]   It's that it takes an infinite amount of energy to do so.
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:14.900]   - So that's talking about us going somewhere.
[00:56:14.900 --> 00:56:16.340]   What about,
[00:56:16.340 --> 00:56:20.580]   one of the things that inspires a lot of folks,
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:23.980]   including myself, is the possibility that there's other,
[00:56:23.980 --> 00:56:27.460]   that this conversation is happening on another planet
[00:56:27.460 --> 00:56:31.380]   in different forms with intelligent life forms.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:36.740]   Well, first we could start,
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:41.380]   as a cosmologist, what's your intuition about
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:44.820]   whether there is or isn't intelligent life out there,
[00:56:44.820 --> 00:56:45.900]   outside of our own?
[00:56:45.900 --> 00:56:49.180]   - Yeah, I would say I'm one of the pessimists
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:52.180]   in that I don't necessarily think that we're the only ones
[00:56:52.180 --> 00:56:54.660]   in the observable universe, which goes out
[00:56:54.660 --> 00:56:59.740]   roughly 14 billion years in light travel time
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:01.980]   and more like 46 billion years
[00:57:01.980 --> 00:57:04.180]   when you take into account the expansion of space.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:06.660]   So the diameter of our observable universe
[00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.500]   is something like 90, 92 billion light years.
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:14.500]   That encompasses 100 billion to a trillion galaxies
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.180]   with 100 billion stars each.
[00:57:17.180 --> 00:57:20.020]   So now you're talking about something like 10 to the 22nd,
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:22.540]   10 to the 23rd power stars
[00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.420]   and roughly an equal number of Earth-like planets and so on.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:32.140]   So there may well be other intelligent life.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:35.140]   - But your sense is our galaxy is not teeming with life.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.180]   - Yeah, our galaxy, our Milky Way galaxy
[00:57:37.180 --> 00:57:40.140]   with several hundred billion stars
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.020]   and potentially habitable planets
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:44.100]   is not teeming with intelligent life.
[00:57:44.100 --> 00:57:44.940]   - Intelligent.
[00:57:44.940 --> 00:57:47.300]   - Yeah, I wouldn't, well, I'll get to the primitive life,
[00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:48.540]   the bacteria in a moment.
[00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:53.540]   But we may well be the only ones in our Milky Way galaxy
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:56.820]   at most a handful I'd say,
[00:57:56.820 --> 00:58:00.940]   but I'd probably side with the school of thought
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:04.100]   that suggests we're the only ones in our own galaxy
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:08.540]   just because I don't see human intelligence
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:13.540]   as being a natural evolutionary path for life.
[00:58:13.540 --> 00:58:15.860]   I mean, there's a number of arguments.
[00:58:15.860 --> 00:58:18.660]   First of all, there's been more than 10 billion species
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:21.700]   of life on Earth in its history.
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:25.140]   Nothing has approached our level of intelligence
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.820]   and mechanical ability and curiosity.
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:30.700]   Whales and dolphins appear to be reasonably intelligent,
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:34.060]   but there's no evidence that they can think abstract thoughts
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.340]   that they're curious about the world.
[00:58:35.340 --> 00:58:37.260]   They certainly can't build machines
[00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:38.760]   with which to study the world.
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:40.900]   So that's one argument.
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:45.220]   Secondly, we came about as early hominids
[00:58:45.220 --> 00:58:47.340]   only four or 5 million years ago,
[00:58:47.340 --> 00:58:50.300]   and as Homo sapiens only about a quarter
[00:58:50.300 --> 00:58:52.020]   of a million years ago.
[00:58:52.020 --> 00:58:55.460]   So for the vast majority of the history of life on Earth,
[00:58:55.460 --> 00:58:58.380]   an intelligent alien zipping by Earth would have said,
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.200]   there's nothing particularly intelligent
[00:59:00.200 --> 00:59:03.580]   or mechanically able on Earth, okay?
[00:59:03.580 --> 00:59:07.520]   Thirdly, it's not clear that our intelligence
[00:59:07.520 --> 00:59:10.700]   is a long-term evolutionary advantage.
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:13.460]   Now it's clear that in the last 100 years, 200 years,
[00:59:13.460 --> 00:59:15.420]   we've improved the lives of millions,
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:17.300]   hundreds of millions of people,
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:20.940]   but at the risk of potentially destroying ourselves,
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.840]   either intentionally or unintentionally
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:26.100]   or through neglect, as we discussed before.
[00:59:26.100 --> 00:59:28.560]   - That's a really interesting point,
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:31.300]   which is it's possible that there,
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.860]   a huge amount of intelligent civilizations
[00:59:33.860 --> 00:59:36.180]   have been born even through our galaxy,
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.860]   but they live very briefly and they die.
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:40.700]   - There are flash bulbs in the night.
[00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:42.060]   (laughing)
[00:59:42.060 --> 00:59:45.540]   - That brings me to the fourth issue,
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.860]   and that is the Fermi paradox.
[00:59:47.860 --> 00:59:50.560]   If they're common, where the hell are they?
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.540]   Notwithstanding the various UFO reports
[00:59:54.540 --> 00:59:57.660]   in Roswell and all that, they just don't meet the bar.
[00:59:57.660 --> 01:00:00.900]   They don't clear the bar of scientific evidence,
[01:00:00.900 --> 01:00:02.560]   in my opinion, okay?
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.700]   So there's no clear evidence
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:07.340]   that they've ever visited us on Earth here.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:10.100]   So, and SETI has been now,
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:12.140]   the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:13.380]   has been scanning the skies,
[01:00:13.380 --> 01:00:15.340]   and true, we've only looked a couple of hundred
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:17.380]   light years out, and that's a tiny fraction
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:19.520]   of the whole galaxy, a tiny fraction
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.940]   of these hundred billion plus stars.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:23.620]   Nevertheless, you know,
[01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:28.900]   if the galaxy were teeming with life,
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:30.100]   especially intelligent life,
[01:00:30.100 --> 01:00:32.420]   you'd expect some of it to have been
[01:00:32.420 --> 01:00:34.680]   far more advanced than ours, okay?
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.840]   There's nothing special about
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.840]   when the Industrial Revolution started on Earth, right?
[01:00:39.840 --> 01:00:41.700]   The chemical evolution of our galaxy
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:44.500]   was such that billions of years ago,
[01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:47.560]   nuclear processing and stars had built up
[01:00:47.560 --> 01:00:49.980]   clouds of gas after their explosion
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.800]   that were rich enough in heavy elements
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.240]   to have formed Earth-like planets,
[01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.000]   even billions of years ago.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:56.300]   So there could be civilizations
[01:00:56.300 --> 01:00:58.860]   that are billions of years ahead of ours.
[01:00:58.860 --> 01:01:01.980]   And if you look at the exponential growth of technology
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.660]   among Homo sapiens in the last couple of hundred years,
[01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:06.460]   and you just project that forward,
[01:01:06.460 --> 01:01:08.660]   I mean, there's no telling what they could have achieved
[01:01:08.660 --> 01:01:11.380]   even in 1,000 or 10,000 years,
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:15.060]   let alone a million or 10 million or a billion years.
[01:01:15.060 --> 01:01:17.900]   And if they reach this capability
[01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:20.500]   of interstellar travel and colonization,
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:23.300]   then you can show that within 10 million years
[01:01:23.300 --> 01:01:25.140]   or certainly a hundred million years,
[01:01:25.140 --> 01:01:28.100]   you can populate the whole galaxy, all right?
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:31.040]   And they, you know, so then you don't have to have
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:33.420]   tried to detect them beyond a hundred or a thousand
[01:01:33.420 --> 01:01:35.420]   light years, they would already be here.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:38.140]   - Do you think, as a thought experiment,
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:42.180]   do you think it's possible that they are already here,
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.260]   but we humans are so human-centric
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:47.500]   that we're just not, like, our conception
[01:01:47.500 --> 01:01:49.300]   of what intelligent life looks like
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.620]   we don't want to acknowledge it.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.340]   Like, what if trees?
[01:01:55.340 --> 01:01:57.900]   - Right, right, right, yeah.
[01:01:57.900 --> 01:01:59.860]   - Okay, I guess in the form of a question,
[01:01:59.860 --> 01:02:03.020]   do you think we'll actually detect intelligent life
[01:02:03.020 --> 01:02:04.500]   if it came to visit us?
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:05.900]   - Yeah, I mean, it's like, you know,
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:08.180]   you're an ant crawling around on a sidewalk somewhere
[01:02:08.180 --> 01:02:10.220]   and do you notice the humans wandering around
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:12.900]   and the Empire State Building and, you know,
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:15.700]   rocket ships flying to the moon and all that kind of stuff.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.740]   Right, it's conceivable that we haven't detected it
[01:02:19.740 --> 01:02:21.740]   and that we're so primitive compared to them
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:23.460]   that we're just not able to do so.
[01:02:23.460 --> 01:02:26.020]   - Like if you look at dark energy, maybe,
[01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:27.340]   we call it as a field.
[01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:30.660]   - It's just that my own feeling is that in science now,
[01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.540]   through observations and experiments,
[01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:35.420]   we've measured so many things
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:40.020]   and basically we understand a lot of stuff.
[01:02:40.020 --> 01:02:41.220]   - The fabric of reality.
[01:02:41.220 --> 01:02:43.540]   - Yeah, the fabric of reality we understand quite well.
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.220]   And there are a few little things like dark matter
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.580]   and dark energy that may be some sign
[01:02:47.580 --> 01:02:50.140]   of some super intelligence, but I doubt it.
[01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.940]   Okay, you know, why would some super intelligence
[01:02:51.940 --> 01:02:54.380]   be holding clusters of galaxies together?
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:55.980]   Why would they be responsible
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.180]   for accelerating the expansion of the universe?
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:01.540]   So the point is that through science
[01:03:01.540 --> 01:03:03.380]   and applied science and engineering,
[01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.140]   we understand so much now
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:07.980]   that I'm not saying we know everything,
[01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.260]   but we know a hell of a lot, okay?
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:13.820]   And so it's not like there are lots of mysteries
[01:03:13.820 --> 01:03:17.300]   flying around there that are completely outside
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:22.300]   our level of exploration or understanding.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:29.020]   - Yeah, I would say from the mystery perspective,
[01:03:30.260 --> 01:03:33.580]   it seems like the mystery of our own cognition
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.700]   and consciousness is much grander than,
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:39.460]   like the degrees of freedom of possible explanations
[01:03:39.460 --> 01:03:41.500]   for what the heck is going on is much greater there
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:44.420]   than in the physics of the observable.
[01:03:44.420 --> 01:03:48.300]   - How the brain works, how did life arise?
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:50.380]   Yeah, big, big questions.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:54.460]   But they, to me, don't indicate the existence
[01:03:54.460 --> 01:03:57.020]   of an alien or something.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.540]   I mean, unless we are the aliens,
[01:03:58.540 --> 01:04:00.180]   you know, we could have been contamination
[01:04:00.180 --> 01:04:03.980]   from some rocket ship that hit here a long, long time ago
[01:04:03.980 --> 01:04:06.020]   and all evidence of it has been destroyed.
[01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:09.460]   But again, that alien would have started out somewhere.
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:14.180]   They're not here watching us right now, right?
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:15.900]   They're not among us.
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:20.660]   And so though there are potential explanations
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:21.820]   for the Fermi paradox,
[01:04:21.820 --> 01:04:23.340]   and one of them that I kind of like
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:26.380]   is that the truly intelligent creatures
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:30.060]   are those that decided not to colonize the whole galaxy
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:32.420]   'cause they'd quickly run out of room there
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:33.740]   'cause it's exponential, right?
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:37.300]   You send a probe to a planet, it makes two copies.
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:39.820]   They go out, they make two copies each
[01:04:39.820 --> 01:04:41.300]   and it's an exponential, right?
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.100]   They quickly colonize the whole galaxy.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:45.500]   But then the distance to the next galaxy,
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:47.300]   the next big one like Andromeda,
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:49.940]   that's two and a half million light years.
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:52.340]   That's a much grander scale now, right?
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:56.100]   And so it also could be that the reason they survived
[01:04:56.100 --> 01:05:00.460]   this long is that they got over this tendency
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:03.260]   that may well exist among sufficiently
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:04.660]   intelligent creatures,
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:09.140]   this tendency for aggression and self-destruction, right?
[01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.860]   If they bypass that, and that may be one
[01:05:11.860 --> 01:05:15.180]   of the great filters if there are more than one, right?
[01:05:15.180 --> 01:05:18.700]   Then they may not be a type of creature
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.540]   that feels the need to go and say,
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:23.900]   "Oh, there's a nice looking planet
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.300]   and there's a bunch of ants on it.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:28.860]   Let's go squish 'em and colonize it."
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:30.900]   No, it could even be the kind of Star Trek
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.460]   like prime directive where you go and explore worlds
[01:05:34.460 --> 01:05:37.860]   but you don't interfere in any way, right?
[01:05:37.860 --> 01:05:40.820]   - And also we call it exploration,
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:42.140]   it's beautiful and everything,
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.700]   but there is underlying this desire to explore
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:47.300]   is a desire to conquer.
[01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:50.620]   I mean, if we're just being really honest about-
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:52.620]   - Right now for us it is, right?
[01:05:52.620 --> 01:05:54.540]   And you're saying it's possible to separate,
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:59.540]   but I would venture to say that those are coupled.
[01:05:59.540 --> 01:06:04.340]   So I could imagine a civilization that lives on
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:07.460]   for billions of years that just stays on,
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:10.780]   like figures out the minimal effort way
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:12.380]   of just peacefully existing.
[01:06:12.380 --> 01:06:13.860]   It's like a monastery.
[01:06:13.860 --> 01:06:15.340]   - Yeah, and it limits itself.
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.500]   - Yeah, it limits itself.
[01:06:16.500 --> 01:06:19.420]   - You know, it's planted its seeds in a number of places,
[01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.820]   so it's not vulnerable to a single point failure, right?
[01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:26.380]   Supernova going off near one of these stars or something
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:30.260]   or an asteroid or a comet coming in from the Oort cloud
[01:06:30.260 --> 01:06:32.100]   equivalent of that planetary system
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.140]   and without warning, thrashing them to bits.
[01:06:35.140 --> 01:06:37.100]   So they've got their seeds in a bunch of places,
[01:06:37.100 --> 01:06:40.980]   but they chose not to colonize the galaxy.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:44.140]   And they also choose not to interfere
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:49.140]   with this incredibly primitive organism, Homo sapiens,
[01:06:49.860 --> 01:06:51.140]   right?
[01:06:51.140 --> 01:06:55.700]   - Or this is like a, they enjoy,
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.900]   this is like a TV show for them.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:00.420]   - Yeah, it could be like a TV show, right?
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.700]   - So they just tuned in.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:04.020]   - Right, so those are possible explanations.
[01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:08.380]   Yet, I think that to me, the most likely explanation
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:11.020]   for the Perimee paradox is that they really are
[01:07:11.020 --> 01:07:12.540]   very, very rare.
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:16.020]   And you know, Carl Sagan estimated 100,000 of them.
[01:07:16.020 --> 01:07:17.980]   If there's that many, some of them would have been
[01:07:17.980 --> 01:07:22.020]   way ahead of us and I think we would have seen them by now.
[01:07:22.020 --> 01:07:24.300]   If there are a handful, maybe they're there,
[01:07:24.300 --> 01:07:27.260]   but at that point, you're right on this dividing line
[01:07:27.260 --> 01:07:29.980]   between being a pessimist and an optimist.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   And what are the odds for that, right?
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.420]   If you look at all the things that had to go right for us.
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:37.540]   And then, you know, getting back to something
[01:07:37.540 --> 01:07:40.900]   you said earlier, let's discuss, you know, primitive life.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:44.340]   That could be the thing that's difficult to achieve.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:47.220]   Just getting the random molecules together
[01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.220]   to a point where they start self-replicating
[01:07:50.220 --> 01:07:53.460]   and evolving and becoming better and all that.
[01:07:53.460 --> 01:07:56.500]   That's an inordinately difficult thing, I think,
[01:07:56.500 --> 01:07:59.300]   though I'm not, you know, some molecular or cell biologist,
[01:07:59.300 --> 01:08:02.140]   but just, it's the usual argument, you know,
[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:04.300]   you're wandering around in the Sahara Desert
[01:08:04.300 --> 01:08:06.540]   and you stumble across a watch.
[01:08:06.540 --> 01:08:10.820]   Is your initial response, oh, you know,
[01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:13.420]   a bunch of sand grains just came together randomly
[01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:14.500]   and formed this watch.
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:17.380]   No, you think that something formed it
[01:08:17.380 --> 01:08:21.100]   or it came from some simpler structure
[01:08:21.100 --> 01:08:23.940]   that then became, you know, more complex.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:26.020]   All right, it didn't just form.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:28.940]   Well, even the simplest life
[01:08:28.940 --> 01:08:31.860]   is a very, very complex structure.
[01:08:31.860 --> 01:08:34.820]   Even the simplest prokaryotic cells,
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:36.500]   not to mention eukaryotic cells,
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:38.580]   although that transition may have been
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:40.340]   the so-called great filter as well.
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:42.860]   Maybe the cells without a nucleus
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.020]   are relatively easy to form.
[01:08:45.020 --> 01:08:48.420]   And then the big next step is where you have a nucleus,
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.180]   which then provides a lot of energy,
[01:08:50.180 --> 01:08:53.060]   which allows the cell to become much, much more complex
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:54.140]   and so on.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:58.740]   Interestingly, going from eukaryotic cells, single cells,
[01:08:58.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   to multicellular organisms does not appear to be,
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.500]   at least on earth, one of these great filters
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:07.460]   because there's evidence that it happened dozens of times
[01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:08.900]   independently on earth.
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:11.940]   So by a really great filter,
[01:09:11.940 --> 01:09:13.860]   something that happens very, very rarely,
[01:09:13.860 --> 01:09:16.540]   I mean that we had to get through
[01:09:16.540 --> 01:09:24.140]   an obstacle that is just incredibly rare to get through.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.660]   - And one of the really exciting scientific things
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:29.500]   is that that particular point
[01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   is something that we might be able to discover,
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:36.940]   even in our lifetimes, that find life elsewhere,
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:39.460]   like Europa or be able to--
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:41.780]   - See, that would be bad news, right?
[01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:42.740]   (laughing)
[01:09:42.740 --> 01:09:46.500]   'Cause if we find lots of pretty advanced life,
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:50.220]   that would suggest, and especially if we found
[01:09:50.220 --> 01:09:52.860]   some defunct fossilized civilization
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:54.940]   or something somewhere else, that would be--
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:09:56.340]   - Oh, bacteria, you mean.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:57.180]   - What's that?
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.980]   - Defunct civilization of like primitive life forms.
[01:09:59.980 --> 01:10:01.220]   - Oh, no, I'm sorry, I switched gears there.
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:05.220]   If we found some intelligent or even trilobites, right,
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.740]   and stuff, you know, elsewhere,
[01:10:06.740 --> 01:10:08.740]   that would be bad news for us because that would mean
[01:10:08.740 --> 01:10:11.620]   that the great filter is ahead of us, you know, right?
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:12.460]   - Oh, interesting, yeah.
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:15.580]   - Because it would mean that lots of things
[01:10:15.580 --> 01:10:17.460]   have gotten roughly to our level.
[01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:18.300]   - Yeah.
[01:10:18.300 --> 01:10:20.460]   - But given the Fermi paradox,
[01:10:20.460 --> 01:10:23.140]   if you accept that the Fermi paradox means
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.580]   that there's no one else out there,
[01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:26.220]   you don't necessarily have to accept that,
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:28.940]   but if you accept that it means that no one else
[01:10:28.940 --> 01:10:31.900]   is out there, and yet there are lots of things we've found
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:34.460]   that are at or roughly at our level,
[01:10:34.460 --> 01:10:36.660]   that means that the great filter is ahead of us
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:40.860]   and that bodes poorly for our long-term future.
[01:10:40.860 --> 01:10:41.700]   You know, but--
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:45.700]   - Yeah, it's funny you said, you started by saying
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.020]   you're a little bit on the pessimistic side,
[01:10:48.020 --> 01:10:51.420]   but it's funny because we're doing this kind of dance
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.360]   between pessimism and optimism because I'm not sure
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.340]   if us being alone in the observable universe
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.020]   as intelligent beings is pessimistic.
[01:11:00.020 --> 01:11:02.760]   - Well, it's good news in a sense for us
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:06.020]   because it means that we made it through.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:06.860]   - Oh, right.
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:09.260]   - See, if we're the only ones,
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.540]   and there are such great filters, maybe more than one,
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:14.660]   formation of life might be one of them,
[01:11:14.660 --> 01:11:18.260]   formation of eukaryotic that is with the nucleus cells
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:21.860]   be another, development of human-like intelligence
[01:11:21.860 --> 01:11:22.980]   might be another, right?
[01:11:22.980 --> 01:11:25.700]   There might be several such filters
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.620]   and we were the lucky ones.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:29.700]   And, you know, then people say, well, then that means
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.260]   you're putting yourself into a special perspective
[01:11:32.260 --> 01:11:34.540]   and every time we've done that, we've been wrong.
[01:11:34.540 --> 01:11:36.300]   And yeah, yeah, I know all those arguments,
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.380]   but it still could be the case that there's one of us,
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.580]   at least per galaxy or per 10 or a hundred
[01:11:42.580 --> 01:11:46.060]   or a thousand galaxies, and we're sitting here
[01:11:46.060 --> 01:11:48.940]   having this conversation because we exist.
[01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:52.980]   And so there's an observational selection effect there.
[01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:54.560]   Just because we're special doesn't mean
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:56.740]   that we shouldn't have these conversations
[01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.280]   about whether or not we're special, right?
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.940]   - Yeah, so that's exciting.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:03.260]   That's optimistic.
[01:12:03.260 --> 01:12:05.700]   - So that's the optimistic part
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.780]   that if we don't find other intelligent life there,
[01:12:08.780 --> 01:12:12.040]   it might mean that we're the ones that made it.
[01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:16.380]   - And in general, outside the great filter and so on,
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.060]   you know, it's not obvious that the Stephen Hawking thing,
[01:12:20.060 --> 01:12:22.700]   which is, it's not obvious that life out there
[01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:24.380]   is gonna be kind to us.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.500]   - Oh yeah.
[01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:29.740]   So, you know, I knew Hawking and I greatly respect
[01:12:29.740 --> 01:12:33.020]   his scientific work and in particular,
[01:12:33.020 --> 01:12:36.580]   the early work on the unification of general theory
[01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:38.380]   of relativity and quantum physics,
[01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:40.140]   two great pillars in modern physics,
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:42.740]   you know, Hawking radiation and all that, fantastic work.
[01:12:42.740 --> 01:12:44.580]   You know, if you were alive,
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:45.860]   you should have been a recipient
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:47.740]   of this year's physics Nobel prize,
[01:12:47.740 --> 01:12:49.980]   which was for the discovery of black holes
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:53.700]   and also by Roger Penrose for the theoretical work
[01:12:53.700 --> 01:12:58.180]   showing that given a star that's massive enough,
[01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:00.700]   you basically can't avoid having a black hole.
[01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:02.940]   Anyway, Hawking, fantastic.
[01:13:02.940 --> 01:13:04.380]   I tip my hat to him.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:05.500]   May he rest in peace.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.660]   - That would have been a heck of a Nobel prize,
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:08.500]   black holes.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.340]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:13:09.340 --> 01:13:10.820]   - Heck of a good group.
[01:13:10.820 --> 01:13:12.220]   - But going back to what he said,
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:16.340]   that we shouldn't be broadcasting our presence to others,
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.780]   there I actually disagree with him respectfully
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:21.100]   because first of all,
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:23.780]   we've been unintentionally broadcasting our presence
[01:13:23.780 --> 01:13:26.780]   for a hundred years since the development of radio and TV.
[01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:32.100]   Secondly, any alien that has the capability
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:34.980]   of coming here and squashing us,
[01:13:34.980 --> 01:13:38.300]   either already knows about us and, you know, doesn't care
[01:13:38.300 --> 01:13:39.820]   'cause we're just like little ants.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:41.820]   And when there are ants in your kitchen,
[01:13:41.820 --> 01:13:42.860]   you tend to squash them.
[01:13:42.860 --> 01:13:45.980]   But if there are ants on the sidewalk and you're walking by,
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:48.060]   do you feel some great conviction
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:49.820]   that you have to squash any of them?
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.420]   No, you generally don't, right?
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:52.940]   We're irrelevant to them.
[01:13:52.940 --> 01:13:55.860]   All they need to do is keep an eye on us
[01:13:55.860 --> 01:13:57.500]   to see whether we're approaching
[01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.740]   the kind of technological capability
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:04.700]   and know about them and have intentions of attacking them.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:06.780]   And then they can squash us, right?
[01:14:06.780 --> 01:14:11.460]   You know, they could have done it long ago.
[01:14:11.460 --> 01:14:13.300]   They'll do it if they want to.
[01:14:13.300 --> 01:14:17.100]   Whether we advertise our presence or not is irrelevant.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:21.620]   So I really think that that's not a huge existential threat.
[01:14:21.620 --> 01:14:24.940]   - So this is a good place to bring up a difficult topic.
[01:14:24.940 --> 01:14:29.940]   You mentioned they would be paying attention to us
[01:14:29.940 --> 01:14:32.980]   to see if we come up with any crazy technology.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:37.740]   There's folks who have reported UFO sightings.
[01:14:37.740 --> 01:14:39.380]   There's actually, I've recently found out
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:42.060]   there's websites that track this,
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:44.060]   the data of these reportings.
[01:14:44.060 --> 01:14:49.060]   And there's millions of them in the past several decades,
[01:14:49.060 --> 01:14:53.100]   so seven decades and so on, that they've been recorded.
[01:14:54.300 --> 01:14:59.300]   And the UFOlogist community, as they refer to themselves,
[01:14:59.300 --> 01:15:04.500]   you know, one of the ideas that I find compelling
[01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:06.260]   from an alien perspective,
[01:15:06.260 --> 01:15:09.460]   that they kind of started showing up
[01:15:09.460 --> 01:15:12.680]   ever since we figured out how to build nuclear weapons.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:14.660]   That was sure. (laughs)
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:15.700]   - What a coincidence.
[01:15:15.700 --> 01:15:17.100]   - Yeah.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.060]   So I mean, you know, if I was an alien,
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:21.660]   I would start showing up then as well.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.340]   - Well, why not just observe us from afar?
[01:15:23.340 --> 01:15:24.340]   - No, I know, right.
[01:15:24.340 --> 01:15:27.860]   I would figure out, but that's why I'm always
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.820]   keeping a distance and staying blurry.
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:32.460]   - Right. (laughs)
[01:15:32.460 --> 01:15:33.340]   Very pixelated.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.460]   - Very pixelated.
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:37.500]   You know, there is something in the human condition,
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:40.540]   a cognition that wants to see,
[01:15:40.540 --> 01:15:42.340]   wants to believe beautiful things.
[01:15:42.340 --> 01:15:45.620]   And some are terrifying, some are exciting.
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:51.460]   Goats, Bigfoot is a big fascination for folks.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:53.940]   And UFO sightings, I think, falls into that.
[01:15:53.940 --> 01:15:57.140]   There's people that look at lights in the night sky.
[01:15:57.140 --> 01:16:04.620]   I mean, it's kind of a downer to think in a skeptical sense,
[01:16:04.620 --> 01:16:07.900]   to think that's just a light.
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:08.740]   - Yeah.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:10.940]   - You want to feel like there's something magical there.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:11.820]   - Sure.
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.700]   - I mean, I felt that first when my dad,
[01:16:13.700 --> 01:16:15.260]   my dad's a physicist,
[01:16:15.260 --> 01:16:18.420]   when he first told me about ball lightning
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:19.260]   when I was like a little kid.
[01:16:19.260 --> 01:16:20.100]   - Very weird.
[01:16:20.100 --> 01:16:20.940]   - Very, like--
[01:16:20.940 --> 01:16:21.780]   - Yeah.
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:22.620]   - Weird physical phenomena.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:23.460]   - Yeah.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:26.420]   - And he said, his intuition was,
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.060]   tell me this as a little kid,
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:30.500]   like I really like math.
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:33.300]   His intuition was whoever figures out ball lightning
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.660]   will get a Nobel Prize.
[01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:38.140]   I think that was a side comment he gave me.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:41.220]   I decided there when I was like five years old or whatever
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:43.220]   that I'm going to win a Nobel Prize
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.060]   for figuring out ball lightning.
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:44.900]   - Figuring out ball lightning.
[01:16:44.900 --> 01:16:47.060]   - That was like one of the first sort of sparks
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.980]   of the scientific mindset.
[01:16:48.980 --> 01:16:51.340]   Those mysteries, they capture your imagination.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:52.180]   - Yeah.
[01:16:52.180 --> 01:16:54.980]   - I think when I speak to people that report UFOs,
[01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.460]   that's that fire, that's what I see, that excitement.
[01:16:58.460 --> 01:16:59.940]   - Sure, and I understand that.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:02.780]   - But what do we do with that?
[01:17:02.780 --> 01:17:06.260]   Because there's hundreds of thousands, if not millions,
[01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:08.020]   and then the scientific community,
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:09.380]   you're like the perfect person.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.940]   You have an awesome Einstein shirt.
[01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:16.980]   What do we do with those reports?
[01:17:17.620 --> 01:17:20.140]   Most of the scientific community kind of rolls their eyes
[01:17:20.140 --> 01:17:21.340]   and dismisses it.
[01:17:21.340 --> 01:17:26.340]   Is it possible that a tiny percent of those folks
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:30.620]   saw something that's worth deeply investigating?
[01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:32.460]   - Sure, we should investigate it.
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:34.780]   It's just one of these things where,
[01:17:34.780 --> 01:17:37.020]   they've not brought us a hunk of kryptonite
[01:17:37.020 --> 01:17:38.300]   or something like that, right?
[01:17:38.300 --> 01:17:42.540]   They haven't brought us actual, tangible, physical evidence
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.500]   with which experiments can be done in laboratories.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:46.540]   - Right.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:48.060]   - It's anecdotal evidence.
[01:17:48.060 --> 01:17:51.380]   The photographs are, in some cases,
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:54.340]   in most cases, I would say, quite ambiguous.
[01:17:54.340 --> 01:17:55.820]   - I don't know what to think about.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:57.780]   So David Fravor is the first person.
[01:17:57.780 --> 01:18:01.060]   He's a Navy pilot, commander, and there's a bunch of them,
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:04.980]   but he's sort of one of the most legit pilots
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:08.180]   and people I've ever met.
[01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.020]   - Right.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:11.100]   - The fact that he saw something weird,
[01:18:11.100 --> 01:18:13.540]   he doesn't know what the heck it is,
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.660]   but he saw something weird.
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:16.780]   I mean, I don't know what to do with that.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:20.220]   And on the psychological side,
[01:18:20.220 --> 01:18:23.940]   so I'm pretty confident he saw what he says he saw,
[01:18:23.940 --> 01:18:27.020]   which he's saying is something weird.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:27.860]   - Right.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:31.260]   - One of the interesting psychological things
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:36.260]   that worries me is that everybody in the Navy,
[01:18:36.260 --> 01:18:38.020]   everybody in the US government,
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:40.460]   everybody in the scientific community
[01:18:40.460 --> 01:18:44.700]   just kind of like pretended that nothing happened.
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:47.060]   That kind of instinct,
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.060]   that's what makes me believe if aliens show up,
[01:18:49.060 --> 01:18:52.780]   we would all just ignore their presence.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:54.100]   That's what bothered me,
[01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:59.100]   that you don't investigate it more carefully
[01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:02.260]   and use this opportunity to inspire the world.
[01:19:02.260 --> 01:19:06.780]   So in terms of kryptonite,
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:09.300]   I think the conspiracy theory folks
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:13.620]   say that whenever there is some good hard evidence
[01:19:13.620 --> 01:19:16.260]   that scientists would be excited about,
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:18.540]   there's this kind of conspiracy that I don't like
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:20.220]   'cause it's ultimately negative,
[01:19:20.220 --> 01:19:23.660]   that the US government will somehow hide the good evidence
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:26.260]   to protect it.
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:28.100]   Of course, there's some legitimacy to it
[01:19:28.100 --> 01:19:32.100]   'cause you wanna protect military secrets,
[01:19:32.100 --> 01:19:32.940]   all that kind of stuff,
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   but I don't know what to do with this beautiful mess
[01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:43.300]   because I think millions of people are inspired by UFOs
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:46.260]   and it feels like an opportunity
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:47.740]   to inspire people about science.
[01:19:47.740 --> 01:19:50.500]   - So I would say, as Carl Sagan used to say,
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:54.220]   "Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence."
[01:19:54.220 --> 01:19:56.540]   I've quoted him a number of times.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:20:02.060]   We would welcome such evidence.
[01:20:02.060 --> 01:20:06.300]   On the other hand, a lot of the things that are seen
[01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:08.820]   or perhaps even hidden from us,
[01:20:08.820 --> 01:20:12.060]   you could imagine for military purposes,
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.860]   surveillance purposes,
[01:20:13.860 --> 01:20:16.260]   the US government doesn't want us to know,
[01:20:16.260 --> 01:20:19.940]   or maybe some of these pilots saw Soviet or Israeli
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:22.980]   or whatever satellites, right?
[01:20:22.980 --> 01:20:26.260]   A lot of the, or some of the crashes that have occurred
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:30.020]   were later found to be weather balloons or whatever.
[01:20:30.020 --> 01:20:34.220]   When there are more conventional explanations,
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:39.220]   science tends to stay away from the sensational ones, right?
[01:20:39.220 --> 01:20:46.340]   And so it may be that someone else's calling in life
[01:20:46.340 --> 01:20:48.820]   is to investigate these phenomena.
[01:20:48.820 --> 01:20:51.660]   And I welcome that as a scientist.
[01:20:51.660 --> 01:20:55.620]   I don't categorically actually deny the possibility
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:58.620]   that ships of some sort could have visited us
[01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:01.980]   because as I said earlier, at slow speeds,
[01:21:01.980 --> 01:21:04.220]   there's no problem in reaching other stars.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.860]   In fact, our Voyager and Pioneer spacecraft
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:10.020]   in a few million years are gonna be in the vicinity
[01:21:10.020 --> 01:21:10.940]   of different stars.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.980]   We can even calculate which ones they're gonna be
[01:21:12.980 --> 01:21:15.140]   in the vicinity of, right?
[01:21:15.140 --> 01:21:17.940]   So there's nothing that breaks any laws of physics
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:20.540]   if you do it slowly, but that's different.
[01:21:20.540 --> 01:21:23.780]   Just having Voyager or Pioneer fly by some star,
[01:21:23.780 --> 01:21:26.500]   that's different from having active aliens
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:29.540]   altering the trajectory of their vehicle
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:31.620]   in real time spying on us.
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:35.020]   And then either zipping back to their home planet
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:38.620]   or sending signals that tell them about us
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.180]   because they are likely many light years away
[01:21:43.180 --> 01:21:47.020]   and they're not gonna have broken that barrier as well.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.060]   Okay, right?
[01:21:48.060 --> 01:21:53.060]   So I just, you know, go ahead, study them.
[01:21:53.060 --> 01:21:55.300]   Great.
[01:21:55.300 --> 01:21:57.660]   For some young kid who wants to do it,
[01:21:57.660 --> 01:21:59.060]   it might be their calling
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:02.140]   and that's how they might find meaning in their lives
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:06.060]   is to be the scientist who really explores these things.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:09.180]   I chose not to because at a very young age,
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:12.820]   I found the evidence to the degree that I investigated it
[01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.980]   to be really quite unconvincing
[01:22:14.980 --> 01:22:18.260]   and I had other things that I wanted to do.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:21.380]   But I don't categorically deny the possibility
[01:22:21.380 --> 01:22:24.020]   and I think it should be investigated.
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.940]   - Yeah, I mean, this is one of those phenomena
[01:22:26.940 --> 01:22:31.660]   that 99.9% of people are almost definitely,
[01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:34.260]   there's conventional explanations
[01:22:34.260 --> 01:22:36.220]   and then there's like mysterious things
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.500]   that probably have explanations
[01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:42.460]   that are a little bit more complicated.
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:43.300]   - Yeah.
[01:22:43.300 --> 01:22:45.500]   - But there's not enough to work with.
[01:22:45.500 --> 01:22:48.980]   I tend to believe that if aliens showed up,
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:53.260]   there'll be plenty of evidence for scientists to study.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.100]   - Yeah.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.620]   And exactly as you said,
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:23:00.500]   avoid your type of spacecraft.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:05.500]   I could see sort of some kind of a dumb thing,
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.020]   almost like a sensor that's like probing,
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.500]   like statistically speaking. - Flying by.
[01:23:09.500 --> 01:23:11.460]   - Flying by, maybe lands,
[01:23:11.460 --> 01:23:13.420]   maybe there's some kind of robot type of thingies
[01:23:13.420 --> 01:23:15.060]   that just like move around and so on.
[01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:15.900]   - Yeah.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:17.700]   - Like in ways that we don't understand.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.100]   But I feel like, well,
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:26.340]   I feel like there'll be plenty of hard to dismiss evidence.
[01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:30.020]   And I also, especially this year,
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:35.020]   believe that the US government is not sufficiently competent
[01:23:35.020 --> 01:23:37.220]   given the huge amount of evidence
[01:23:37.220 --> 01:23:39.500]   that will be revealed from this kind of thing
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.220]   to conceal all of it.
[01:23:41.220 --> 01:23:42.060]   - Right.
[01:23:42.060 --> 01:23:43.060]   - At least in modern times,
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:46.580]   you can say maybe decades ago, but in modern times.
[01:23:46.580 --> 01:23:49.180]   But the people I speak to,
[01:23:49.180 --> 01:23:50.220]   and the reason I bring it up
[01:23:50.340 --> 01:23:52.220]   is because so many people write to me,
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:53.540]   they're inspired by it.
[01:23:53.540 --> 01:23:54.660]   - By the way, I wanted to comment
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:56.380]   on something you said earlier.
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:59.340]   Yeah, I had said that I'm sort of a pessimist
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:03.140]   in that I think there are very few other intelligent,
[01:24:03.140 --> 01:24:06.020]   mechanically able creatures out there.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:09.140]   But then I said, yes, in a sense, I'm an optimist,
[01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:09.980]   as you pointed out,
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:13.020]   because it means that we made it through the great filter.
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:13.860]   Right.
[01:24:13.860 --> 01:24:16.100]   I meant originally that I'm a pessimist
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:19.580]   in that I'm pessimistic about the possibility
[01:24:19.580 --> 01:24:21.860]   that there are many, many of us out there.
[01:24:21.860 --> 01:24:23.420]   - You know, mathematically speaking,
[01:24:23.420 --> 01:24:24.540]   in the Drake equation.
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:25.860]   - Exactly, right, right.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:29.220]   But it may mean a good thing for our ultimate survival.
[01:24:29.220 --> 01:24:30.660]   Right, so I'm glad you caught me on that.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:32.380]   - Yeah, I definitely agree with you.
[01:24:32.380 --> 01:24:33.980]   It is ultimately an optimist statement.
[01:24:33.980 --> 01:24:38.020]   - But anyway, I think UFO research is interesting.
[01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.460]   And I guess one of the reasons
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:42.340]   I've not been terribly convinced
[01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.460]   is that I think there are some scientists
[01:24:44.460 --> 01:24:46.100]   who are investigating this,
[01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:48.940]   and they've not found any clear evidence.
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:52.660]   Now, I must admit, I have not looked through the literature
[01:24:52.660 --> 01:24:55.060]   to convince myself that there are many scientists
[01:24:55.060 --> 01:24:58.020]   doing systematic studies of these various reports.
[01:24:58.020 --> 01:25:01.940]   I can't say for sure that there's a critical mass of them.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:02.780]   - Well, the one-
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:04.700]   - But it's just that you never get these reports
[01:25:04.700 --> 01:25:06.460]   from hardcore scientists.
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:07.300]   That's the other thing.
[01:25:07.300 --> 01:25:08.660]   And astronomers, you know, what do we do?
[01:25:08.660 --> 01:25:10.780]   We spend our time studying the heavens,
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:13.700]   and you'd think we'd be the ones that are most likely,
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.380]   aside from pilots, perhaps,
[01:25:15.380 --> 01:25:17.300]   at seeing weird things in the sky.
[01:25:17.300 --> 01:25:22.300]   And we just never do, of the unexplained UFO-type nature.
[01:25:22.300 --> 01:25:25.020]   - Yeah, I definitely, I try to keep an open mind,
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:26.420]   but for people who listen,
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.620]   it's actually really difficult for scientists.
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:34.060]   Like, I get probably, like this year,
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:36.020]   I've probably gotten over,
[01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:41.020]   probably maybe over 1,000 emails on the topic of AGI.
[01:25:41.020 --> 01:25:45.580]   It's very difficult to, you know,
[01:25:45.580 --> 01:25:48.780]   people write to me, it's like, how can you ignore this,
[01:25:48.780 --> 01:25:50.540]   in AGI side, like this model?
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.860]   This is obviously the model
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:53.780]   that's going to achieve general intelligence.
[01:25:53.780 --> 01:25:54.700]   How can you ignore it?
[01:25:54.700 --> 01:25:55.740]   I'm giving you the answer.
[01:25:55.740 --> 01:25:56.740]   Here's my document.
[01:25:56.740 --> 01:26:00.500]   And there's always just these large write-ups.
[01:26:00.500 --> 01:26:03.460]   The problem is, it's very difficult
[01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:07.060]   to weed through a bunch of BS.
[01:26:07.060 --> 01:26:07.900]   - Right.
[01:26:07.900 --> 01:26:12.420]   - It's very possible that you actually saw the UFO,
[01:26:12.420 --> 01:26:14.980]   but you have to acknowledge that,
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.540]   by UFO, I mean an extraterrestrial life,
[01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:21.820]   you have to acknowledge the hundreds of thousands of people
[01:26:21.820 --> 01:26:26.420]   who are a little bit, if not a lot, full of BS.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:28.780]   And from a scientist's perspective,
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:30.820]   it's really hard work.
[01:26:30.820 --> 01:26:34.020]   And when there's amazing stuff out there,
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:36.540]   it's like, why invest in Bigfoot
[01:26:36.540 --> 01:26:40.180]   when evolution in all of its richness is beautiful?
[01:26:40.180 --> 01:26:42.500]   Who cares about a monkey that walks on two feet,
[01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:43.340]   or eight, or whatever?
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:44.900]   - In a sense, it's like there's a zillion decoys.
[01:26:44.900 --> 01:26:45.740]   - Yeah.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:48.820]   - At observatories, true fact,
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:51.740]   we get lots and lots of phone calls
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:54.020]   when Venus, the evening star,
[01:26:54.020 --> 01:26:55.980]   but just really a bright planet,
[01:26:55.980 --> 01:26:58.380]   happens to be close to the crescent moon,
[01:26:58.380 --> 01:27:00.300]   because it's such a striking pair.
[01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.340]   This happens once in a while.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:02.260]   So we get these phone calls,
[01:27:02.260 --> 01:27:04.540]   oh, there's a UFO next to the moon.
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.260]   And no, it's Venus.
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:07.940]   And so, they're just,
[01:27:07.940 --> 01:27:12.500]   and I'm not saying the best UFO reports are of that nature.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.380]   No, there's some much more convincing cases,
[01:27:14.380 --> 01:27:17.100]   and I've seen some of the footage, and blah, blah, blah.
[01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:19.500]   But it's just, there's so many decoys, right?
[01:27:19.500 --> 01:27:22.580]   So much noise that you have to filter out.
[01:27:22.580 --> 01:27:24.420]   - And there's only so many scientists, so it's hard.
[01:27:24.420 --> 01:27:27.380]   - There's only so much time as well,
[01:27:27.380 --> 01:27:30.060]   and you have to choose what problems you work on.
[01:27:30.060 --> 01:27:33.220]   - This might be a fun question to ask,
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:38.220]   to kind of explore the idea of the expanding universe.
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:42.860]   So, the radius of the observable universe
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.580]   is 45.7 billion light years.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:52.580]   And the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years.
[01:27:52.580 --> 01:27:59.700]   That's less than the radius of the universe.
[01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.580]   How's that possible?
[01:28:01.580 --> 01:28:03.420]   - So, that's a great question.
[01:28:03.420 --> 01:28:06.700]   So, I meant to bring a little prop I have
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:09.420]   with ping pong balls and a rubber hose, a rubber band.
[01:28:09.420 --> 01:28:11.780]   I use it in many of the lectures
[01:28:11.780 --> 01:28:14.460]   that one can find of me online.
[01:28:14.460 --> 01:28:16.540]   But you have, in an expanding universe,
[01:28:16.540 --> 01:28:18.900]   the space itself between galaxies,
[01:28:18.900 --> 01:28:22.860]   or more correctly, clusters of galaxies, expanding.
[01:28:22.860 --> 01:28:26.980]   So, imagine light going from one cluster to another.
[01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:29.180]   It traverses some distance,
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:32.300]   and then while it's traversing the rest,
[01:28:32.300 --> 01:28:36.060]   that part that it already traveled through
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:38.340]   continues to expand.
[01:28:38.340 --> 01:28:43.340]   Now, 13.7 billion years might have gone by
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:48.060]   since the light that we are seeing from the early stages,
[01:28:48.060 --> 01:28:50.620]   the so-called cosmic microwave background radiation,
[01:28:50.620 --> 01:28:53.260]   which is the afterglow of the Big Bang,
[01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.660]   or the echo of the Big Bang.
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:57.220]   Yeah, 13.7 billion years have gone by.
[01:28:57.220 --> 01:29:00.700]   That's how long it's taken that light to reach us.
[01:29:00.700 --> 01:29:03.300]   But while it's been traveling that distance,
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:07.060]   the parts that it already traveled continue to expand.
[01:29:07.900 --> 01:29:11.300]   So, it's like you're walking at an airport
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:13.060]   on one of these walkways,
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:14.140]   and you're walking along
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.100]   'cause you're trying to get to your terminal,
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:19.140]   but the walkway is continuing as well.
[01:29:19.140 --> 01:29:21.740]   You end up traveling a greater distance,
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:23.260]   or the same distance faster
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:25.140]   is another way of putting it, right?
[01:29:25.140 --> 01:29:28.340]   That's why you get on one of these traveling walkways.
[01:29:28.340 --> 01:29:31.820]   So, you get roughly a factor of pi,
[01:29:31.820 --> 01:29:33.460]   but it's more like 3.2, I think.
[01:29:33.460 --> 01:29:35.620]   But when you work it all out,
[01:29:35.620 --> 01:29:37.980]   you multiply the number of years
[01:29:37.980 --> 01:29:40.060]   the universe has been in existence
[01:29:40.060 --> 01:29:42.420]   by three and a quarter or so,
[01:29:42.420 --> 01:29:47.380]   and that's how you get this 46 billion light year radius.
[01:29:47.380 --> 01:29:53.220]   - But how is that, let me ask some nice dumb questions.
[01:29:53.220 --> 01:29:57.140]   How is that not traveling faster than the speed of light?
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:59.060]   - Yeah, it's not traveling faster than the speed of light
[01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:01.140]   because locally, at any point,
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:03.340]   if you were to measure the light,
[01:30:03.340 --> 01:30:05.420]   the photon zipping past,
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:07.980]   it would not be exceeding the speed of light.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:10.980]   The speed of light is a locally measured quantity.
[01:30:10.980 --> 01:30:13.300]   After light has traversed some distance,
[01:30:13.300 --> 01:30:16.100]   if the rubber band keeps on stretching,
[01:30:16.100 --> 01:30:19.380]   then yes, it looks like the light traveled
[01:30:19.380 --> 01:30:21.980]   a greater distance than it would have
[01:30:21.980 --> 01:30:25.140]   had the space not been expanding.
[01:30:25.140 --> 01:30:28.180]   But locally, it never was exceeding the speed of light.
[01:30:28.180 --> 01:30:29.300]   It's just that the distance
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.020]   through which it already traveled
[01:30:31.020 --> 01:30:35.180]   then went off and expanded on its own some more.
[01:30:35.180 --> 01:30:38.820]   And if you give the light credit, so to speak,
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:40.740]   for having traversed that distance,
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.780]   well, then it looks like it's going faster
[01:30:42.780 --> 01:30:43.620]   than the speed of light.
[01:30:43.620 --> 01:30:46.220]   - But that's not how speed works.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:47.420]   - Right, that's not how speed works.
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:49.860]   Speed, and in relativity also,
[01:30:49.860 --> 01:30:53.380]   the other thing that is interesting is that,
[01:30:53.380 --> 01:30:55.300]   you know, if you take two ping pong balls
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:56.620]   that are sufficiently far apart,
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:30:59.180]   especially in an accelerating universe,
[01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:01.540]   you can easily have them moving apart from one another
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:03.300]   faster than the speed of light.
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.420]   So, you know, take two ping pong balls
[01:31:05.420 --> 01:31:09.180]   that were originally 400,000 kilometers from each other
[01:31:09.180 --> 01:31:11.660]   and let every centimeter in your rubber band
[01:31:11.660 --> 01:31:14.220]   expand to two in one second.
[01:31:14.220 --> 01:31:17.580]   Then suddenly this 400,000 kilometer distance
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:19.780]   is 800,000 kilometers.
[01:31:19.780 --> 01:31:24.340]   It went out by 400,000 kilometers in one second,
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:28.100]   that exceeds the 300,000 kilometer per second
[01:31:28.100 --> 01:31:29.540]   speed of light.
[01:31:29.540 --> 01:31:32.860]   But that light limit, that particle limit
[01:31:32.860 --> 01:31:36.340]   in special relativity applies to objects
[01:31:36.340 --> 01:31:39.500]   moving through a preexisting space.
[01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:43.020]   There's nothing in either special or general relativity
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:47.260]   that prevents space itself from expanding faster
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:48.540]   than the speed of light.
[01:31:48.540 --> 01:31:49.380]   That's no problem.
[01:31:49.380 --> 01:31:53.740]   Einstein wouldn't have had a problem with a universe
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.300]   as observed now by cosmologists.
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:32:00.700]   - Yeah, I'm not sure I'm yet ready to deal emotionally
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:02.980]   with expanding space.
[01:32:02.980 --> 01:32:03.820]   - Ha ha.
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:06.360]   - It's like, that to me is one of the most awe-inspiring
[01:32:06.360 --> 01:32:09.460]   things, you know, starting from the Big Bang.
[01:32:09.460 --> 01:32:10.860]   - It's definitely abstract.
[01:32:10.860 --> 01:32:13.580]   - It's space itself is expanding.
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:15.180]   - Right.
[01:32:15.180 --> 01:32:18.340]   - Could you, can we talk about the Big Bang a little bit?
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:19.660]   - Sure, yeah, yeah.
[01:32:19.660 --> 01:32:23.100]   - So like, the entirety of it,
[01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:27.660]   the universe was very small.
[01:32:27.660 --> 01:32:29.660]   - Right, but it was not a point.
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:30.860]   - It was not a point.
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:34.300]   - Because if we live in what's called a closed universe now,
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:36.780]   a sphere or the three-dimensional version of that
[01:32:36.780 --> 01:32:39.900]   would be a hypersphere, you know.
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:43.060]   Then regardless of how far back in time you go,
[01:32:43.060 --> 01:32:45.820]   it was always that topological shape.
[01:32:45.820 --> 01:32:49.260]   You can't turn a point suddenly into a shell, okay?
[01:32:49.260 --> 01:32:51.780]   It always had to be a shell.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:54.860]   So when people say, well, the universe started out
[01:32:54.860 --> 01:32:57.940]   as a point, that's being kind of flippant, kind of glib.
[01:32:57.940 --> 01:33:00.060]   It didn't really, it just started out
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:02.060]   at a very high density.
[01:33:02.060 --> 01:33:04.660]   And we don't know actually whether it was finite
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:05.720]   or infinite.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:08.380]   I think personally that it was finite at the time,
[01:33:08.380 --> 01:33:10.280]   but it expanded very, very quickly.
[01:33:10.280 --> 01:33:14.500]   Indeed, if it exponentiated and continued in some places
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:17.540]   to exponentiate, then it could in fact be infinite
[01:33:17.540 --> 01:33:20.540]   right now, and most cosmologists think that it is infinite.
[01:33:20.540 --> 01:33:24.740]   - Wait, yeah, sorry, what infinite, which dimension, mass?
[01:33:24.740 --> 01:33:26.940]   - Infinite in space, infinite in space.
[01:33:26.940 --> 01:33:30.220]   And by that I mean that if you were trying to measure,
[01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:32.760]   use light to measure its size,
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:35.000]   you'd never be able to measure its size
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:36.700]   'cause it would always be bigger
[01:33:36.700 --> 01:33:39.060]   than the distance light can travel.
[01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:40.660]   That's what you get in a universe
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:43.060]   that's accelerating in its expansion.
[01:33:43.060 --> 01:33:46.780]   - Okay, but if a thing was a hypersphere,
[01:33:46.780 --> 01:33:49.220]   it's very small, not a point.
[01:33:49.220 --> 01:33:51.060]   How can that thing be infinite?
[01:33:51.060 --> 01:33:53.860]   - Well, it expands exponentially.
[01:33:53.860 --> 01:33:56.140]   That's what the inflation theory is all about.
[01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:57.820]   Indeed, at your home institution,
[01:33:57.820 --> 01:34:00.320]   Alan Guth is one of the originators
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:02.860]   of the whole inflationary universe idea,
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:05.740]   along with Andre Linde at Stanford University
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:07.700]   here in the Bay Area, and others,
[01:34:07.700 --> 01:34:11.140]   Alexei Starobinsky and others had similar sorts of ideas.
[01:34:11.140 --> 01:34:14.580]   But in an exponentially expanding universe,
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:17.160]   if you actually try to make this measurement,
[01:34:17.160 --> 01:34:21.140]   you send light out to try to see it curve back around
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:23.100]   and hit you in the back of the head.
[01:34:23.100 --> 01:34:25.640]   If it's an exponentially expanding universe,
[01:34:25.640 --> 01:34:29.400]   the amount of space remaining to be traversed
[01:34:29.400 --> 01:34:32.280]   is always a bigger and bigger quantity.
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:33.640]   So you'll never get there from here.
[01:34:33.640 --> 01:34:35.840]   You'll never reach the back of your head.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.480]   So observationally or operationally,
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:41.020]   it can be thought of as being infinite.
[01:34:41.020 --> 01:34:43.040]   - That's one of the best definitions of infinity,
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:44.240]   by the way. - What's that?
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:49.000]   - That's one of the best sort of physical manifestations
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.120]   of infinity.
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:51.480]   - Yeah, yeah, because you have to ask,
[01:34:51.480 --> 01:34:53.320]   how would you actually measure it?
[01:34:53.320 --> 01:34:56.280]   Now, I sometimes say to my cosmology theoretical friends,
[01:34:56.280 --> 01:34:59.880]   well, if I were God and I were outside this whole thing
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.320]   and I took a God-like slice in time,
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:05.840]   wouldn't it be finite no matter how big it is?
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.760]   And they object and they say, Alex,
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:12.760]   you can't be outside and take a God-like slice of time.
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:14.880]   - Because there's nothing outside.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.320]   - Well, I'm not, you know, or also,
[01:35:19.320 --> 01:35:22.800]   what slice of time you're taking depends on your motion.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:24.740]   And that's true even in special relativity
[01:35:24.740 --> 01:35:28.560]   that slices of time get tilted in a sense
[01:35:28.560 --> 01:35:30.080]   if you're moving quickly.
[01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:34.340]   The axes, X and T, actually become tilted,
[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.680]   not perpendicular to one another.
[01:35:37.680 --> 01:35:41.080]   And you can look at Brian Greene's books and lectures
[01:35:41.080 --> 01:35:45.680]   and other things where he imagines taking a loaf of bread
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:50.040]   and slicing it in units of time as you progress forward.
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:52.040]   But then if you're zipping along relative
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:54.160]   to that loaf of bread,
[01:35:54.160 --> 01:35:57.360]   the slices of time actually become tilted.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:00.560]   And so it's not even clear what slices of time mean,
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:02.880]   but I'm an observational astronomer.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:04.920]   I know which end of the telescope to look through.
[01:36:04.920 --> 01:36:06.940]   And the way I understand the infinity is,
[01:36:06.940 --> 01:36:07.780]   as I just told you,
[01:36:07.780 --> 01:36:11.100]   that operationally or observationally,
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:15.700]   there'd be no way of seeing that it's a finite universe,
[01:36:15.700 --> 01:36:17.380]   of measuring a finite universe.
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:20.380]   And so in that sense, it's infinite,
[01:36:20.380 --> 01:36:24.860]   even if it started out as a finite little dot.
[01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:29.420]   Well, not a dot, I'm sorry, a finite little hypersphere.
[01:36:29.420 --> 01:36:33.780]   - But it didn't really start out there
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:37.740]   'cause what happened before that?
[01:36:37.740 --> 01:36:38.620]   - Well, we don't know.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:41.340]   So this is where it gets into a lot of speculation.
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:42.260]   - Let's go, I mean.
[01:36:42.260 --> 01:36:43.260]   - Let's go there, okay, sure.
[01:36:43.260 --> 01:36:45.420]   So, you know.
[01:36:45.420 --> 01:36:46.260]   - Nobody can prove you wrong.
[01:36:46.260 --> 01:36:49.300]   - The idea of what happened before T equals zero
[01:36:49.300 --> 01:36:51.740]   and whether there are other universes out there.
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:53.140]   I like to say that these are sort of
[01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.100]   on the boundaries of science.
[01:36:55.100 --> 01:36:57.580]   They're not just ideas that we wake up at three
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:36:59.300]   in the morning to go to the bathroom and say,
[01:36:59.300 --> 01:37:00.900]   oh, well, let's think about what happened
[01:37:00.900 --> 01:37:01.820]   before the big bang,
[01:37:01.820 --> 01:37:04.860]   or let there be a multiplicity of universes.
[01:37:04.860 --> 01:37:08.220]   In other words, we have real testable physics
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:12.380]   that we can use to draw certain conclusions
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:16.620]   that are plausibility arguments based on what we know.
[01:37:16.620 --> 01:37:20.540]   Now, admittedly, there are not really direct tests
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:24.060]   of these hypotheses.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:25.540]   That's why I call them hypotheses.
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:29.020]   They're not really elevated to a theory
[01:37:29.020 --> 01:37:30.980]   'cause a theory in science is really something
[01:37:30.980 --> 01:37:33.100]   that has a lot of experimental
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:34.860]   or observational support behind it.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:37.300]   So, they're hypotheses,
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:39.940]   but they're not unreasonable hypotheses
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:42.100]   based on what we know about general relativity
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:44.140]   and quantum physics, okay?
[01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:46.300]   And they may have indirect tests
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:49.260]   in that if you adopt this hypothesis,
[01:37:49.260 --> 01:37:51.620]   then there might be a bunch of things you expect
[01:37:51.620 --> 01:37:54.500]   of the universe, and lo and behold, that's what we measure.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:57.660]   But we're not actually measuring anything
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:37:59.860]   at T less than zero,
[01:37:59.860 --> 01:38:02.660]   or we're not actually measuring the presence
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:04.980]   of another universe in this multiverse.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:09.100]   And yet there are these indirect ideas that stem forth.
[01:38:09.100 --> 01:38:12.100]   So, it's hard to prove uniqueness,
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:14.620]   and it's hard to completely convince oneself
[01:38:14.620 --> 01:38:17.860]   that a certain hypothesis must be true.
[01:38:17.860 --> 01:38:22.980]   But the more and more tests you have that it satisfies,
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:25.060]   let's say there are 50 predictions it makes,
[01:38:25.060 --> 01:38:30.060]   and 49 of them are things that you can measure.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.940]   And then the 50th one is the one where you wanna measure
[01:38:33.940 --> 01:38:36.500]   the actual existence of that other universe,
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:39.140]   or what happened before T equals zero,
[01:38:39.140 --> 01:38:40.380]   and you can't do that.
[01:38:40.380 --> 01:38:46.100]   But you've satisfied 49 of the other testable predictions.
[01:38:46.100 --> 01:38:48.940]   And so, that's science, right?
[01:38:48.940 --> 01:38:51.900]   Now, a conventional condensed matter physicist
[01:38:51.900 --> 01:38:54.340]   or someone who deals with real data in the laboratory
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.700]   might say, "Oh, you cosmologists,
[01:38:55.700 --> 01:38:57.300]   that's not really science,
[01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:59.500]   'cause it's not directly testable."
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:02.180]   But I would say it's sort of testable.
[01:39:02.180 --> 01:39:03.780]   But it's not completely testable,
[01:39:03.780 --> 01:39:05.020]   and so it's at the boundary.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:08.460]   But it's not like we're coming up with these crazy ideas,
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:11.100]   among them quantum fluctuations out of nothing,
[01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:14.180]   and then inflating into a universe with,
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:16.060]   you might say, "Well, you created a giant amount
[01:39:16.060 --> 01:39:19.220]   of energy, but in fact, this quantum fluctuation
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.500]   out of nothing, in a quantum way,
[01:39:21.500 --> 01:39:24.180]   violates the conservation of energy, but who cares?
[01:39:24.180 --> 01:39:26.500]   That was a classical law anyway."
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:29.180]   And then an inflating universe maintains
[01:39:29.180 --> 01:39:31.620]   whatever energy it had, be it zero
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:33.660]   or some infinitesimal amount.
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:37.940]   In a sense, the stuff of the universe has a positive energy,
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:40.140]   but there's a negative gravitational energy
[01:39:40.140 --> 01:39:41.460]   associated with it.
[01:39:41.460 --> 01:39:43.020]   It's like I drop an apple.
[01:39:43.020 --> 01:39:45.540]   I got kinetic energy, energy of motion out of that,
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:49.700]   but I did work on it to bring it to that height.
[01:39:49.700 --> 01:39:54.220]   So, by going down and gaining energy of motion,
[01:39:54.220 --> 01:39:55.980]   positive one, two, three, four, five units
[01:39:55.980 --> 01:39:58.900]   of kinetic energy, it's also gaining or losing,
[01:39:58.900 --> 01:40:01.020]   depending on how you want to think of it,
[01:40:01.020 --> 01:40:03.300]   negative one, two, three, four, five units
[01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:07.140]   of potential energy, so the total energy remains the same.
[01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:09.820]   An inflating universe can do that,
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:12.340]   or other physicists say that energy isn't conserved
[01:40:12.340 --> 01:40:13.740]   in general relativity.
[01:40:13.740 --> 01:40:16.340]   That's another way out of creating a universe
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:17.460]   out of nothing, you know?
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:20.180]   But the point is that this is all based
[01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:22.620]   on reasonably well-tested physics,
[01:40:22.620 --> 01:40:27.100]   and although these extrapolations seem kind of outrageous
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:29.660]   at first, they're not completely outrageous.
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:33.420]   They're within the realm of what we call science already,
[01:40:33.420 --> 01:40:36.460]   and maybe some young whippersnapper
[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:39.180]   will be able to figure out a way to directly test
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:41.100]   what happened before T equals zero,
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:43.960]   or to test for the presence of these other universes,
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.380]   but right now, we don't have a way of doing that.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:50.260]   - So, speaking of young whippersnappers, Roger Penrose.
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:51.940]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:40:51.940 --> 01:40:54.740]   - So, he kind of has a, you know, idea
[01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:58.380]   there may be some information that travels
[01:40:58.380 --> 01:41:00.660]   from whatever the heck happened before the Big Bang.
[01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:01.980]   - Yeah, maybe.
[01:41:01.980 --> 01:41:03.220]   I kind of doubt it.
[01:41:03.220 --> 01:41:06.820]   - So, do you think it's possible to detect something,
[01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:09.920]   like actually experimentally be able to detect some,
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:13.820]   I don't know what it is, radiation, some sort of--
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:15.820]   - Yeah, in the cosmic microwave background radiation,
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:18.140]   there may be ways of doing that.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:23.140]   - But is it philosophically or practically possible
[01:41:23.340 --> 01:41:26.480]   to detect signs that this was before the Big Bang,
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:29.100]   or is it what you said, which is like,
[01:41:29.100 --> 01:41:32.940]   everything we observe will, as we currently understand,
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:34.180]   will have to be a creation
[01:41:34.180 --> 01:41:36.340]   of this particular observable universe?
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.180]   - Yeah, I mean, you know, if you,
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.780]   it's very difficult to answer right now,
[01:41:39.780 --> 01:41:43.200]   because we don't have a single, verified,
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:46.820]   fully self-consistent, experimentally tested
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:48.900]   quantum theory of gravity.
[01:41:48.900 --> 01:41:51.220]   And of course, the beginning of the universe
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:54.180]   is a large amount of stuff in a very small space.
[01:41:54.180 --> 01:41:56.900]   So you need both quantum mechanics and general relativity.
[01:41:56.900 --> 01:41:58.980]   Same thing if our universe re-collapses
[01:41:58.980 --> 01:42:01.380]   and then bounces back to another Big Bang.
[01:42:01.380 --> 01:42:02.860]   You know, there's also ideas there
[01:42:02.860 --> 01:42:06.380]   that some of the information leaks through or survives.
[01:42:06.380 --> 01:42:08.840]   I don't know that we can answer that question right now,
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:12.540]   because we don't have a quantum theory of gravity
[01:42:12.540 --> 01:42:15.500]   that most physicists believe in,
[01:42:15.500 --> 01:42:17.420]   and belief is perhaps the wrong word,
[01:42:17.420 --> 01:42:19.140]   that most physicists trust,
[01:42:19.140 --> 01:42:23.340]   because the experimental evidence favors it, right?
[01:42:23.340 --> 01:42:25.340]   You know, there are various forms of string theory.
[01:42:25.340 --> 01:42:26.860]   There's quantum loop gravity.
[01:42:26.860 --> 01:42:28.620]   There are various ideas,
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:31.800]   but which, if any, will be the one
[01:42:31.800 --> 01:42:33.780]   that survives the test of time,
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:36.420]   and more importantly, within that,
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:39.780]   the test of experiment and observation.
[01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:43.380]   So my own feeling is probably these things don't survive.
[01:42:43.380 --> 01:42:45.140]   I don't think we've seen any evidence
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:47.540]   in the cosmic microwave background radiation
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:50.140]   of information leaking through.
[01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:54.220]   Similarly, the one way, or one of the few ways
[01:42:54.220 --> 01:42:56.860]   in which we might test for the presence of other universes
[01:42:56.860 --> 01:42:59.500]   is if they were to collide with ours.
[01:42:59.500 --> 01:43:03.100]   That would leave a pattern, a temperature signature
[01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:05.700]   in the cosmic microwave background radiation.
[01:43:05.700 --> 01:43:08.120]   Some astrophysicists claim to have found it,
[01:43:08.120 --> 01:43:11.420]   but in my opinion, it's not statistically significant
[01:43:11.420 --> 01:43:13.400]   to the level that would be necessary
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:16.900]   to have such an amazing claim, right?
[01:43:16.900 --> 01:43:18.900]   You know, it's just a 5% chance
[01:43:18.900 --> 01:43:20.140]   that the microwave background
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:22.900]   had that distribution just by chance.
[01:43:22.900 --> 01:43:27.900]   5% isn't very long odds if you're claiming that instead,
[01:43:27.900 --> 01:43:34.000]   that you're finding evidence from another universe.
[01:43:34.000 --> 01:43:36.880]   I mean, it's like if the Large Hadron Collider people
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:40.980]   had claimed, after gathering enough data
[01:43:40.980 --> 01:43:42.840]   to show the Higgs particle,
[01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:46.300]   when there was a 5% chance it could be
[01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:50.060]   just a statistical fluctuation in their data.
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:53.940]   No, they required five sigma, five standard deviations,
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:57.020]   which is roughly one chance in two million
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:43:59.780]   that this is a statistical fluctuation
[01:43:59.780 --> 01:44:03.580]   of no physical greater significance.
[01:44:03.580 --> 01:44:05.500]   - Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.
[01:44:05.500 --> 01:44:07.460]   - There you go, it all boils down to that.
[01:44:07.460 --> 01:44:09.540]   And the greater your claim,
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:11.580]   the greater is the evidence that is needed,
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:16.460]   and the more evidence you need from independent ways
[01:44:16.460 --> 01:44:20.700]   of measuring or of coming to that deduction.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:23.300]   A good example was the accelerating universe,
[01:44:23.300 --> 01:44:26.420]   you know, when we found evidence for it in 1998
[01:44:26.420 --> 01:44:29.380]   with supernovae, with exploding stars,
[01:44:29.380 --> 01:44:30.980]   it was great that there were two teams
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:34.140]   that lent some credibility to the discovery,
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:37.140]   but it was not until other astrophysicists
[01:44:37.140 --> 01:44:39.740]   used not only that technique,
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:42.820]   but more importantly, other independent techniques
[01:44:42.820 --> 01:44:45.660]   that had their own potential sources
[01:44:45.660 --> 01:44:47.860]   of systematic error or whatever,
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:49.780]   but they all came to the same conclusion,
[01:44:49.780 --> 01:44:52.900]   and that started giving a much more complete picture
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:53.780]   of what was going on,
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:56.620]   and a picture in which most astrophysicists
[01:44:56.620 --> 01:44:59.080]   quickly gained confidence.
[01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:01.760]   That's why that idea caught on so quickly,
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:05.100]   is that there were other physicists
[01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:08.160]   and astronomers doing observations,
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:10.640]   completely independent of supernovae,
[01:45:10.640 --> 01:45:12.580]   that seemed to indicate the same thing.
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:16.780]   - Yeah, that period of your life,
[01:45:16.780 --> 01:45:20.380]   that work with an incredible team of people
[01:45:20.380 --> 01:45:23.520]   that won the Nobel Prize,
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.620]   it's just fascinating work.
[01:45:25.620 --> 01:45:29.380]   - Oh, gosh, you know, never in my wildest dreams as a kid
[01:45:29.380 --> 01:45:32.940]   did I think that I would be involved,
[01:45:32.940 --> 01:45:35.260]   much less so heavily involved,
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:37.160]   in a discovery that's so revolutionary.
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:39.020]   I mean, you know, as a kid, as a scientist,
[01:45:39.020 --> 01:45:40.460]   if you're realistic,
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:42.700]   once you learn a little bit more about how science is done,
[01:45:42.700 --> 01:45:44.220]   and you're not gonna win a Nobel Prize
[01:45:44.220 --> 01:45:46.980]   and be the next Newton or Einstein or whatever,
[01:45:46.980 --> 01:45:49.340]   you just hope that you'll contribute something
[01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:52.260]   to humankind's understanding of how nature works,
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:53.960]   and you'll be satisfied with that.
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:57.780]   But here, I was in the right place at the right time,
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:02.140]   lot of luck, lot of hard work, and there it was.
[01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:05.540]   We discovered something that was really amazing,
[01:46:05.540 --> 01:46:08.440]   and that was the greatest thrill, right?
[01:46:08.440 --> 01:46:10.360]   I couldn't have asked for anything more
[01:46:10.360 --> 01:46:13.480]   than being involved in that discovery.
[01:46:13.480 --> 01:46:17.440]   - So the couple of teams, the Supernova Cosmology Project
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:19.480]   and the High-Z Supernova Search Team,
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.920]   so what was the Nobel Prize given for?
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:23.600]   - It was given for the discovery
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:25.680]   of the accelerating expansion of the universe.
[01:46:25.680 --> 01:46:28.960]   Not for the elucidation of what dark energy is
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.280]   or what causes that expansion, that acceleration,
[01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:34.560]   be it universes on the outside or whatever.
[01:46:34.560 --> 01:46:36.780]   It was only for the observational fact.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:39.140]   - So first of all, what is the accelerating universe?
[01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.140]   - So the accelerating universe is simply that
[01:46:42.140 --> 01:46:46.980]   if we look at the galaxies moving away from us right now,
[01:46:46.980 --> 01:46:50.500]   we would expect them to be moving away more slowly
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:52.700]   than they were billions of years ago,
[01:46:52.700 --> 01:46:55.360]   and that's because galaxies have visible matter,
[01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:57.580]   which is gravitationally attractive,
[01:46:57.580 --> 01:46:59.660]   and dark matter of an unknown sort
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:01.740]   that holds galaxies together
[01:47:01.740 --> 01:47:04.500]   and holds clusters of galaxies together,
[01:47:04.500 --> 01:47:06.820]   and of course, they then pull on one another
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:10.020]   and they would tend to retard the expansion of the universe,
[01:47:10.020 --> 01:47:12.920]   just as when I toss an apple up,
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:15.600]   even ignoring air resistance,
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.340]   the mutual gravitational attraction
[01:47:17.340 --> 01:47:19.840]   between Earth and the apple slows the apple down,
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:22.020]   and if that attraction is great enough,
[01:47:22.020 --> 01:47:24.700]   then the apple will someday stop and even come back,
[01:47:24.700 --> 01:47:26.100]   the big crunch, you could call it,
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.940]   or the gnab-gib, which is big bang backwards, right?
[01:47:28.940 --> 01:47:30.400]   That's what could have happened to the universe,
[01:47:30.400 --> 01:47:33.680]   but even if the universe's original expansion energy
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:37.300]   was so great that it avoids the big crunch,
[01:47:37.300 --> 01:47:39.740]   that's like an apple thrown at Earth's escape speed,
[01:47:39.740 --> 01:47:43.940]   it's like the rockets that go to Mars someday, right?
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.860]   You know, with people.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:48.420]   Even then, you'd expect the universe
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.620]   to be slowing down with time,
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:54.140]   but we looked back through the history of the universe
[01:47:54.140 --> 01:47:57.660]   by looking at progressively more distant galaxies,
[01:47:57.660 --> 01:48:02.660]   and by seeing that the evolution of this expansion rate
[01:48:03.640 --> 01:48:07.080]   is that in the first nine billion years,
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:09.240]   yeah, it was slowing down,
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:13.560]   but in the last five billion years, it's been speeding up.
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:15.320]   So who asked for that, right?
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.960]   - I think it's interesting to talk about
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:21.600]   a little bit of the human story of the Nobel Prize.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:22.440]   - Sure.
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.120]   - Which is, I mean--
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:24.960]   - It's fascinating.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:27.600]   - It's a really, first of all, the prize itself.
[01:48:27.600 --> 01:48:30.400]   It's kind of fascinating on the psychological level
[01:48:30.400 --> 01:48:34.620]   that prizes, I know we kind of think that prizes
[01:48:34.620 --> 01:48:37.460]   don't matter, but somehow they kind of focus the mind
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:40.300]   about some of the most special things we've accomplished.
[01:48:40.300 --> 01:48:43.100]   - The recognition, the funding, you know.
[01:48:43.100 --> 01:48:45.220]   - But, and also inspiration for,
[01:48:45.220 --> 01:48:46.700]   I mean, like I said, when I was a little kid,
[01:48:46.700 --> 01:48:49.600]   thinking about the Nobel Prize, like I didn't, you know,
[01:48:49.600 --> 01:48:52.620]   it inspires millions of young scientists.
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:56.540]   At the same time, there's a sadness to it a little bit
[01:48:56.540 --> 01:49:00.340]   that especially in the field, like depending on the field,
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:03.680]   but experimental fields that involve teams of,
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:08.440]   I don't know, sometimes hundreds of brilliant people.
[01:49:08.440 --> 01:49:11.460]   The Nobel Prize is only given to just a handful.
[01:49:11.460 --> 01:49:12.300]   I--
[01:49:12.300 --> 01:49:13.120]   - That's right.
[01:49:13.120 --> 01:49:14.800]   - Is it maxed at three?
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.620]   - Yeah, yeah, and it's not even written
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:18.820]   in Alfred Nobel's will, it turns out.
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:22.660]   One of our teammates looked into it in a museum in Stockholm
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:25.780]   when we went there for Nobel week in 2011.
[01:49:25.780 --> 01:49:28.820]   The leaders who got the prize formally knew
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:31.620]   that without the rest of us working hard in the trenches,
[01:49:31.620 --> 01:49:34.960]   the result would not have, you know, been discovered.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:37.500]   So they invited us to participate in Nobel week.
[01:49:37.500 --> 01:49:39.720]   And so one of the team members looked in the will
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:42.580]   and it's not there, it's just tradition.
[01:49:42.580 --> 01:49:43.420]   - That's interesting.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.420]   - It's archaic, you know,
[01:49:44.420 --> 01:49:46.740]   that's the way science used to be done.
[01:49:46.740 --> 01:49:47.580]   - Yeah.
[01:49:47.580 --> 01:49:49.260]   - And it's not the way a lot of science is done now.
[01:49:49.260 --> 01:49:51.860]   And you look at gravitational wave discovery,
[01:49:51.860 --> 01:49:53.780]   which was, you know,
[01:49:53.780 --> 01:49:56.740]   recognized with the Nobel Prize in 2017,
[01:49:56.740 --> 01:49:59.860]   Ray Weiss at MIT got it and Kip Thorne
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:03.580]   and Barry Barish at Caltech.
[01:50:03.580 --> 01:50:05.780]   And Ron Drever, one of the masterminds
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:07.460]   had passed away earlier in the year.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:10.540]   So again, one of the rules of Nobel
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:12.380]   is that it's not given posthumously.
[01:50:12.380 --> 01:50:13.220]   - Yeah.
[01:50:13.220 --> 01:50:14.860]   - Or at least the one exception might be
[01:50:14.860 --> 01:50:16.140]   if they've made their decision
[01:50:16.140 --> 01:50:19.220]   and they're busy making their press releases
[01:50:19.220 --> 01:50:22.540]   right before October, the first week in October or whatever.
[01:50:22.540 --> 01:50:24.100]   And then the person passes away.
[01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:25.820]   I think they don't change their minds then.
[01:50:25.820 --> 01:50:27.140]   But yeah, you know,
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:31.180]   it doesn't square with today's reality
[01:50:31.180 --> 01:50:33.540]   that a lot of science is done by big teams.
[01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:35.660]   In that case, a team of a thousand people.
[01:50:35.660 --> 01:50:40.020]   In our case, it was two teams consisting of about 50 people.
[01:50:40.020 --> 01:50:43.420]   And we used techniques that were arguably developed
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:45.300]   in part by people who,
[01:50:45.300 --> 01:50:48.820]   astrophysicists who weren't even on those two papers.
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:49.780]   I mean, some of them were,
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.780]   but other papers were written by other people, you know?
[01:50:52.780 --> 01:50:54.020]   And so it's like,
[01:50:54.020 --> 01:50:56.420]   we're standing on the shoulders of giants.
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:59.380]   And none of those people was officially recognized.
[01:50:59.380 --> 01:51:01.700]   And to me, it was okay.
[01:51:01.700 --> 01:51:04.140]   You know, again, it was the thrill of doing the work
[01:51:04.140 --> 01:51:05.940]   and ultimately the work,
[01:51:05.940 --> 01:51:08.580]   the discovery was recognized with the prize.
[01:51:08.580 --> 01:51:10.980]   And, you know, we got to participate in Nobel week
[01:51:10.980 --> 01:51:13.980]   and, you know, it's okay with me.
[01:51:13.980 --> 01:51:17.940]   I've known other physicists whose lives were ruined
[01:51:17.940 --> 01:51:21.020]   because they did not get the Nobel prize
[01:51:21.020 --> 01:51:23.900]   and they felt strongly that they should have.
[01:51:23.900 --> 01:51:25.820]   - So it doesn't- - Ralph Alpher,
[01:51:25.820 --> 01:51:28.100]   of the Alpher beta Gamow, you know,
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:31.460]   paper predicting the microwave background radiation.
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:33.300]   He should have gotten it.
[01:51:33.300 --> 01:51:36.340]   His advisor Gamow was dead by that point,
[01:51:36.340 --> 01:51:39.620]   but, you know, Penzias and Wilson got it for the discovery.
[01:51:39.620 --> 01:51:43.660]   And Alpher, apparently from colleagues who knew him well,
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:46.740]   I've talked to them, his life was ruined by this.
[01:51:46.740 --> 01:51:50.620]   He just, it just gnawed at his innards so much.
[01:51:50.620 --> 01:51:54.660]   - It's very possible that in a small handful of people,
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:51:57.340]   even three, that you would be one of the Nobel,
[01:51:57.340 --> 01:51:59.300]   one of the winners of the Nobel prize.
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:00.740]   That doesn't weigh heavy on you?
[01:52:00.740 --> 01:52:03.020]   - Well, you know, there were the two team leaders,
[01:52:03.020 --> 01:52:04.940]   Saul Perlmutter and Brian Schmidt,
[01:52:04.940 --> 01:52:07.500]   and usually it's the team leaders that are recognized.
[01:52:07.500 --> 01:52:10.220]   And then Adam Rees was my postdoc.
[01:52:10.220 --> 01:52:11.620]   - First author, I guess.
[01:52:11.620 --> 01:52:12.460]   - Yeah, first author.
[01:52:12.460 --> 01:52:13.780]   I was second author of that paper.
[01:52:13.780 --> 01:52:14.620]   Yeah.
[01:52:14.620 --> 01:52:16.380]   So I was his direct mentor at the time,
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:17.220]   although he was, you know,
[01:52:17.220 --> 01:52:19.860]   one of these people who just, you know, runs with things.
[01:52:19.860 --> 01:52:22.020]   He was an MIT undergraduate, by the way,
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:24.580]   Harvard graduate student,
[01:52:24.580 --> 01:52:27.820]   and then a postdoc as a so-called Miller Fellow
[01:52:27.820 --> 01:52:30.140]   for basic research in science at Berkeley,
[01:52:30.140 --> 01:52:32.980]   something that I was back in '84 to '86.
[01:52:32.980 --> 01:52:35.940]   But you're, you know, you're largely a free agent,
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:37.780]   but he worked quite closely with me,
[01:52:37.780 --> 01:52:39.500]   and he came to Berkeley to work with me.
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.460]   And on Schmidt's team,
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:43.660]   he was charged with analyzing the data,
[01:52:43.660 --> 01:52:47.780]   and he measured the brightnesses of these distant supernovae
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:49.100]   showing that they're fainter
[01:52:49.100 --> 01:52:51.300]   and thus more distant than anticipated.
[01:52:51.300 --> 01:52:53.380]   And that led to this conclusion
[01:52:53.380 --> 01:52:55.380]   that the universe had to have accelerated
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:58.340]   in order to push them out to such great distances.
[01:52:58.340 --> 01:53:01.380]   And I was shocked when he showed me the data,
[01:53:01.380 --> 01:53:03.860]   the results of his calculations and measurements.
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:05.540]   - But it's very-
[01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:06.700]   - So he deserved it.
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:07.860]   And on Saul's team,
[01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:10.300]   Gerson Goldhaber deserved it,
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:12.940]   but he died, I think, a year earlier in 2010,
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:14.660]   but that would have been four.
[01:53:14.660 --> 01:53:15.500]   And so,
[01:53:17.020 --> 01:53:19.180]   and me, well, I was on both teams,
[01:53:19.180 --> 01:53:22.260]   but, you know, was I number four, five, six, seven?
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:23.100]   I don't know.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:25.900]   - It's also very, so if I were to,
[01:53:25.900 --> 01:53:27.700]   it's possible that you're, I mean,
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:31.020]   I could make a very good case for you're in the three.
[01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:33.140]   And does that-
[01:53:33.140 --> 01:53:34.460]   - You're kind, you know, so-
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:36.180]   - But is that psychologically,
[01:53:36.180 --> 01:53:38.460]   I mean, listen, it weighs on me a little bit,
[01:53:38.460 --> 01:53:39.300]   because I,
[01:53:39.300 --> 01:53:43.220]   I don't know what to do with that.
[01:53:43.220 --> 01:53:45.740]   Perhaps it should motivate
[01:53:46.740 --> 01:53:50.580]   the rethinking, like Time Magazine started doing,
[01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:52.660]   like, you know, Person of the Year.
[01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:53.500]   - Yeah.
[01:53:53.500 --> 01:53:55.500]   - And like, they would start doing like concepts
[01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:58.540]   and almost like the black hole gets the Nobel Prize,
[01:53:58.540 --> 01:54:01.900]   or the Xcelerator universe gets the Nobel Prize,
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:03.740]   and here's the list of people.
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:08.140]   So like, or like the Oscar that you could say,
[01:54:08.140 --> 01:54:09.100]   because it-
[01:54:09.100 --> 01:54:10.300]   - It's a team effort now.
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.140]   - It's a team.
[01:54:11.140 --> 01:54:12.140]   - And it should be redone.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:15.020]   And the Breakthrough Prize in Fundamental Physics,
[01:54:15.020 --> 01:54:16.500]   which was started by Yuri Milner,
[01:54:16.500 --> 01:54:20.060]   and Zuckerberg is involved in others as well, you know.
[01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:21.980]   - They recognize the larger team.
[01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:24.300]   - Yeah, they recognize teams.
[01:54:24.300 --> 01:54:27.420]   And so in fact, both teams in the Xcelerating universe
[01:54:27.420 --> 01:54:31.100]   were recognized with the Breakthrough Prize in 2015.
[01:54:31.100 --> 01:54:34.620]   Nevertheless, the same three people,
[01:54:34.620 --> 01:54:36.700]   Reese, Perlmutter, and Schmidt,
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:38.700]   got the red carpet rolled out for them
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:40.820]   and were at the big ceremony
[01:54:40.820 --> 01:54:43.420]   and shared half of the prize money.
[01:54:43.420 --> 01:54:45.700]   And the rest of us, roughly 50,
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:48.820]   shared the other half and didn't get to go to the ceremony.
[01:54:48.820 --> 01:54:50.140]   But I feel for them.
[01:54:50.140 --> 01:54:52.860]   I mean, for the gravitational waves, it was 1,000 people.
[01:54:52.860 --> 01:54:54.620]   What are they gonna do, invite everyone?
[01:54:54.620 --> 01:54:55.980]   For the Higgs particle,
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:58.700]   it was 6,000 to 8,000 physicists and engineers.
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:02.180]   In fact, because of the whole issue of who gets it,
[01:55:02.180 --> 01:55:04.260]   experimentally that discovery
[01:55:04.260 --> 01:55:06.620]   still has not been recognized, right?
[01:55:06.620 --> 01:55:11.020]   The theoretical work by Peter Higgs and Englert
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:14.020]   got recognized, but there was a troika of other people
[01:55:14.020 --> 01:55:16.820]   who perhaps wrote the most complete paper
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:19.060]   and they were left out.
[01:55:19.060 --> 01:55:22.620]   And another guy died, you know?
[01:55:22.620 --> 01:55:24.180]   - It's all of this heartbreaking.
[01:55:24.180 --> 01:55:26.420]   Some people argue that the Nobel Prize
[01:55:26.420 --> 01:55:27.420]   has been diluted too,
[01:55:27.420 --> 01:55:29.940]   because if you look at Roger Penrose,
[01:55:29.940 --> 01:55:31.100]   you can make an argument
[01:55:31.100 --> 01:55:33.500]   that he should get the prize by himself.
[01:55:33.500 --> 01:55:36.060]   Like, so separate those-
[01:55:36.060 --> 01:55:37.020]   - Could have and should have.
[01:55:37.020 --> 01:55:39.540]   Perhaps he should have perhaps gotten it with Hawking
[01:55:39.540 --> 01:55:41.700]   before Hawking's death, right?
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:45.140]   The problem was Hawking radiation had not been detected,
[01:55:45.140 --> 01:55:47.020]   but you could argue that Hawking made enough
[01:55:47.020 --> 01:55:49.580]   other fundamental contributions
[01:55:49.580 --> 01:55:51.940]   to the theoretical study of black holes.
[01:55:51.940 --> 01:55:55.420]   And the observed data were already good enough
[01:55:55.420 --> 01:55:58.380]   at the time of before Hawking's death, okay?
[01:55:58.380 --> 01:56:00.620]   I mean, the latest results by Reinhard Genzel's group
[01:56:00.620 --> 01:56:03.380]   is that they see the time dilation effect
[01:56:03.380 --> 01:56:06.460]   of a star that's passing very close to the black hole
[01:56:06.460 --> 01:56:07.540]   in the middle of our galaxy.
[01:56:07.540 --> 01:56:10.300]   That's cool, and it adds additional evidence,
[01:56:10.300 --> 01:56:13.220]   but hardly anyone doubted the existence
[01:56:13.220 --> 01:56:14.820]   of the supermassive black hole.
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:16.940]   And Andrea Ghez's group, I believe,
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:19.340]   hadn't yet shown that relativistic effect,
[01:56:19.340 --> 01:56:21.020]   and yet she got part of the prize as well.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:24.700]   So clearly it was given for the original evidence
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:25.540]   that was really good.
[01:56:25.540 --> 01:56:28.500]   And that evidence is at least a decade old, you know?
[01:56:28.500 --> 01:56:31.180]   So one could make the case for Hawking.
[01:56:31.180 --> 01:56:34.860]   One could make the case that in 2016,
[01:56:34.860 --> 01:56:37.980]   when Mayor and K. Lowe's won the Nobel Prize
[01:56:37.980 --> 01:56:42.980]   for the discovery of the first exoplanet, 51B Pegasi,
[01:56:42.980 --> 01:56:47.420]   well, there was a fellow at Penn State, Alex Wolshon,
[01:56:47.420 --> 01:56:52.340]   who in 1992, three years preceding 1995,
[01:56:52.340 --> 01:56:55.900]   found a planet orbiting a pulsar,
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:57.860]   a very weird kind of star, a neutron star,
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:57:01.140]   and that wouldn't have been a normal planet, sure.
[01:57:01.140 --> 01:57:03.180]   And so the Nobel Committee, you know,
[01:57:03.180 --> 01:57:05.540]   they gave it for the discovery of planets
[01:57:05.540 --> 01:57:07.820]   around normal sun-like stars,
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:10.820]   but hell, you know, Wolshon found a planet,
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:13.460]   so they could have given it to him as the third person
[01:57:13.460 --> 01:57:16.340]   instead of to Jim Peebles for the development
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:18.180]   of what's called physical cosmology.
[01:57:18.180 --> 01:57:19.900]   He's at Princeton, he deserved it,
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:22.100]   but they could have given the Nobel
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.700]   for the development of physical cosmology to Peebles,
[01:57:25.700 --> 01:57:27.140]   and I would claim some other people
[01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:29.140]   were pretty important in that development as well, you know?
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:31.500]   And they could have given it some other year.
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:35.060]   So there's a lot of controversy.
[01:57:35.060 --> 01:57:36.460]   I try not to dwell on it.
[01:57:36.460 --> 01:57:37.460]   Was I number three?
[01:57:37.460 --> 01:57:38.300]   Probably not.
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:40.620]   You know, Adam Ries did the work.
[01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:43.300]   You know, I helped bounce ideas off of him,
[01:57:43.300 --> 01:57:46.940]   but we wouldn't have had the result without him.
[01:57:46.940 --> 01:57:50.300]   And I was on both teams for reasons.
[01:57:50.300 --> 01:57:53.340]   I mean, you know, the style of the first team,
[01:57:53.340 --> 01:57:56.260]   the Supernova Cosmology Project, didn't match mine.
[01:57:56.260 --> 01:57:57.980]   They came largely from experimental
[01:57:57.980 --> 01:57:59.740]   high-energy particle physics,
[01:57:59.740 --> 01:58:02.300]   where there's these hierarchical teams and stuff,
[01:58:02.300 --> 01:58:05.060]   and it's hard for the little guy to have a say.
[01:58:05.060 --> 01:58:06.660]   At least that's what I kind of thought.
[01:58:06.660 --> 01:58:10.500]   Whereas the team of astronomers led by Brian Schmidt
[01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:12.300]   was, first of all, a bunch of my friends,
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:15.060]   and they grew up as astronomers
[01:58:15.060 --> 01:58:16.820]   making contributions on little teams,
[01:58:16.820 --> 01:58:18.220]   and we decided to band together,
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:20.340]   but all of us had our voices heard.
[01:58:20.340 --> 01:58:24.220]   So it was sort of a culture, a style that I preferred,
[01:58:24.220 --> 01:58:27.180]   really, but let me tell you a story.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:30.260]   At the Nobel banquet, okay,
[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:32.700]   I'm sitting there between two physicists
[01:58:32.700 --> 01:58:34.540]   who are members of the committee
[01:58:34.540 --> 01:58:37.380]   of the Swedish National Academy of Sciences,
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:40.500]   you know, and I strategically kept offering them wine
[01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:44.900]   and stuff during this long, drawn-out Nobel ceremony, right?
[01:58:44.900 --> 01:58:47.180]   And I got them to be pretty talkative,
[01:58:47.180 --> 01:58:49.540]   and then in a polite, diplomatic way,
[01:58:49.540 --> 01:58:52.740]   I started asking them pointed questions.
[01:58:52.740 --> 01:58:54.260]   And basically, they admitted
[01:58:54.260 --> 01:58:58.260]   that if there are four or more people equally deserving,
[01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:00.780]   they wait for one of them to die,
[01:59:00.780 --> 01:59:02.740]   or they just don't give the prize at all
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:05.380]   when it's unclear who the three are,
[01:59:05.380 --> 01:59:06.900]   at least unclear to them.
[01:59:06.900 --> 01:59:08.580]   But unclear to them,
[01:59:08.580 --> 01:59:12.220]   they're not even right part of the time.
[01:59:12.220 --> 01:59:16.580]   I mean, Jocelyn Bell discovered pulsars
[01:59:16.580 --> 01:59:20.420]   with a set of radio antennas
[01:59:20.420 --> 01:59:22.900]   that her advisor, Anthony Hewish,
[01:59:22.900 --> 01:59:27.700]   conceived and built, so he deserves some credit.
[01:59:27.700 --> 01:59:31.260]   But he didn't discover the pulsar, she did.
[01:59:31.260 --> 01:59:35.820]   And his initial reaction to the data that she showed him
[01:59:35.820 --> 01:59:39.820]   was a condescending, "Rubbish, my dear."
[01:59:39.820 --> 01:59:41.940]   Yeah, I'm not kidding.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:43.420]   Now, I know Jocelyn Bell,
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:46.820]   and she did not let this destroy her life.
[01:59:46.820 --> 01:59:50.180]   She won every other prize under the sun, okay?
[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:56.100]   Vera Rubin, arguably one of the discoverers of dark matter,
[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:57.980]   although there, if you look at the history,
[01:59:57.980 --> 02:00:00.180]   there were a number of people, and that was the issue.
[02:00:00.180 --> 02:00:02.460]   I think there were a number of people, four or more,
[02:00:02.460 --> 02:00:04.580]   who had similar data and similar ideas
[02:00:04.580 --> 02:00:06.380]   at about the same time.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:09.100]   Rubin won every prize under the sun.
[02:00:09.100 --> 02:00:12.060]   The new big, large-scale survey telescope
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:14.620]   being built in Chile is being renamed
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.900]   the Vera Rubin Telescope,
[02:00:16.900 --> 02:00:19.700]   'cause she passed away in December of 2015, I think.
[02:00:19.700 --> 02:00:25.340]   It'll conduct this survey, large-scale survey,
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:26.580]   with the Rubin Telescope.
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:30.100]   So she's been recognized, but never with the Nobel Prize.
[02:00:30.100 --> 02:00:32.100]   And I would say that, to her credit,
[02:00:32.100 --> 02:00:35.940]   she did not let that consume her life either.
[02:00:35.940 --> 02:00:37.340]   And perhaps it was a bit easier
[02:00:37.340 --> 02:00:40.500]   because there had been no Nobel given
[02:00:40.500 --> 02:00:42.140]   for the discovery of dark matter,
[02:00:42.140 --> 02:00:45.500]   whereas in the case of pulsars and Jocelyn Bell,
[02:00:45.500 --> 02:00:46.940]   there was a prize given
[02:00:46.940 --> 02:00:49.580]   for the discovery of the freaking pulsars,
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:50.820]   and she didn't get it.
[02:00:50.820 --> 02:00:52.980]   I mean, what a travesty of justice.
[02:00:52.980 --> 02:00:57.980]   - So I also think, as a fan of fiction,
[02:00:57.980 --> 02:01:02.100]   as a fan of stories, that the travesty and the tragedy
[02:01:02.100 --> 02:01:06.100]   and the unfairness and the tension of it
[02:01:06.100 --> 02:01:09.900]   is what makes the prize and similar prizes beautiful.
[02:01:09.900 --> 02:01:14.540]   The decisions of other humans that result
[02:01:14.540 --> 02:01:17.180]   in dreams being broken.
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:21.220]   That's why we love the Olympics,
[02:01:21.220 --> 02:01:25.220]   as so many people, athletes, give their whole life
[02:01:25.220 --> 02:01:26.580]   for this particular moment.
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:27.540]   - Yeah, that's cool.
[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:29.460]   - And then there's referee decisions
[02:01:29.460 --> 02:01:32.100]   and little slips of here and there,
[02:01:32.100 --> 02:01:36.260]   like the little misfortunes that destroy entire dreams.
[02:01:36.260 --> 02:01:39.060]   And that's, it's weird to say,
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:42.220]   but it feels like that makes the entirety of it
[02:01:42.220 --> 02:01:43.540]   even more special.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:44.380]   - Yeah.
[02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:46.380]   - If it was perfect, it wouldn't be interesting.
[02:01:46.380 --> 02:01:49.340]   - Well, humans like competition and they like heroes,
[02:01:49.340 --> 02:01:51.260]   and unfortunately it gives the impression
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:54.620]   to youngsters today that science is still done
[02:01:54.620 --> 02:01:58.940]   by white men with gray beards wearing white lab coats.
[02:01:58.940 --> 02:02:02.100]   And I'm very pleased to see that this year,
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:04.500]   Andrea Ghez, the fourth woman in the history
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:07.340]   of the physics prize to have received it.
[02:02:07.340 --> 02:02:10.460]   And then two women, one at Berkeley,
[02:02:10.460 --> 02:02:13.220]   one elsewhere won the Nobel Prize in chemistry
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:15.940]   without any male co-recipient.
[02:02:15.940 --> 02:02:18.900]   And so that's sending a message, I think, to girls
[02:02:18.900 --> 02:02:23.620]   that they can do science and they have role models.
[02:02:23.620 --> 02:02:26.860]   I think the Breakthrough Prize and other such prizes
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:30.380]   show that teams get recognized as well.
[02:02:30.380 --> 02:02:33.820]   And if you pay attention to the newspapers,
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:38.020]   most of the good authors like Dennis Overby
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:39.820]   of the New York Times and others said
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:42.980]   that these were teams of people and they emphasize that.
[02:02:42.980 --> 02:02:45.860]   And they all played a role.
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:48.180]   And maybe if some grad student hadn't soldered
[02:02:48.180 --> 02:02:51.140]   some circuit, maybe the whole thing wouldn't have worked.
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:57.060]   But still, Ray Weiss, Kip Thorne was the theoretical impetus
[02:02:57.060 --> 02:03:02.420]   for the whole search for gravitational waves.
[02:03:02.420 --> 02:03:06.620]   Barry Barish brought the MIT and Caltech teams together
[02:03:06.620 --> 02:03:09.860]   to get them to cooperate at a time when the project
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:12.100]   was nearly dead from what I understand
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:16.140]   and contributed greatly to the experimental setup as well.
[02:03:16.140 --> 02:03:17.540]   He's a great experimental physicist,
[02:03:17.540 --> 02:03:21.300]   but he was really good at bringing these two teams together
[02:03:21.300 --> 02:03:23.220]   instead of having them duke it out in blows
[02:03:23.220 --> 02:03:25.700]   and leaving both of them bleeding and dying.
[02:03:25.700 --> 02:03:28.500]   The National Science Foundation was gonna cut the funding
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:29.740]   from what I understand.
[02:03:29.740 --> 02:03:33.820]   So there's human drama involved in this whole thing.
[02:03:33.820 --> 02:03:37.460]   And the Olympics, yeah, a runner, a swimmer, a runner,
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:42.020]   they slip just at the moment that they were taking off
[02:03:42.020 --> 02:03:43.860]   from the first thing and that costs them
[02:03:43.860 --> 02:03:46.220]   some fraction of a second and that's it.
[02:03:46.220 --> 02:03:47.980]   They didn't win.
[02:03:47.980 --> 02:03:51.900]   - And in that case, I mean, the coaches, the families,
[02:03:51.900 --> 02:03:54.020]   which I met a lot of Olympic athletes,
[02:03:54.020 --> 02:03:56.380]   and the coaches and the families of the athletes
[02:03:56.380 --> 02:03:59.300]   are really the winners of the medals.
[02:03:59.300 --> 02:04:02.580]   But they don't get the medal.
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:06.940]   Credit assignment is a fascinating thing.
[02:04:06.940 --> 02:04:08.380]   That's the full human story.
[02:04:08.380 --> 02:04:13.660]   And outside of prizes, it's fascinating.
[02:04:14.580 --> 02:04:15.620]   Just to be in the middle of it,
[02:04:15.620 --> 02:04:16.900]   for artificial intelligence,
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:19.660]   there's a field of deep learning that's really exciting.
[02:04:19.660 --> 02:04:24.140]   And people have been, there's yet another award,
[02:04:24.140 --> 02:04:28.540]   the Turing Award given for deep learning to three folks
[02:04:28.540 --> 02:04:31.060]   who are very much responsible for the field,
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:32.580]   but so are a lot of others.
[02:04:32.580 --> 02:04:33.780]   - Yeah, that's right.
[02:04:33.780 --> 02:04:36.780]   - And there's a few, there's a fellow
[02:04:36.780 --> 02:04:41.300]   by the name of Schmidt-Huber,
[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:46.340]   who sort of symbolizes the forgotten folks
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:48.740]   in the deep learning community.
[02:04:48.740 --> 02:04:51.940]   But that's the unfortunate, sad thing,
[02:04:51.940 --> 02:04:55.660]   where you remember Isaac Newton,
[02:04:55.660 --> 02:04:59.820]   or remember these special figures
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:04.820]   and the ones that flew close to them, we forget.
[02:05:04.820 --> 02:05:05.700]   - Well, that's right.
[02:05:05.700 --> 02:05:07.700]   And often the breakthroughs were made
[02:05:07.700 --> 02:05:09.580]   based on the body of knowledge
[02:05:09.580 --> 02:05:13.060]   that had been assimilated prior to that.
[02:05:13.060 --> 02:05:15.780]   But again, people like to worship heroes.
[02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:17.500]   You mentioned the Oscars earlier,
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:22.140]   and you look at the direct, I mean, well, I mean, okay,
[02:05:22.140 --> 02:05:24.620]   directors and stuff sometimes get awards and stuff,
[02:05:24.620 --> 02:05:27.980]   but you look at even something like, I don't know,
[02:05:27.980 --> 02:05:30.340]   songwriters, musicians, Elton John or something, right?
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:31.860]   Bernie Taupin, right?
[02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:36.620]   Wrote many of the words, or he's not as well-known,
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:39.820]   or the Beatles or something like that.
[02:05:39.820 --> 02:05:41.140]   - I was heartbroken to learn
[02:05:41.140 --> 02:05:43.300]   that Elvis didn't write most of his songs.
[02:05:43.300 --> 02:05:45.420]   - Yeah, Elvis, that's right, there you go.
[02:05:45.420 --> 02:05:47.140]   But he was the king, right?
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:48.580]   And he had such a personality,
[02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:51.180]   and it was such a performer, right?
[02:05:51.180 --> 02:05:54.180]   But it's the unsung heroes in many cases, yeah.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:56.580]   - So maybe taking a step back,
[02:05:56.580 --> 02:05:59.060]   we talked about the Nobel Prize
[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:00.300]   for the accelerating universe,
[02:06:00.300 --> 02:06:05.220]   but your work and the ideas around supernova
[02:06:05.220 --> 02:06:10.220]   were important in detecting this accelerating universe.
[02:06:10.220 --> 02:06:14.060]   Can we go to the very basics
[02:06:14.060 --> 02:06:17.620]   of what is this beautiful, mysterious object of a supernova?
[02:06:17.620 --> 02:06:20.860]   - Right, so a supernova is an exploding star.
[02:06:20.860 --> 02:06:23.460]   Most stars die a relatively quiet death,
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.420]   our own sun will, despite the fact
[02:06:25.420 --> 02:06:28.180]   that it'll become a red giant and incinerate Earth.
[02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:30.220]   It'll do that reasonably slowly,
[02:06:30.220 --> 02:06:32.500]   but there's a small minority of stars
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:35.660]   that end their lives in a titanic explosion.
[02:06:35.660 --> 02:06:38.700]   And that's not only exciting to watch from afar,
[02:06:38.700 --> 02:06:40.500]   but it's critical to our existence
[02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:42.820]   because it is in these explosions
[02:06:42.820 --> 02:06:45.340]   that the heavy elements synthesize
[02:06:45.340 --> 02:06:48.020]   through nuclear reactions during the normal course
[02:06:48.020 --> 02:06:51.940]   of the star's evolution, and during the explosion itself,
[02:06:51.940 --> 02:06:53.860]   get ejected into the cosmos,
[02:06:53.860 --> 02:06:56.660]   making them available as raw material
[02:06:56.660 --> 02:07:00.020]   for new stars, planets, and ultimately life,
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:02.260]   and that's just a great story.
[02:07:02.260 --> 02:07:04.620]   The best in some ways.
[02:07:04.620 --> 02:07:06.900]   So, you know, we like to study these things
[02:07:06.900 --> 02:07:09.260]   and our origins, but it turns out
[02:07:09.260 --> 02:07:12.420]   these are incredibly useful beacons as well,
[02:07:12.420 --> 02:07:14.740]   because if you know how powerful
[02:07:14.740 --> 02:07:17.780]   an exploding star really is
[02:07:17.780 --> 02:07:22.260]   by measuring the apparent brightness at its peak
[02:07:22.260 --> 02:07:24.940]   in galaxies whose distances we already know
[02:07:24.940 --> 02:07:27.500]   through having made other measurements,
[02:07:27.500 --> 02:07:31.900]   and you can thus calibrate how powerful the thing really is,
[02:07:31.900 --> 02:07:35.340]   and then you find ones that are much more distant,
[02:07:35.340 --> 02:07:38.380]   then you can use their observed brightness
[02:07:38.380 --> 02:07:42.100]   compared with their true intrinsic power or luminosity
[02:07:42.100 --> 02:07:43.500]   to judge their distance,
[02:07:43.500 --> 02:07:45.300]   and hence the distance of the galaxy
[02:07:45.300 --> 02:07:46.820]   in which they're located.
[02:07:46.820 --> 02:07:48.380]   - So- - Okay, it's like looking at,
[02:07:48.380 --> 02:07:51.580]   if you'll, let me just give this one analogy.
[02:07:51.580 --> 02:07:55.300]   You know, you judge the distance of an oncoming car at night
[02:07:55.300 --> 02:07:58.260]   by looking at how bright its headlights appear to be,
[02:07:58.260 --> 02:08:01.580]   and you've calibrated how bright the headlights are
[02:08:01.580 --> 02:08:04.780]   of a car that's two or three meters away of known distance,
[02:08:04.780 --> 02:08:06.820]   and you go, "Whoa, that's a faint headlight,
[02:08:06.820 --> 02:08:09.060]   "and so that's pretty far away."
[02:08:09.060 --> 02:08:12.180]   You also use the apparent angular separation
[02:08:12.180 --> 02:08:13.340]   between the two headlights
[02:08:13.340 --> 02:08:15.140]   as a consistency check in your brain,
[02:08:15.140 --> 02:08:16.660]   but that's what your brain is doing.
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:20.500]   So we can do that for cars, we can do that for stars.
[02:08:20.500 --> 02:08:21.540]   - Nice, I like that.
[02:08:21.540 --> 02:08:24.860]   But, you know, with cars, the headlights are all,
[02:08:24.860 --> 02:08:29.100]   there's some variation, but they're somewhat similar,
[02:08:29.100 --> 02:08:31.180]   so you can make those kinds of conclusions.
[02:08:31.180 --> 02:08:35.620]   What, how much variation is there between supernova
[02:08:35.620 --> 02:08:37.300]   that you can- - Yeah.
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:38.860]   - And can you detect them?
[02:08:38.860 --> 02:08:41.420]   - Right, so first of all, there are several different ways
[02:08:41.420 --> 02:08:44.020]   that stars can explode, and it depends on their mass
[02:08:44.020 --> 02:08:47.340]   and whether they're in a binary system and things like that.
[02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:50.780]   And the ones that we used for these cosmological purposes,
[02:08:50.780 --> 02:08:54.020]   studying the expansion of the history of the universe,
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:58.540]   are the so-called type Roman numeral one, lowercase a,
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:00.500]   type 1a supernovae.
[02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:04.220]   They come from a weird type of a star called a white dwarf.
[02:09:04.220 --> 02:09:06.940]   Our own sun will turn into a white dwarf
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.940]   in about 7 billion years.
[02:09:08.940 --> 02:09:11.740]   It'll have about half its present mass
[02:09:11.740 --> 02:09:14.820]   compressed into a volume just the size of Earth.
[02:09:14.820 --> 02:09:17.020]   So that's an inordinate density, okay?
[02:09:17.020 --> 02:09:18.740]   It's incredibly dense.
[02:09:18.740 --> 02:09:20.620]   And the matter is what's called,
[02:09:20.620 --> 02:09:23.000]   by quantum physicists, degenerate matter,
[02:09:23.000 --> 02:09:24.860]   not because it's morally reprehensible
[02:09:24.860 --> 02:09:26.900]   or anything like that, but this is just the name-
[02:09:26.900 --> 02:09:27.740]   - No judgments here.
[02:09:27.740 --> 02:09:30.460]   - Yeah, quantum physicists give to electrons
[02:09:30.460 --> 02:09:32.940]   that are squeezed into a very tight space.
[02:09:32.940 --> 02:09:34.940]   The electrons take on a motion
[02:09:34.940 --> 02:09:38.420]   due to Heisenberg's uncertainty principle,
[02:09:38.420 --> 02:09:40.980]   and also due to the Pauli exclusion principle
[02:09:40.980 --> 02:09:43.540]   that electrons don't like to be in the same place.
[02:09:43.540 --> 02:09:44.620]   They like to avoid each other.
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:47.620]   So those two things mean that a lot of electrons
[02:09:47.620 --> 02:09:49.180]   are moving very rapidly,
[02:09:49.180 --> 02:09:51.860]   which gives the star an extra pressure
[02:09:51.860 --> 02:09:54.220]   far above the thermal pressure associated
[02:09:54.220 --> 02:09:57.860]   with just the random motions of particles inside the star.
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:09:59.580]   So it's a weird type of star,
[02:09:59.580 --> 02:10:02.220]   but normally it wouldn't explode,
[02:10:02.220 --> 02:10:04.540]   and our sun won't explode,
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:07.860]   except that if such a white dwarf is in a pair
[02:10:07.860 --> 02:10:10.160]   with another more or less normal star,
[02:10:10.160 --> 02:10:14.340]   it can steal material from that normal star
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:17.140]   until it gets to an unstable limit,
[02:10:17.140 --> 02:10:20.860]   roughly one and a half times the mass of our sun,
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:22.340]   1.4 or so.
[02:10:22.340 --> 02:10:25.460]   This is known as the Chandrasekhar limit,
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:27.540]   after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar,
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.260]   an Indian astrophysicist who figured this out
[02:10:30.260 --> 02:10:32.260]   when he was about 20 years old
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:35.020]   on a voyage from India to England
[02:10:35.020 --> 02:10:36.860]   where he was to be educated.
[02:10:36.860 --> 02:10:38.020]   And then he did this,
[02:10:38.020 --> 02:10:39.220]   and then 50 years later,
[02:10:39.220 --> 02:10:42.260]   he won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1984,
[02:10:42.260 --> 02:10:44.100]   largely for this work, okay,
[02:10:44.100 --> 02:10:45.260]   that he did as a youngster
[02:10:45.260 --> 02:10:48.060]   who was on his way to be educated, you know?
[02:10:48.060 --> 02:10:50.500]   Oh, and his advisor,
[02:10:50.500 --> 02:10:53.140]   the great Arthur Eddington in England,
[02:10:53.140 --> 02:10:54.540]   who had done a lot of great things
[02:10:54.540 --> 02:10:55.940]   and was a great astrophysicist,
[02:10:55.940 --> 02:10:59.500]   nevertheless, he too was human and had his faults.
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:03.900]   He ridiculed Chandra's scientific work
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:05.380]   at a conference in England.
[02:11:05.380 --> 02:11:08.180]   And most of us, if we had been Chandra,
[02:11:08.180 --> 02:11:12.100]   would have just given up astrophysics at that time,
[02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:16.380]   when the great Arthur Eddington ridicules our work.
[02:11:16.380 --> 02:11:19.580]   And that's another inspirational story for the youngster,
[02:11:19.580 --> 02:11:21.320]   just keep going, you know?
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:22.160]   But anyway, John-
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:22.980]   - Ignore your advisor.
[02:11:22.980 --> 02:11:25.060]   - Yeah, no matter what your advisor says, right?
[02:11:25.060 --> 02:11:28.020]   So, or don't always pay attention to your advisor, right?
[02:11:28.020 --> 02:11:30.380]   Don't be, don't lose hope
[02:11:30.380 --> 02:11:32.420]   if you really think you're onto something.
[02:11:32.420 --> 02:11:34.300]   That doesn't mean never listen to your advisor,
[02:11:34.300 --> 02:11:36.580]   they may have sage advice as well.
[02:11:36.580 --> 02:11:38.500]   But anyway, you know,
[02:11:38.500 --> 02:11:41.780]   when a white dwarf grows to a certain mass,
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:43.420]   it becomes unstable.
[02:11:43.420 --> 02:11:45.300]   And one of the ways it can end its life
[02:11:45.300 --> 02:11:48.820]   is to go through a thermonuclear runaway.
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:52.660]   So basically, the carbon nuclei inside the white dwarf
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:56.740]   starts start fusing together to form heavier nuclei.
[02:11:56.740 --> 02:11:59.860]   And the energy that those fusion reactions emits
[02:11:59.860 --> 02:12:05.820]   doesn't go into, you know,
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:09.140]   being dissipated out of the star or, you know, whatever,
[02:12:09.140 --> 02:12:11.700]   or expanding it the way, you know,
[02:12:11.700 --> 02:12:14.060]   if you take a blowtorch to the middle of the sun,
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:17.580]   you heat up its gases, the gases would expand and cool.
[02:12:17.580 --> 02:12:21.220]   But this degenerate star can't expand and cool.
[02:12:21.220 --> 02:12:25.420]   And so the energy pumped in through these fusion reactions
[02:12:25.420 --> 02:12:28.460]   goes into making the nuclei move faster.
[02:12:28.460 --> 02:12:31.620]   And that gets more of them sufficiently close together
[02:12:31.620 --> 02:12:33.740]   that they can undergo nuclear fusion,
[02:12:33.740 --> 02:12:35.740]   thereby releasing more energy
[02:12:35.740 --> 02:12:38.780]   that goes into speeding up more nuclei.
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:41.860]   And thus you have a runaway, a bomb,
[02:12:41.860 --> 02:12:45.060]   an uncontrolled nuclear fusion reactor, right?
[02:12:45.060 --> 02:12:46.420]   Instead of the controlled fusion,
[02:12:46.420 --> 02:12:48.300]   which is what our sun does, okay?
[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:51.340]   Our sun is a marvelous controlled fusion reactor.
[02:12:51.340 --> 02:12:52.940]   This is what we need here on earth,
[02:12:52.940 --> 02:12:56.020]   fusion energy to solve our energy crisis, right?
[02:12:56.020 --> 02:12:58.860]   But the sun holds the stuff in, you know, through gravity,
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:00.940]   and you need a big mass to do that.
[02:13:00.940 --> 02:13:05.500]   So this uncontrolled fusion reaction blows up a star
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:09.260]   that's pretty much the same in all cases.
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:12.860]   And you measure it to be almost the same in all cases,
[02:13:12.860 --> 02:13:14.860]   but the devil's in the details.
[02:13:14.900 --> 02:13:18.660]   And in fact, we observe them to not be all the same.
[02:13:18.660 --> 02:13:21.100]   And theoretically, they might not be all the same
[02:13:21.100 --> 02:13:23.460]   because the rate of the fusion reactions
[02:13:23.460 --> 02:13:27.620]   might depend on the amount of trace heavier elements
[02:13:27.620 --> 02:13:28.540]   in the white dwarf.
[02:13:28.540 --> 02:13:30.300]   And that could depend on how old it is,
[02:13:30.300 --> 02:13:31.460]   when it was, you know,
[02:13:31.460 --> 02:13:33.220]   whether it was born billions of years ago
[02:13:33.220 --> 02:13:35.060]   when there weren't many heavier elements,
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:37.820]   or whether it's a relatively young white dwarf
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.900]   and all kinds of other things.
[02:13:39.900 --> 02:13:42.460]   And part of my work was to show that indeed,
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:44.860]   not all the type IAs are the same.
[02:13:44.860 --> 02:13:47.420]   You have to be careful when you use them.
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:49.060]   You have to calibrate them.
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:51.540]   They're not standard candles,
[02:13:51.540 --> 02:13:55.300]   the way it just, if all headlights or all candles
[02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:57.780]   were the same lumens or whatever,
[02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:58.940]   you'd say they're standard,
[02:13:58.940 --> 02:13:59.780]   and then it would be relevant.
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:01.300]   - Standard candles is an awesome term.
[02:14:01.300 --> 02:14:02.140]   Okay. (laughs)
[02:14:02.140 --> 02:14:03.740]   - Standard candles is what astronomers like to say,
[02:14:03.740 --> 02:14:05.580]   but I don't like that term
[02:14:05.580 --> 02:14:07.300]   'cause there aren't any standard candles,
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:10.060]   but there are standardizable candles.
[02:14:10.060 --> 02:14:11.220]   And by looking at these type IA--
[02:14:11.220 --> 02:14:12.620]   - Oh, calibrate them, that's what you mean.
[02:14:12.620 --> 02:14:15.100]   - Yeah, you're calibratable, standardizable, calibratable.
[02:14:15.100 --> 02:14:17.660]   You look at enough of them in nearby galaxies
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:20.300]   whose distances you know independently.
[02:14:20.300 --> 02:14:23.660]   And what you can tell is that, you know,
[02:14:23.660 --> 02:14:25.060]   and this is something that a colleague of mine,
[02:14:25.060 --> 02:14:28.020]   Mark Phillips, did, who was on Schmidt's team,
[02:14:28.020 --> 02:14:30.100]   and arguably was one of the people
[02:14:30.100 --> 02:14:31.340]   who deserved the Nobel Prize,
[02:14:31.340 --> 02:14:33.500]   but he showed that the intrinsically
[02:14:33.500 --> 02:14:38.500]   more powerful type IAs decline in brightness,
[02:14:39.180 --> 02:14:41.740]   and it turns out rise in brightness as well,
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.020]   more slowly than the less luminous IAs.
[02:14:45.020 --> 02:14:47.100]   And so if you calibrate this
[02:14:47.100 --> 02:14:49.900]   by measuring a whole bunch of nearby ones,
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:52.060]   and then you look at a distant one,
[02:14:52.060 --> 02:14:56.060]   instead of saying, well, it's a 100-watt type IA supernova,
[02:14:56.060 --> 02:14:57.980]   they're much more powerful than that, by the way,
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:00.100]   plus or minus 50, you can say,
[02:15:00.100 --> 02:15:04.460]   no, it's 112 plus or minus 15,
[02:15:04.460 --> 02:15:08.860]   or it's 84 plus or minus 17.
[02:15:08.860 --> 02:15:12.460]   It tells you where it is in the power scale,
[02:15:12.460 --> 02:15:15.220]   and it greatly decreases the uncertainties,
[02:15:15.220 --> 02:15:18.860]   and that's what makes these things cosmologically useful.
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:22.460]   I showed that if you spread the light out into a spectrum,
[02:15:22.460 --> 02:15:24.180]   you can tell spectroscopically
[02:15:24.180 --> 02:15:26.460]   that these things are different as well.
[02:15:26.460 --> 02:15:29.380]   And in 1991, I happened to study
[02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:32.180]   two of the extreme peculiar ones,
[02:15:32.180 --> 02:15:35.940]   the low-luminosity ones and the high-luminosity ones,
[02:15:35.940 --> 02:15:40.500]   1991 BG and 1991 T.
[02:15:40.500 --> 02:15:43.500]   This showed that not all the IAs are the same,
[02:15:43.500 --> 02:15:46.500]   and indeed, at the time of 1991,
[02:15:46.500 --> 02:15:50.340]   I was a little bit skeptical that we could use type IAs
[02:15:50.340 --> 02:15:53.060]   because of this diversity that I was observing.
[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:56.420]   But in 1993, Mark Phillips wrote a paper
[02:15:56.420 --> 02:16:00.580]   that showed this correlation between the light curve,
[02:16:00.580 --> 02:16:03.740]   the brightness versus time, and the peak luminosity.
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:04.580]   And once you- - Which gives you
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:05.780]   enough information to calibrate.
[02:16:05.780 --> 02:16:07.060]   - Yeah, then they become calibratable,
[02:16:07.060 --> 02:16:08.220]   and that was a game changer.
[02:16:08.220 --> 02:16:12.340]   - How many type IAs are out there to use for data?
[02:16:12.340 --> 02:16:13.780]   - Now there are thousands of them.
[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:15.420]   - Thousands, wow. - But at the time,
[02:16:15.420 --> 02:16:18.300]   the high Z team had 16,
[02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:22.420]   and the Supernova Cosmology Project had 40,
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:25.820]   but the 16 were better measured than the 40,
[02:16:25.820 --> 02:16:29.860]   and so our statistical uncertainties were comparable
[02:16:29.860 --> 02:16:31.940]   if you look at the two papers that were published.
[02:16:31.940 --> 02:16:34.060]   - How does that make you feel
[02:16:34.060 --> 02:16:36.820]   that there's these gigantic explosions
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:38.700]   just sprinkled out there?
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:40.220]   Is that- - Well, I certainly don't want one
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:42.500]   to be very nearby, and it would have to be
[02:16:42.500 --> 02:16:44.660]   within something like 10 light years
[02:16:44.660 --> 02:16:46.340]   to be an existential threat.
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:49.020]   - So they can happen in our galaxy?
[02:16:49.020 --> 02:16:49.940]   - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:49.940 --> 02:16:52.380]   So they can happen- - We would be okay?
[02:16:52.380 --> 02:16:53.820]   - In most cases, we'd be okay,
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:56.980]   'cause our galaxy is 100,000 light years across,
[02:16:56.980 --> 02:16:58.540]   and you'd need one of these things
[02:16:58.540 --> 02:17:00.420]   to be within about 10 light years
[02:17:00.420 --> 02:17:01.940]   to be an existential threat.
[02:17:01.940 --> 02:17:06.940]   - And it gives birth to a bunch of other stars, I guess?
[02:17:06.940 --> 02:17:09.140]   - Yeah, it gives birth to expanding gases
[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:10.300]   that are chemically enriched,
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:12.020]   and those expanding gases mix
[02:17:12.020 --> 02:17:15.340]   with other chemically enriched expanding gases,
[02:17:15.340 --> 02:17:18.740]   or primordial clouds of hydrogen and helium.
[02:17:18.740 --> 02:17:21.300]   I mean, this is, in a sense,
[02:17:21.300 --> 02:17:23.840]   the greatest story ever told, right?
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:28.100]   I teach this introductory astronomy course at Berkeley,
[02:17:28.100 --> 02:17:30.660]   and I tell 'em there's only five or six things
[02:17:30.660 --> 02:17:33.700]   that I want them to really understand and remember,
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:35.260]   and I'm gonna come to their deathbed,
[02:17:35.260 --> 02:17:36.860]   and I'm gonna ask them about this,
[02:17:36.860 --> 02:17:40.100]   and if they get it wrong, I will retroactively fail them.
[02:17:40.100 --> 02:17:41.980]   Their whole career will have been shot.
[02:17:41.980 --> 02:17:43.060]   That, and if they don't know- - That's a student's
[02:17:43.060 --> 02:17:43.900]   worst nightmare.
[02:17:43.900 --> 02:17:45.500]   - And observe a total solar eclipse,
[02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:47.460]   and yet they had the opportunity to do so,
[02:17:47.460 --> 02:17:48.940]   I will retroactively fail them.
[02:17:48.940 --> 02:17:51.660]   But one of them is, where did we come from?
[02:17:51.660 --> 02:17:54.500]   Where did the elements in our DNA come from?
[02:17:54.500 --> 02:17:57.520]   The carbon in our cells, the oxygen that we breathe,
[02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:01.540]   the calcium in our bones, the iron in our red blood cells,
[02:18:01.540 --> 02:18:04.060]   those elements, the phosphorus in our DNA,
[02:18:04.060 --> 02:18:08.780]   they all came from stars, from nuclear reactions in stars,
[02:18:08.780 --> 02:18:12.380]   and they were ejected into the cosmos,
[02:18:12.380 --> 02:18:16.980]   and in some cases, like iron, made during the explosions.
[02:18:16.980 --> 02:18:20.960]   And those gases drifted out, mixed with other clouds,
[02:18:20.960 --> 02:18:24.060]   made a new star or a star cluster,
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:27.780]   some of whose members then evolved and exploded,
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:31.060]   thus enriching the gases in the galaxy
[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:32.580]   progressively more with time,
[02:18:32.580 --> 02:18:35.900]   until finally, 4 1/2 billion years ago,
[02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:38.900]   from one of these chemically enriched clouds,
[02:18:38.900 --> 02:18:43.180]   our solar system formed with a rocky Earth-like planet,
[02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:46.440]   and somewhere, somehow, these self-replicating,
[02:18:46.440 --> 02:18:51.440]   evolving molecules, bacteria, formed and evolved
[02:18:51.620 --> 02:18:56.620]   through paramecia and amoebas and slugs and apes and us.
[02:18:56.620 --> 02:19:01.700]   And here we are, sentient beings
[02:19:01.700 --> 02:19:05.140]   that can ask these questions about our very origins,
[02:19:05.140 --> 02:19:09.120]   and with our intellect and with the machines we make,
[02:19:09.120 --> 02:19:13.960]   come to a reasonable understanding of our origins.
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:16.580]   What a beautiful story.
[02:19:16.580 --> 02:19:20.860]   I mean, if that does not put you at least in awe,
[02:19:20.860 --> 02:19:25.860]   if not in love with science and its power of deduction,
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:29.380]   I don't know what will, right?
[02:19:29.380 --> 02:19:31.420]   It's one of the greatest stories,
[02:19:31.420 --> 02:19:32.940]   if not the greatest story.
[02:19:32.940 --> 02:19:36.100]   Obviously, that's personality dependent and all that.
[02:19:36.100 --> 02:19:37.500]   It's a subjective opinion,
[02:19:37.500 --> 02:19:40.400]   but it's perhaps the greatest story ever told.
[02:19:40.400 --> 02:19:43.020]   I mean, you could link it to the Big Bang
[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:44.260]   and go even farther, right,
[02:19:44.260 --> 02:19:46.060]   to make an even more complete story,
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:49.740]   but as a subset, that's even, in some ways,
[02:19:49.740 --> 02:19:53.220]   a greater story than even the existence of the universe,
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:54.940]   in some ways, 'cause you could end up,
[02:19:54.940 --> 02:19:57.240]   you could just imagine some really boring universe
[02:19:57.240 --> 02:20:01.220]   that never leads to sentient creatures such as ourselves.
[02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:06.220]   - And is a supernova usually the introduction to that story?
[02:20:06.220 --> 02:20:07.620]   - Yeah.
[02:20:07.620 --> 02:20:10.220]   - So are they usually the thing that launches the,
[02:20:10.220 --> 02:20:12.360]   is there other engines of creation?
[02:20:12.360 --> 02:20:14.200]   - Well, the supernova is the one,
[02:20:14.200 --> 02:20:18.380]   I mean, I touch upon the subject earlier in my course,
[02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:19.860]   in fact, right about now in my lectures,
[02:20:19.860 --> 02:20:22.420]   because I talk about how our sun right now
[02:20:22.420 --> 02:20:25.140]   is fusing hydrogen to form helium nuclei,
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:29.060]   and later it'll form carbon and oxygen nuclei,
[02:20:29.060 --> 02:20:31.820]   but that's where the process will stop for our sun.
[02:20:31.820 --> 02:20:32.760]   It's not massive enough.
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:36.960]   Some stars that are more massive can go somewhat beyond that.
[02:20:36.960 --> 02:20:39.020]   So that's the beginning of, right,
[02:20:39.020 --> 02:20:41.740]   this idea of the birth of the heavy elements,
[02:20:41.740 --> 02:20:43.980]   since they couldn't have been born
[02:20:43.980 --> 02:20:45.140]   at the time of the Big Bang.
[02:20:45.140 --> 02:20:47.260]   Conditions of temperature and pressure
[02:20:47.260 --> 02:20:50.220]   weren't sufficient to make any significant quantities
[02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:51.780]   of the heavier elements.
[02:20:51.780 --> 02:20:53.540]   And so that's the beginning,
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:57.260]   but then you need some of these stars to explode, right?
[02:20:57.260 --> 02:21:00.540]   Because if those heavy elements remained forever trapped
[02:21:00.540 --> 02:21:02.500]   in the cores of stars,
[02:21:02.500 --> 02:21:05.040]   then they would not be available
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:07.700]   for the production of new stars, planets,
[02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:08.820]   and ultimately life.
[02:21:08.820 --> 02:21:13.360]   So indeed, the supernova, my main area of interest,
[02:21:13.360 --> 02:21:16.580]   plays a leading role in this whole story.
[02:21:17.460 --> 02:21:21.380]   - I saw that you got a chance to call Richard Feynman
[02:21:21.380 --> 02:21:24.260]   a mentor of yours when you were at Caltech.
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:27.220]   Do you have any fond memories of Feynman,
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:28.740]   any lessons that stick with you?
[02:21:28.740 --> 02:21:31.660]   - Oh yeah, he was quite a character
[02:21:31.660 --> 02:21:35.940]   and one of the deepest thinkers of all time, probably.
[02:21:35.940 --> 02:21:37.820]   And at least in my life,
[02:21:37.820 --> 02:21:42.820]   the physicist who had the single most intuitive understanding
[02:21:42.820 --> 02:21:45.940]   of how nature works of anyone I've met.
[02:21:46.780 --> 02:21:50.740]   He, I learned a number of things from him.
[02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:52.380]   He was not my thesis advisor.
[02:21:52.380 --> 02:21:54.500]   I worked with Wallace Sargent at Caltech
[02:21:54.500 --> 02:21:56.740]   on what are called active galaxies,
[02:21:56.740 --> 02:21:58.820]   big black holes in the centers of galaxies
[02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:01.500]   that are accreting or swallowing material,
[02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:02.500]   a little bit like the stuff
[02:22:02.500 --> 02:22:05.500]   of this year's Nobel Prize in physics 2020.
[02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:09.220]   But Feynman I had for two courses.
[02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:12.620]   One was general theory of relativity at the graduate level
[02:22:12.620 --> 02:22:15.380]   and one was applications of quantum physics
[02:22:15.380 --> 02:22:17.820]   to all kinds of interesting things.
[02:22:17.820 --> 02:22:22.820]   And he had this very intuitive way of looking at things
[02:22:22.820 --> 02:22:28.820]   that he tried to bring to his students.
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:33.080]   And he felt that if you can't explain something
[02:22:33.080 --> 02:22:38.080]   in a reasonably simple way to a non-scientist,
[02:22:38.080 --> 02:22:42.340]   or at least someone who is versed a little bit with science
[02:22:42.340 --> 02:22:44.700]   but is not a professional scientist,
[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:48.140]   then you probably don't understand it very well yourself,
[02:22:48.140 --> 02:22:49.320]   very thoroughly.
[02:22:49.320 --> 02:22:51.000]   So that in me,
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:57.040]   made a desire to be able to explain science
[02:22:57.040 --> 02:22:58.300]   to the general public.
[02:22:58.300 --> 02:23:00.660]   And I've often found that in explaining things,
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:02.100]   yeah, there's a certain part
[02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:03.780]   that I didn't really understand myself.
[02:23:03.780 --> 02:23:06.620]   That's one reason I like to teach the introductory courses
[02:23:06.620 --> 02:23:08.980]   to the lay public is that I sometimes find
[02:23:08.980 --> 02:23:12.580]   that my explanations are lacking in my own mind.
[02:23:12.580 --> 02:23:14.100]   So he did that for me.
[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:16.580]   - Is there, if I could just pause for a second.
[02:23:16.580 --> 02:23:18.980]   You said he had one of the most intuitive understanding
[02:23:18.980 --> 02:23:20.220]   of nature.
[02:23:20.220 --> 02:23:23.980]   If you could break apart what intuitive means,
[02:23:23.980 --> 02:23:26.860]   is it on a philosophical level?
[02:23:26.860 --> 02:23:28.460]   - No, sort of physical.
[02:23:28.460 --> 02:23:32.680]   How do you draw a mental picture or a picture on paper
[02:23:32.680 --> 02:23:33.580]   of what's going on?
[02:23:33.580 --> 02:23:36.100]   And he's perhaps most famous in this regard
[02:23:36.100 --> 02:23:37.660]   for his Feynman diagrams,
[02:23:37.660 --> 02:23:40.460]   which in what's called quantum electrodynamics,
[02:23:40.460 --> 02:23:43.940]   a quantum field theory of electricity and magnetism,
[02:23:43.940 --> 02:23:45.620]   what you have are actually, you know,
[02:23:45.620 --> 02:23:48.660]   an exchange of photons between charged particles.
[02:23:48.660 --> 02:23:50.980]   And they might even be virtual photons
[02:23:50.980 --> 02:23:55.340]   if the particles are at rest relative to one another.
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:23:57.380]   And there are ways of doing calculations
[02:23:57.380 --> 02:23:58.660]   that are brute force,
[02:23:58.660 --> 02:24:02.140]   that take pages on pages and pages of calculations.
[02:24:02.140 --> 02:24:05.540]   And Julian Schwinger developed some of the mathematics
[02:24:05.540 --> 02:24:07.580]   for that and won the Nobel prize for it.
[02:24:07.580 --> 02:24:09.900]   But Feynman had these diagrams that he made
[02:24:09.900 --> 02:24:13.140]   and he had a set of rules of what to do at the vertex.
[02:24:13.140 --> 02:24:14.660]   And he'd have two particles coming together
[02:24:14.660 --> 02:24:15.940]   and then a particle going out
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:17.800]   and then two particles coming out again.
[02:24:17.800 --> 02:24:19.900]   And he'd have these rules associated
[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:21.000]   when there were vertices
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:22.780]   and when there were particles splitting off
[02:24:22.780 --> 02:24:24.100]   from one another and all that.
[02:24:24.100 --> 02:24:25.780]   And it looked a little bit
[02:24:25.780 --> 02:24:27.820]   like a bunch of a hodgepodge at first,
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:31.340]   but to those who learned the rules and understood them,
[02:24:31.340 --> 02:24:35.080]   they saw that you could do these complex calculations
[02:24:35.080 --> 02:24:37.100]   in a much simpler way.
[02:24:37.100 --> 02:24:38.660]   And indeed, in some ways,
[02:24:38.660 --> 02:24:41.580]   Freeman Dyson had an even better knack
[02:24:41.580 --> 02:24:44.460]   for explaining really what quantum electrodynamics
[02:24:44.460 --> 02:24:46.060]   actually was.
[02:24:46.060 --> 02:24:49.060]   But I didn't know Freeman Dyson, I knew Feynman.
[02:24:49.060 --> 02:24:51.740]   Maybe he did have a more intuitive view of the world
[02:24:51.740 --> 02:24:52.820]   than Feynman did.
[02:24:52.820 --> 02:24:54.500]   But of the people I knew,
[02:24:54.500 --> 02:24:56.940]   Feynman was the most intuitive,
[02:24:56.940 --> 02:24:58.820]   most sort of, is there a picture?
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:25:00.900]   Is there a simple way you can understand this?
[02:25:00.900 --> 02:25:05.700]   And in the path that a particle follows even,
[02:25:05.700 --> 02:25:07.600]   you can figure out the,
[02:25:07.600 --> 02:25:09.900]   you can get the classical path,
[02:25:09.900 --> 02:25:12.140]   at least for a baseball or something like that,
[02:25:12.140 --> 02:25:14.420]   by using quantum physics if you want.
[02:25:14.420 --> 02:25:16.500]   But in a sense,
[02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:19.740]   the baseball sniffs out all possible paths.
[02:25:19.740 --> 02:25:21.340]   It goes out to the Andromeda galaxy
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:22.940]   and then goes to the batter.
[02:25:22.940 --> 02:25:26.380]   But the probability of doing that is very, very small
[02:25:26.380 --> 02:25:30.380]   because tiny little paths next door to any given path
[02:25:30.380 --> 02:25:32.280]   cancel out that path.
[02:25:32.280 --> 02:25:35.820]   And the ones that all add together,
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:38.860]   they're the ones that are more likely to be followed.
[02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:42.020]   And this actually ties in with Fermat's
[02:25:42.020 --> 02:25:43.700]   principle of least action.
[02:25:43.700 --> 02:25:47.380]   And there are ideas in optics that go into this as well.
[02:25:47.380 --> 02:25:50.500]   And it just sort of beautifully brings everything together.
[02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:53.960]   But the particle sniffs out all possible paths.
[02:25:53.960 --> 02:25:54.980]   What a crazy idea.
[02:25:54.980 --> 02:25:57.720]   But if you do the mathematics associated with that,
[02:25:57.720 --> 02:26:00.780]   it ends up being actually useful,
[02:26:00.780 --> 02:26:02.700]   a useful way of looking at the world.
[02:26:02.700 --> 02:26:06.100]   - So you're also, I mean, you're widely acknowledged as,
[02:26:06.100 --> 02:26:07.460]   I mean, outside of your science work
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:12.100]   as being one of the greatest educators in the world.
[02:26:12.100 --> 02:26:16.100]   And Feynman is famous for being that.
[02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:19.060]   Is there something about being a teacher that you--
[02:26:19.060 --> 02:26:21.000]   - Well, it's very, very rewarding
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:23.040]   when you have students who are really into it.
[02:26:23.040 --> 02:26:25.900]   And going back to Feynman,
[02:26:25.900 --> 02:26:28.260]   at Caltech I was taking these graduate courses
[02:26:28.260 --> 02:26:32.000]   and there were two of us, myself and Jeff Richman,
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:33.460]   who's now a professor of physics
[02:26:33.460 --> 02:26:36.020]   at University of California, Santa Barbara,
[02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:37.900]   who asked lots of questions.
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:40.240]   And a lot of the Caltech students
[02:26:40.240 --> 02:26:42.380]   are nervous about asking questions.
[02:26:42.380 --> 02:26:43.900]   They wanna save face.
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:46.380]   They seem to think that if they ask a question,
[02:26:46.380 --> 02:26:49.440]   their peers might think it's a stupid question.
[02:26:49.440 --> 02:26:51.420]   Well, I didn't really care what people thought
[02:26:51.420 --> 02:26:52.540]   and Jeff Richman didn't either.
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:53.980]   And we'd ask all these questions.
[02:26:53.980 --> 02:26:57.420]   And in fact, in many cases, they were quite good questions.
[02:26:57.420 --> 02:26:58.980]   And Feynman said, well, the rest of you
[02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:00.620]   should be having questions like this.
[02:27:00.620 --> 02:27:04.740]   And I remember one time in particular when he said,
[02:27:05.940 --> 02:27:06.940]   he said to the rest of the class,
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:08.900]   why is it always these two?
[02:27:08.900 --> 02:27:11.980]   Aren't the rest of you curious about what I'm saying?
[02:27:11.980 --> 02:27:14.520]   Do you really understand it all that well?
[02:27:14.520 --> 02:27:16.020]   If so, why aren't you asking
[02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:18.280]   the next most logical question?
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:21.580]   No, you guys are too scared to ask these questions
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:23.220]   that these two are asking.
[02:27:23.220 --> 02:27:26.380]   So he actually invited us to lunch a couple of times
[02:27:26.380 --> 02:27:29.820]   where just the three of us sat and had lunch
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:33.540]   with one of the greatest thinkers of 20th century physics.
[02:27:33.540 --> 02:27:35.780]   And so, yeah, he rubbed off on me
[02:27:35.780 --> 02:27:37.460]   and-- - So you encourage questions
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:39.060]   as well? - I encourage questions.
[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:40.540]   (laughing)
[02:27:40.540 --> 02:27:42.060]   Yeah, definitely.
[02:27:42.060 --> 02:27:44.860]   I mean, I encourage questions.
[02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:47.060]   I like it when students ask questions.
[02:27:47.060 --> 02:27:49.420]   I tell them that they shouldn't feel shy
[02:27:49.420 --> 02:27:51.060]   about asking a question.
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:53.140]   Probably half the students in the class
[02:27:53.140 --> 02:27:54.340]   would have that same question
[02:27:54.340 --> 02:27:56.620]   if they even understood the material enough
[02:27:56.620 --> 02:27:59.180]   to ask that question, yeah.
[02:27:59.180 --> 02:28:02.140]   - Curiosity is the first step of--
[02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:03.500]   - Absolutely. - Of seeing
[02:28:03.500 --> 02:28:04.500]   the beauty of something.
[02:28:04.500 --> 02:28:08.900]   So yeah, and the question is the ultimate form of curiosity.
[02:28:08.900 --> 02:28:09.980]   - Yeah.
[02:28:09.980 --> 02:28:13.040]   - Let me ask, what is the meaning of life?
[02:28:13.040 --> 02:28:16.020]   - The meaning of life, you know--
[02:28:16.020 --> 02:28:17.580]   - From a cosmologist's perspective
[02:28:17.580 --> 02:28:19.820]   or from a human perspective? - Or from my personal,
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:23.260]   you know, life is what you make of it, really, right?
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:27.380]   Each of us has to have our own meaning.
[02:28:27.380 --> 02:28:31.500]   And it doesn't have to be,
[02:28:31.500 --> 02:28:33.460]   well, I think that in many cases,
[02:28:33.460 --> 02:28:36.180]   meaning is to some degree associated with goals.
[02:28:36.180 --> 02:28:38.980]   You set some goals or expectations for yourself,
[02:28:38.980 --> 02:28:42.800]   things you want to accomplish, things you wanna do,
[02:28:42.800 --> 02:28:44.260]   things you wanna experience.
[02:28:44.260 --> 02:28:47.240]   And to the degree that you experience those
[02:28:47.240 --> 02:28:50.700]   and do those things, it can give you meaning.
[02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:53.420]   You don't have to change the world
[02:28:53.420 --> 02:28:56.580]   the way Newton or Michelangelo or da Vinci did.
[02:28:56.580 --> 02:28:58.620]   I mean, people often say, "You changed the world."
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:00.780]   But look, come on, there's seven and a half,
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:02.500]   close to eight billion of us now.
[02:29:02.500 --> 02:29:04.380]   Most of us are not gonna change the world.
[02:29:04.380 --> 02:29:05.980]   And does that mean that most of us
[02:29:05.980 --> 02:29:07.740]   are leading meaningful lives?
[02:29:07.740 --> 02:29:12.460]   No, it just has to be something that gives you meaning,
[02:29:12.460 --> 02:29:15.040]   that gives you satisfaction,
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:17.420]   that gives you a good feeling about what you did.
[02:29:17.420 --> 02:29:20.780]   And often, based on human nature,
[02:29:20.780 --> 02:29:23.900]   which can be very good and also very bad,
[02:29:23.900 --> 02:29:27.100]   but often it's the things that help others
[02:29:27.100 --> 02:29:31.580]   that give us meaning and a feeling of satisfaction.
[02:29:31.580 --> 02:29:33.580]   You taught someone to read.
[02:29:33.580 --> 02:29:36.580]   You cared for someone who was terminally ill.
[02:29:36.580 --> 02:29:38.660]   You brought up a nice family.
[02:29:38.660 --> 02:29:40.860]   You brought up your kids.
[02:29:40.860 --> 02:29:42.100]   You did a good job.
[02:29:42.100 --> 02:29:44.360]   You put your heart and soul into it.
[02:29:44.360 --> 02:29:48.080]   You read a lot of books, if that's what you wanted to do,
[02:29:48.080 --> 02:29:50.700]   had a lot of perspectives on life.
[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:53.900]   You traveled the world, if that's what you wanted to do.
[02:29:53.900 --> 02:29:57.620]   But if some of these things are not within reach,
[02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:00.380]   you're in a socioeconomic position
[02:30:00.380 --> 02:30:02.820]   where you can't travel the world or whatever,
[02:30:02.820 --> 02:30:05.500]   you find other forms of meaning.
[02:30:05.500 --> 02:30:10.940]   It doesn't have to be some profound,
[02:30:10.940 --> 02:30:13.220]   I'm gonna change the world,
[02:30:13.220 --> 02:30:17.020]   I'm gonna be the one who everyone remembers type thing.
[02:30:17.020 --> 02:30:20.020]   - In the context of the greatest story ever told,
[02:30:20.020 --> 02:30:22.380]   like the fact that we came from stars
[02:30:22.380 --> 02:30:30.060]   and now we're two apes asking about the meaning of life.
[02:30:30.060 --> 02:30:31.460]   How does that fit together?
[02:30:31.460 --> 02:30:34.660]   How does that make any sense?
[02:30:34.660 --> 02:30:35.860]   - It does, it does.
[02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:38.220]   And this is sort of what I was referring to,
[02:30:38.220 --> 02:30:41.260]   that it's a beautiful universe
[02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:45.360]   that allows us to come into creation.
[02:30:45.360 --> 02:30:50.460]   It's a way that the universe found of knowing,
[02:30:50.460 --> 02:30:51.880]   of understanding itself.
[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:56.060]   Because I don't think that inanimate rocks and stars
[02:30:56.060 --> 02:30:59.620]   and black holes and things have any real capability
[02:30:59.620 --> 02:31:04.220]   of abstract thoughts and of learning
[02:31:04.220 --> 02:31:08.540]   about the rest of the universe or even their origins.
[02:31:08.540 --> 02:31:10.540]   I mean, they're just a pile of atoms
[02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:15.540]   that has no conscience, has no ability to think,
[02:31:15.540 --> 02:31:18.140]   has no ability to explore.
[02:31:18.140 --> 02:31:20.300]   And we do.
[02:31:20.300 --> 02:31:25.300]   And I'm not saying we're the epitome of all life forever,
[02:31:25.300 --> 02:31:29.500]   but at least for life on earth so far,
[02:31:29.500 --> 02:31:32.340]   the evidence suggests that we are the epitome
[02:31:32.340 --> 02:31:35.940]   in terms of the richness of our thoughts,
[02:31:35.940 --> 02:31:38.900]   the degree to which we can explore the universe,
[02:31:38.900 --> 02:31:43.060]   do experiments, build machines, understand our origins.
[02:31:43.060 --> 02:31:48.060]   And I just hope that we use science for good, not evil,
[02:31:48.060 --> 02:31:50.660]   and that we don't end up destroying ourselves.
[02:31:50.660 --> 02:31:53.980]   I mean, the whales and dolphins are plenty intelligent.
[02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:58.140]   They don't ask abstract questions, they don't read books,
[02:31:58.140 --> 02:32:00.660]   but on the other hand, they're not in any danger
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:03.340]   of destroying themselves and everything else as well.
[02:32:03.340 --> 02:32:06.040]   And so maybe that's a better form of intelligence,
[02:32:06.040 --> 02:32:10.160]   but at least in terms of our ability to explore
[02:32:10.160 --> 02:32:13.060]   and make use of our minds.
[02:32:13.060 --> 02:32:16.180]   I mean, to me, it's this.
[02:32:16.180 --> 02:32:21.180]   It's this that gives me the potential for meaning, right?
[02:32:21.180 --> 02:32:24.460]   The fact that I can understand and explore.
[02:32:24.460 --> 02:32:25.860]   - It's kind of fascinating to think
[02:32:25.860 --> 02:32:27.580]   that the universe created us,
[02:32:27.580 --> 02:32:33.980]   and eventually we've built telescopes to look back at it,
[02:32:33.980 --> 02:32:35.620]   to look back at its origins
[02:32:35.620 --> 02:32:39.620]   and to wonder how the heck the thing works.
[02:32:39.620 --> 02:32:41.380]   - It's magnificent.
[02:32:41.380 --> 02:32:44.140]   Needn't have been that way, right?
[02:32:44.140 --> 02:32:47.700]   And this is one of the multiverse sort of things.
[02:32:47.700 --> 02:32:50.420]   You can alter the laws of physics
[02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:52.580]   or even the constants of nature,
[02:32:52.580 --> 02:32:54.820]   seemingly inconsequential things
[02:32:54.820 --> 02:32:57.900]   like the mass ratio of the proton and the neutron.
[02:32:57.900 --> 02:32:59.660]   Wake me up when it's over, right?
[02:32:59.660 --> 02:33:00.980]   What could be more boring?
[02:33:00.980 --> 02:33:03.300]   But it turns out you play with things a little bit
[02:33:03.300 --> 02:33:06.580]   like the ratio of the mass of the neutron to the proton,
[02:33:06.580 --> 02:33:09.780]   and you generally get boring universes,
[02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:12.460]   only hydrogen or only helium or only iron.
[02:33:12.460 --> 02:33:14.700]   You don't even get the rich periodic table,
[02:33:14.700 --> 02:33:19.700]   let alone bacteria, paramecia, slugs, and humans, okay?
[02:33:19.700 --> 02:33:23.900]   I'm not even anthropocentralizing this
[02:33:23.900 --> 02:33:25.220]   to the degree that I could.
[02:33:25.220 --> 02:33:29.300]   Even a rich periodic table wouldn't be possible
[02:33:29.300 --> 02:33:33.700]   if certain constants weren't this way, but they are.
[02:33:33.700 --> 02:33:37.660]   And that to me leads to the idea of a multiverse
[02:33:37.660 --> 02:33:39.980]   that the dice were thrown many, many times,
[02:33:39.980 --> 02:33:41.900]   and there's this cosmic archipelago
[02:33:41.900 --> 02:33:43.980]   where most of the universes are boring,
[02:33:43.980 --> 02:33:45.580]   and some might be more interesting,
[02:33:45.580 --> 02:33:48.180]   but we are in the rare breed
[02:33:48.180 --> 02:33:51.580]   that's really quite darn interesting.
[02:33:51.580 --> 02:33:54.500]   And if there were only one, and maybe there is only one,
[02:33:54.500 --> 02:33:56.940]   well, then that's truly amazing.
[02:33:56.940 --> 02:33:57.860]   - We're lucky.
[02:33:57.860 --> 02:34:00.420]   - We're lucky, but I actually think there are lots and lots,
[02:34:00.420 --> 02:34:02.860]   just like there are lots of planets,
[02:34:02.860 --> 02:34:05.740]   Earth isn't special for any particular reason,
[02:34:05.740 --> 02:34:07.740]   there are lots of planets in our solar system,
[02:34:07.740 --> 02:34:09.660]   and especially around other stars,
[02:34:09.660 --> 02:34:11.300]   and occasionally there are gonna be ones
[02:34:11.300 --> 02:34:14.700]   that are conducive to the development of complexity
[02:34:14.700 --> 02:34:16.900]   culminating in life as we know it.
[02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:19.820]   And that's a beautiful story.
[02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:21.740]   - I don't think there's a better way to end it, Alex.
[02:34:21.740 --> 02:34:22.940]   It's a huge honor.
[02:34:22.940 --> 02:34:25.260]   One of my favorite conversations I've had in this podcast.

[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:23.980]   The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth,
[02:35:23.980 --> 02:35:28.420]   the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies
[02:35:28.420 --> 02:35:32.220]   were made in the interiors of collapsing stars.
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:34.680]   We are made of star stuff.
[02:35:34.680 --> 02:35:38.820]   Thank you for listening, and hope to see you next time.
