[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   Well, today we have a really important question about how we should think of the recorded
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.520]   words of Christ in our Bibles.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.000]   Do we have the actual words of Christ, or do we have a paraphrase of what he said?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.640]   The question is from Reston, who lives in Newton, Iowa.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.060]   "Pastor John, as I continue to study the Bible, and specifically the actual text and
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.560]   transmission of the Bible itself, I keep returning to a debate over two Latin phrases.
[00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:35.360]   Ipsima verba, the very words, and Ipsima vox, the very voice or the gist of the words.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.320]   The debate is whether or not the Gospel writers give us the exact words spoken by Christ or
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.900]   the paraphrased gist of Jesus' words.
[00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.520]   What do you think, and what bearing does it have on our Bible interpretation?"
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:54.700]   This question takes me back almost 50 years to the three years that I spent at the University
[00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.920]   of Munich in Germany, 1971 to 1974, working on a dissertation about the words of Jesus
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.920]   in Matthew and Luke, "Love Your Enemies."
[00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:15.400]   To write a dissertation for a German university in the 1970s about the words of Jesus was
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.480]   to be presented with this very question all the time.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:29.040]   Can we peel away the layers of tradition and get back to the Ipsisma verba of Jesus, the
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.440]   very words of Jesus?
[00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:39.800]   So I had to immerse myself in the kind of scholarship that developed methods, formgeschichte,
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.160]   redaktionsgeschichte, literaturgeschichte, sachkritik.
[00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:51.600]   You have to immerse yourself in these things because that's the way the work was done,
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.960]   to peel away the layers and try to get to the Ipsisma verba.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.200]   Now if you wonder whether I had a crisis of faith, you might be surprised about the nature
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.960]   of the crisis.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.800]   It wasn't a crisis of my belief in the truth and worth of Scripture, but a crisis of my
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.120]   belief in the truth and worth of such academic scholarship.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.520]   It really was a crisis.
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.720]   What was I doing?
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.040]   And what was—what had they done for two centuries in this country, Germany, and everywhere
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.160]   else that was influenced by higher criticism?
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.080]   It went something like this.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.600]   Article after article that I read and book after book began and was pervaded by the words
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:46.560]   "wahrscheinlich" and "vielleicht," "probably" and "perhaps."
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:53.600]   And yet they tended at the end of the article, at the end of the book, to move toward what
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.760]   were called the assured results of critical studies.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.760]   And I could never see a clear path.
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:09.200]   How did you get from all those "probablys" and all those "perhapses" to this so-called
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.400]   assured results of scholarship?
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.400]   It all looked like historical guesswork to me.
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.760]   And to my mind, they were not at all assured because they were built on guesses over and
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.880]   over and over again.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.960]   That's what gave them the appearance of scholarship.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:34.600]   And as a Christian who had come to trust in Jesus Christ as the Lord, Savior, treasure
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.940]   of my life, who had stood forth from the Bible with such compelling evidence to my mind and
[00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:50.600]   heart as real and reliable, I knew there must be a better way and more reliable way to come
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.800]   to a conviction about the truth of the person and the teachings and the work, the words
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.200]   of Jesus.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.040]   What was at stake for me—this was the crisis—what was at stake for me was not whether Christ
[00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.840]   was real and the New Testament was true.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.400]   What was at stake was whether any missionaries would give their lives for guesswork.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.480]   I mean, really, scholars, come on!
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.040]   What's going to happen on Sunday morning with pastors who believe what you believe,
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.080]   who don't believe what you don't believe, who handle the Bible the way you do?
[00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:26.080]   Nothing's going to happen.
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:27.080]   That's what's going to happen.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.680]   There's going to be no missionaries.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.640]   Nobody will give their life for this kind of guesswork.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.720]   So that's background.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.920]   That's what came to my mind when I read this question.
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:44.160]   Let me say three things about the ipsissima verba, the very words of Jesus.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:52.200]   First, we do not know what language Jesus spoke in every conversation and every teaching
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.960]   moment of his life.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.640]   He could speak in Greek.
[00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.020]   He could speak in Aramaic.
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.080]   He could speak in Hebrew.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.440]   But there is very good evidence that at least some of the time—most scholars would say
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.840]   most of the time, so a little bit of guesswork going on here, right?—he was speaking in
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.480]   Aramaic.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.120]   The ordinary Semitic language of Galilee, Judea, at the time.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.240]   Some of the evidence for that is that the gospel writers preserved some of his Aramaic
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   words.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.840]   Talath ha-Kum, Mark 5.41.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.640]   Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani, on the cross, Mark 5.15.34.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.880]   Efaphtha, open, Mark 7.34.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.960]   Abba, Mark 14.36.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:44.400]   These leftovers from Aramaic cause most scholars to say he probably spoke most of the time
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.280]   in Aramaic, which was a Semitic.
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.040]   It was related to Hebrew, very much like Hebrew in Judea, Galilee at that time.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.200]   Which means we probably don't have the very words of Jesus in all the time because he
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.280]   didn't speak in Greek, and what we have is Greek.
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.160]   The New Testament was written in Greek originally, and we read it in our translations.
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.840]   And so even if he sometimes taught in Greek, which he may well have, readers of English
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.100]   today don't have the very words because they're reading English.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.040]   So that's the first observation.
[00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   Ipsissima verba, probably not, because he spoke in Aramaic and nobody reads Aramaic
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:30.640]   when they read the Greek New Testament today, which is the way they were written.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:39.280]   So second observation, what is essential in connecting us reliably with the mind of Christ,
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:46.640]   what he really intended to communicate when he taught, is not the very words but the very
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:55.880]   meaning, the very intention that he had when he communicated with whatever words he used.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.960]   Creating meaning, intention, is essential.
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.280]   Words are means to that end.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.920]   So here's an example.
[00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:13.360]   What if you sent a friend to ask me if I thought you should purchase a subscription to a certain
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.960]   video service?
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:23.000]   And he reports back to you in writing in an email, "John said, 'Yeah, I am sure that
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.920]   would be a great use of your money.'"
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:31.980]   Now those are my very words.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:38.040]   But what if I had said them to your friend like this, "Yeah, I'm sure that would be
[00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.000]   a great use of your money."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.800]   The meaning, the intention of my words is, "Don't be stupid.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.440]   Don't waste your money on that subscription."
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:56.360]   So the point is, my very words may not carry my meaning.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:59.720]   People need to realize this about language.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:07.640]   Meaning and language are not the same, and we need to be alert to how language communicates
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   intention.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.560]   I want to know what Jesus meant, what he intended me to understand.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:22.800]   Whether I have his very words or not is relatively unimportant compared to, are the words that
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:29.140]   God used to communicate the meaning of Jesus doing that for us?
[00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:35.540]   The second point, then, is that we must not assume it is better to have the very words
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:43.680]   of Jesus than it is to have an accurate and faithful rendering of the meaning and the
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:49.880]   mind of Christ guaranteed by God in the inspiration of the Scripture.
[00:08:49.880 --> 00:08:52.360]   So here's the third observation.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:09:00.240]   The Bible itself presents us with a doctrine, a teaching, about its own inspiration by God
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:09.660]   and its truthfulness and reliability, which secures for us not the less important very
[00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:18.440]   words of Jesus in Aramaic or Greek or Hebrew, but a true and reliable communication of what
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:25.780]   Jesus meant, what he intended to communicate with the words that he used.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.580]   Do we have that now truthfully and faithfully communicated in the language of Scripture,
[00:09:32.580 --> 00:09:33.580]   Greek and Hebrew?
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.860]   And the answer is yes.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:42.620]   And I've tried to gather all my thoughts about these things, that how we know the Bible
[00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:49.000]   is true in a book written a few years ago called A Peculiar Glory, how the Christian
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.220]   Scriptures reveal their complete truthfulness.
[00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.220]   I recommend that.
[00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:58.860]   If you want to go deeper into how I think the Bible shows itself to be true, that's
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:02.380]   where I tried to say it all that I understood.
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:12.860]   My argument is that God has provided a self-authenticating Scripture which enables the simplest believer
[00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:20.540]   by the Holy Spirit through the divine marks and evidences of the Scripture itself to know
[00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:29.820]   that they are true and to know with such confidence that they can justly give their lives for
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.820]   this truth.
[00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:37.740]   So, let me close with one paragraph from that book about the message of Jesus in the New
[00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:39.140]   Testament in particular.
[00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:40.580]   It goes like this.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:47.180]   "Jesus came to bear witness to the truth," John 18, 37, "with all authority, with all
[00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.980]   the authority of God," John 17, 2, Matthew 28, 18.
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:59.620]   "He planned and prepared that truth and authority to be preserved through a band of
[00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:06.220]   apostles whom he would guide by his Spirit into all the truth needed for the foundation
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:13.860]   and preservation of his church," John 14, 25, 16, 12, Ephesians 2, 20, 1 Corinthians
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:14.860]   2, 13.
[00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:21.780]   "In perfect harmony with God's will for Christ and Christ's will for his church,
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:28.620]   those spokesmen," those apostolic spokesmen, "put their teachings into writing with a sober,
[00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:34.180]   conscious sense that what they wrote for the church," including the record of Jesus'
[00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:40.860]   teaching in the Gospels, "would be her infallible charter till Jesus would come again."
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.380]   End of the paragraph that I quoted.
[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:49.460]   So I conclude that, for the most part, not having his very words is not a loss for the
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:57.020]   church, since he himself planned that there would be preserved for us a faithful and true
[00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:03.260]   and infallible writing of what he wanted communicated.
[00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:04.260]   Really good.
[00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:06.580]   Thank you, Pastor John, for walking us through this debate and how you've thought through
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:08.500]   it over the years.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.500]   Appreciate that.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:10.500]   And thank you for listening.
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.020]   You can find those episodes in our archive or submit a question to us, like Reston did
[00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:14.020]   today.
[00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:15.020]   Do all that online at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:22.260]   Well, it's Christmas week, and we have two episodes coming up on Christmas themes.
[00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:26.420]   On Wednesday, we're going to look at the fundamental question over why Christ needed a body to
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:27.940]   begin with, the incarnation.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:29.380]   That's on Wednesday.
[00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:34.500]   And then on Friday, we're going to address a question on the holiday itself and look
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:39.880]   at the Germanic roots for why we celebrate Christmas on December 25th, and should we
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:45.700]   celebrate the birth of Christ on what is basically a reclaimed pagan holiday.
[00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.700]   Two great questions.
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:47.700]   Should be a good week.
[00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.500]   I'm Tony Reinke, and we'll see you back here on Wednesday.
[00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.500]   You
[00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:53.500]   You
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.500]   You
[00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
