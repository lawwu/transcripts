[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.640]   So the question I want to dive into today is how do you follow through on transformative
[00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.640]   goals?
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.920]   Now, I mean something very specific by transformative goals.
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.880]   These aren't small goals, things you want to be better about.
[00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.960]   They're goals that if accomplished will have a remarkable change on your life.
[00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160]   And I mean remarkable literally in the sense that people will remark on the accomplishment
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160]   of this goal.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:25.160]   Oh, wow.
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.160]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.160]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.480]   Isn't that impressive?
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.400]   So if you followed along our recent discussions on the deep life stack, this is what you do
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.320]   at that very top layer of the stack where you finally after setting down the basics
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.160]   and your values and your discipline is where you finally make those big radical changes
[00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:43.160]   that are so impressive.
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.300]   So I thought we'd talk about that today.
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.920]   How do you succeed with your transformative goals?
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.680]   I'm going to take a two-part approach to this discussion.
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.640]   First I want to focus on why most people don't succeed with these type of big goals.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.800]   There are some common mistakes people make, we'll name them.
[00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.600]   Then I want to talk about a particular methodology for having a much higher hit rate with hard
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.600]   goals.
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.360]   I'm going to take the notion of reverse goal setting and I'm going to complicate it with
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.120]   my own secret sauce with a couple of examples along the way.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.200]   After that, we got some questions from listeners on these type of topics.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200]   So stick around for that.
[00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.920]   So let's get started.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.000]   People like the idea of having these transformative goals.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.360]   Most people don't succeed with them.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.360]   What's going on?
[00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.600]   There's three common mistakes that I want to point out to get started.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.680]   The first common mistake is under estimating effort.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.360]   So you underestimate how much effort is actually required to accomplish the goal that you're
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.520]   setting out to tackle.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.100]   There's a couple of forms of this that's pretty popular.
[00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.240]   One is what I like to call checklist productivity.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.340]   This was this concept that sort of emerged in the early 2000s and productivity circles
[00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.520]   and online productivity circles.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.440]   And it was this idea that the main thing that differentiates people who accomplish hard
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.920]   interesting things and those who don't is information.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.040]   So this checklist productivity idea leads people to believe if I just get the right
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:13.080]   system, that's a little more complicated, maybe uses technology in ways that other people
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.400]   don't know how to do.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.800]   And I execute this system step by step, I will get the really cool, impressive thing.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.480]   So this is checklist productivity.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.840]   We see a lot of this even today.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.160]   If you spend any time on Twitter, you've probably seen more and more people have these Twitter
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.180]   threads where they say, okay, I'm going to break down the key ideas from X.
[00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.680]   And it's like 15 tweets in a row.
[00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.560]   And at the bottom of it says, if you like what you saw here, please subscribe because
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.980]   I do lots of threads like this or something like that.
[00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.160]   Why is everyone suddenly doing these same threads?
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.440]   There's some checklist productivity idea out there that look, if you just do these things,
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.400]   do these Twitter threads, breaking down popular books, ask for subscriptions, your user base
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.560]   is going to grow and grow and you're going to be influential.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.480]   So we see that checklist productivity idea a lot.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.000]   It leads us to believe it's not that hard to accomplish hard goals.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.880]   You just have to have the right system.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.180]   The other thing that drives us to underestimate effort is the algorithmic lottery effect.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.940]   So this is where we have goals that have a perceived low barrier of entry and a hard
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:16.120]   to predict outcome.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.300]   So I call this the algorithmic lottery effect because we see this a lot with YouTube.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.060]   We see this a lot with TikTok.
[00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.560]   It's why not me?
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.960]   You know, you never know.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.880]   I could be doing some videos on TikTok and it could just take off and I could be famous.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.400]   And you would never have this sort of delusion around being a star basketball player because
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.160]   you're like, okay, I know what it means to be really good at basketball.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.320]   I know how good I am.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.920]   Oh my God, I'm never going to get that good or I'm not practicing nearly enough.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.640]   There's a very high perceived barrier to entry, but with the algorithmic lottery, especially
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.480]   with this online type activity, it often seems like, wow, this seems so plausible.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.560]   It's why if you talk to a middle schooler or a high schooler today, I hear this from
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.600]   teachers all the time.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.600]   So many of them now have career aspirations built around being an online influencer because
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.200]   why it seems so accessible.
[00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.920]   You never know.
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.520]   Start doing videos and something clicks.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.920]   So because of checklist productivity, because of algorithmic lottery, it's easy to underestimate
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.800]   the effort required to accomplish the hard goal.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.240]   So then you go and follow your checklist or put out your TikTok videos and wait to become
[00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.240]   famous.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:22.240]   It doesn't work.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240]   And then you give up.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.720]   The reality of course, is that cool things are desirable.
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.240]   If there's a straightforward way to get there, everyone would do it.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.080]   It's like having a mythical traffic shortcut in a congested city like Washington, DC.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   It doesn't exist.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.800]   If there was a way to get around the backup that happens when you're heading eastbound
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.440]   from 66 on 495 in the afternoon, where you lose that lane on the bridge, if there was
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.200]   a way around that, people would find it and it would be just as congested.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.560]   No, you can't go on River Road and expect to get around that 30 minute backup.
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.160]   There is no magical shortcut that you were going to find because you have the right information.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.440]   The same comes for almost any actual hard accomplishment.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.640]   So you have to get used to the time or to the idea that your transformative goal is
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.400]   going to be hard and it's going to take a lot of time.
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.840]   There's not an internet based shortcut that's going to get you around.
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:22.680]   The second common mistake people make with transformative goals is writing a story.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.520]   You write a story about what is required to succeed with the goal that speaks to what
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520]   you want to be true.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.200]   And it could be completely divorced from the reality of how people succeed with this goal,
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.360]   but you like the story.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:35.800]   You like what it asks you to do.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:37.080]   It's hard, but not too hard.
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.920]   It's flexible, but not too scary.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.340]   It avoids the things that you don't really want to deal with.
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.200]   You write yourself a story about what is required to accomplish your goal.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.440]   You fall in love with this story.
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.600]   You really want that story to be true.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.120]   And so you follow that story.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.560]   But it's not a true story and it doesn't get you to the goal and it fizzles out.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:59.680]   I had a long back and forth with someone last year that reminded me of exactly this fallacy
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.800]   of someone who really wanted to write a successful nonfiction book.
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.000]   And he had a particular topic he wanted to write about.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.800]   And he was like, "Oh, can I ask for your advice?"
[00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.600]   He's like, "Yeah, I can tell you how the nonfiction book world works.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:16.280]   I've sold 10 books at this point, published seven with my eighth about to come out."
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.560]   And so we talked to him and he's like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.840]   That's not what I'm going to do.
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.600]   Here is how I'm going to be successful as a nonfiction book writer.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.680]   I'm going to write the book myself.
[00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.360]   I'm going to self-publish it.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.000]   And then there's this firm I found that I can hire that's going to do all this publicity
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.920]   around my self-published book.
[00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.400]   And it's going to get a lot of people to buy the self-published book.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.600]   And then we're going to come to the publishing houses and say, "Look at all these sales we
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.800]   have and they're going to give us this great deal and push the book wide."
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:45.960]   I said, "Well, that's just not going to work.
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.000]   People just don't buy self-published.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.320]   They're not going to buy your self-published book.
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.920]   And it doesn't matter what this firm does.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.240]   But also why do that?
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.520]   All of these big publishing houses are desperate for books they can publish.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:57.760]   Pipeline is everything in the world of consolidated publishing.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:01.060]   You need a big pipeline of feasible books.
[00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:05.200]   If your book had any chance of being a big book, people would be happy to publish it.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.720]   They need books.
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.580]   So why would you not just go straight to the publisher with it?"
[00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.780]   But he liked this story and he wouldn't give up this story.
[00:07:12.780 --> 00:07:16.240]   And if you really pushed on it, I think he liked the story because going to the publisher
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.480]   would have this moment of clarity and rejection early on.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.120]   You might get the feedback of, "You're not ready with this book yet.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:24.120]   This idea is not here.
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.520]   Why are you writing about this?
[00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:30.040]   This is not a book that's at the level it needs to be to be a successful book."
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.360]   And I think he liked the story where, "No, what's really happening is the gatekeepers
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.800]   just don't understand me.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:38.640]   And if I deploy systems and resources in clever ways, I can get around that.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.160]   And then they'll have to see that the book is successful.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.480]   You write the story you want to be true."
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.880]   The reality, of course, is that paths to hard thing are often very, very specific.
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.280]   You need to know exactly what matters and that's where you need to put your energy.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.440]   Otherwise, you are going to dissipate energy out into the atmosphere and most of it won't
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:58.240]   actually lead towards forward progress.
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:03.120]   The third issue people have when trying to go after transformative goals is wandering
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.960]   randomly forward.
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:12.360]   So by this, I mean you choose a next thing to do that seems like it's vaguely relevant
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.360]   to your goal.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:15.760]   Like, "Let me just do this.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.800]   This feels like something will come out of this.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.440]   This will move me closer to my goal.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.600]   I just want to focus on what I can do next."
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.520]   The classic example of this that I'm always harping about on this show is, "Well, let
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.440]   me just go get a master's degree."
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.400]   It's vaguely in a field I'm interested in and maybe that's going to open up opportunities.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.280]   I don't really want to tell you exactly what those opportunities are.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.500]   Let me just go get the master's degree.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.880]   Or half-hearted side hustles.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:43.800]   "I'm going to do this thing in a field I'm interested in, kind of half-heartedly, but
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.640]   that might open something up.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   Maybe it'll hit a nerve.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   You never know.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.120]   This could lead to something big."
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:53.080]   You're sort of just taking a random step forward.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.400]   That's not part of a specific path.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.400]   Random step forward.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.320]   The problem with random steps forward is that your route becomes random itself and you wander
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.420]   all over this landscape and you're very unlikely to actually wander through the right twists
[00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:10.880]   and turns necessary to get to your destination of accomplishing the transformative goal.
[00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:13.960]   So you do these random things.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.880]   They do not aggregate cleanly.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.880]   The energy is dissipated.
[00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:20.120]   You never actually make it to the goal.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.400]   So if we think about this like orienteering, it's like up on this mountain top is where
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.660]   you're trying to get.
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.360]   If you just randomly take turns in various trails, you'll walk a lot, but you're unlikely
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:33.680]   to stumble up the exact path needed to get to the peak.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.040]   So these are the three main issues I think people have.
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:41.600]   Underestimating effort, writing the story they want to be true, and wandering randomly
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   forward.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:46.160]   None of these are very successful when it comes to accomplishing transformative goals.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.680]   So what does work?
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.360]   Well, I want to make a pitch for reverse goal setting.
[00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:54.200]   Hey, quick interruption.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:10:01.400]   If you want my free guide with my seven best ideas on how to cultivate the deep life, go
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:07.580]   to calnewport.com/ideas or click the link right below in the description.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:12.280]   This is a great way to take action on the type of things we talk about here on this
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.280]   show.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.280]   All right, let's get back to it.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:16.720]   It's an idea that's been bouncing around the internet.
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.120]   I have my own flavor of it, and that's the flavor that I want to present to you today.
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.720]   So what is reverse goal setting?
[00:10:22.720 --> 00:10:30.340]   You start with a transformative goal and you work backwards step by step until you get
[00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.760]   to your current situation.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:36.000]   So you're not trying to go forward like, well, what could I do next?
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.920]   And then after I did this, what else could I do?
[00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:39.040]   And then after that, what else can I do?
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.000]   It's actually very difficult if you're just trying to take forward steps to end up where
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.220]   you want to go.
[00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:49.160]   But when you work backwards, you can very directed get a relatively or the shortest
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.160]   possible path, at least to where you are today.
[00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:53.800]   Now, this is a tricky process because what does it mean to work backwards?
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.500]   And we'll do an example here in a second, but let me explain this to you in words first.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.980]   What it means to work backwards is, okay, I'm starting, let's say with the goal.
[00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:05.580]   Now I want to move backwards to the step right before the goal.
[00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:10.720]   So a state I could get to where I'm now one step away from accomplishing my goal.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.200]   And I want to actually specify the step and specify that link when I'm right here.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.720]   What is the concrete activity that gets me over this link to the goal?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:21.400]   And then you go one step back from that.
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:22.400]   All right.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:24.000]   So what's the step before the goal?
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.920]   What's the one step before that?
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.760]   And what's the clear concrete way to get from that two steps back to the one step back?
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:30.760]   All right.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.920]   Well, if I'm there, what's like one step back from this?
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:39.800]   So you're sort of peeling back progress and then very carefully saying, how would I actually
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.640]   add that back in?
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:44.920]   And when you create these links from step to step, you use evidence.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:45.920]   What is true?
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.920]   How would I actually get from this specific state to that specific state?
[00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:49.920]   This type of effort?
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:50.920]   How do I know it's that type of effort?
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   Because I looked into it.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   So you work backwards.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.720]   That was a little bit confusing.
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   So let's get concrete.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:00.520]   I'm going to actually bring up, I'll bring up my tablet here.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:07.800]   I'm going to write out a reverse goal, a reverse goal setting path for a sort of common type
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.000]   of goal someone could have.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Right.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.360]   So for those of you who are just listening, I can tell you what I'm actually doing here.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.000]   I'm going to write, I never can figure this out.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.640]   In theory, I'm going to write, how do I actually get to, there we go.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:27.080]   All right.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:29.320]   So I'm going to just draw out a reverse goal path.
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:35.120]   I'm going to start at the top of the screen with where we want to end up, right?
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:37.600]   Because we're working backwards.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.480]   So at the top of the screen, we're going to start with, how about notably in shape?
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.280]   All right.
[00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.560]   Transformative goal.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.840]   So what do I mean by notably in shape?
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:54.360]   Well, for this example, imagine what we mean by that is it's something people think about
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.360]   when they think about you.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.360]   You're like in really good shape.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:00.000]   Like when you're on the, at the beach, like people notice, like when people talk, your
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.920]   friends, like, oh, one of the things we know about, you know, one of the things we know
[00:13:03.920 --> 00:13:06.880]   about this guy is that like, he's, yeah, he's, he's like really in good shape.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:07.880]   Right?
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.320]   So like a notable thing, like a part of your identity, that's a transformative goal to
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:13.520]   be someone who's really in shape could really change a lot about your life.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:16.280]   All right, let's do reverse goal setting now.
[00:13:16.280 --> 00:13:19.360]   So we're going to work backwards step by step.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.960]   So as you see, if again, if you're watching on the screen, you'll see that I'm putting
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:27.140]   an arrow up towards this goal.
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:32.680]   So now we're going to write right under it, the step that comes right before ending up
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:36.040]   at this place of being notably in shape.
[00:13:36.040 --> 00:13:41.920]   And let's say here, I was thinking about this earlier, I'm lean and strong.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:44.520]   All right.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:47.880]   So we can imagine this is the final place before you make that push to be in really
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.680]   notable shape is like, I'm, you know, I'm pretty lean, you know, my weight is where
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.200]   I want it to be and I'm strong.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.200]   Like I lift stuff.
[00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:58.880]   I, I have a base on which I can do a pretty intense weightlifting routine.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:02.040]   And so how would you get from I'm lean and strong to notably in shape?
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.760]   That is one reasonable link.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.600]   And the way you would probably do that is, you know, you would hire a trainer at this
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:11.920]   point and the trainer would do the standard stuff you would see like a movie star do to
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.120]   prepare for a role.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:17.720]   If you're already generally lean and strong, so you're, you're, you're comfortable with
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.920]   weights, the trainer is going to come in and say, great, here's what we're going to do.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.000]   We're going to do this intense weightlifting routine.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.760]   There's going to be bulking followed by cutting.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.080]   There's like specific things you can do starting from that point.
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.560]   It would take about six months.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   Okay.
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.800]   So if you got to, I'm lean and strong, you could get to the, like, I'm notably in shape
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:35.320]   in four to six months and there's a, there's a specific way to do that.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:38.240]   All right, let's go down to the layer below now.
[00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:45.000]   So then how do you, what comes before getting in this particular example here?
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.960]   So what would come before lean and strong say a reasonable, man, my handwriting, Jesse
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   is fantastic.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.960]   I know what you're thinking.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:01.360]   You're thinking what professional font are you typing with Cal?
[00:15:01.360 --> 00:15:03.280]   I'm actually handwriting this.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:08.800]   You're saying what master calligrapher is hiding in the studio, writing your text.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:09.800]   That's me guys.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.040]   That beautiful handwriting is me.
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   All right.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:16.720]   So the step before lean and strong is maybe a reasonable weight and active.
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.600]   So you're like, you know, I'm I'm at a reasonable weight.
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.680]   Like maybe if I was overweight before now, I'm at like a reasonable weight and I'm active,
[00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:25.680]   right?
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.840]   Like I'm I'm not just completely sedentary because if you were there, how would you get
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.400]   from there to the step above being lean and strong?
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:38.160]   Well, you could get there probably by starting to be careful about your diet and exercising
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.160]   every day.
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:41.640]   So from a foundation of like, I'm like in a reasonable place, weight rise, I'm sort
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.400]   of moving, I'm active, I'm I'm walking.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.440]   I do a little bit of exercising.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.440]   From there, you could get to lean and strong by now.
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:51.960]   So now let me be specific about my diet and I'm going to exercise every day.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   Right.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   So we're moving down.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   We're moving.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   We're moving backwards.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.480]   Let's go one more layer down.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   All right.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:13.080]   So then this layer will say consistent health disciplines.
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:19.440]   I'm going to draw an arrow pointing into that because this is where the first thing we're
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.440]   going to start.
[00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:26.360]   So let's say now you're in a place where, well, I have some daily discipline I do related
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   to health.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:32.560]   You know, like I walk every morning or I, you know, whatever.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:35.600]   I don't drink on a weekday, like just some sort of consistent thing you're doing related
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.000]   to health, even if small, some sort of daily habit.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.440]   So we're going to we've moved down the stack.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.720]   So let's say this is the first place you start.
[00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.160]   If you're doing that now, you've added a little bit of discipline around health and fitness
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.240]   in your life.
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.280]   From there, it isn't too hard to get to reasonable weight and active, right?
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:55.200]   Because from, okay, I have some consistent health disciplines.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.920]   Now you can get to a, let me just upcharge those.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:02.080]   Let me just upgrade those to be a little bit more consistent about how I eat.
[00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.440]   Let me update the like daily thing.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.800]   If I do a hundred pushups to like I walk or do something, that's an easy step for my,
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:11.600]   I've added some discipline related to health in my life too.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.560]   I have a reasonable set of disciplines.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.360]   And so you could get from this layer to the next.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   And we'll say this bottom layer is then the first thing you would do.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.160]   So you start this whole process and I'm out of shape.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160]   I'm out of shape.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.160]   I don't think much about it.
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.240]   Somehow I want in the future to be notably in shape and be known for it.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:35.360]   By doing reverse goal setting, we have now given ourself a very believable concrete path
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.920]   forward where each linkage is evidence-based.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.680]   You start, so now we're going to read this whole thing forward.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:41.360]   So you start from, I'm just out of shape.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:42.360]   I'm overweight.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.600]   I'm not at all active.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:48.000]   We go to number one, some sort of consistent health discipline, something you do every
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   day.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.400]   This is all just about changing your mindset.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.960]   I am willing to do hard things in the moment for the future goals related to my health.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:01.280]   Once you're doing that, you upgrade to, okay, I have some actual substantial disciplines
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:02.280]   surrounding.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:03.440]   I'm going to clean up my diet.
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.720]   I'm going to have a much more notable daily activity.
[00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:10.600]   Once you're good with that, you move up to like, I'm actually exercising and have a specific
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.480]   diet that gets you lean and strong.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:18.200]   Then you hire the trainer and it's a Hemsworth time.
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.900]   That is a very reasonable path forward because we work backwards to get there.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.240]   We have much more chance of succeeding actually moving forward.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.400]   Now compare this to the fallacies that most people would typically apply.
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:35.480]   So if you applied with the same goal, the underestimating effort fallacy, you would
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:37.600]   be like, oh, there's just something I need to do.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.000]   I'm going to download some app on my phone and I'll just do that thing.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:43.800]   And then I'll look like Thor, right?
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:46.200]   So you underestimate the effort and that's not going to fail.
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   Think about writing the story.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   Okay.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:53.400]   What really matters is some complicated, you know, bro-y, diet-y thing where if I take
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:55.880]   this supplement or do this, you think there's some shortcut to it.
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.480]   That's not going to work.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.640]   Right?
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:02.720]   Same thing with our final one, which was wandering randomly, which is like, I don't know, I'm
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.200]   going to buy a Peloton.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.360]   All right.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:08.360]   Still don't look like Thor.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   All right.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:12.360]   I'm going to get kettlebells.
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.760]   Still don't look like Thor.
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:14.760]   Right?
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.120]   So all of those common fallacies would not lead you to be notably in shape.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.080]   Reverse goal setting, however, gave us a very specific path that because we work backwards,
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:23.840]   it's realistic.
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.280]   We don't get stuck.
[00:19:25.280 --> 00:19:26.280]   We don't wander off.
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:27.280]   All right.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:32.080]   So we have a reasonable evidence-based plan.
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:37.680]   There's another thing about reverse goal setting that I think is often not discussed, but is
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:44.080]   important, which is not only does it help you create better paths to your goals when
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.440]   done in the way I'm talking about here, it can also help you improve your goals themselves.
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:55.880]   It's actually sometimes non-trivial to come up with the appropriate transformative goals.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.240]   Not every transformative goal is possible, and some are possible, but maybe you don't
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:01.240]   actually want to do it.
[00:20:01.240 --> 00:20:06.400]   Reverse goal setting makes it easier to figure out when there are flaws in your goals.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:11.640]   There are two particular things to look for when creating a reverse goal setting path
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:16.720]   that should give you some pause and make you rethink how you think about your goal.
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.000]   So to highlight these two things, I want to do another example, reverse goal setting exercise
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   here.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.440]   And what I want to do now is start with something, a goal that we just sort of intuitively think,
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:29.960]   this probably isn't going to work out.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:33.860]   And so let's take an unreasonable, probably unreasonable goal.
[00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:37.680]   Let's reverse goal set and then point out, okay, where are the red flags in this path
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.640]   that would tell us we got to change what we're trying.
[00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.640]   All right.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.480]   So here's my sort of unreasonable goal that I'm going to tackle with goal setting.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:51.960]   100 million YouTube subscribers, right?
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:57.400]   So maybe you listen to some Mr. Beast interviews or you watch Mr. Beast videos like, look at
[00:20:57.400 --> 00:20:59.600]   this guy, a hundred million subscribers.
[00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:00.640]   It's just fantastic.
[00:21:00.640 --> 00:21:02.600]   He owns like a movie studio in North Carolina.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:04.480]   They have these warehouses full of things.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:05.480]   This seems like the life.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.240]   Let's say you're a 24 year old, like I want a hundred million YouTube subscribers.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:14.280]   And I've listened to Cal, I'm not going to just write a story about this or wander randomly
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:15.280]   forward.
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   Let's do some reverse goal setting.
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.440]   So let's apply the whole discipline to this goal, which is probably unreasonable.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.880]   And then we'll see where we get in trouble.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:22.880]   All right.
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:24.320]   So I worked this through the other day.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:27.360]   I was thinking through how would I actually reverse goal set this.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.600]   I would say the step before the a hundred million YouTube subs that's relevant is going
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:35.600]   to be a million subs.
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.500]   Because think about this.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:45.080]   If you have a channel of that size, a million subscriber YouTube channel, which are rare,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.380]   but not super rare.
[00:21:48.380 --> 00:21:51.720]   What you could do at that point to get to a hundred million is what Mr. Beast talks
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:54.220]   about if you ever heard him interviewed, which is okay.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:59.620]   Now you have to invest a huge amount of money into doing what you're doing right, even better.
[00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:01.040]   So like this is what Mr. Beast did.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:03.680]   He's like, okay, I have this formula for a video that's working.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:05.640]   I upgrade it.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.120]   If I before I was giving people a thousand dollars, now I'll give him a hundred thousand
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.120]   dollars.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:12.080]   If it was, you know, here's an iPad.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.100]   Now it's going to be a Lamborghini and a Tesla.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:18.380]   So he has this whole philosophy of take what's working and put all of the money you're making
[00:22:18.380 --> 00:22:23.160]   in your videos into making the new videos and push what's working to an extreme that
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:25.000]   almost no one else is doing.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:27.040]   That is how you get this extreme growth, right?
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:29.680]   So if you're already at a million subscribers, you're making money.
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.400]   You have the time at this point for this to be a full-time job or a part-time job.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:37.440]   You have the time and the money to go all in and push what's working to try to have
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:39.240]   that final bit of explosive growth.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.400]   So we'll make that the step before.
[00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.400]   All right.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.440]   Well, what comes before that?
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:49.320]   Well, just sort of based off our experience with YouTube, probably the next relevant goal
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:53.280]   below that would be a 50,000 sub channel.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.680]   All right.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:01.980]   So if you have 50,000 subs, that means something's working, right?
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:03.500]   Your voice, your content is working.
[00:23:03.500 --> 00:23:09.960]   You have a non-trivial audience and it's not hard to imagine how do I get from 50,000 subscribers
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:11.360]   to a million subscriber channel?
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.000]   A lot of this, if you talk to YouTube people, is professionalization.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Okay.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   What you're doing is working.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:19.320]   You have to do this on a regular basis.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.500]   It has to be at a consistent high level of quality.
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.000]   You probably need to hire an editor.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.800]   You need to be careful about the details.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:26.440]   You need to be careful about the thumbnails.
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.000]   You need to be careful about the timing.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:31.480]   You need to be careful about the subtle things inside the video that makes a big difference
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:36.280]   to the YouTube algorithm that you might not think about, such as retention early on, how
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:37.680]   you recommend the next video.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.680]   So you professionalize.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:42.040]   If you have 50,000 subs, you start saying, "Look, I'm going to spend one day a week.
[00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:45.880]   This is what I'm doing on Sundays, and we're going to professionalize this operation."
[00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:50.520]   And that's how you grow from the 50,000 to the 1 million sub.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.600]   We'll put one more level below that.
[00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.720]   I would say the level below that, which is going to be our starting place, the first
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:03.320]   thing you want to get to, would be regularly publish.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.040]   Right?
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:12.400]   Because you talk to people, you say, "Okay, the first place you need to get," and I've
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   seen this advice.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:14.920]   I mean, I've seen Mr. Beast give this advice.
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:19.320]   The first place you need to get is just regularly publishing videos on your YouTube channel.
[00:24:19.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   Right?
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.800]   Because this means you have all the mechanics.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:25.240]   It's a very accomplished goal from starting from, "I don't do anything with YouTube,"
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.000]   on your path to 100 million subscribers.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.440]   It's a very reasonable first goal is, "I regularly post stuff on my channel."
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:34.280]   That means you've just figured out the mechanics of how YouTube works, the logistics of cameras
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   and files and posting and descriptions.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.520]   And so you could imagine, how do I get from regularly posting to 50,000 subs?
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.920]   It's like, "Well, I'm regularly posting stuff.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:42.920]   I figured out YouTube.
[00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:44.080]   I'm figuring out my voice.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:45.080]   I'm figuring out my topic.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:49.720]   I see what works and I kind of turn towards what works.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.720]   And over time, that's how I'm going to build up this initial audience to 50,000."
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.720]   All right.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:56.160]   So we did reverse goal setting on what is probably an unreasonable goal.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   And we got what at first looks like a reasonable step-by-step path.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.760]   Regularly publish, that gets you to 50,000.
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   From there, you get professional, you get to a million.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.960]   From a million, you give it, it becomes like a full-time job.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:14.160]   You go all in, push everything into what's working in the videos, and you make your jump
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:15.680]   towards a hundred million.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   All right.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.000]   Well, clearly it can't be that easy, so consistent to get to a hundred million because lots of
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   people are trying.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.320]   So what's wrong with this plan?
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:26.680]   So looking at this plan, where are the mistakes that we can find that we can look for in other
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:28.000]   plans that we might make?
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.840]   Well, there's two things, two common problems with reverse goal setting plans that are both
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:35.420]   highlighted in this example.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:38.480]   The first is what I call choke points.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.880]   So that's a step that if you really look at the evidence and are realistic about it, your
[00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.480]   chances of I am actually going to succeed getting from this step to the next, it's a
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.120]   particular link, are actually pretty low.
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.800]   And that you're hiding that difficulty.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:56.360]   It's a choke point where most people aren't going to make it through, and you're hiding
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.360]   that in your plan.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.960]   Just like, "I'll be the one who makes it through."
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:05.120]   So on this particular reverse plan, can anyone see where that choke point is going to be?
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:12.080]   It's actually this link right here, from regularly publishing videos to getting the 50,000 YouTube
[00:26:12.080 --> 00:26:13.800]   subscribers.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.280]   That's actually a choke point.
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:21.760]   Learning the mechanics of YouTube, publishing things regularly, experimenting with voices,
[00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:26.400]   experimenting with topics, for the vast majority of people, that will never lead to a sizable
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.360]   audience.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:32.120]   It's actually very difficult to get the right combination of things that gets to a sizable
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   audience.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:37.480]   Often, what's required is some other type of thing that's going on.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.520]   And I'm on TV, I'm a writer like I am, there's something else that's going on.
[00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:43.520]   I'm an athlete.
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:46.280]   It's very difficult if you don't already have that.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:50.920]   If you don't get lucky with, "I'm a first mover on a particular type of content," or
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:53.200]   there's something really special about the way you talk about things.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.040]   Actually, most people will never make it over there.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:58.360]   So the problem with this plan is we have a link early on that almost certainly you're
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:00.640]   not going to make it through.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:07.640]   There's another flaw in this plan as well, and it's what I call a stochastic bridge link.
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:12.240]   And that's what we have up here at the top, from 1 million YouTube subscribers to 100
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:14.000]   million YouTube subscribers.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:18.400]   The plan that we talked about here, okay, go all in, put all the money you're making
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:23.280]   the videos into the new videos, make this like your full-time job, ramp everything else
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:24.860]   up to the extreme.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:29.680]   That is the proper thing you would need to do to have a chance of getting to 100 million
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:31.160]   YouTube subscribers.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.820]   This is what MrBeast did.
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.440]   This is what Mark Rober did.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.120]   All in, push the videos past what anyone else is doing.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:45.360]   But here's the thing, the results of this particular link are random.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:48.600]   So I'm using a more technical mathematic term, stochastic.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:49.800]   It's a stochastic model.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:54.440]   What this means is there's a range of different outcomes, each with different likelihoods.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:59.200]   So yes, if we think of this as a distribution, at the very far end tail, there's a really
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:05.420]   rare chance that you might be the next MrBeast and this blows up and you get 100 million.
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.640]   But it's also probably right in the big fat part of this distribution.
[00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:13.520]   The most likely outcome is you do that and you go from a million to a million seven,
[00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.560]   and then you kind of find your equilibrium around there.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:18.780]   And there's opportunities in between as well.
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:23.480]   Maybe like unlikely, but not as unlikely as 100 million as you're like a Mark Rober situation
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:25.860]   and you hit tens of millions, which is pretty rare.
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.220]   There's also outcomes where this is kind of the extent of your audience and putting more
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:32.540]   into these videos doesn't change it much at all.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:33.540]   And there's no growth at all.
[00:28:33.540 --> 00:28:38.020]   So the problem about stochastic bridges is you you're hiding the fact that the outcomes
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:40.860]   of this effort are going to be hard to predict in random.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:41.940]   They're coming from distribution.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:45.760]   You're just picking what you want to happen from that distribution.
[00:28:45.760 --> 00:28:50.140]   But really, you have to acknowledge, I don't really know what's going to come out of this.
[00:28:50.140 --> 00:28:51.460]   It could be anywhere on this range.
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:54.020]   In fact, it's very unlikely to be at either extreme.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:58.220]   It's very unlikely that putting all this effort will lead to no growth, but it's more unlikely
[00:28:58.220 --> 00:29:03.460]   that all this effort is going to lead you to be the one or two biggest subscribed YouTubers
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.460]   on the channel.
[00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:09.220]   So we have these two flaws in this plan, choke points and stochastic bridges.
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.900]   So how do we respond to these flaws in a plan?
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.880]   Well, if you find choke points in your in your plan, you either need to change your
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:22.540]   goal so that you can find a reverse path that avoids choke points.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.740]   Or if the choke point is early on, like it is for us here, it's really right here on
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:30.460]   the second link as we go from regularly publishing to 50,000 YouTube subs, then you can just
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:33.780]   acknowledge that this is a milestone checkpoint.
[00:29:33.780 --> 00:29:37.700]   I'm going to go from this step to that step six months.
[00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.500]   If it doesn't work, then I say I didn't make it to the choke point.
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.500]   New goal.
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:45.900]   So you can either try to eliminate the choke points by a better plan or better goal or
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.980]   clearly identify them as a checkpoint.
[00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:51.260]   But when you get there, you're going to see how it goes.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:54.700]   And if it's not going well, have clear evidence to pull the ripcord on it.
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:56.820]   What about stochastic bridges?
[00:29:56.820 --> 00:30:01.700]   These links that are stochastic bridges, you need to integrate that reality into your goal.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:06.820]   So you need to come back and say, OK, let's say if I get past this choke point and I get
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:09.180]   to a million subs, I am going to do this final link.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:13.140]   But I shouldn't say a million YouTube subs is my final goal I'm heading towards because
[00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:14.660]   I don't know that's where I'm going to end up.
[00:30:14.660 --> 00:30:17.100]   And I can't guarantee that's where I'm going to end up.
[00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:21.460]   So I need to change this to something that better matches the expected value of my stochastic
[00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.160]   bridge, like a range of outcomes that's likely from that stochastic bridge.
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:31.060]   So here that might be a multi-million subscriber YouTube channel.
[00:30:31.060 --> 00:30:32.820]   Probably I could get there if I did this.
[00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:37.100]   So you want to revise your goal for the expected value of that stochastic bridge link, not
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:38.100]   the maximum value.
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.900]   And so I said, yeah, actually, if I have a multi-million subscriber YouTube, this could
[00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:43.900]   be my full time job.
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:46.460]   And if I'm careful about my money, this could be like a really interesting way to live.
[00:30:46.460 --> 00:30:47.460]   And I could use this.
[00:30:47.460 --> 00:30:50.300]   You can have a really cool plan built around it.
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.620]   But it's much more realistic because you realize, OK, the maximum possible thing that could
[00:30:55.620 --> 00:30:59.380]   come out of this random step, planning for that is not smart planning.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.780]   Let's go with the expected value.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:01.780]   All right.
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.100]   So this will show up in many different types of plans.
[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:06.220]   Oh, there's choke points.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:07.700]   Oh, there's stochastic bridges.
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.340]   You recognize that it improves your plans.
[00:31:09.340 --> 00:31:10.340]   It improves your goals.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:13.500]   And so then we get this recursive process with reverse goal setting.
[00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:14.980]   You choose a goal, you build a plan.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:15.980]   You see some flaws.
[00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:16.980]   You revise the plan.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:17.980]   There's another flaw.
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:18.980]   You revise your goal.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:22.940]   And all of this works symbiotically to make it much more likely for you to make transformative
[00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:24.020]   change in your life.
[00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:27.380]   It just makes it makes us much smarter at pursuing goals.
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:31.140]   And we end up certainly much better.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:34.900]   Then if you're instead just randomly wandering forward, writing stories or just assuming
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:38.460]   there's some like secret checklist productivity you found in an online course, it's going
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.940]   to turn this all around for you in the next six months.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:44.220]   So we can call this like advanced reverse goal setting.
[00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:47.460]   I think it's the right way to think about the final layer of the deep life stack.
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:52.820]   That's the right way to think about making radically cool things happen in your life.
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.180]   What would be a choke point in the first example?
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:57.140]   Well, this was a pretty good plan.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.020]   All right, so let me load this up.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:07.020]   So this first plan was supposed to be an example that didn't have those flaws to a big degree.
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:08.520]   So it's better.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.860]   I would say there's a little bit of a stochastic bridge in lean and strong to notably in shape.
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:16.940]   Like here you have to acknowledge notably in shape.
[00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:21.140]   It's probably not going to be because this depends on genes and other things, Thor.
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.140]   But it is good.
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:25.940]   It could be almost certainly could be if you work with a trainer in bulk and cut and do
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.020]   the type of stuff people will say, oh, you're in good shape.
[00:32:29.020 --> 00:32:30.020]   We know that about you.
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.420]   So like there's the place where stochastic bridge is where you'd want to be reasonable.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:37.340]   Like I'm not going to look like the rock, but I could look like it's something that
[00:32:37.340 --> 00:32:38.820]   people notice about me.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:44.660]   If we're going to look for a potential choke point in this plan, it might be for a lot
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:49.700]   of people, honestly, this first link to reasonable weight and active is hard.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:52.500]   But I'm not going to say that might be the hardest step for a lot of people, especially
[00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:53.660]   if you're really out of shape.
[00:32:53.660 --> 00:32:57.940]   It's really hard to get to like, oh, now I'm in like a reasonable weight and active and
[00:32:57.940 --> 00:33:01.500]   like I have a foundation from which I can start real training.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:06.820]   That could take a lot of time, but it's not really a choke point because it's it's 100%
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.820]   possible.
[00:33:07.820 --> 00:33:08.820]   Right.
[00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:12.700]   Like there is, you can sit down like with our sponsor, my body tutor, who's a sponsor
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:13.700]   of today's episode.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:15.000]   You can get a my body tutor trainer.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:19.340]   And if you follow what they're saying and you give it enough time, you will get the
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:20.340]   result.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:24.460]   Whereas 50,000 YouTube subs, I mean, there, there, there might be no way that you can
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:27.260]   force that to happen no matter what you do.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.980]   So instead of a choke point, maybe we could call this like a long bridge.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:37.380]   So you can have some of these links are long bridges and it's going to take like a lot.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:41.660]   It might take a long March and we can't break it up into sub steps because you're just doing
[00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:43.260]   the same thing.
[00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:47.860]   It's you know, I'm changing how I eat and I'm, you know, doing pushups every day, no
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:52.700]   matter what, just to get in that mindset, it might take eight months of doing that,
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:54.260]   you know, so maybe we'll call that a long bridge.
[00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:56.060]   So we have a long bridge there.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.460]   We have a mile, you know, we had a stochastic bridge, but I, but I feel like the stochastic
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:00.700]   bridge I took into account here.
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:04.060]   So instead of saying, look like Thor, I said, okay, be notably in shape.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:05.500]   Yeah, like whatever that means for you.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.540]   And a lot of that's going to be genetics.
[00:34:07.540 --> 00:34:11.580]   So like, this is why this was a pretty good reverse plan where this one had some real
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:16.020]   flaws and like, okay, we have to put in a checkpoint and really rewrite it.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.020]   Yep.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.020]   It's interesting.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.420]   We don't think enough about the mechanics of goal setting, something maybe we don't
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:26.580]   talk enough about in general, in the pragmatic nonfiction space.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:32.900]   There's a lot of like mindset, have the courage to follow goals, get out of your own way,
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:36.020]   get rid of the stuff, a lot of books with curse words in the title, get, get away from
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.660]   the stuff that's keeping you back from your goals and all that is fine.
[00:34:38.660 --> 00:34:41.220]   But the actual mechanics of doing goals can be complicated.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:45.460]   I mean, there's like SWAT, there's particular acronyms for, you know, break things into
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:46.460]   achievable steps.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:50.060]   That stuff is good, but it's something we should keep talking about more because there
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:53.340]   really is an art to the cool stuff.
[00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:54.340]   The boring stuff.
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.340]   Yeah.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:57.180]   I need to reorganize my closet.
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:34:59.380]   Like we can break that down into steps and execute it.
[00:34:59.380 --> 00:35:04.220]   But the big stuff, like I'm notably in shape, I've completely transformed my work situation.
[00:35:04.220 --> 00:35:08.900]   I want to live in the woods somewhere and have a garden greenhouse, you know, in a field.
[00:35:08.900 --> 00:35:09.900]   How do I make that happen?
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:13.900]   These sort of transformative goals, there's a real art to how you make that happen.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:18.380]   There's courage and effort, but also the sidestepping of traps and the avoiding of unreasonableness.
[00:35:18.380 --> 00:35:20.780]   And it's, it's not as easy as people make it out to be.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.180]   So I'm glad we have a chance to talk about it.
[00:35:23.180 --> 00:35:24.180]   All right.
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:28.300]   So we have some questions coming up from you that are generally relevant to this and in
[00:35:28.300 --> 00:35:30.900]   general, the idea of improving your life and making it deeper.
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:36.580]   First, however, I want to mention one of the sponsors that makes this show possible.
[00:35:36.580 --> 00:35:40.500]   That is our friends at Shopify.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:47.860]   Whether you're selling a little or a lot, Shopify helps you do your thing.
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:52.080]   Shopify is the global commerce platform that helps you sell at every stage of your business
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.860]   from just launching your online shop to the first real life store stage, all the way to
[00:35:56.860 --> 00:36:00.300]   the, we just hit a million dollars worth of order stage.
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:06.300]   Shopify is there to help you at every step of your way in growth, in growing.
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:09.340]   If you sell things online, Shopify is what you should use.
[00:36:09.340 --> 00:36:15.060]   It makes it so easy to do this, to sell, to get money from people, to keep track of people's
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:16.060]   information.
[00:36:16.060 --> 00:36:19.700]   It makes the e-commerce experience for your customers simple.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:24.140]   And for you as the seller, it makes your life simple as well.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:28.460]   Especially when Jesse and I open our long awaited deep questions online shop, Shopify
[00:36:28.460 --> 00:36:29.660]   is what we would use.
[00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:34.320]   Jesse, every week I have a new idea about what should be in our store.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:39.660]   Right now what I'm thinking about is Jesse skeleton t-shirts that have, I'm really interested
[00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:44.140]   this idea, catchphrases that seems like it's really meaningful.
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:47.660]   You're like, yeah, but don't actually make any sense.
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:52.420]   Cause I love that idea that someone is just thinking like, yeah, right, right.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.620]   But never actually put the pieces together.
[00:36:54.620 --> 00:37:02.980]   So like, it'd be like a Jesse skeleton made up of bones and you're like, yeah, like skeletons
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:08.580]   are made up of bones and there's, it's a, cause he's like, there's some stoic, like
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:16.900]   so it may, it's like a stoic thing and you never really, you never really figure it out.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:17.900]   Jesse skeleton.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:20.820]   Oh, we'd use the Shopify store to sell that.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:24.380]   We would use the Shopify store, Jesse skeleton.
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:27.860]   The wind is only what you believe it to be.
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.540]   Like a picture of Brandon Sanderson.
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:30.940]   Like it seems like it should make sense.
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.540]   You're like, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.940]   Anyways, that's my dream.
[00:37:35.940 --> 00:37:39.480]   Shopify is how I would make that dream a reality.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:46.140]   So sign up for a $1 per month trial period at Shopify.com/deep and make sure that is
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:47.140]   all lowercase.
[00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:52.340]   Go to Shopify.com/deep lowercase now to grow your business.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.340]   No matter what stage you're in.
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.340]   Shopify.com/deep.
[00:37:54.340 --> 00:38:01.220]   I also want to talk about our good friends at Hinson shaving.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:07.100]   Hinson sells the razor that I use to keep my baby smooth shave on my face.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:14.460]   I like Hinson because they, they know how to build a beautiful, precisely milled tool.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.940]   This is what they do.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:19.620]   Hinson's manufactures parts for the aerospace industry.
[00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:23.140]   They have the tools to do this and they've turned all this expertise to make these beautiful
[00:38:23.140 --> 00:38:28.220]   razors, which are milled to this exact precision so that you can take a 10 cent safety razor
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:31.500]   blade, put it in a beautiful Hinson razor.
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:36.820]   And just the barest edge of that 10 cent blade goes beyond the body of the razor, getting
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:41.460]   rid of the up and down diving board effect and allowing you to get a really nice close
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:47.300]   shave without having to go to the drug store and buy those 70 blade vibrating monstrosities
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:52.740]   or to the spend countless dollars on the subscription services, 10 cent blades in this beautifully
[00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:54.340]   milled razor.
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.500]   You get a really good shave.
[00:38:56.500 --> 00:39:01.900]   Every time I use my Hinson shaver, I always feel like I'm in a Wendell Berry essay.
[00:39:01.900 --> 00:39:06.500]   You know, like I just came in from using my horses to plow the field and I get my Hinson
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.540]   shave.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:09.940]   They should use Wendell Berry as their sponsor.
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.620]   I don't think Wendell Berry does a lot of podcasting.
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:15.340]   No, I think he's in his nineties.
[00:39:15.340 --> 00:39:18.620]   And he is a farms, his Kentucky farm with horses.
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.620]   Yeah.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:22.260]   When you read his book last year about him, that introduced me to him.
[00:39:22.260 --> 00:39:23.860]   I just read another essay collection.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:24.860]   I finished it this morning.
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:25.860]   So that's why I was thinking about it.
[00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:26.860]   Oh really?
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:27.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:31.940]   Um, Wendell Berry probably does not podcast, but if he, if he did, I'm sure he would tell
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:33.860]   you about his love of Hinson razor.
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.380]   It just seems like something he would use.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:36.380]   Anyways.
[00:39:36.380 --> 00:39:37.380]   I love my Hinson razor.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:38.380]   It's what I use.
[00:39:38.380 --> 00:39:39.380]   They actually sent me this beautiful stand for it too.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.380]   So it's almost like a piece of art, uh, in my bathroom.
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:47.380]   So it's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor that will last you a lifetime.
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:52.660]   Visit Hinson shaving.com/cal to pick the razor for you and use that code Cal and you'll get
[00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:56.660]   two and a half years worth of blades for, or two years worth of blades for free with
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:57.660]   a razor.
[00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.620]   Just add the two year supply of blades to your cart.
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:02.580]   And then when you use that promo code Cal, it check out the price of the blades goes
[00:40:02.580 --> 00:40:03.780]   down to zero.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:13.060]   That's 100 free blades when you head to H E N S O N S H A V I N G.com/cal and use the
[00:40:13.060 --> 00:40:14.060]   code Cal.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:18.020]   All right, Jesse, I think it's time for us to do some questions.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.820]   Who do we got first?
[00:40:20.820 --> 00:40:21.820]   Sounds good.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:22.820]   First question's from Pedro.
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:28.900]   I work in a small fun tech company as a backend software engineer on the main contributor
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:31.140]   and the flagship project of the company.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:35.460]   We're going through job cuts and it's likely that more tasks will spill over to me.
[00:40:35.460 --> 00:40:37.220]   This means more shall work.
[00:40:37.220 --> 00:40:42.020]   My long time goal is to become an independent developer and escape wage based labor.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:46.300]   To this end, I recently started working on a side project and the first prototype is
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   ready.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:51.060]   I'm still far away from making any income with it though.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.040]   It could take anywhere from one to four years before this happens.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.980]   So the question is, how should I handle this imminent change to my personal, my professional
[00:40:58.980 --> 00:40:59.980]   life?
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:00.980]   All right, Pedro, it's a good question.
[00:41:00.980 --> 00:41:03.500]   A couple of things I want to mention.
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:04.500]   All right.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:10.140]   So first, just some advice about building a side hustle that you eventually want to
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:13.560]   perhaps take over your main source of income.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:19.740]   Follow the advice I quote in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, which is to use money
[00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:24.460]   as a neutral indicator of value.
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:29.180]   So number one piece of accurate feedback you can get on the promise of this product you're
[00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:32.460]   working on is people paying for it.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:34.140]   People are happy to tell you they love your idea.
[00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:35.900]   They're happy to tell you your idea is great.
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:38.820]   They're happy to tell you that, yeah, you should just quit your job and go for it.
[00:41:38.820 --> 00:41:40.600]   They're not happy to give you money.
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.900]   They will only do that if what you're working on actually works for them.
[00:41:43.900 --> 00:41:46.180]   So really use, sell this thing.
[00:41:46.180 --> 00:41:48.860]   Got the prototype, get to something you can sell.
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.300]   This is the feedback that matters when trying to make a decision about changing your financial
[00:41:52.300 --> 00:41:53.300]   situation.
[00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.300]   Will people pay for it?
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:58.460]   The second thing I want to suggest here is probably work harder on it.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:03.900]   So if you have a side hustle you want to build to a particular place, do a reverse goal setting
[00:42:03.900 --> 00:42:07.700]   path towards that ambitious place you want to get to.
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:11.380]   Follow the advice that I went over in the deep dive in today's episode.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:16.020]   Here is the clear step-by-step path, each link evidence-based to get from where I am
[00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:17.540]   to where I want to go.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.100]   Check that path for choke points.
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:21.700]   Check that path for stochastic bridges.
[00:42:21.700 --> 00:42:23.260]   Adjust as needed.
[00:42:23.260 --> 00:42:26.760]   And once you have a path like that, most of those links are going to focus your energy
[00:42:26.760 --> 00:42:32.140]   and get you to work harder on making progress towards where you want to be.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:36.220]   If you do not reverse goal set, if you do not have a verified evidence-based path, you're
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:41.220]   probably going to fall trap to a lot of the common goal setting mistakes we talked about
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:42.220]   earlier.
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.460]   You're going to do random wandering.
[00:42:43.460 --> 00:42:47.660]   Well, I built a prototype and then I tried this and then I tried that.
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:50.780]   You might underestimate effort like, "Hey, I took this online course about how to sell
[00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:55.540]   software and if I just do these 10 steps and set up these websites and it's going to be
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:56.700]   successful.
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:59.260]   Or you're going to write yourself a story about like you're just kind of working on
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:03.180]   this thing on the side when you have time and then one day there's a knock on your door
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.340]   and it's Bill Gates and he just hands you like a bag with a dollar sign on it.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:08.420]   Like there's all of these flaws are waiting there.
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:11.180]   That's not the worst thing if you're just like, "This is fun.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.100]   I like the daydream and I'm just doing this hobby."
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:15.420]   But it sounds like you want to get out of your job.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.220]   You want this to succeed.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:19.040]   So don't dissipate effort.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:23.340]   So setting a good reverse goal setting based verified path is going to allow you to focus
[00:43:23.340 --> 00:43:28.900]   the energy you do expend in the most productive possible way forward.
[00:43:28.900 --> 00:43:34.380]   The final thing I'll say though is in the meantime, don't just say, "My current job
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:37.580]   is bad and there's nothing I can do about that."
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.860]   Work on making your current job better.
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:44.180]   Even if you do succeed with your plan, even if you do leave your current job in the future,
[00:43:44.180 --> 00:43:49.100]   why suffer unnecessarily between now and then?
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.340]   Also, you want to be building up as much career capital as possible because that capital might
[00:43:53.340 --> 00:43:56.140]   be a big part of how you make a change in the future.
[00:43:56.140 --> 00:43:59.180]   Being better and more valuable in your job might give you more options about how you
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:03.980]   transition away from purely wage-based labor.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.880]   So if you're talking about your concern, I'm looking at your question here, your concern
[00:44:06.880 --> 00:44:11.500]   about getting swamped with more and more shallow work, fight the hyperactive hive mind.
[00:44:11.500 --> 00:44:12.500]   All right?
[00:44:12.500 --> 00:44:17.660]   So you start saying like, "I do not want unscheduled messages to be central to how things get done.
[00:44:17.660 --> 00:44:21.340]   I'm going to start creating processes for the things I do regularly and just follow
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.220]   those processes and other people will have to come along because otherwise they're just
[00:44:24.220 --> 00:44:25.300]   not going to be able to talk to me."
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:29.420]   Do multi-scale planning so you're not just jumping from thing to thing and putting out
[00:44:29.420 --> 00:44:30.420]   fires.
[00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:33.500]   Use the meeting buffer methodology we talked about.
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.140]   Every meeting that goes on your calendar is followed by 15 to 20 minutes of a buffer that's
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.820]   also scheduled on your calendar.
[00:44:38.820 --> 00:44:42.760]   So after every meeting, you can process everything, send out the follow-up messages, update your
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:46.020]   list and take a breather before moving on to the next things.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.460]   Schedule your deep work time on your calendar like any other meeting and appointments.
[00:44:49.460 --> 00:44:53.100]   Use clear shutdown methodology so you close the open loops, close the open loops at the
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:56.420]   end of the day and allow your mind some psychological relief.
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:58.420]   Do the stuff that matters.
[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:02.160]   Don't give up on that stuff because you're trying to just stay warm by the flames of
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.300]   your distance future daydream.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.940]   Build a good house now.
[00:45:06.940 --> 00:45:09.580]   You can always move to a better one if and when the daydream comes true.
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.420]   So this is a rear guard, front guard action.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:17.620]   If you're gonna try to go for something new, go for that well.
[00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:18.620]   Use a good plan.
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:22.380]   But at the same time, your rear guard action is keep improving the thing you're in right
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.380]   now.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:26.940]   At the very least, it's just a discipline in life construction and discipline.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:31.780]   So I see that a lot, Jesse, is people have an idea of where they want to go and because
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.500]   of that, they just let everything else be bad.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:36.420]   Why even bother trying to fix my situation?
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:42.700]   In fact, there's a pathological behavior that's common where people actually want their current
[00:45:42.700 --> 00:45:49.580]   situation to stay as bad as possible to maintain their motivation to go after the goal, which
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:52.700]   I think is a big unforced error, right?
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:58.420]   It means that you're putting up with months, if not years of unnecessary discomfort as
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:00.260]   a motivational trick.
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.140]   If that's what you need to motivate yourself to go for the goal, then that goal is not
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:04.520]   well set.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.180]   You don't need to emotionally blackmail yourself into making progress.
[00:46:07.180 --> 00:46:11.340]   If you have a clear goal and a good path, you've done like we talked about in episode
[00:46:11.340 --> 00:46:15.140]   274, proper episodic future thinking about this.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:18.300]   So you're projecting into the future what it would be like to accomplish this goal and
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:19.420]   aligns with your values.
[00:46:19.420 --> 00:46:21.600]   Your motivational system will be there for you.
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:25.900]   You shouldn't have to emotionally blackmail yourself into pursuing a long-term goal, much
[00:46:25.900 --> 00:46:29.580]   in the same way that for short-term goals, like students, for example, will often say,
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:33.900]   "Well, I need the stress of this is due in three hours to get started."
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:39.020]   Any place I see examples of this type of chemical or emotional motivation to force yourself
[00:46:39.020 --> 00:46:43.460]   to work tells me your systems for work, for setting goals, for pursuing things, for planning
[00:46:43.460 --> 00:46:44.460]   are broken.
[00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:48.540]   So don't make your current situation bad so that you'll put an effort towards something
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:51.500]   you think in the future that will be good.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:56.020]   His situation is unique too in the fact that his company is making a lot of cuts.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:58.700]   So he's going to get a lot more of that work thrown on him.
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:46:59.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:59.700 --> 00:47:01.180]   So he's got to be, he needs his game face on.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.180 --> 00:47:03.180]   Like, "Okay, we got to..."
[00:47:03.180 --> 00:47:08.420]   And he elaborated a little bit more that this happened recently.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.140]   It sounds like the company might be struggling, but...
[00:47:11.140 --> 00:47:15.060]   But if he woe is me's this change, like, "Oh my God, I have so much junk and I'm just going
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.260]   to complain about it."
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:17.500]   It's a lot of unnecessary negativity.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:21.960]   You should be like, "Okay, the flood is coming.
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:25.760]   So what we're going to do is put the sandbags around our house while we're still building
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.400]   a new house up on the hill.
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.180]   But in the meantime, we don't want to have water coming in the door.
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:34.300]   So we got to do what we can with what's in front of us while also thinking towards the
[00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:35.300]   future."
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:36.300]   Yep.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   All right.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.300]   What do we got next?
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:39.300]   Hi, next question is from Evan.
[00:47:39.300 --> 00:47:43.540]   "I'm an eighth year faculty member at a large state university.
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:46.780]   I've just been approved for a semester long sabbatical.
[00:47:46.780 --> 00:47:50.420]   What is your recommendation for balancing my main goal of writing with my duties as
[00:47:50.420 --> 00:47:52.660]   a graduate student advisor?
[00:47:52.660 --> 00:47:58.340]   I've allocated 75% of my sabbatical to my backlog of papers, including 13 manuscripts
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:02.100]   for publication, some of which I just have to revise and resubmit.
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:06.660]   However, I have a PhD student in their final year, which I'll be required to be present."
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.660]   Okay.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.660]   All right.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.780]   Evan, I know this issue because I'm a professor too.
[00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:14.780]   It's not just sabbatical.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:16.620]   So for me, for example, summers are like this.
[00:48:16.620 --> 00:48:20.380]   It's like, "Oh, I got a lot less responsibilities in the summer.
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.180]   I don't even take a paycheck from Georgetown in the summer.
[00:48:23.180 --> 00:48:27.580]   I don't take summer salary, but there are things I still need to do."
[00:48:27.580 --> 00:48:35.100]   This is a really good question because scheduling time off can actually be difficult.
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:36.100]   It's very difficult.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:37.700]   We're like, "I have abundant free time in a period.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.460]   I'm taking a month off.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:40.460]   I'm in between jobs.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:41.920]   I'm a summer as professor."
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:46.780]   It's very easy to have that all dissipate in the thing, meetings and email.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.020]   Why am I not getting anything done?
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:49.340]   It's a really common thing.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:52.540]   People come out of these periods like, "I didn't really get anything done."
[00:48:52.540 --> 00:49:00.260]   So what you actually have to do is build a good scheduling system for periods of abundant
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:01.260]   free time.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:02.260]   So let me tell you what I do during my summer.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:06.140]   I call this my summer scheduling system.
[00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:11.540]   No meetings Mondays, no appointments, no professional meetings Fridays.
[00:49:11.540 --> 00:49:15.380]   So that means Friday through Monday, professional calendar blank.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:19.340]   Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, any sort of meetings or appointments or calls because
[00:49:19.340 --> 00:49:25.980]   it turns out these still happen in the afternoon, literally afternoon, so between noon and four.
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:27.580]   I'm willing to fill that time.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:29.700]   Some days that time might be full completely with meetings.
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.220]   So I just know if like, "Well, I got to talk to my student.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:34.740]   I have a committee thing I have to check in on with Georgetown.
[00:49:34.740 --> 00:49:36.060]   I got to talk to my publishing team."
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:37.060]   Yeah, great.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.220]   Tuesday, Thursday afternoon, any time you want to do it.
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.560]   I used to think this is the summer.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   What I want is nothing to do.
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:48.080]   And then I get really frustrated because there is stuff to do and it'd be just enough stuff
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.260]   that days weren't clear.
[00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:50.380]   So I realized there is stuff to do.
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:51.860]   So let's control where we put it.
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:52.860]   All right.
[00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:54.300]   What do I do in the other time?
[00:49:54.300 --> 00:49:55.920]   Every morning's deep work.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.300]   On Monday and Friday, that deep work session can go longer because I don't have appointments
[00:49:59.300 --> 00:50:02.580]   and I'll typically throw in some sort of brainstorming.
[00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:05.900]   Let me walk outside or in the woods, like really get into it.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:09.980]   And I'll end my day earlier, maybe in my day by two or three, because I can do that in
[00:50:09.980 --> 00:50:12.980]   the summer on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:17.100]   It's deep work till like 11 to 1130.
[00:50:17.100 --> 00:50:21.340]   And then it's like emails and appointments and I end the day by five.
[00:50:21.340 --> 00:50:24.220]   That scheduling system, I call it my summer hours, works really well.
[00:50:24.220 --> 00:50:27.940]   I mean, it means I have these four days a week where I'm completely free from being
[00:50:27.940 --> 00:50:29.300]   on Zoom or calls.
[00:50:29.300 --> 00:50:33.020]   I'm getting deep work done five days a week, including a couple of days of like really
[00:50:33.020 --> 00:50:35.420]   long sessions with being outside.
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:37.420]   But I'm also on top of the stuff that has to happen.
[00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:40.220]   The phone calls that have to happen, the meetings that have to happen, the emails that have
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.220]   to happen, that still gets done.
[00:50:42.220 --> 00:50:44.940]   But instead of that just being spread all throughout my calendar and annoying me that
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:49.540]   I can't get it the free time I imagine, I'm corralling it.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:55.100]   So abundant free time requires careful scheduling philosophies for you to feel like you're actually
[00:50:55.100 --> 00:50:57.220]   taking advantage of that abundant free time.
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:50:58.300]   So come up with your own system.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:03.900]   You can use my Tuesday, Thursday meeting rule or whatever else you want to do.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:08.700]   Lean into your flexibility, but you have to somewhat paradoxically have a lot of structure
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:12.380]   to get the most out of the flexibility.
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:13.740]   Through structure, you get relief.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:15.280]   Through structure, you get free time.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:18.500]   Through structure, you get this flexibility to spend full days walking and thinking and
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   not worrying about it.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:24.340]   So you have to sometimes structure things to get the most out of unstructured time.
[00:51:24.340 --> 00:51:26.460]   All right, let's see here.
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:27.460]   We've got some long questions.
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:28.460]   We forgot to cut these out.
[00:51:28.460 --> 00:51:29.460]   Maybe summarize them a little bit.
[00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:30.460]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:51:30.460 --> 00:51:33.700]   A little behind the scenes.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.960]   People tend to send us very long versions of questions, which Jesse and I edit down,
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.260]   but there's a couple here we didn't edit.
[00:51:38.260 --> 00:51:40.380]   So we're going to do some on the fly editing.
[00:51:40.380 --> 00:51:41.920]   Yeah, I got it.
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:44.100]   First question is from Christie.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:48.180]   Cal mentioned the book Company of One and that allowed me to reframe my business goals.
[00:51:48.180 --> 00:51:52.500]   Along with Cal's techniques, I'm able to work part-time four to six hours a day, Monday
[00:51:52.500 --> 00:51:57.940]   through Friday and bring home an excellent salary with my own law practice.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:52:02.020]   And the extra hours I homeschool, garden, trail run, stuff like that.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:07.220]   An unexpected side effect is this sense of guilt I feel and that I really don't have
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.620]   to only have to work a few hours a day.
[00:52:09.620 --> 00:52:13.900]   Growing up, my parents worked very long hours, so I feel bad when I talk to my dad who still
[00:52:13.900 --> 00:52:16.360]   works 60 to 70 hours a week.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.060]   What are your thoughts on this aspect of success with deep work and productivity?
[00:52:20.060 --> 00:52:27.480]   Well, I mean, part of this should be a reminder for all of us who are in knowledge work.
[00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:34.240]   So generally, we work at a computer screen, some mixture of at an office and at home remotely.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:41.160]   For all the complaining we do, you should remember relative to all of human history,
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:42.480]   it's a pretty sweet gig.
[00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:45.760]   I mean, throughout all of human history, if someone said, okay, here's what's going to
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:46.760]   happen.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:52.380]   Like, uh, you're going to go to like an air conditioned building and sit around in a comfortable
[00:52:52.380 --> 00:52:56.280]   chair, like a Herman Miller chair that costs $600.
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.680]   And you're going to be like a computer screen and like send messages to people and like
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.120]   make PowerPoint and make slides and stuff like that.
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:07.120]   And you know, you can eat, there's coffee and, um, and like, oh, so like, but it's like
[00:53:07.120 --> 00:53:08.120]   hard.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.120]   It's like, it's kind of up to you what you do.
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:10.120]   And there's a lot of flexibility.
[00:53:10.120 --> 00:53:12.560]   Oh, and by the way, we're going to pay you really well.
[00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.240]   You could get paid a lot of money for this actually.
[00:53:15.240 --> 00:53:19.240]   Even if you can't even exactly specify specifically what it is you do.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:20.240]   Right.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   You, you, you tell this to a surf in, you know, 14th century, uh, England, like sign
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:29.240]   me up.
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:35.360]   You, you, you tell this to a factory labor in early 20th century Detroit, like what you
[00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:38.200]   just sit in the air conditioned box and kind of like figure out what you want to do.
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.280]   And there's like a, you just drink coffee all day.
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:41.280]   Sign.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:42.280]   And how much you're going to pay me?
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:43.280]   Six figures.
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:44.280]   What?
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:46.120]   You know, they're like, sign me up, you know, sign me up.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:51.000]   So we should remember knowledge work in some sense could be, it's a, it's a fantastic gig.
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:57.720]   Um, if you can control it and that's what the CP here has done.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:54:02.080]   He's an aficionado of what I talk about of company of one that, that fantastic book.
[00:54:02.080 --> 00:54:04.160]   I, um, Paul Jarvis's book.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:08.080]   I talked about a lot in the show about instead of growing your business, when you get better
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.280]   at it, just ask for more money and work less.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.120]   Uh, so he's, he's put these philosophies to work to fully take advantage of knowledge
[00:54:14.120 --> 00:54:15.120]   work.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:16.120]   I have a good salary.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.120]   I don't have to work that much.
[00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:20.660]   I have a lot of autonomy and the work is creatively demanding.
[00:54:20.660 --> 00:54:26.000]   So partially I just want to say, look, when done right, knowledge work is a great gig.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:28.760]   So this is why it's worth doing it right.
[00:54:28.760 --> 00:54:30.240]   It's really wasting the opportunity.
[00:54:30.240 --> 00:54:33.760]   Just imagine that 14th century medieval surf, how frustrated they would be to say, you have
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:36.240]   this opportunity to be like CP's life.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.000]   And instead you're just on slack all day and, and tired and complaining about it.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000]   Like you're really not that it's pretty easy to get from there to an awesome life in a
[00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.840]   way that I'm never going to be able to, uh, you know, pulling potatoes out of the ground
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:48.740]   and Cornwall or whatever.
[00:54:48.740 --> 00:54:51.320]   So knowledge work can be a great gig.
[00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.480]   If you take full advantage of what it can offer using the type of things we talk about
[00:54:54.480 --> 00:54:55.480]   here.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.160]   Now, what about the guilt aspect of it?
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:05.880]   Um, I would say don't feel guilty as long as you are living up to the gift you're given.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:10.040]   So you know, you're in a situation to not only have a knowledge work job, but to be
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:13.440]   able to transform it into this, like four hours a day, I'm making good money at full
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.760]   autonomy.
[00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:19.480]   You should see that as a gift in some sense you were given that you need to live up to
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:22.960]   by living the deepest possible life all the round.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   So I got good money.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:24.960]   I've good time.
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:25.960]   I'm doing great.
[00:55:25.960 --> 00:55:33.480]   Um, my community, you know, my, my kids, my, uh, things I'm involved in honing my mind,
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.640]   honing my body.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.920]   Do not let that gift go to waste.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.200]   If it's like, this is great.
[00:55:38.200 --> 00:55:44.640]   Now I can, you know, um, drink more and send more angry tweets than you should feel guilty
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.920]   because you were given a gift.
[00:55:46.920 --> 00:55:48.400]   You could almost think about this.
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:51.480]   It's not obviously not an exact analogy, but you could almost think about this.
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:59.000]   If we, if we look at, you know, monarchical Europe, uh, as being a, uh, landed gentry
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:05.400]   and they had this whole philosophy, not please, uh, uh, no bless a oblige.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   I seen that backwards.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   Jesse bless.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.200]   Say it'll be at least it's the French term.
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:14.720]   Uh, this whole notion of like, Hey, look, you, you inherited this land.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:16.480]   This is just the way we run our society.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.040]   You need to like do stuff with your, the free time.
[00:56:20.040 --> 00:56:21.040]   This frees up.
[00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:26.640]   You need to like, get out there and try to give back and be useful.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   And you know how it was.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:29.000]   We all saw down to the Abbey.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   You like owned a town.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:32.680]   You're supposed to be like involved in the town.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:36.600]   There's almost an echo of that with modern knowledge, working camp in a family that was
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:37.600]   like upper middle class.
[00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:40.880]   I got a good education and then I stumbled across Cal Newport stuff and I don't know,
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:46.040]   I'm getting $175,000 a year and I'm really only working like four hours a day.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:49.080]   Uh, live up to that gift.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:53.400]   And do cool stuff with the time that remains and you hone your body and you hone your mind
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.560]   and you, you become a leader in your community.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.200]   You serve other people.
[00:56:57.200 --> 00:57:00.680]   You have real gratitude and appreciation for craftsmanship in the world.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.240]   You hone your soul through philosophy and theology.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:06.760]   I think that's the right way to think about it.
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.600]   There's a part of it's a gift part of it.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:09.600]   You did it.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:11.000]   However you got there.
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:18.000]   Let's run with that opportunity to live a even more enlightened, even more, uh, useful
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.000]   human life.
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   That's the way I would think about that.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:23.600]   And also I'm sure your dad is happy that you don't have to do the 70 hours in the factory.
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:25.600]   Just live up to that gift that you were given.
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:27.880]   Do you look up the phrase?
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.960]   Now please bless a, not bleached bless.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.880]   Say, I can only think of you saying it in like your accent.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:35.760]   Well, am I saying, I'll say, I'll say my accent if I have the right phrase.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   Is that the right phrase?
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   I'm not even trying to spell it.
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.760]   O B L I G E.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.760]   It's French.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:49.080]   No bless a.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:50.080]   No bless a.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.080]   No bless a.
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:53.960]   I think it's a, did you mean a bleached no bless a?
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   Yes.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:55.960]   A bleached no bless a.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   That's what I was forgetting.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   It's French.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:01.320]   A bleached no bless a.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.960]   The sense of I have to give back because I was born land of gentry.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:05.960]   Oh, well.
[00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   All right, let's do another one.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:07.960]   What do we got?
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:10.200]   I thought I was in Spanish class there for a second.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:13.200]   I didn't understand what you were saying.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.200]   I think it's French.
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:15.200]   I don't know.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:16.200]   I'm not an expert, expert pronunciation.
[00:58:16.200 --> 00:58:17.200]   I don't appreciate it.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:20.600]   I have an expert pronunciation of all foreign words.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.160]   All right.
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:26.240]   Next question is actually a follow-up from Christie and she's talking about how her three
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:30.440]   kids are back in school and she has a lot more time each day, but she's nervous about
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.580]   putting too much on her plate.
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:36.160]   She explained her other interests that she likes to pursue, but oftentimes she has a
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.360]   tendency to overdo things.
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:43.040]   Having her kids at home, especially with work, allowed her a convenient excuse to say no.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.320]   So she wonders, how can I say no to working more than four hours a day when I no longer
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.760]   can say, well, I have my kids at home?
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:54.320]   How would you advise someone who doesn't want to be more productive in the sense of producing
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:55.920]   and providing more services?
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:57.840]   Well, I like this question.
[00:58:57.840 --> 00:59:02.000]   It's clearly an older, we have questions from a long array of time.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:05.520]   Clearly this is an older question because Christie's talking about, oh, the pandemic's
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:08.800]   over and my kids are going back to school and how I'm going to transition to that.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.160]   But we brought in this older question because it actually gets to a topic I've been thinking
[00:59:12.160 --> 00:59:17.040]   a lot about more recently, and that is slow productivity.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:21.680]   Jesse, I think we need a sound effect for slow productivity because I like this idea
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:28.720]   as we get closer to my slow productivity book coming out in March that we have.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:29.720]   We do need one.
[00:59:29.720 --> 00:59:30.720]   We do need one.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.720 --> 00:59:32.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:32.720 --> 00:59:33.720]   And it needs some sort of musical cue.
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:36.880]   Actually, we have some solid fans who sent in some stuff, so they should send.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:37.880]   We need a slow, okay.
[00:59:37.880 --> 00:59:40.440]   So we need a slow productivity theme song because what I want to try to do from now
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:45.240]   until my book comes out is have at least one slow productivity question each episode.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:52.000]   You can call this slow productivity corner with slow Cal Newport.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.120]   Slow Cal Newport's probably not great, but it's slow productivity corners where we can
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:58.160]   do a little bit of slow productivity thinking every episode.
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:04.200]   So my answer to Christie here is going to be to pull some ideas from slow productivity,
[01:00:04.200 --> 01:00:05.200]   two points in particular.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.200]   All right.
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:08.140]   So remember, here's her problem.
[01:00:08.140 --> 01:00:11.080]   In the pandemic, there's a lot less stuff going on.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.720]   Her kids were at home.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.120]   She could say no to most things because people weren't doing things and she was worrying,
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:19.200]   I'm going to become overloaded again, but I can't just keep saying no to everything
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.560]   because I don't have the excuse anymore of things are shut down.
[01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:27.000]   So slow productivity is going to help us here.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:34.080]   Point one, in both your work and non-work schedule, what you need to do is build what
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:41.080]   you believe, identify what you believe to be the reasonable workload in both, and then
[01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:43.280]   just don't exceed that workload.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.920]   So it's not so much as saying yes or no to each thing in individual, it's keeping your
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:53.000]   workload and outside of work would be your activity load, your obligation load, keeping
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:55.180]   that at your predetermined limit.
[01:00:55.180 --> 01:00:56.920]   This is where I'm best.
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:00:59.000]   At this point, I don't want to go beyond it.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.160]   So now when you're saying no, it's not random.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.760]   It's because you already hit your load for the moment.
[01:01:04.760 --> 01:01:07.680]   Now you can break this down to be a little bit more specific.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.380]   For example, using things like activity specific quotas.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:16.240]   So instead of just saying I do five projects, but no more at work, you might be like this
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.240]   type of work.
[01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:18.960]   I only do one at a time.
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.880]   These type of events, okay.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.920]   Once a quarter, I'll say yes to doing these networking events I'm always asked to do in
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:29.920]   terms of, I don't know, there's like white papers that your company produces.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.400]   I can only work on two at a time.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:36.520]   So you could have specific activity, specific quotas that add up to specifying what your
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.560]   desired workload is.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.160]   And then the no's are informed by the quotas.
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:43.960]   Yes, I'm happy to do these.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:47.720]   I do do these, but I typically do once a month and I've already have one on the books for
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.720]   this month.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:49.720]   So I can't do this one.
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.400]   So you're not saying no, because in general, I'm busy.
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:56.280]   I don't want to do things, but because I have a very specific load and quota and I've hit
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:57.440]   that.
[01:01:57.440 --> 01:01:59.600]   Same thing with life outside of work.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:02.800]   You can do something similar like, oh yeah, this sounds like a great group.
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:06.560]   You want me to join, but really my quota is like, I don't like to be involved in more
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:12.560]   than like three book club, uh, parents, sports, whatever it is like no more than two at a
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560]   time.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   And I already have two going on this season.
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.360]   So, you know, great idea, but I've already kind of loaded my activity quota.
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.160]   Um, so I can't do that.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:20.160]   I'm not gonna be able to do that.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:22.800]   Or I go to this many events at my kids' schools.
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.840]   I'll, I'll do one a week, but not, not more than one.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840]   Right.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:31.920]   So you have to have clarity because what you don't want to do is tackle the yes or no emotionally
[01:02:31.920 --> 01:02:33.760]   in the moment.
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.000]   That doesn't work out well.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:39.320]   A it's hard because again, an emotional no is not very acceptable from other people.
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.800]   Like we're all busy.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.360]   Come to the stupid activity, right?
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   That doesn't work.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.640]   Specificity is much better.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:48.960]   And two, if you depend on emotions, I wrote a big article about this in the New Yorker
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:53.040]   a couple of years ago that was called it's time to embrace slow productivity.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.480]   Or maybe it's an article I wrote called why we work so much.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.080]   I wrote a couple of things about this, but the basic thesis of this article, I get into
[01:02:59.080 --> 01:03:02.880]   this in my, my book coming out in March as well, is that when you use the emotional,
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:06.760]   no, when do you actually feel that strong emotion of, oh, I need to say no.
[01:03:06.760 --> 01:03:09.720]   It's when you already have too much to do.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:14.280]   So if you're just depending on like, I feel psychologically like I can't take on anymore.
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.320]   You've already taken on too much.
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.200]   So the emotional no leads you to always be about 20% too overloaded.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:20.200]   So that's not good either.
[01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:23.960]   So figure out in advance your workloads for work and non-work.
[01:03:23.960 --> 01:03:28.280]   You can subdivide those workloads by activity specific quotas and then just stick to those
[01:03:28.280 --> 01:03:30.700]   use them as your explanation.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:37.380]   Point number two, it's another huge point for my upcoming book seasonality.
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:42.440]   So what you might also do is say the fall is unusually busy because the kids go back
[01:03:42.440 --> 01:03:44.760]   to school and there's all these things that happen.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.780]   I'm actually willing to be busier in the fall.
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:50.600]   And I go particularly unbusy in the summer.
[01:03:50.600 --> 01:03:53.840]   I have certain times of the year where I do more and other times where I do less and they
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.000]   help kind of balance out and help me get a breather.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.480]   And so there can be periods where I'm really involved in things and there can be other
[01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.640]   periods where I'm kind of scarce.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:02.640]   I'm not around as much.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:06.200]   Seasonality is something we're wired for as humans and is often more effective than trying
[01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:10.600]   to just have a steady limit that's pretty low that you follow all the time.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:15.040]   I mean, seasonality is what we experience as hunter gatherers.
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:17.960]   The winter we're doing a lot less than other types of seasons.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:23.240]   It's certainly what we experienced acutely once the Neolithic era began.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:26.000]   The harvest time is incredibly busy.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:28.200]   We have almost nothing to do in January.
[01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:32.800]   So they're like really busy times and times where we're sitting around inventing art because
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:36.120]   we had nothing else to do while we're waiting for the next crops to come in.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:40.260]   So also you see as an analogy and offset unusually busy with less busy.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:43.600]   Sometimes it's also better satisfies people's demands for you because you're available when
[01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.040]   the times where people really need you, but you get that breather in times where people
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.040]   are scarce.
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:50.040]   All right.
[01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:54.640]   So that is slow productivity corner for this week.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.080]   We should just have.
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:04:57.640]   Sound effect coming 276.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:59.200]   Sound effect coming.
[01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:03.400]   I think it should be off putting and random like circus music.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.280]   It's calliope music or something that just never explained.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.880]   It was like slow productivity corner.
[01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:08.880]   It's like.
[01:05:08.880 --> 01:05:11.640]   Or we can make it the Shopify sale sound.
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:12.640]   Just again and again.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:21.520]   We're going to do 45 seconds of Shopify sales sound effects.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:22.840]   Because we are awesome at audio engineering.
[01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:23.840]   All right.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:24.840]   Let's do let's do one more question.
[01:05:24.840 --> 01:05:25.840]   All right.
[01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:29.360]   Next question is from can't start won't stop.
[01:05:29.360 --> 01:05:32.200]   I really want to try time block planning.
[01:05:32.200 --> 01:05:36.940]   I have a typical hive mind slack fueled tech job.
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.800]   I think I could tame that pretty well.
[01:05:38.800 --> 01:05:43.520]   The part I frankly dread about time block planning is switching to the next task while
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.960]   in progress on the first.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   How do you do it?
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.360]   I'm a pretty pessimistic person.
[01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:51.600]   And if I'm in the middle of a problem or a piece of writing, for example, I don't see
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:53.200]   how I'm going to get it done.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:56.560]   Stopping the middle because the timer went off is a worse kind of mental focus.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.520]   Interrupts me because I fear I may not get to the end.
[01:05:59.520 --> 01:06:00.520]   How do you do it?
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.720]   Well, there's two different cases here to cover.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:09.640]   There's two different cases when it comes to I'm working on something and the time I
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:13.360]   put aside for it is up and I'm not done.
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.960]   Two cases to consider.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.280]   Case one is I have to finish this.
[01:06:17.280 --> 01:06:22.120]   I mean, it's unfortunate that I did not accurately estimate how long this is going to take.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:23.520]   But this is due at the end of the day.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:26.680]   Like this is the report my boss needs and I'm not done yet.
[01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.600]   The second case is just this is a big thing I'm working on.
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:31.700]   It's a computer program that's going to take me a month.
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:32.700]   It's a book manuscript.
[01:06:32.700 --> 01:06:34.440]   And it's just like, look, I'm in it.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.680]   The block ended and I'm just in the middle of it.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:38.000]   I really don't want to stop.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:43.120]   We need different responses to both of these different cases.
[01:06:43.120 --> 01:06:47.560]   So for the case of this has to finish, I just thought it was going to take less time than
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560]   it did.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:50.040]   But I do have to get this done.
[01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.240]   Don't sweat it.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:57.160]   Remember with time blocking, the goal is not perfectly predicting how long everything is
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   going to take.
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:06:59.160]   And if you do, you win.
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.160]   And if you don't, you lose.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:01.880]   The goal of time blocking is intention.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:07.320]   At any one point, you want to have some intention behind what you're doing next.
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:11.300]   So if there's something that's urgent and it's taking you longer, you can keep going
[01:07:11.300 --> 01:07:12.440]   until you're done.
[01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:13.960]   And then what do you do when you're done?
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.020]   You adjust your plan for the time that remains the day.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.680]   That's time blocking 101.
[01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:22.040]   Next time you get a chance, you move over to that next column in your time block planner
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.480]   and you build a new plan for the time that remains.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:26.480]   The key is you're never without intention.
[01:07:26.480 --> 01:07:29.640]   So when you're done finishing this thing, you say, what's the best I can do with my
[01:07:29.640 --> 01:07:30.640]   time left?
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.640]   You're avoiding random wandering.
[01:07:31.640 --> 01:07:32.640]   That's fine.
[01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:33.880]   That's time blocking 101.
[01:07:33.880 --> 01:07:38.800]   Intention is winning, not accuracy and prediction.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:41.020]   But what about the second issue?
[01:07:41.020 --> 01:07:44.920]   You work on these big projects and you never want to stop.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.920]   It's always like I'm in the flow.
[01:07:45.920 --> 01:07:46.920]   I don't want to stop now.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:50.600]   This is psychologically very difficult, but you're finding this is a problem because you're
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:55.440]   constantly blowing over other things you need to get done, other things that are important.
[01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:59.760]   Here I want to push back on this idea, and you use a term here that this is the worst
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:02.360]   kind of focus interruption.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:04.200]   It's not.
[01:08:04.200 --> 01:08:05.200]   It's not.
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:09.840]   I want to give a name to something I talked about in a recent episode.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.840]   I didn't give it that name then.
[01:08:10.840 --> 01:08:12.960]   I'm going to invent the name right now.
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.320]   The Hemingway principle.
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:22.840]   The Hemingway principle says it is not a bad thing to stop working on something deep in
[01:08:22.840 --> 01:08:25.440]   the middle of you being in the flow of working on something deep.
[01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:29.960]   I call this the Hemingway principle because when I brought this up in a recent episode,
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.880]   I talked about Hemingway's specific practice of always stopping writing in the middle of
[01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:40.320]   something that he was on the flow about so that the next day he was picking up from something
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:44.160]   that was really working and you could get right into it and get moving again, as opposed
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:47.400]   to writing until you're completely done and having to start fresh the next day.
[01:08:47.400 --> 01:08:51.520]   It actually can be better to return to something that you were in the flow of.
[01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.660]   First of all, you get a faster start.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:57.660]   Second of all, you give your mind chance to do some unconscious processing about what
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.660]   you're working on.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:02.280]   And when you come back to it, it might be a lot better than if you had kept going.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:07.340]   There is some mental discomfort in these pauses, but the right way to deal with that mental
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:12.160]   discomfort is, okay, my block is about to end five minutes till it ends.
[01:09:12.160 --> 01:09:17.440]   Stop what I'm working on and let's give ourselves a fully encapsulated checkpoint here.
[01:09:17.440 --> 01:09:19.280]   All right, here's where I am.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:20.680]   Let me take a quick note to myself.
[01:09:20.680 --> 01:09:21.680]   Here's what the work on tomorrow.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:22.800]   I stopped right here.
[01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.060]   Here's what I was thinking about.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:26.720]   Go back and check that algorithm.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:30.160]   Make sure you do the smoke testing over on that module.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:34.660]   I was about to look up this technique I heard about, see if that applies here.
[01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:36.160]   Save that, check in my code.
[01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.160]   Okay, good.
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.160]   This is fully encapsulated.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.480]   There's nothing I'm just keeping in my head.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:42.920]   I have a good snapshot of where I was and what I was about to do.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:44.200]   Move on to the next block.
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.620]   Give it 10 minutes, your mind will move on.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:50.620]   So the Hemingway principle says it's not a problem to stop in the middle of something
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:54.640]   deep so long as you capture well exactly where you were.
[01:09:54.640 --> 01:09:58.220]   So you can close open loops and pick up from where you started the next day.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:01.340]   Over time, this is probably actually more efficient.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:07.980]   There was a chapter, not a chapter, but a section of a chapter that was originally in
[01:10:07.980 --> 01:10:11.780]   my slow productivity book that's coming out that got cut just because a lot, you know,
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:13.340]   you cut a lot of stuff when you're working on the book.
[01:10:13.340 --> 01:10:14.340]   But I like this idea.
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:20.420]   It was this idea about cold starts that actually taking something hard and working on it for
[01:10:20.420 --> 01:10:25.580]   a long period of time versus breaking it up into a couple independent sessions.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:29.700]   The couple independent sessions might in the end take less total hours because every time
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.140]   you come back to it fresh, you have new energy.
[01:10:33.140 --> 01:10:38.780]   You can leverage unconscious processing that's happened since the last time you stopped it.
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.180]   And so you come at it with more ammunition.
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.140]   And so the overall quality of your work per minute is much higher if you break it up into
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:51.300]   a few big sessions as opposed to trying to drag it out on one large section.
[01:10:51.300 --> 01:10:53.220]   You get better, more creative work.
[01:10:53.220 --> 01:10:58.380]   So in this chapter I cut from slow productivity, I gave this detailed account of how this math
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:02.100]   proof that won the Fields Medal was proven because there was a book about this.
[01:11:02.100 --> 01:11:05.820]   The mathematicians wrote a whole book about how they solved this math theorem.
[01:11:05.820 --> 01:11:08.340]   And they had their emails and their back and forth correspondence.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.340]   It's a great book.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:11.540]   I think I talked about on the show a couple of years ago.
[01:11:11.540 --> 01:11:16.780]   Anyways, I went beat by beat and it was like all of the big insights came from cold starts.
[01:11:16.780 --> 01:11:17.900]   Your mind was working on it.
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:21.100]   Then they came back to it the next day like, oh, wait, this is even better.
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:23.220]   That's the Hemingway principle.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:25.940]   Don't fear stopping even when things are going well.
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:29.580]   It's not necessarily a problem.
[01:11:29.580 --> 01:11:30.580]   All right.
[01:11:30.580 --> 01:11:31.580]   So I think we have a call, right?
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:32.580]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:33.580]   All right.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:34.580]   Let's do a call.
[01:11:34.580 --> 01:11:37.540]   Remember, if you want to leave a call for us, you just go to the deep life dot com slash
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.540]   listen.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:39.540]   There's a link at the top there.
[01:11:39.540 --> 01:11:41.620]   You can record the call straight from your browser.
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:42.620]   All right.
[01:11:42.620 --> 01:11:43.620]   Let's see who we have here, Jesse.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:44.620]   OK.
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:47.780]   Hi, Cal.
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:52.180]   My name is Rachel and I work in a role where I have two different parts of my job.
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:55.860]   One is clinical and one is research.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:00.180]   And what I've realized as I'm looking at my career is that my two halves of my job are
[01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:02.980]   in two different market types.
[01:12:02.980 --> 01:12:06.780]   The clinical work is very much an auction market, whereas the research is very much
[01:12:06.780 --> 01:12:08.700]   a winner take all market.
[01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:14.740]   And yet oftentimes, like my hiring, my firing, my job security is going to depend a little
[01:12:14.740 --> 01:12:15.740]   bit on both.
[01:12:15.740 --> 01:12:19.800]   And I'm reaching out because I'm wondering if you have any advice for how to approach
[01:12:19.800 --> 01:12:22.460]   this kind of split market career.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:26.960]   Does one take precedence over the other?
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:30.940]   How do you figure out which where to put priorities and how to negotiate that?
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:32.900]   I'd love to hear your thoughts on it.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:33.900]   Thank you.
[01:12:33.900 --> 01:12:40.260]   Well, I'm familiar with this issue because, I mean, essentially you have multiple jobs,
[01:12:40.260 --> 01:12:41.260]   not on paper.
[01:12:41.260 --> 01:12:42.900]   This is all the same academic position.
[01:12:42.900 --> 01:12:47.300]   I'm assuming you're probably is a academic medical school position, but you have these
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:51.060]   different jobs with different objectives and different paths towards success.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:52.300]   I mean, this is my life, right?
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.940]   I mean, I have, I used to joke, 17 jobs.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:13:00.540]   But if we're going to be really clear about it, I have like a research job, a teaching
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:05.100]   job, a writing job, and a sort of a media company job.
[01:13:05.100 --> 01:13:07.660]   Some of these are winner take all, like the research position.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:10.500]   Some of these are more auction market, like the media company.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.340]   I think it's helpful to have mental separation.
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:17.660]   You treat it like I have two jobs and I deal with these jobs separately.
[01:13:17.660 --> 01:13:20.020]   Now there's the complexity about how you schedule both, but fine.
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.020]   That's just a challenge.
[01:13:21.020 --> 01:13:22.020]   I do that all the time.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:23.020]   I have these two jobs.
[01:13:23.020 --> 01:13:27.340]   You should have a separate strategic planning document for both of these roles.
[01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:30.540]   Your weekly plan should be bifurcated.
[01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:31.540]   Like this is what I'm doing for this job.
[01:13:31.540 --> 01:13:33.100]   This is what I'm doing for that job.
[01:13:33.100 --> 01:13:36.780]   And you should keep that in mind when you build your daily time block plans.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:42.000]   You have to be, to succeed with two jobs, you of course have to be organized and efficient.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.860]   This has always been my secret.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:48.900]   If you let any one job, sort of like most people do, if they have one job, just kind
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:50.020]   of take over all your time.
[01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:51.020]   You can't fit two.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:53.020]   So you got to be very organized, very efficient.
[01:13:53.020 --> 01:13:54.020]   Here's what I'm doing with this job.
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:55.020]   Here's what I'm making progress.
[01:13:55.020 --> 01:13:56.020]   Here's what I'm doing with that job.
[01:13:56.020 --> 01:13:57.020]   Here's what I'm making progress.
[01:13:57.020 --> 01:13:59.500]   And with daily time block plans, you're also going to want some bifurcation.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.180]   Let's not mix these things together.
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:03.700]   Now it could be this day is mainly clinical.
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:05.980]   This day is mainly research or the mornings is research.
[01:14:05.980 --> 01:14:09.980]   The afternoons is clinical, but keep some separation there as well.
[01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:13.700]   So again, to have this sort of logical separation between these two roles, you're going to have
[01:14:13.700 --> 01:14:16.380]   separate strategic plans, separate parts of your weekly plan.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:20.380]   You're going to try to divide your week when you're doing your actual planning day to day,
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:23.300]   to try to get some separation there as well.
[01:14:23.300 --> 01:14:27.780]   Do something similar with whatever task organizational system you are using.
[01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:29.820]   These are two different roles, have two different collections.
[01:14:29.820 --> 01:14:33.160]   If you're using Trello, have a separate Trello board for the one role and the other.
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:36.620]   You really want to keep these as in a logical sense, very separate.
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:41.660]   And then it's okay that they operate in different markets because you're tackling them each
[01:14:41.660 --> 01:14:46.160]   differently, different goals, different strategies, different mental context, and you're not mixing
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:48.220]   the two things together.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:54.580]   So you can be very by research, I'm just working on progress, good papers and in clinical work,
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:58.860]   I'm exploring and trying to find whatever my niche is going to be there and putting
[01:14:58.860 --> 01:15:00.140]   together some unique skills.
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:03.700]   They're completely separated logically and mentally, you're going to be able to have
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:07.260]   divergent approaches and goals and strategies for different parts of your life.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.540]   I've been doing this for a few years now.
[01:15:08.540 --> 01:15:09.540]   It works fine.
[01:15:09.540 --> 01:15:10.540]   I mean, it gets complicated.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:13.700]   You got to be on the ball and it does slow down.
[01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:17.860]   If you have two roles, it's hard to fully excel in one versus the other, but it's completely
[01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:22.060]   possible, completely possible to have two roles.
[01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:26.460]   Just keep them separate and your approach to each can be distinct.
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.140]   All right.
[01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:31.820]   So we're going to move here in a second to our final segment where I react to something
[01:15:31.820 --> 01:15:33.140]   that I've seen in the news.
[01:15:33.140 --> 01:15:35.980]   But first we want to hear from another sponsor.
[01:15:35.980 --> 01:15:41.020]   In particular, I want to talk about our friends at My Body Tutor.
[01:15:41.020 --> 01:15:44.940]   I've known Adam Gilbert, My Body Tutor's founder for many years.
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:48.700]   He used to be the fitness advice guy on my study hack blogs.
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:54.620]   His company, My Body Tutor is a 100% online coaching program that solves the biggest problem
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:16:00.460]   in health and fitness, which is the lack of consistency.
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:03.980]   They do this by giving you an online coach.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:09.520]   So a coach you interact with online that you check in with every day.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.460]   The coach helps you figure out what are we going to do with food?
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:12.700]   What are we going to do with fitness?
[01:16:12.700 --> 01:16:16.220]   Let's give you a plan that fits your particular needs and the particular constraints of you
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:17.220]   and your lifestyle.
[01:16:17.220 --> 01:16:18.980]   And then you check in every day with this coach.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:24.100]   You have accountability from someone who knows you, knows what you're trying to do and knows
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:25.100]   your plan.
[01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.900]   It sounds simple, but knowing there's someone that is going to hear what you did today gives
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.900]   you motivation that you otherwise would not have.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:35.220]   You're much more likely to take consistent progress.
[01:16:35.220 --> 01:16:37.700]   Also the coach is there to help you adapt.
[01:16:37.700 --> 01:16:39.060]   It's winter vacation.
[01:16:39.060 --> 01:16:40.780]   We're going to like my parents' house for Christmas.
[01:16:40.780 --> 01:16:41.780]   I'm really worried.
[01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:42.780]   I don't have exercise equipment.
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:43.780]   I eat too much.
[01:16:43.780 --> 01:16:44.780]   Like this is what we're going to do.
[01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.660]   Let's make a special plan just for this week coming up.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:50.100]   It makes a really big difference to have someone there.
[01:16:50.100 --> 01:16:56.100]   But because this is online, it can be affordable in a way that having a trainer in your home
[01:16:56.100 --> 01:16:59.220]   or a personal chef in your home would be out of reach for most people.
[01:16:59.220 --> 01:17:03.780]   So that's what MyBodyTutor is a great idea, leveraging the internet and human psychology
[01:17:03.780 --> 01:17:07.740]   to be incredibly successful in helping you get in better shape.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:11.380]   So if you're serious about getting fit, Adam is giving deep question listeners $50 off
[01:17:11.380 --> 01:17:12.380]   their first month.
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:14.980]   All you have to do is mention this podcast when you join.
[01:17:14.980 --> 01:17:16.620]   This is interesting.
[01:17:16.620 --> 01:17:19.980]   If you have questions, Adam wants you to call him or text him.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:25.000]   You can find his personal cell phone number at the top of every page of MyBodyTutor.com.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:29.180]   This is personal service that gets you results.
[01:17:29.180 --> 01:17:33.180]   Also want to talk about our longtime sponsor at Blinkist.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:41.420]   When you use the Blinkist app, you can get short summaries, either written or you can
[01:17:41.420 --> 01:17:49.500]   listen to them, of over 5,500 nonfiction books and also a huge number of podcasts.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:52.900]   These short summaries, which are called Blinks, gives you the main ideas of these books and
[01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:57.340]   podcasts in just 15 minutes.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:03.140]   The way Jesse and I use Blinkist is as a triage service for the books in our lives.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:07.660]   If there's a book we hear about that we think we might want to read, we will first listen
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:11.020]   to or read the Blink summary of the book.
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:16.200]   They tell you, you just know, "Oh, I don't need to buy this," or, "Oh, yes, I'm fascinated.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.220]   I want to know more about this.
[01:18:18.220 --> 01:18:19.900]   Definitely I want to buy this."
[01:18:19.900 --> 01:18:21.500]   There's other ways to use Blinkist as well.
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:25.020]   I know people, for example, that use it to quickly get the lay of the land of a particular
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:26.020]   topic.
[01:18:26.020 --> 01:18:29.860]   They'll take five books on the topic, read the Blinks, gives them the main terminology,
[01:18:29.860 --> 01:18:33.500]   gives them the main ideas, keeps them up to date without having to read hundreds and hundreds
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:34.500]   of pages.
[01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.860]   There's a lot of ways to use Blinkist.
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:40.980]   If you are serious about having the reading being a portion of your life, and you really
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:46.540]   should if you embrace the deep life, Blinkist is a great partner to have in that commitment
[01:18:46.540 --> 01:18:48.980]   to depth.
[01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:52.060]   Right now, Blinkist has a special offer just for our audience.

[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:35.540]   All right, Jesse, let's move on to our final segment where I react to the news.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:40.300]   So in particular, what I want to react to is an interview I was listening to recently.
[01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.940]   I'll even load this up on the screen for those who are watching.
[01:19:43.940 --> 01:19:52.060]   An interview between Joe Rogan and The Rock, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson.
[01:19:52.060 --> 01:19:57.080]   The Rock is an interesting character, so this interview caught my attention.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.300]   One of the reasons why I'm interested in The Rock, and Jesse, this probably won't surprise
[01:20:00.300 --> 01:20:06.540]   you, is that I'm often confused for The Rock.
[01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:07.780]   This happens a lot.
[01:20:07.780 --> 01:20:12.540]   People will be like, "Oh yeah, I saw you interviewed on The Rock's podcast."
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:13.700]   They're like, "No, no, no, no, no.
[01:20:13.700 --> 01:20:16.100]   I was on a Cal Newport show."
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:18.060]   It's a physical stature thing.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:19.060]   Yeah.
[01:20:19.060 --> 01:20:21.500]   He's probably been to your garage gym.
[01:20:21.500 --> 01:20:22.500]   Yeah.
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:23.980]   People will come by and be like, "Oh, cool, man.
[01:20:23.980 --> 01:20:25.860]   The Newports have The Rock working out in the garage gym."
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:28.220]   They're like, "No, no, it's me.
[01:20:28.220 --> 01:20:29.220]   It's Cal."
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:33.460]   Like, "Oh, we were thrown because of the similarities in your physical stature."
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:34.460]   It's your Hemsworth workout.
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:35.460]   My Hemsworth.
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:38.780]   Also, I'm interested in Chris Hemsworth because this happens a lot.
[01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:41.740]   I'll be picking my kids up from school and people will be like, "Thor!"
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:43.580]   I'm like, "No, no, no.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:44.580]   That's Chris Hemsworth."
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:49.900]   Anyways, so I was listening to this interview with Joe Rogan and The Rock, and they had
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:54.420]   a discussion early on that I wanted to bring up.
[01:20:54.420 --> 01:21:03.700]   Early on, they were talking about the importance of having some sort of passion that you pursue.
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:07.700]   This was in the context of a discussion of some people have it hard, and you're kind
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:09.020]   of grinding day to day.
[01:21:09.020 --> 01:21:13.900]   They're saying, "In this situation, you need something you're going after, something you're
[01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:17.140]   getting after, that you have this passion that you're pursuing that you can focus your
[01:21:17.140 --> 01:21:22.180]   energy on, otherwise you just get stuck with you're on social media all day, you're eating
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:24.740]   crap, you're drinking all the time."
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:29.860]   Having some sort of passion to pursue, they were presenting this in the context of life,
[01:21:29.860 --> 01:21:37.580]   not just in the context of work, as a necessary component to avoiding all the traps that can
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:43.940]   really trap a lot of people these days into a life of resentment or disappointment.
[01:21:43.940 --> 01:21:50.060]   So I wanted to tackle this a little bit, because you could see this idea as maybe contradicting
[01:21:50.060 --> 01:21:57.540]   my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, which was arguing against the common maxim, "Follow
[01:21:57.540 --> 01:21:59.380]   your passion."
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.680]   So let's put these two next to each other.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:06.340]   So Good They Can't Ignore You, and the idea, as spoken by my doppelganger, Dwayne "The
[01:22:06.340 --> 01:22:15.260]   Rock" Johnson, that passion is the key to actually escaping a shallow life.
[01:22:15.260 --> 01:22:19.660]   Well here's the thing, I believe, after listening to this interview, and I want to clarify this,
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:22.340]   we're highly aligned on this.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:26.220]   Because what The Rock and Joe Rogan were talking about, what they did not say, if you listen
[01:22:26.220 --> 01:22:32.380]   to this interview, what they did not say was, "Right now, I want you to think really hard
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:37.600]   today and figure out your one true passion, and then go after it."
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:39.480]   That's not what they said.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:44.700]   What The Rock was saying instead is, "The pursuit of something you're passionate about
[01:22:44.700 --> 01:22:46.260]   is going to free you."
[01:22:46.260 --> 01:22:49.400]   But he did not say where that pursuit actually came from.
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:53.560]   He did not say that you identify that passion easily and from the very beginning.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:57.420]   And we know that in part because we can look at the life of Dwayne Johnson himself, and
[01:22:57.420 --> 01:23:00.360]   he gets into this in this interview.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:06.920]   The haphazardness, or should we say the randomness with which the early stages of his path to
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:10.080]   where he is today actually unfolded.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:13.120]   He talked about football, that was going to be his thing.
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:17.240]   Not everyone knows this about Dwayne Johnson, but he was a relatively successful college
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.240]   football player.
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.560]   He's a big guy.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:24.120]   But he knew at some point, he realized that wasn't going to be his ticket.
[01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:25.120]   He wasn't quite good enough.
[01:23:25.120 --> 01:23:27.080]   And when you play at the high level, you get that sense.
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.360]   He didn't have what it would take to succeed at the NFL level.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:31.860]   So then he gets into wrestling.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:36.000]   But this for a while is really not a great situation.
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:42.600]   He talked about wrestling at bars and selling his headshot for $5 a piece just to sort of
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.720]   make enough money that he could buy a sandwich.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:51.780]   It was a random unfolding of things that got him to eventually a point where he pursues
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.840]   his life with a lot of passion.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:58.120]   So he didn't identify a passion in advance, but lives his life with a lot of passion.
[01:23:58.120 --> 01:24:00.920]   So what lesson do we extrapolate that from for the rest of us?
[01:24:00.920 --> 01:24:05.120]   Well, the idea that I uncover in my book, So Good They Can't Ignore You, is that passion
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:11.480]   is something that you cultivate, not something that you discover.
[01:24:11.480 --> 01:24:14.620]   Passion is not, I do some reflection and I figure out this is what I'm passionate about.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:16.140]   It's something you cultivate.
[01:24:16.140 --> 01:24:17.720]   And how do you cultivate it?
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.740]   Well, you cultivate it with discipline.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.520]   You cultivate it with curiosity.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.040]   It's a combination of those two things.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.360]   You're curious, you're engaged in the world and options and what's possible.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.960]   Through this curiosity, you find something like this could be interesting.
[01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.800]   Let me pursue it with discipline.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:38.520]   And through the discipline pursuit is where you learn, is this thing building momentum
[01:24:38.520 --> 01:24:41.120]   or is it a dead end?
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:42.700]   Curiosity plus discipline.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:48.200]   And when something starts to click, you up the discipline, you up the intensity.
[01:24:48.200 --> 01:24:51.760]   And over time that blossoms into passion.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.560]   And so we see this in The Rock's path, right?
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:56.640]   I mean, he goes from football into wrestling, the wrestling is not going well.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:01.160]   He makes some changes, gets involved with WWE and suddenly things are really starting
[01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:05.460]   to click and he gives that full intense discipline.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:10.120]   Really develops his body, develops himself as someone able to play characters.
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:15.680]   And he begins to pursue his life with this particular goal with a real passion.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:19.020]   That passion then is what carried him from that and the movies and all the other things
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.020]   he's involved with today.
[01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:24.360]   It was a passion that was cultivated from discipline and curiosity.
[01:25:24.360 --> 01:25:28.640]   That I think is the lesson probably if we sat them down here.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.020]   If we got Joe and The Rock, I don't know if they'd accept an invitation, but we should
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:33.020]   send it out.
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:35.600]   Hey, Joe and The Rock, come on by the Deep Work HQ.
[01:25:35.600 --> 01:25:36.600]   Come on into the studio.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:37.600]   We'll talk to you.
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:38.760]   I think they would agree with this.
[01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:41.920]   And certainly I think Dwayne Johnson would probably agree with this.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.480]   Yeah, it's not about I know in advance what I'm supposed to do.
[01:25:45.480 --> 01:25:51.000]   It's about approaching the things that you think might be worth doing with enough discipline
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:55.960]   that you have the opportunity for that to cultivate and blossom into passion.
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:25:57.980]   If that's a possibility.
[01:25:57.980 --> 01:26:01.780]   We discover and develop passion over time.
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:05.820]   We don't find it through a short moment of self-reflection.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:10.820]   So I really like this idea that this discipline, passionate pursuit of things is critical for
[01:26:10.820 --> 01:26:12.300]   the deep life.
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:15.820]   But nuancing that with you don't get there by starting with the passion.
[01:26:15.820 --> 01:26:17.420]   You actually start with the discipline and the curiosity.
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:22.820]   And if you're doing that right, the passion, the passion will come later.
[01:26:22.820 --> 01:26:24.220]   I'm not done with that interview yet, but.
[01:26:24.220 --> 01:26:25.500]   Yeah, I'm going to check it out.
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:29.420]   I started listening to it yesterday while I was exercising.
[01:26:29.420 --> 01:26:30.660]   And that caught my attention.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:31.660]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.660 --> 01:26:33.940]   I don't know what happens later in the interview.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:39.740]   When he talked about Rogan and The Rock coming to the HQ for guests, it reminded me of how
[01:26:39.740 --> 01:26:41.060]   Mad Dog always talks about.
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:46.060]   I mean, he gets a lot of guests, but he's been, he puts in calls like Kyle Shannon and
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:47.660]   Dave Campbell, like some big time NFL coaches.
[01:26:47.660 --> 01:26:48.660]   He just calls us to see.
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:52.580]   Well, I mean, he has his guys do it, but a lot of them just say no.
[01:26:52.580 --> 01:26:57.420]   I mean, he's got a lot of good guests on, but he always makes jokes about how, "Yeah,
[01:26:57.420 --> 01:26:59.500]   we're got the call into Kyle."
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:00.500]   Got the call.
[01:27:00.500 --> 01:27:03.340]   I bet we would get a 10% of the big time.
[01:27:03.340 --> 01:27:08.220]   If we regularly invited big time guests, I think we'd be surprised.
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:12.300]   I think like 10% of the people we invited might come, but we just don't ask because
[01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:13.300]   we don't do a lot of interviews.
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:15.620]   I don't think The Rock would come, but you never know.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.620]   That's like the weird thing about it.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:24.380]   You never know like, oh, this particular celebrity turns out to secretly be a fan.
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.780]   I forgot about this, my agent, because we were doing publicity stuff for the new book.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:34.020]   I forgot about this, but it turns out like Michelle Pfeiffer is a fan of Deep Work.
[01:27:34.020 --> 01:27:35.020]   Oh really?
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:36.260]   It's like a random thing.
[01:27:36.260 --> 01:27:38.860]   Somebody posted a photo of it years ago or something I'd forgotten about it.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:39.860]   So you never know.
[01:27:39.860 --> 01:27:41.540]   So like Michelle Pfeiffer likes Deep Work.
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:45.420]   We know Rory McIlroy, McIlroy, whatever his name is.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:47.860]   He's a big digital minimalism guy, right?
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:48.860]   The golfer, right?
[01:27:48.860 --> 01:27:49.860]   He plays the golfs.
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:52.140]   So you never know.
[01:27:52.140 --> 01:27:54.500]   So we could have Michelle and Rory.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:55.500]   Yep.
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:56.500]   They could both come on the show.
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:59.660]   I was thinking we should invite Schwarzenegger because he has the book out.
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:02.380]   I bet we have like a 20% chance he would come.
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:03.380]   Plus I think he's kind of bored.
[01:28:03.380 --> 01:28:05.260]   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[01:28:05.260 --> 01:28:06.260]   He did Ryan's show.
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:07.260]   He's done a lot.
[01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:08.260]   He's done a lot of shows.
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:09.260]   He was on Ferris again.
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:11.460]   I read his book the other day.
[01:28:11.460 --> 01:28:12.460]   How was it?
[01:28:12.460 --> 01:28:14.660]   I mean, it was fine.
[01:28:14.660 --> 01:28:15.660]   I would recommend his autobiography.
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:16.660]   Yeah, I've read that.
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:18.740]   Yeah, his autobiography, you're going to get the same.
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:20.140]   I mean, it's longer, but it's way more.
[01:28:20.140 --> 01:28:24.180]   I think you're going to get the same lessons and it's like a better book.
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:25.660]   But wait, if we're going to invite him, I shouldn't say that.
[01:28:25.660 --> 01:28:27.220]   I loved his new book.
[01:28:27.220 --> 01:28:28.220]   Let's get him on.
[01:28:28.220 --> 01:28:29.220]   Let's get him on the show.
[01:28:29.220 --> 01:28:31.060]   Oh, well, in the meantime.
[01:28:31.060 --> 01:28:32.500]   He smokes Stogies.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:33.500]   He smokes Stogies.
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:34.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:35.500 --> 01:28:36.500]   Yeah.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:38.500]   What's Zoe going to think if we have Arnold in here smoking Stogies?
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.900]   We probably have to go outside.
[01:28:40.900 --> 01:28:42.220]   But you know what?
[01:28:42.220 --> 01:28:47.100]   The Chinese healer across the hall does those weird oils that like they have a pretty distinct
[01:28:47.100 --> 01:28:48.420]   smell that the whole floor sounds like.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:54.340]   So why can't we have Arnold Schwarzenegger smoking Stogies in our HQ?
[01:28:54.340 --> 01:28:57.300]   Zoe's are the super, if people are wondering, for the built-in.
[01:28:57.300 --> 01:28:58.300]   All right.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:28:59.300]   That's going to be our thing.
[01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.300]   Nonsense.
[01:29:00.300 --> 01:29:01.300]   All right.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.500]   Well, anyways, thank you everyone for listening up to this nonsense.
[01:29:04.500 --> 01:29:05.500]   Thank you for listening.
[01:29:05.500 --> 01:29:11.300]   We'll be back next week as always with another episode and until then stay deep.
[01:29:11.300 --> 01:29:16.260]   Hey, so if you like today's episode about reverse goal setting, I think you'll also
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:24.540]   really like episode two 63, which gives a step-by-step system for overhauling your life.
[01:29:24.540 --> 01:29:26.020]   Check it out.
[01:29:26.020 --> 01:29:33.340]   So today's deep question, how can I reinvent my life in four months?
