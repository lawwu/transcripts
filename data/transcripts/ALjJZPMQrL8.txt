[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   And so that's the it's going to be the deep question we're going to tackle today.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.880]   How do I adapt professional productivity techniques to my life outside of work?
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:16.580]   I'm Cal Newport, and this is Deep Questions,
[00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.120]   the show about living and working deeply in an increasingly distracted world.
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:29.660]   I'm here in my deep work HQ, joined as always by my producer, Jesse.
[00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.560]   Jesse, interesting observation from my life I wanted to point out.
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.560]   As you know, I was in a busy period in the sense that I had these
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.440]   overlapping kind of major deep work intensive deadlines
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.600]   that I was switching back and forth between for months.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.840]   It felt like one after another, always two at a time.
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.500]   All that's temporarily done.
[00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.500]   So like, this is great.
[00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.100]   I don't have a major time demand is now out of my life.
[00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.600]   It's just doing the loose ends of closing up the semester at Georgetown,
[00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.300]   getting my final lectures, grading like this type of thing.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.840]   And what I found this last week of having no major hard things to work on
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.440]   is that the small stuff just ate up all the time.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.680]   Really?
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.940]   And I was ending days feeling rushed and feeling like I was not on top of things,
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.080]   which is crazy because objectively, the amount of available time probably doubled.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.940]   And what I realized was going on is a proto principle type of thing.
[00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.840]   I was not structuring my days because I was like taking time off.
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.980]   I'd come out of all of this intense period.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.580]   Like, look, now it's easy.
[00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.540]   Go to class, just take care of some things.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.940]   And without structure, the small stuff just metastasized and took all the time.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.680]   Like you can spend your entire day.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.940]   Well, let me go back and forth with this person on email.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:50.980]   Let me think about this.
[00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.480]   The time just gets eaten up.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.280]   So now I've had to return to wait a second.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.880]   Even when you don't have a lot to do, you have to structure your time.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.780]   Like you do have a lot to do.
[00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.940]   And what you get out of that is you reclaim your free time.
[00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.840]   But the only way I can reclaim my free time is to actually be really structured.
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.880]   And then if I'm really structured, it's like, oh, I'm done by two.
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.140]   Because I really thought about what's going on.
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.820]   It's mainly small, but let me consolidate this and push this aside
[00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.440]   and handle this real focus and things get done.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.120]   But without structure, what I know objectively to be
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.780]   at half of what I could handle a normal day expanded to take out the full day.
[00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.280]   To be structured during your working day.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:27.180]   Working day. Yeah.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.840]   During the working day, time block planning.
[00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.780]   Yeah. Having having a plan for the day.
[00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.440]   And so I'm thinking about this is probably a lot of people's experience
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.520]   of knowledge work is they're unstructured.
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.020]   So they're just their day is full and they're busy all the time.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.280]   Not realizing they're not actually as busy as they think.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.140]   A little amount of stuff will expand to take over large volumes
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.080]   if it's left free, that we're actually our mental energy
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.340]   is incredibly diffused if we don't focus it.
[00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.840]   Yeah. And our time gets used with an incredible low density
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.740]   if we're not actually packing carefully.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:01.980]   So it's an interesting observation.
[00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.180]   It was a good lesson for me.
[00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.940]   Good reminder that intentionality with your time when you work matters
[00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.000]   whether or not you're busy or not.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.180]   And if anything, I honestly almost dislike these days
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.480]   where I felt busy and I wasn't really doing much and it was all just small stuff.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.040]   I felt more tired and dissatisfied with those days
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.400]   than I think a really locked in day where I'm working on something hard
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.280]   and it's kind of stressful, but everything is fitting in place.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.180]   You know, there's a lesson in there.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.180]   You might have to fit in another book. Yeah.
[00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.040]   I I was kind of hinting down that path.
[00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.440]   My wife is like, no, just don't do anything for a week.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.540]   Don't work on any big project for a week.
[00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:44.680]   I secretly started working on the outline for my next book.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.980]   Don't tell anyone that I had to do a little bit of that.
[00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.840]   I had to. I had to work on my next book just a little bit.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.620]   But one of the things that was happening during this time
[00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.920]   is the non work stuff that had been pushed off to the side
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.980]   a little bit when I was very busy traveling, doing all this other type of stuff.
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.940]   All has collapsed back in on me. Right.
[00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:10.120]   And I have a large amount of non professional
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.540]   sort of personal or household tasks that have have piled up
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.180]   to a pretty big extent. We're talking about.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:21.080]   It's almost comical. I got the whole list, but both our cars need oil.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:25.020]   The lights just all burnt out and stopped working in one of our rooms.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.920]   There's an electricity problem.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.480]   The master lock on my garden shed.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:30.940]   We lost a key.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.580]   And my lawnmower was in there and the grass was getting long
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.680]   and I couldn't get my lawnmowers.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.740]   This is like a locksmith locksmith type of situation.
[00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.440]   We have this big pile of boring but ambiguous, time
[00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.780]   consuming tasks that our financial advisor need us to do.
[00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.820]   It's moving 529s between different states where you have to print all this stuff.
[00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.240]   And it's all it's all complicated.
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.880]   There's tax stuff going on.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:55.520]   There's endless list.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.740]   And what got me thinking about this is like, as I came out of this period
[00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.020]   of intense professional productivity and I'm realizing, oh, I need to restructure
[00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.280]   and get my arms back around during this lower density period,
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.180]   is that something we don't talk about as much on the show
[00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.120]   is how do we successfully take ideas from professional productivity
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.380]   and apply them to the stuff that happens outside of work?
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.740]   I mean, the one idea that we have talked about on a regular basis
[00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:23.280]   is that you can't schedule your whole life with the same structure
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.580]   and systems and intentionality that you maybe tackle your work with.
[00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.080]   But as I've learned recently with this giant pile of household stuff on my plate,
[00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   it can't be haphazard about it either.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.780]   That's a big source of stress or dropping the ball on things.
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:39.480]   And so I figured this would be an interesting topic to cover.
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.920]   How do we think about productivity outside of work?
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.520]   So then coincidentally, as I was thinking about this topic,
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.460]   a friend of mine, Sarah Hart Unger pinged me.
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.400]   So Sarah Hart Unger is a doctor who runs and has run a blog for a long time.
[00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.700]   The blog is called The Shoe Box S H U.
[00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.920]   It took me I'm embarrassed to admit how long it took me to realize
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:07.200]   that shoe stands for Sarah Hart Unger.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.000]   But it's a blog. It started as a doctor blog, but became a productivity blog.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.500]   Very personal and very focused in particular on productivity outside of work.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:22.000]   When you're a doctor, productivity is its own, like very specific, managed thing.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.660]   But it really focused on productivity in life, productivity if you have a family.
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:29.260]   So Sarah thinks a lot about that issue.
[00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.040]   She also co-hosts the podcast with a friend of the show, Laura Vanderkam,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.140]   that talks about these issues.
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:39.800]   She also has her own podcast about planners, which is awesome.
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.500]   I've been on that podcast before talking about the time block planner.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.240]   So anyway, she pinged me like, hey, our family is going to be in D.C.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.300]   because it's spring break and this is where people come on spring break.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.560]   It may be we could podcast like, yeah, come by.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:52.160]   We could podcast in the studio.
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:54.400]   And then I realized, oh, that's also our spring break.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.360]   And we were going to Utah.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.060]   So I said, you know what?
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.460]   We'll just just call into an episode.
[00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.340]   We can do it.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:01.500]   You know, we can do it remote.
[00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:05.400]   But you think and have been writing about productivity outside of work.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:08.860]   Strategies and the unique challenges that presents,
[00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.360]   you've thought a lot more about that than me.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.820]   So why don't you call into the show and we'll we'll get into that.
[00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:17.600]   And so that's the it's going to be the deep question we're going to tackle today.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:22.620]   How do I adapt professional productivity techniques to my life outside of work?
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:26.360]   And Sarah is going to join me in a second and going to help us look into that
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.160]   from a strategic and philosophical perspective.
[00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.100]   Then we'll do some questions that are all about productivity
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.260]   and organization outside of work.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.860]   I want to preview, however, at the end of the show.
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.720]   I'm going to change gears substantially and actually I'm going to return
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:43.720]   to the topic of artificial intelligence, which we talked about on the show,
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.960]   I believe a few weeks ago now, and I'm going to return
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.020]   to this topic of artificial intelligence and tackle directly.
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:54.700]   How worried should you be about this right now?
[00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:58.500]   What's the right way to think about artificial intelligence and its potential risk?
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.220]   There's a really interesting article by Tyler Cowen I'm going to use.
[00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:02.300]   There's my foundation.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.460]   So stay tuned for that.
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:05.560]   At the end of the episode, we're going to do some
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.000]   we're going to geek out on some stuff.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.020]   But first, productivity.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.120]   Outside of work with Sarah Hart Unger.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:17.360]   All right, Jesse, let's get Sarah on the line here and get into this.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.920]   Sounds good.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:19.120]   All right.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:23.000]   Well, the good news is I have Sarah Hart Unger here to help me
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.620]   make sense of these issues.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:30.520]   Sarah, thank you for joining the show, calling in and helping me make sense of this topic.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.120]   I am happy to.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.280]   I love talking about anything planning related or adjacent.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:39.820]   So I thought we would do is before we get into the weeds and God knows
[00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.920]   my audience knows I love to get into the weeds, especially when talking productivity.
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:47.820]   Let's talk a little bit about your story.
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:51.240]   You and I have some parallels, which I think are really interesting
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:54.840]   in that we we both started blogging
[00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:59.060]   in what I think of as the heyday of productivity blogging,
[00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:02.840]   which was that first decade of the 2000s.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.500]   Tell us a little bit about the first the blog you started,
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.760]   then why you started it when you started it.
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.540]   Oh, man, it definitely didn't qualify as a productivity blog in those days.
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.460]   I began my website in 2004, totally influenced by a friend of mine.
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.500]   I was in medical school and I just thought it would be cool to temporarily document
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.900]   part of the phase of my training that I was in.
[00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.600]   And then it just turned out that I loved writing about my life.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.300]   I loved coming up with clever titles and posts and just kind of kept at it.
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:37.260]   My blog has had a lot of different focuses over the years.
[00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:39.660]   I am embarrassed and like cringe when I think of like
[00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:45.200]   sort of like a running health blogger in kind of like the 2007, 2009
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.600]   heyday of those things.
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.500]   And then I started getting really interested in productivity.
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:53.460]   And I still don't know that I would consider my website a productivity website.
[00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:57.040]   I think my podcasts would definitely fit in that realm.
[00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.500]   But it's a life website.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.400]   I mean, I write about things that work for me.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.440]   I'm very passionate about certain things like planning.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.700]   I don't think a lot of people spend enough time
[00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.960]   thinking about what they want to do with their lives.
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:11.200]   So that's a big focus of what I talk about.
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:15.600]   But it's still at its core is a little bit of a personal website as well.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.600]   So I don't know if I totally fit in that productivity world there,
[00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.340]   but then my podcasts have fit that genre.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:23.760]   Well, I'll say this kind of interesting.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:27.160]   Everyone who writes about these issues says, myself included, will say, look,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:31.300]   I'm not this productivity guru trying to tell you how to do whatever.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:35.000]   I don't think there is anyone who actually qualifies.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.200]   No one's actually doing that.
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:36.660]   It's interesting.
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:39.840]   We all we all qualify of, look, this is just my own thing.
[00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:41.160]   And I'm talking about my own life.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:43.460]   But that's actually what I've come to believe.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:47.460]   That is what productivity discussion is, is about yourself and your life
[00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:52.060]   and how I guess back in that early days, 2006 to 2009,
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:56.960]   there were some, I guess, Gawker style life hacker like this is just,
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.240]   you know, here's here's how to do it. But it's interesting.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.000]   It's it's a much more the medium has always been always been pretty personal.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.100]   So is that the right timeline? Do I have that right?
[00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.660]   Then it's roughly that 07, 08, somewhere around there
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.340]   where you began talking about things like planning,
[00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.700]   like organizing your life on your blog that been around for a while at that point.
[00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:17.880]   I think so. I think it started to bleed in.
[00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:20.640]   And I remember being one of the first people to put little pictures
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.800]   of like what I was writing in my physical planner and Instagram
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:24.800]   wasn't around back then.
[00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:28.500]   So this was like kind of interesting to people like, oh, that's how she,
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.680]   you know, puts her checklist together or oh, that's how she laid out
[00:11:31.680 --> 00:11:35.340]   her weekly planner. So, yeah, probably around that time.
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:37.540]   And at some point, the podcast came.
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:41.200]   So, you know, my listeners know we I've known Laura Vanderkam for a while.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:46.800]   Sarah has a co-host, a podcast with Laura, best of both worlds.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:52.500]   And you also have my favorite, a podcast about planners, best laid plans.
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:54.540]   When did those enter the scene?
[00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:58.780]   Yes. So I met Laura through my blog and her blog.
[00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:02.540]   I started commenting on hers and she's like this big name writer to me back then.
[00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.700]   And then she starts commenting on mine.
[00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.540]   And I'm like, oh, my gosh, Laura Vanderkam is reading my blog.
[00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.840]   Like what is happening?
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.540]   And gradually we began to actually get to know each other.
[00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:13.800]   I'm from outside of Philadelphia and she lives there.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.460]   So on some trip to see my parents, we ended up having dinner.
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:21.660]   And soon after that, I wrote something on my blog about wanting to start a podcast.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.940]   And I got an email from her like very quickly after that was like,
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.100]   do you want to do it with me?
[00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.640]   This was 2017.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.340]   Best of both worlds was was born.
[00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:31.640]   And now we are 300 episodes strong.
[00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.340]   It's all about mostly geared towards women making work and life fit together.
[00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.600]   So kind of the intersection of time management, but also work and family.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.740]   And it's been such a fun journey to do that with her.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.600]   And she's such a fun partner.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   Like, I can't wait for you to have her on as well.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:49.100]   She I've learned so much from her through it through the years.
[00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:51.300]   And then best laid plans.
[00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.400]   Total pandemic project. I'm in medicine.
[00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:57.240]   It was rough. I needed an outlet and I love planners.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.860]   And so I started it thinking I was going to like do planner reviews.
[00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.700]   But quickly, I kind of ran out of planners.
[00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.040]   And so it became all things planning and planning adjacent.
[00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.240]   My last episode was a probably Cal Newport Ian rant about screen time.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:13.860]   So, you know, I cover all things now and it's a really fun pet project.
[00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:16.200]   Although I also still do physical planner reviews as well.
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.860]   And I can't wait to have your next time block planner.
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:23.360]   Oh, yes. Yeah, I'm getting you know, I'm getting the mock up and a few weeks
[00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.060]   because we're into the summer.
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.640]   There's going to be version two.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.600]   So stay tuned.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.100]   Well, we'll have to geek out about that.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:32.840]   I'll just preview spiral binding.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.160]   That's what I'm excited about.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.560]   That's what I'm excited about.
[00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:39.800]   And we should mention in terms of your work, you're a pediatric endocrinologist.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.140]   Do I have that right?
[00:13:41.140 --> 00:13:45.100]   And so that's a job where endocrinology does that mean you have to have
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.760]   work within a hospital system because of the equipment or is it outpatient?
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.500]   What's that actual work like?
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:54.760]   Well, there's not much equipment.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.160]   So endocrinology is like treats kids with diabetes, thyroid,
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.800]   you know, short stature, puberty issues, et cetera.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.140]   I am a board certified general pediatrician as well, but I specialized after that.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.340]   And I am in a kind of medium sized group at a not at a sort of burgeoning
[00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:11.540]   academic hospital in South Florida.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:12.380]   But I don't do research.
[00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:16.940]   I primarily do patient care and I work 60 percent as of last October.
[00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:17.980]   So it's three days a week.
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:20.200]   So I can focus on my other pursuits as well.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:21.600]   Very interesting. Very interesting.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.440]   OK, so what I want to talk about is going back in time.
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:27.000]   You're talking more on your blog.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.280]   This is pre podcast, but you're talking more on your blog
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.340]   about issues around organization, productivity and how it intersects your life.
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:36.880]   If I understand, I was reading your about page a little bit.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.940]   I think our our timelines of children is very similar.
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:44.780]   So I think we both had our oldest in 2012.
[00:14:44.780 --> 00:14:45.880]   I think we might have that right.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:48.040]   And we both now have three children.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:50.080]   So there's a very similar timeline.
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.240]   What changed?
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:54.400]   So you're thinking about productivity, you're thinking about organization
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.380]   just from the perspective of I am a young doctor.
[00:14:58.380 --> 00:15:00.280]   Then you start having kids.
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:03.740]   If we go back and read your blog for this period,
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.000]   what are the changes we're going to notice and how you thought about these issues
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.680]   or how you were what you thought was important or what wasn't important?
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:13.640]   I wouldn't say anything changed necessarily.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.240]   It just got harder.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:20.640]   Like it just got more challenging and every minute became just that much more
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.180]   precious. And I don't mean that in the precious way, like Laura and I joke
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:28.000]   like, oh, I need to spend every moment with my like, you know, 18 month old.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.580]   Like 18 month olds are tough.
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.940]   Maybe I don't want to spend every single minute with my 18 month old.
[00:15:31.940 --> 00:15:35.680]   But at the same time, there's just more balls in the air, more stuff to manage,
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.200]   more priorities to think about.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.300]   And certainly the complexity of managing kind of the admin of life
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.380]   does multiply the more children you seem to have.
[00:15:44.380 --> 00:15:47.240]   So I've had to come up with more robust systems
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.740]   to be able to keep up with what that entails.
[00:15:49.740 --> 00:15:53.880]   And I actually feel like that in some ways becomes more and more challenging.
[00:15:53.900 --> 00:15:57.200]   The older the kids get. So I'm probably going to learn even more going forward.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.540]   Yeah. Carpooling enters the scene.
[00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:03.680]   You know, in the episode of my podcast that aired the day before we're doing this
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:07.740]   interview, I made a perhaps unfortunate but accurate metaphor
[00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:12.140]   talking about the impact of kids on your time available to work.
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.400]   And I believe my metaphor involved a forest fire ravaging a city.
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:20.600]   And so I sort of talk about it kind of destroys a lot of things in some people's
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.540]   houses. It all made sense in the context, Jesse will say.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:27.240]   But somehow it was some people's houses get burned down worse than others.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.040]   But everyone is kind of in a hard situation because the city's on fire
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.780]   and maybe not the most loving metaphor.
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:33.900]   But there's some truth to that.
[00:16:33.900 --> 00:16:37.140]   It really makes everything harder.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:39.840]   So can we get let's get a little bit specific then.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.340]   So what type of system, when you think about organizing yourself right now,
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:49.340]   what are you using and how do you differentiate between
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:52.280]   thinking about your practice versus everything else that's happening
[00:16:52.280 --> 00:16:53.880]   outside of work?
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:57.480]   So I set goals kind of based on the time horizon,
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.740]   and I like to always think about the level of goals above where I am
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.400]   when I'm setting that time horizon goals.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:04.440]   And that sounds more complicated than it is.
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:07.740]   Give it a fancy name to which probably makes things worse called nested goals.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:12.000]   And that means every day I'm looking at kind of what I had set my goals
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   for the week and choosing my goals for the day.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:17.180]   Every week I'm looking at the goals I set for the month,
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:20.100]   as well as kind of like what's on my landscape and choosing my goals
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.700]   for the week, et cetera, going up levels to year.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:25.940]   I never went above year yet, although that's something I could consider.
[00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:29.840]   And I have really, you know, specific routines in place
[00:17:29.840 --> 00:17:34.100]   for each of these levels as well, which I think are flexible.
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.140]   And they change as the kids, you know, have different needs
[00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.340]   or are in different stages.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:42.040]   So, for example, right now, our weekly kind of family planning
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.200]   routine involves a whiteboard.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:48.460]   I know, really high tech that every single Sunday I put like
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.260]   all of the kids activities, what we're having for dinner, who's driving anything.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:53.660]   I have a full time nanny.
[00:17:53.660 --> 00:17:57.640]   So I guess one other soapbox I'll stand up on is have more child care
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:01.800]   than you think you need if you are able to, because if you have a couple
[00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:04.940]   where both parties have pretty significant jobs and big dreams,
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:07.860]   then you're probably going to need some help unless you are lucky enough
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:09.740]   to have family that's able to fill that role.
[00:18:09.740 --> 00:18:11.460]   So total tangent.
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.840]   But I put all that information together.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.760]   And it's worth saying your husband's a surgeon, right?
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:17.000]   So we can set the context.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.600]   My husband's a vascular surgeon, not the world's most flexible job,
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.740]   a great dad.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.940]   And just like you've mentioned, you know, parenting has impacted him too,
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:28.340]   because I know that's one of the critiques that you've had to fight at times.
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:29.100]   But it's true.
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.460]   It's a fire for all of us.
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:31.460]   It's a fire for him.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.100]   And the more we can keep things running smoothly, the less that fire will take us
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:35.460]   all over.
[00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:38.100]   So every week, we look and see what's coming.
[00:18:38.100 --> 00:18:41.500]   We kind of proactively think about what the issues might be.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:46.440]   And as low tech as it is, that seems to work for us on a weekly scale.
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:48.140]   But we have to go up levels too.
[00:18:48.140 --> 00:18:50.740]   Like we want to think about on a grand scheme, where do we want to go on
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:51.460]   vacations?
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:53.900]   You know, what are our big goals for the family this year?
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:57.340]   What activities would be really great for the kids to look at?
[00:18:57.340 --> 00:19:02.060]   And for that scale of things, we actually, every year, my husband and I do like a
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.060]   little mini retreat where we kind of plan out the calendar.
[00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.640]   And so that is a collaborative effort to make sure our family is kind of moving in
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:09.800]   the direction that we want.
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.740]   And then kind of on the smaller scale, we operationalize.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:17.800]   So yeah, I guess that's in a nutshell view kind of how we manage the rest of life.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:20.800]   - So what's on the whiteboard used for the weekly planning?
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.000]   Is it drawing out day by day and you have notes on it?
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.460]   Is it just highlights?
[00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:26.300]   What would we see?
[00:19:26.300 --> 00:19:27.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:27.860]   - It's a calendar.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:32.000]   So it's an old whiteboard by Aaron Condren that's not made anymore.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.600]   I know that's not terribly useful, but it has the days of the week and then there's
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.400]   a blank section.
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.740]   So there's eight, it's like a grid, four on the top, four on the bottom.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:42.240]   And then the blank one's usually for like to-do items or like, "Right now,
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.840]   we got in trouble because our roof is dirty."
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.840]   So I put clean roof or figure out someone to clean the roof.
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:50.040]   And then for each day, I put like what the kids have, who's driving,
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.700]   what's for dinner, any schedule alteration from the norm, if someone has to stay late,
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.840]   if I'm hosting book club, etc.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.700]   And I really do feel like this kind of thinking ahead of time,
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.600]   where are the blocks of time I can grab?
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.600]   What are the things I want to do?
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:08.960]   And then planning around that rather than like let life happen and see what ends
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:13.280]   up fitting in, I end up getting to do so much more like we get to do,
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:15.380]   more of what we actually want to do.
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:16.480]   Do things come up?
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:17.280]   Yes.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.480]   - Like you're saying, if you see you're thinking ahead for the week and, you know,
[00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.720]   your husband might say, "You know what?
[00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:24.720]   We would love to go try out this new restaurant or something like that."
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.020]   Because you're thinking about it in advance, you're now able to be like, "Okay,
[00:20:28.020 --> 00:20:29.080]   well, here's what we're going to do.
[00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:30.880]   Let's arrange for the babysitter.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:34.180]   Let's say no to these two things, play dates or whatever.
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.080]   Let's keep this day clear."
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.800]   By looking in advance at your time horizon, you're able to actually have more
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:43.400]   flexibility than if it was just, "Okay, now it's Wednesday afternoon.
[00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:44.480]   What can we do tonight?"
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.880]   And it's like, "Oh, my God, we scheduled ourselves once again all the way
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.400]   tonight or we both were working."
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:53.400]   And so that looking ahead, you're saying, is allowing you to move the...
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:57.000]   We talk about sometimes moving the blocks of time around the sort
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:00.340]   of proverbial schedule chessboard.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:01.240]   So you have some advance.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:01.880]   - Yes.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.280]   When I think when you mentioned like, you know, what did having kids change?
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:09.880]   I think you're getting at that right now, which is that like the spontaneity in
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:15.760]   theory is great and maybe you can like decide to go to a random restaurant on a
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.560]   Wednesday night when there's no kids.
[00:21:17.560 --> 00:21:22.160]   But once there are multiple players in the mix, it does require a broader horizon
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.560]   to make things happen.
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:27.080]   And if you go ahead right now and turn to like, I don't know when this is airing,
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.080]   but like July 23rd, you're probably free.
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:33.360]   So if there's something that's important to you, put that on July 23rd now because
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:36.200]   on July 21st, it's going to be filled with something else.
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:39.200]   So planning just becomes very, very important.
[00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:42.560]   And the more important something is to us, the farther back we probably want
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:43.360]   to be thinking about it.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:43.840]   - Interesting.
[00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:47.960]   So at the annual level, when you're on the retreat, this is where you might also look
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:51.000]   at different seasonal rhythms and work, I'm assuming.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.160]   Like this is always a busy period because whatever, all the kids have to get...
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:58.360]   Before school starts, everyone's coming in to get some sort of whatever.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:21:59.560]   This is the heavy surgery season.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:01.360]   So let's aim for right after this.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:02.840]   We know March is a great time.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:04.600]   Let's really protect this and keep this clean.
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.520]   This is when we can go, whatever, relax or vacation.
[00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:11.840]   So I'm assuming on this annual level, you probably really get to make sure the
[00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:12.760]   important stuff falls.
[00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:16.080]   I mean, because I think about this sometimes, when important events happen
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:18.800]   in people's lives, they're able to make time for it.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:22.640]   You know, there's a medical issue, there's a relative gets sick,
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.600]   there's a major house issue, your roof has a big problem.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.240]   Time is made.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.400]   Things have to get cancelled, things get moved around.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.520]   So it's possible to make time, but there's a lot of force that has
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:34.680]   to be applied to do so.
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.560]   It never just sort of naturally opens up.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:41.560]   So the more you're really looking ahead, it sounds like the more breathers,
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:49.320]   adventure, exploration, all of that can find a spot if that spot is protected
[00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:50.560]   farther in advance.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.240]   So the planning aspect is really coming through at multiple scales here.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.920]   - And I think you're so right that when there's an emergency,
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:58.600]   we're going to be able to clear off those meetings.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:02.000]   But like, I'm not going to be able to decide I want to run XYZ marathon
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:02.760]   in two days, right?
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:05.520]   Because like that might be important to me, but it's not going to like be the
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.760]   emergency type of thing that could just knock everything off.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.400]   That kind of thing has to be thought out well in advance.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.800]   So that's a great distinction to make.
[00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:17.400]   - Another thing you mentioned, and I want to get soon to how you operationalize this
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   on the daily level, I think this is where we're going to get some help I'm going
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.080]   to need.
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.840]   But I really like the partnership aspect of this.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.560]   And, you know, I do calls and questions.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:31.160]   So I don't know how much you get this in your letters or when people write in for
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:36.160]   your show, but something that comes up often on my show is the disaster that
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:39.760]   happens when you have two members of a partnership, let's say like a married
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:43.320]   couple, and they're both trying to do this separately.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:47.960]   And each person is thinking about just, "Well, what do I want to do?
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.160]   What's important to me?"
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.080]   And these things are just clashing left and right, you know?
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.680]   And it's, you know, "I want to run a marathon, and that's important to me,
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:56.400]   and I should be able to run a marathon."
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.240]   And now, wait, every single morning, you're having to do this training,
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.640]   and it really doesn't work with...and it's a big disaster.
[00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:03.320]   Whereas if it had been planned in partnership, it's like, "Well,
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:03.960]   here's the issue."
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:08.040]   Like, that really clashes really terribly with our schedule.
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.800]   But this other thing you might be interested in would work really well.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:15.320]   And so I like that aspect where you're talking about you and your husband go on
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:16.920]   a retreat to think about this.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:22.280]   Your whole family looks at the whiteboard because it seems like this doesn't work
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:25.560]   when you have a group of people, and everyone is on their own trying
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.600]   to just make decisions, the, "Hey, what do I want to do?
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:28.960]   What's important to me?"
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.200]   Or getting the tit for tat, thinking, "Well, you got to do that,
[00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:33.280]   so I got to make sure I get to do this."
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:36.640]   And you're not doing it in a collaborative structure.
[00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:39.040]   That seems like that falls apart pretty quickly because these pieces are
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:41.680]   complicated, and they don't...to make them fit together,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.240]   you have to be incredibly intentional.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:46.440]   It's hard to build a complex mechanism when you have two people
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:47.240]   with blindfolds on.
[00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:48.640]   - I agree.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:52.600]   And if you have one person that tends to enjoy doing more of the planning,
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:56.440]   then you hope that the other person at least can weigh in on...you know,
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:57.400]   have veto power.
[00:24:57.400 --> 00:25:01.440]   You know, like, they hopefully will appreciate the labor that it takes
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:02.880]   to do the planning, and I'm very lucky.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:05.640]   And maybe it's partly because I do a whole podcast about it,
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.560]   but my husband understands that this actually takes time.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:09.440]   This is mental load.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.400]   This is emotional labor.
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.680]   So if I work to put something together that he's not part of,
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:15.640]   he's going to be respectful about it, but at the same time,
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.640]   I want to include him.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.320]   I'm not going to, like, plan some big adventure or some big thing just for me
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.240]   that's going to impact him without discussing it.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.760]   And that's why I do feel like...I mean, I called it a retreat, and we do.
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:29.440]   We go every year, and we...every few months...I would say every,
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.520]   like, four to six months, we try to do, like, a trip where it's two
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:37.760]   nights, just us, and talk about a lot of these things and how they're going.
[00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:41.000]   And then once a year, one of those will be, like, what I would really formally
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.040]   call a retreat to, like, "Okay, this is our calendar.
[00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   What do you prioritize?
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:45.960]   What should we do?"
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.560]   - Yeah, I love that.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.160]   And we do something similar.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.840]   I also like the idea...my wife and I do some of this.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.720]   You can do a balanced responsibilities here that lean into strengths.
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:26:01.280]   So maybe if one person is better at or prefers to be involved in, let's say,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.120]   logistics or interpersonal logistics, the other person says, "Okay,
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.800]   well, here's five other household stuff, like the budget,
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.240]   like keeping up on the household repair, the car repair,
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:14.280]   stuff that's maybe not interpersonal logistical but a pain.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:15.440]   All right, I'll do all that stuff."
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:20.120]   And you can kind of get a nice balance that leans into strengths.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:23.880]   Like, "Okay, I'm willing to, you know, I like to get into it with the
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:25.520]   contractors and blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.800]   And you like to talk to the relatives and figure out who's coming
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.480]   to who on Christmas.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:34.160]   And so, great, we'll have a balance of powers here.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.440]   We're all leaning into our strengths and like roughly speaking,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:37.120]   stuff gets done.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.080]   - And I don't remember where I learned it, but someone called it vertical
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.960]   ownership, which I think is a great way to refer to things like,
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:45.600]   "I own pediatrician visits, so like I'm not going to bother him
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:46.240]   about them."
[00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.800]   And then he's going to own cleaning the roof.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.680]   Like, "If we get something from the HOA, I don't even want to know about it."
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:54.520]   And honestly, maybe not for every relationship, but I find that helps to just
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.480]   have like realms that are like owned by one person versus owned by the other.
[00:26:59.480 --> 00:27:02.240]   And these don't have to split by any traditional gender norms.
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.160]   I agree, they should be...
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:03.720]   - Strengths.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:04.720]   - Split by strengths.
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:05.040]   - Yeah.
[00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:08.520]   - But it helps to just be able to hand something off entirely to someone.
[00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:09.720]   - I like vertical ownership.
[00:27:09.720 --> 00:27:11.600]   I like that terminology.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:15.720]   Occasionally, we do have couples we know, it is kind of weird where you're
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.920]   arranging something, like just when you're dropping off their kid or something,
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:21.360]   and both parents are in the text.
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:26.800]   And it feels like this can't possibly be the most efficient distribution of
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.720]   resources here that both of you are involved in thinking through because it is
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:34.640]   much more...vertical ownership, I think, is more common and it works great.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:37.240]   Like, "Okay, which parent am I talking to about this?
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:39.640]   Oh, this parent is doing the soccer carpool.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:43.120]   Oh, this parent is really the play date parent."
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:45.240]   And yeah, I think that's fantastic.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:49.400]   All right, let's talk about operationalizing then day to day.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:53.040]   So, you have the annual helps influence the weekly.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.760]   By the way, we call this multi-scale planning on my show, but I'm typically
[00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.440]   talking about multi-scale planning very professionally.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.320]   Multi-scale, you know, quarter, weekly, daily, but very much in the context of
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.480]   I'm at my computer screen working.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.520]   So, this is great to see this adjusted.
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.080]   So, the annual is influencing the weekly.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:12.120]   The weekly is going to influence the daily.
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.120]   Now, how are we getting through in your approach day by day?
[00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:17.440]   - Yeah.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:19.280]   So, this is perfect timing.
[00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.760]   I literally just...I have this thing called Best Laid Plans Academy, and I taught the
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.040]   daily session today.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.200]   So, this is fresh.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.840]   But I think in order to plan your day, you need three things.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:32.480]   You need a calendar that is reliable, that I call like a one source of truth,
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:36.080]   a hard landscape that you know like this is actually what I have going on.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   And in this day and age, there's a lot of people who are using digital calendars,
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:42.840]   but are like using multiple ones, and like kind of like one for home and one for work,
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:43.560]   and this is on paper.
[00:28:43.560 --> 00:28:47.080]   And I really think having them in one integrated place is very important.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:49.680]   So, it's not a search and find when you're like, "What do I have on my
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.400]   docket for the day?"
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:52.320]   - What are you using for this?
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:53.320]   - I use paper.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:54.000]   - Okay.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.800]   - So, I mean, I use digital tools, obviously.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:58.160]   I have to use Outlook for work.
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:29:00.360]   I have to use Epic for the electronic medical record.
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:02.680]   I know how to use Google Calendar because honestly, that's how I send my
[00:29:02.680 --> 00:29:03.840]   husband stuff.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.680]   But I prefer paper as my integrator.
[00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:10.240]   So, I like to use a vertical weekly layout where I can...it almost looks like a version
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:11.840]   of Google Calendar on paper.
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:12.360]   - Okay.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:13.080]   - And then...
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.480]   - Can you walk us through what's the landscape?
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.960]   So, per page, what do you have?
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:18.760]   What's the actual layout?
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:19.400]   - Oh, interesting.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.320]   So, I have an actual calendar view.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:22.360]   I wish I had a visual.
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.280]   I could have...oh, well.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:24.360]   I could show it at the end.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:25.240]   I'll send you a picture.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.480]   So, it's a vertical weekly, which is what I prefer.
[00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:30.360]   And then part of it is set up like a calendar.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:33.720]   So, I love Japanese products because there's a lot of room to write.
[00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:37.120]   So, like Hobonichi, right now I'm using one by Sterling Inc.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   But basically, like, you know, I can block out the hours of what I'm doing.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.600]   But I also have rows along the bottom that I've used in late night hours where I'm
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:48.720]   sleeping to put what my workout is for the day, any kid activities that are
[00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:53.080]   happening for the day, any priority tasks that I know are assigned to a specific day,
[00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.960]   I put in little tiny boxes along the top.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:58.120]   And then along the left side, I have, like, my tasks for the week that I've
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.040]   identified on my previous weekly review.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:00.360]   So...
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:04.200]   - Is it one day per page or is it seven days?
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.840]   You have seven vertical columns or five vertical columns per page.
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:10.520]   - So, I use both.
[00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:15.280]   So, but when I talk about my hard landscape calendar, I'm talking about seven
[00:30:15.280 --> 00:30:19.840]   calendars, seven columns plus a column on the left for, like, tasks.
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   So, that makes eight columns total.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:26.800]   And then as I'm planning my day, I refer to that source of truth, which, again,
[00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:30.400]   in my case is paper, but it could be your Google Calendar, your Fantastical,
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.640]   your whatever.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:36.160]   And you have to have your schedule and then you have to have your task list that
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:39.160]   you're going to decide what is important to work on that day.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:43.640]   And that should be influenced by your schedule and by your energy and, like,
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:44.600]   by what's the most pressing.
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:46.480]   So, those three things kind of get integrated.
[00:30:46.480 --> 00:30:48.480]   You decide what actually goes onto your list.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.360]   And the third component of planning your day is just, like, if you have any
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.000]   specific rituals or routines.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.800]   Like, Laura does certain things every day.
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:55.920]   I do certain things every day.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:56.360]   You do.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:57.720]   I think you check off certain metrics.
[00:30:57.720 --> 00:31:00.520]   So, there might be things that are just, like, sort of non-negotiable.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.320]   You walk, you exercise, or whatever it is.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.600]   So, that might kind of influence how you structure your day as well.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.840]   And I actually do go through the ritual each morning, looking at my hard
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:14.360]   landscape, looking at, like, what I have to do and deciding what I'm going to
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.480]   tackle that day.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.000]   And I write that on my daily page.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.240]   That's a little different from your time block planning method and, honestly,
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.960]   might even be considered less reactive.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:24.200]   So, I'm always like, "Oh, Cal's not going to like this."
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.640]   But for me, it works.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:28.000]   And I think, in part, it works because when I'm seeing patients,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.800]   those days are so structured that, like, I don't need any more time stress.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:34.800]   Like, if I'm getting something done, it might be, like, during my lunch hour
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:35.640]   or between patients.
[00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.520]   So, I can't time block plan that.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:41.680]   And then on my non-patient days, I just want to be more free because I am
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.160]   so constrained on the patient days.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.480]   So, I prefer that.
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:49.440]   But I like to think that so much thought goes into making that to-do list that
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:50.840]   is not really list reactive.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:54.480]   I've, like, kind of already prioritized it and I'm just seeing where the blank
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:57.400]   pockets of time are and then I can go about it in a methodical way.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:00.560]   - Well, and doctors' professional days are, as you mentioned,
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:01.760]   they're already time block plan.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:03.000]   So, you are doing time block planning.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.480]   I mean, it's being done in your patient scheduling system.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:10.240]   But the doctors already time block plan because that's how patient calendars work,
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:10.520]   right?
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:14.120]   Where if you have a job where you don't have that and every day is just you
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.560]   and your inbox, that's where, "Okay, I need to add some more artificial
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:20.400]   processing, I need to add some more time."
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.000]   And so, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.320]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.640]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:26.000]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.360]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:28.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.200]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.200]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.600]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:36.000]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:37.320]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:38.800]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.280]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:41.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:43.240]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.720]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.120]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:47.640]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.200]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:50.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.400]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.000]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.680]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:55.680 --> 00:32:57.440]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.160]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.920]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.640]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.360]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.120]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.880]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:09.600]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.320]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:11.320 --> 00:33:13.080]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.880]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.680]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:18.480]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.360]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.280]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:24.240]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.120]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:28.040]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:28.040 --> 00:33:29.960]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.920]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:33.880]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.880]   So, you're already time blocking.

[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:39.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:41.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:43.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:47.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:49.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:01.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:01.760 --> 00:41:03.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:07.760 --> 00:41:09.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:09.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:13.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:13.760 --> 00:41:15.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:17.760 --> 00:41:19.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:21.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:27.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:27.760 --> 00:41:29.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:31.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:35.760 --> 00:41:37.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:37.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:41.760]   So, you're already time blocking.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:43.760]   So, that's good. I just want to point out,
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:45.760]   I'm glad that you emphasized,
[00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:47.760]   maybe people do it and they're worried
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.760]   about talking about it because this is very,
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.760]   different people can do different things,
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:53.760]   but I don't think we should be worried about talking about it.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   Some people can do a lot more than others.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.760]   We have to be careful also,
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:59.760]   there is privilege inherent in this.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.760]   I know you're going to get emails,
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:03.760]   but I can't do that right now.
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:05.760]   I get it. I mean, I couldn't do that when I was a resident either.
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:07.760]   There is inherent privilege,
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:09.760]   and at the same time,
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:11.760]   there are families who probably could do more
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:13.760]   than they are currently doing.
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:15.760]   So, I do want to recognize that
[00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:17.760]   not everybody is well compensated enough
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.760]   for this to work,
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.760]   but if it is, and you have two big jobs,
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:23.760]   it's kind of like,
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.760]   we have a 2011 Prius, okay?
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.760]   That's where our priorities are.
[00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:31.760]   Maybe when you think of it more about
[00:42:31.760 --> 00:42:33.760]   shifting resources,
[00:42:33.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   spend less on this, spend more on this,
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:37.760]   and what those amounts are differ for different people.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.760]   But yeah, there's this interesting block
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:41.760]   with yard work and house work
[00:42:41.760 --> 00:42:43.760]   and logistical stuff
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:45.760]   that there's this sense of,
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   "You shouldn't spend money on that,"
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:49.760]   because there's a thrift in theory,
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:51.760]   even if you have the money, but in theory, I could do that.
[00:42:51.760 --> 00:42:53.760]   I think the "in theory, I could do that"
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.760]   has probably created more unnecessary stress
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:57.760]   than almost any other mindset.
[00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.760]   Because it's true, in theory,
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   I could rake the leaves,
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:03.760]   but it also takes me a really long time.
[00:43:03.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   All right, this is great, though.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.760]   I was just going to say, there's parenting tasks
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:09.760]   that I want to outsource
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.760]   and some that I don't.
[00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:13.760]   I want to be there to help my kids with their homework,
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:15.760]   and if that means that I'm not doing the laundry,
[00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:17.760]   I have a planner,
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.760]   I can see how many hours there are.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   I can't do everything, and also get the rest
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:23.760]   and stuff that I need.
[00:43:23.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   We do have to make intelligent choices
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.760]   or thoughtful choices about what we decide to outsource,
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:29.760]   and that doesn't mean that it's nothing,
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.760]   because in reality, you can't do everything.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   Now, what do you think about this theory?
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.760]   Because it sounds like you might exemplify it
[00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.760]   with your own life as well.
[00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:39.760]   When people get more serious about planning,
[00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   they tend to be
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:43.760]   not just less stressed, but they're less likely
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.760]   to talk about themselves as being overloaded.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.760]   The fallacy is,
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   "Oh, that's because with planning,
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   you can juggle a lot more things."
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:53.760]   My theory is,
[00:43:53.760 --> 00:43:55.760]   the reality is, with planning,
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   you learn a lot more about
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   how much time you really have
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:01.760]   and how much time things really take.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:03.760]   Planners have this good source
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   of back pressure that gets them
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.760]   limiting things on the intake.
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   Now you have a really good sense of,
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.760]   "I'm not going to agree to do that.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.760]   That's too much," because you're used to seeing your plan
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.760]   on these different scales.
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   Planners are less likely to be overloaded,
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:19.760]   not because they can somehow make better use
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.760]   of their time, though they do,
[00:44:21.760 --> 00:44:23.760]   but more because they're familiar with their time,
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   and they can avoid getting
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.760]   into the time trouble in the first place.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   You end up drowning when
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   the intake maybe was
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.760]   not well curated, and you get to Wednesday
[00:44:33.760 --> 00:44:35.760]   and you agreed to the four things on Thursday
[00:44:35.760 --> 00:44:37.760]   and you're kid's sick, and you have a busy workday,
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.760]   and the stress comes from that's impossible.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.760]   But it's impossible in part
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:43.760]   because maybe you weren't
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   thinking through the last
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   50 weeks of doing this weekly planning
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:49.760]   and seeing what happens. I don't know.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   What's the role there? What do you think about this theory that just being
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   more aware of your time
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   can be as big of a role
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:57.760]   in you feeling less overloaded than actually just trying to
[00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.760]   squeeze more things into your
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:01.760]   schedule by being careful about your time?
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.760]   I think it helps. I think,
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:05.760]   I mean, I have to again be careful because
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.760]   some people are facing such challenges
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   that it doesn't matter how much planning
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   they do, they're going to have some
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   stress, and that's tough. But
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   I also think there are a lot of people
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:17.760]   that can be helped by doing more planning,
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:19.760]   and that I do do a lot of things
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:21.760]   and generally don't have a lot of stress about them.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.760]   Yeah, stuff comes up,
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:25.760]   but if I've kind of been overall
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   kind of looking at the
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   big picture, what's ahead, so that I can
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.760]   be a little bit more proactive than reactive
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   when the surprises do come, they're not going
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:35.760]   to set things into such a
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:37.760]   disaster mode, and so things are less stressful
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   overall. I also think you're right.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   It helps me be more realistic about
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   saying no to things, and
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   sometimes just
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:47.760]   getting ahead of stuff makes stuff easier.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.760]   Like, if you ask someone
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.760]   to give a lecture in six
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   months, for example, they're probably going to say yes,
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   and your task is done. You've asked it, you've filled it,
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:57.760]   you're done. If you are trying to find someone to fill
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:59.760]   a lecture in two days, or you're trying to
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.760]   get a fancy restaurant reservation
[00:46:01.760 --> 00:46:03.760]   in two days, it's very
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:05.760]   hard, because all of a sudden
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   the options are not open to you, and so
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.760]   by thinking a number of steps ahead,
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:11.760]   you can actually
[00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:13.760]   make certain things easier.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.760]   So I think that helps as well. You have lots of free time
[00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:17.760]   over the next month. You have very limited free time
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   over the next day. There's a general rule
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   of thumb. So if you're
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   thinking far ahead, you have plenty of time to do it, and if you're
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.760]   thinking about, "Oh, now I need to do this for tomorrow,"
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.760]   yeah, that's what happens to college students.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   Back when I used to advise college students,
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   they actually have plenty of time, but their issue
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   is they wait until the deadline
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   arises to say, "Oh, I need to work on
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   this now," and then you're just playing schedule
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:39.760]   roulette, because if two things have the same
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:41.760]   deadline, now you're staying up all night,
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   and now it's screwed. And I always talk
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:45.760]   to them, like, if you just looked at even just one week ahead,
[00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   or two weeks ahead, you have plenty of time. Just start that
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   paper two weeks ago when you have nothing to do,
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   and then the week before the paper, you can study
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:53.760]   for the midterm and not have to do both,
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:55.760]   but I might as well be telling
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:57.760]   them, "Just flap your arms
[00:46:57.760 --> 00:46:59.760]   really hard, and you'll begin to fly,"
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:01.760]   because to them, it's just as believable
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.760]   that they're going to do that.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.760]   I also have to say, and this is
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.760]   going to be a compliment to you, which is
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:09.760]   that all the planning and time awareness
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   helps you realize
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   certain things are very time-sucking
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   and not important, and I do credit you
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   for one of the things that's gotten me
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.760]   entirely off of social media.
[00:47:19.760 --> 00:47:21.760]   I'm just like, "Don't have time
[00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:23.760]   for--that's not a priority for me."
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:25.760]   I have so many other things that I want to do
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:27.760]   that I've planned in intentionally, that if I'm
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   spending two hours
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:31.760]   sucked into Instagram that I'm not going to get
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   to do, and by completely crossing
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   that off of my list, which honestly, you are
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:37.760]   really part of what helped me do that,
[00:47:37.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   that's also opened up a lot of time.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.760]   But I think that the planning awareness and your
[00:47:41.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   influence came together
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.760]   in a nice way there. - How do you and your
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   husband think about your portfolio
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   of kids' activities to balance--
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   kids need stuff to do, it's
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:53.760]   important for them, but also certain combinations
[00:47:53.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   of activities are going to have a
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.760]   much bigger footprint on
[00:47:57.760 --> 00:47:59.760]   our schedule and our stress levels than others.
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:01.760]   Where does this fall into, the way
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:03.760]   when you do your planning? - I think I tend
[00:48:03.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   to land more on the Laura
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   side, which is like, if a kid wants to do
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:09.760]   an activity, I'd rather them do
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   that activity than
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   them end up wanting to be on
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   a device, which is what they want to do otherwise.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   So, my kid is
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:19.760]   trying out for trouble soccer, so it's like,
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:21.760]   I mean, what can I say? I guess
[00:48:21.760 --> 00:48:23.760]   that's where the outsourcing and the carpooling
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:25.760]   and the networking and the planning so that I can
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.760]   make that carpooling work
[00:48:27.760 --> 00:48:29.760]   comes into mind. But I guess
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   I would be loathe
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:33.760]   to turn down one of my kids an
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   opportunity for convenience, and
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.760]   I know some families love
[00:48:37.760 --> 00:48:39.760]   family dinners, but
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:41.760]   confession, we don't really have them
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.760]   that often because my husband is not home in time.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:45.760]   Not because I don't want them, but it would be like me
[00:48:45.760 --> 00:48:47.760]   and the kids, and like, you know, sometimes I do
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:49.760]   eat with the kids, and that's one version of family dinner,
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:51.760]   but I don't have a family dinner sacred
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:53.760]   ritual that would be disrupted by my kid having
[00:48:53.760 --> 00:48:55.760]   later night soccer. So instead,
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.760]   it just kind of fits in
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:48:59.760]   and gets planned in, etc. So, I think
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:01.760]   especially as my kids get older,
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.760]   if they have passions,
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.760]   I just want to make it happen
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   for them. - Yeah, I had a similar change
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   of heart. When my kids were young, I used to think about
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:11.760]   time-intensive sports.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.760]   Like, "Oh, I don't understand this. This seems like such a pain,
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   and the parents' time
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   is important, too, and this takes so much time."
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:19.760]   And then as your kids get a little bit older, you're like, "Oh, this is much
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:21.760]   better than the alternatives." Especially
[00:49:21.760 --> 00:49:23.760]   when I have all boys. Like, "Okay,
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.760]   you can go run for hours
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   instead of just being at home
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:29.760]   and bothering me or trying
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.760]   to play video games." Like, "Oh, now I understand
[00:49:31.760 --> 00:49:33.760]   why kids do
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:35.760]   so many sports." It's because if you think
[00:49:35.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   abstractly, you have all this time when the kids are not
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:39.760]   in school. If you can take a
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:41.760]   significant portion of those hours and they're outside
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:43.760]   and there's another adult that they have to listen to
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.760]   and their learning skills and
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:47.760]   not bothering you directly, I'll
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.760]   carpool some people. I sort of
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.760]   get that. I sort of get that now.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:53.760]   It's interesting how that shifts.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:55.760]   So, how
[00:49:55.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   have you seen... I just want to do
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:49:59.760]   a 30,000-foot question here.
[00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:01.760]   You've been doing... talking about these issues
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.760]   for a long time. How have you seen
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:05.760]   the culture or your
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.760]   audience response to the types
[00:50:07.760 --> 00:50:09.760]   of things you write about? What are the
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   inflection points? How has that changed
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.760]   since 2009 to 2023?
[00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:15.760]   When you're talking about
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.760]   things like organization, planning, productivity,
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.760]   has your audience been pretty constant, or have you
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:21.760]   found how they approach
[00:50:21.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   these issues as something that's evolved over time?
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   Yeah. I feel
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.760]   like people are always looking for
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   one prescriptive system,
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.760]   and sometimes it takes me kind of being
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   like, "No, you kind of have to build your own, but
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   here are the elements that you need."
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.760]   I definitely find that people
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.760]   struggle with giving
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   themselves enough time to plan, and
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:43.760]   then sometimes I'll suggest
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   something like, "Well, you could get to work 10 minutes
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.760]   earlier and do a little planning," and they're like, "Oh my
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   God, I could." They didn't
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   realize that that was something they were allowed to
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   do. I think people
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   tell themselves
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   stories or mythology also
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   about what they're supposed to
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:01.760]   use their time for, or what's a good use of time
[00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   or not, and really that has to be
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   all our own decisions.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   Have I seen it change? I don't
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.760]   know how much I've seen it change. I'll say that the biggest
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   theme that seems to come up
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   tends to be
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   either time
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:17.760]   or task overload, and then
[00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:19.760]   also so many people wanting
[00:51:19.760 --> 00:51:21.760]   to curb destructive
[00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   screen time/distraction
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   habits. How do I create
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:27.760]   a plan for my day where I'm not going to get
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:29.760]   distracted and derailed by less important
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   things? That's come up a lot.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   - That's interesting. I also think it's interesting
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:35.760]   your decision, similar to mine, to
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   not engage on social
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:39.760]   media, because there is
[00:51:39.760 --> 00:51:41.760]   – and I don't know if you know this world better. I don't
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   know it that well, but there's a big
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:45.760]   social media-housed
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   productivity culture
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.760]   that's based on Instagram,
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   and I suppose TikTok,
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:53.760]   and I don't think it's on Twitter
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:55.760]   so much. There's a whole world out there.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:57.760]   They have YouTube videos, too. I don't
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   know that world very well, but especially
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   when I talk to young people, they'll talk about it. So there's a whole
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:03.760]   new productivity
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:05.760]   online world that I'm not that
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   familiar with. I have my newsletter blog
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   readers who I love and have been around forever.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   I, by the way, think
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:13.760]   that type of early Web 2.0
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:15.760]   style interaction is
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   pure distilled web. It's, "Here's
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:19.760]   these readers who have been commenting
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   on my things for years, and
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   I know some of them, and they send me emails." It's so
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.760]   much better than, "This is going out
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.760]   into Instagram, where
[00:52:27.760 --> 00:52:29.760]   God knows who's going to start commenting
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.760]   on this," or, "It's going on Twitter, where it can get
[00:52:31.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   retweeted and cause a pile-on,"
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   or whatever. I think it's
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:37.760]   the right level of interaction.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   But there's that whole world out there. I don't know if you know anything
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:41.760]   about it, or are you happy, like me,
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:43.760]   that you can deal
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:45.760]   with individuals, a more
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:47.760]   reasonable-sized crowd. It can be more
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   personal. It can be more reflective. It can be more
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.760]   responsive, and it's not this
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   almost tribal warfare
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:55.760]   feel that's out there, where everyone is
[00:52:55.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   looking around and, I don't know,
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   painting Braveheart paint on their face before
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.760]   rushing into battle or something like that. I think
[00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   it's telling that you and I are not
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:05.760]   in that world of productivity.
[00:53:05.760 --> 00:53:07.760]   But there is a whole world out there that, I don't know,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.760]   maybe it's giving our world a bad name.
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:11.760]   But I don't know much about it, and I don't know how much you've seen.
[00:53:11.760 --> 00:53:13.760]   I know Laura's not that interested in that world, either.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:15.760]   - No, Laura, I think, has fun
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:17.760]   with Instagram, but doesn't do a lot with it
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.760]   professionally. I mean, she writes books, books that
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.760]   do really well, so she probably doesn't
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   need that other platform. I probably
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:25.760]   could use that platform, but I just
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.760]   really don't want to. I
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:29.760]   don't have the self-control, and neither
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:31.760]   do I think most people, to, you know, use
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   it a little bit, or use it professionally.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.760]   And then I feel like the people who kind of use it professionally
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.760]   but aren't really using it, like, how much
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:39.760]   benefit are they getting out of that?
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   And I just, I feel like I have enough.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.760]   Like, I have enough connection with my listeners.
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.760]   I have people signing up for my courses.
[00:53:45.760 --> 00:53:47.760]   I'm doing a live course, and I'm super excited.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:49.760]   Like, it's almost full. Like, I
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:51.760]   don't, I'm not big,
[00:53:51.760 --> 00:53:53.760]   and I don't necessarily need to be.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:55.760]   I would love to, like, get into the actual
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.760]   book writing, you know, club
[00:53:57.760 --> 00:53:59.760]   someday, but honestly,
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:01.760]   even without that, I'm happy. I'm reaching a lot
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:03.760]   of people. I get lots of great emails, and I just
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:05.760]   I feel like I'm getting more
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:07.760]   than I would, like, I would lose so much
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.760]   from doing that, and I'm getting so much without it
[00:54:09.760 --> 00:54:11.760]   that, like, why would I add that in? - How's the course
[00:54:11.760 --> 00:54:13.760]   going? Tell us again what it's called, and a little
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:15.760]   bit about it, because I think there should be more
[00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:17.760]   of this, but anyways, tell us a little bit about it.
[00:54:17.760 --> 00:54:19.760]   - It's called Best Laid
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.760]   Plans Academy, and I've done
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:23.760]   well, I've done one full round of it, so
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:25.760]   it's seven online sessions. It's done via
[00:54:25.760 --> 00:54:27.760]   Zoom. It's, like, live, like, me in a classroom,
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:29.760]   and the sessions are all about
[00:54:29.760 --> 00:54:31.760]   the different levels of planning. So, like, the first one
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   the first one's more of, like, a kickoff getting started,
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   but then the second one's on annual, the third
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   one's on daily. We kind of zoom down, and
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.760]   then we go weekly, seasonal, and then, like,
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:41.760]   some extras, and there's, like,
[00:54:41.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   a little bulletin board component where people can share
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   little things, but it's not, there's no social
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.760]   media base at all.
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:49.760]   People can do, like, a little one-on-one
[00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   with me, but
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   it's been really, really fun. The first
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:55.760]   session, it was 30 people. It was all women.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.760]   I would love to welcome some men
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:54:59.760]   into my courses as well,
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.760]   so who knows, maybe they'll find it
[00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.760]   via you and be interested,
[00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.760]   but we talk about all the challenges, and I
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.760]   kind of share my methods and help them with theirs,
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:09.760]   and, you know, it's like a, you know,
[00:55:09.760 --> 00:55:11.760]   classroom-size group,
[00:55:11.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   so there's, like, enough kind of interactivity.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:15.760]   And then I'm doing the second session,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:17.760]   which is, like, the spring session, and I'm applying everything
[00:55:17.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   I learned from that first section, and then
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.760]   I decided I wanted to do something, like, IRL,
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   like, I just wanted to, like, see people, so
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:25.760]   I decided, probably against my better judgment,
[00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:27.760]   to host a live planning retreat,
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   kind of like what I do with my husband, but, like, for other
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:31.760]   people in South Florida,
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:33.760]   so... - That's awesome. - Make it happen.
[00:55:33.760 --> 00:55:35.760]   - That's my nightmare, that organizing
[00:55:35.760 --> 00:55:37.760]   a real-person event because I'm a weird
[00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:39.760]   introspective troll, but I love
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.760]   that you're doing it. I would love to,
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:43.760]   I would love to attend something like that. And, yeah, we've got to get some
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   men into your class. We have to change the culture
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:47.760]   so that men
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:49.760]   feel like being sort of
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.760]   ninja-level household planners
[00:55:51.760 --> 00:55:53.760]   is what, you know, being able to use the
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:55.760]   barbecue was 30 years ago. I want to
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:57.760]   make that culture shift where it's something
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:55:59.760]   like dads are really proud of.
[00:55:59.760 --> 00:56:01.760]   - It's like men are productivity
[00:56:01.760 --> 00:56:03.760]   and women are planning, but, like,
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:05.760]   I feel like I'm very productive, and it's my
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:07.760]   planning that helps me be productive, so I don't think
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:09.760]   those are separate worlds. - That's an interesting split, that people will
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:11.760]   think about planning. Where I'm with you,
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:13.760]   planning is at the core of productivity,
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.760]   right? It's like how you actually organize
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:17.760]   the resource that is your time and match
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:19.760]   it with what needs to be done so that you have
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   an intentional mix of activity
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:23.760]   given the resources you have available. Planning's
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:25.760]   the engine there, and you're right. Productivity
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.760]   gets changed into other things where it's
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.760]   more about this sort of high-energy grinding
[00:56:29.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   or, I don't know, there's all, people define it in lots
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.760]   of different ways. They define it the way they need it
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.760]   for whatever point they're about to make, I guess,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:37.760]   is the way that works.
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:39.760]   All right, one last question before
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.760]   I move on to my listener questions
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:43.760]   today. The other
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:45.760]   parallel I wanted to ask you about between us is
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:47.760]   that we both have these sort of elite-trained
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:49.760]   jobs. You're
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:51.760]   a medical doctor,
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   I'm a fake doctor, professor,
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:55.760]   and we do
[00:56:55.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   talk about these other types of issues that are
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.760]   pragmatic on the side.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:01.760]   What's that like as a medical doctor?
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:03.760]   Do people care? Is it
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:05.760]   awkward? Are people excited?
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:07.760]   I love it. I've helped
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.760]   a number of my colleagues tame their
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   epic inboxes, and it makes
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:13.760]   me so happy when I can apply these
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   lessons with the people I work with, and I would actually
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:17.760]   love to do more work with physicians.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.760]   No, I talk about it. I mean, I don't do it in
[00:57:19.760 --> 00:57:21.760]   any official context in my
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.760]   workplace. That was something I thought
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.760]   about at one point, but then kind of just decided
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:27.760]   I'd rather keep it more neutral and
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.760]   not specifically medically-based.
[00:57:29.760 --> 00:57:31.760]   Every so often, a patient will be like,
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   "I found your blog!" And that's why I
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   actually think it says, "If you're a patient, it's fine.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   This is public. You can say hi. I don't mind."
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   I read it. You said, "I'll own it," is what
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.760]   you said. It's fine. If you found this because you were
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.760]   Googling me because you just signed up for an appointment,
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:45.760]   it's okay.
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:47.760]   Exactly. So, it's
[00:57:47.760 --> 00:57:49.760]   fun. I'm very
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:51.760]   much in the doctor mindset.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.760]   I don't think about this stuff when I'm at work,
[00:57:53.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   and I'm sure you're the same. It's like a split.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:57.760]   "Okay, now I'm thinking about this. Now I'm thinking
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.760]   about that." But I'm
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:01.760]   amazed that you can do
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   both, at least to some extent.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:05.760]   It's been really fun so far.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   The split is with this particular topic.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   You can do both because this particular topic
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:11.760]   makes it much
[00:58:11.760 --> 00:58:13.760]   easier for you to do both because the whole particular topic
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   is about planning and being okay with your time or
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   whatever. If we were really into
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:19.760]   bird watching or something completely
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:21.760]   unrelated to planning on the side,
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:23.760]   then maybe it would be a problem.
[00:58:23.760 --> 00:58:25.760]   I'll say it's been weird
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:27.760]   for me because early on, for a
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   while, when I was writing
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   online or writing books, it really was very
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:33.760]   solidly in the productivity space. We just had this clear
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.760]   Chinese wall. Then over here, I'm doing algorithms.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.760]   A lot of that's changed for me in the last
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   six or seven years as more of my writing has
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.760]   turned towards technology
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   and society.
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.760]   As my writing moved towards that, my academic role
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   moved more towards that. Now those worlds are blended
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.760]   for me.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:51.760]   It's almost harder.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:53.760]   It's better because it's not as much overlap,
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:55.760]   but it's harder. I do miss the simplicity
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:57.760]   of my doctoral advisor
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   coming back from the bookstore and saying, "Did you write a book?"
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.760]   "What's this thing I just saw
[00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:03.760]   in the bookstore?" It was like, "Yeah, I'm
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:05.760]   helping."
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   At the time, I was doing a lot of student productivity. It was great.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.760]   It was this nice, clear thing.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   It's like, "I'm a good triathlete
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.760]   and I'm a doctor."
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   "Yeah, great. That's a great hobby
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:17.760]   or whatever other thing you do
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.760]   in your great shape or something." It's actually almost
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:21.760]   weirder for me now that my writing
[00:59:21.760 --> 00:59:23.760]   is
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.760]   a lot of my writing is now
[00:59:25.760 --> 00:59:27.760]   part of my job.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:29.760]   That separation is not there.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:31.760]   - That's a great progression, though.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:33.760]   I think it's cool. I think your story makes total sense.
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:35.760]   - Yeah. Well, I'm having fun.
[00:59:35.760 --> 00:59:37.760]   I like thinking about things. Sarah, this
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.760]   was great. I really appreciate you coming on.
[00:59:39.760 --> 00:59:41.760]   Hopefully, my listeners got a lot
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:43.760]   of good advice out of this, thinking
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:45.760]   about your systems and how you approach
[00:59:45.760 --> 00:59:47.760]   life admin. I certainly did. I have some notes
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:49.760]   here I was taking. We're going to
[00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:51.760]   put some of this into action.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:53.760]   Sarah, if you're looking for Sarah, the blog
[00:59:53.760 --> 00:59:55.760]   is theshoebox.shu.
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:57.760]   I am
[00:59:57.760 --> 00:59:59.760]   embarrassed, Sarah, to admit
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:01.760]   that it wasn't until I was preparing for this interview that I
[01:00:01.760 --> 01:00:03.760]   thought, "Oh, Sarah
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:05.760]   Hart Unger." - Oh, it's a terrible name. The name's
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.760]   from 2010 and it should probably
[01:00:07.760 --> 01:00:09.760]   just be SarahHartUnger.com.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:11.760]   I tried to get bestladeplans.com, but it was like
[01:00:11.760 --> 01:00:13.760]   $25,000, so I couldn't
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:15.760]   do it. - Oh, come on. - But it's right now.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:17.760]   - You and Laura can swing it. Get some of your advertising
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:19.760]   money. You know what, though? They say that
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:21.760]   I had to buy the deeplife.com
[01:00:21.760 --> 01:00:23.760]   and you
[01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.760]   hire someone
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:27.760]   to negotiate
[01:00:27.760 --> 01:00:29.760]   speaking of outsourcing, on your behalf.
[01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.760]   There's a whole industry out there, everyone. Domain,
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.760]   name, whatever it is,
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:35.760]   negotiation. So theshoebox.com
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:37.760]   and then that links to the blog,
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760]   which is fantastic, but then also both of the
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.760]   podcasts. You can find out about both of the
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.760]   podcasts there and
[01:00:43.760 --> 01:00:45.760]   the course, I'm assuming, all that information
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:47.760]   is on theshoebox.shu.
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   Sarah Hart Unger, shoebox.com. - Yeah,
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:51.760]   theshoebox.com. - Excellent.
[01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:53.760]   All right, well, thanks, Sarah. I really
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   appreciate it. - Thank you so much
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:57.760]   for having me on. This was so fun. - All right,
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:59.760]   well, thank you, Sarah, for joining the show.
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:01.760]   That was great. You know, Jesse,
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:03.760]   I already have some ideas off of that.
[01:01:03.760 --> 01:01:05.760]   It's funny how different
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.760]   productivity can seem. I mean, it's a completely
[01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:09.760]   different game and in some ways it's a very similar game
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.760]   when you're talking about life outside of work.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:13.760]   It's a part of my game that I need to clean up, so
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.760]   Sarah's sort of my guru there.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:17.760]   Her podcast with Laura,
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:19.760]   which is,
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   what is that podcast called?
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.760]   I think it's Best of Both Worlds. I'm just going to
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:25.760]   load it up here so I'm not...
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.760]   I know we mentioned it, but let me just make sure I'm saying it right.
[01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   Yeah, Best of Both Worlds.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:31.760]   That does a lot of productivity
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.760]   outside of work, a lot of productivity
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   with the family. So if you're interested in this stuff, check out
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:37.760]   that podcast.
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   They get into it all the time. All right, so I want to do
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   some questions generically on this
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:43.760]   topic. First, however, let me mention
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.760]   one of the sponsors that makes this show possible,
[01:01:45.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   and that is our friends at
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.760]   Hinson Shaving.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.760]   So here's the thing with Hinson Shaving.
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.760]   What you get from them
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.760]   is a very
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:57.760]   well engineered aluminum
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:01:59.760]   razor. The company
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:01.760]   that builds this specializes
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.760]   in manufacturing of precision
[01:02:03.760 --> 01:02:05.760]   parts for the aerospace industry,
[01:02:05.760 --> 01:02:07.760]   so they have the proper machinery to
[01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:09.760]   mill incredibly
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   precise specifications. So this
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.760]   razor is milled
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.760]   in such a way that the blade only
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:17.760]   extends beyond the actual
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:19.760]   boundary of the razor by .0013
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.760]   inches. That's less than the thickness
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:23.760]   of a human hair. This gives you a secure
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:25.760]   and stable blade. No
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:27.760]   vibration, no diving
[01:02:27.760 --> 01:02:29.760]   board effect. You get a close shave,
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:31.760]   and you get it without
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:33.760]   the irritation or without the
[01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:35.760]   nicks. What's cool about this is that this
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:37.760]   razor, because it's so well designed,
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:39.760]   you can just use a standard 10 cent
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:41.760]   safety blade in it.
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:43.760]   You do not need one of
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.760]   these next generation
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:47.760]   disposable razors that you
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.760]   buy at the
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.760]   drugstore where you have to
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.760]   plug it into a computer,
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:55.760]   and there's laser trackers that shine
[01:02:55.760 --> 01:02:57.760]   on your face, and the whole thing vibrates,
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:02:59.760]   and there's 75 blades, and somehow
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:01.760]   chat GPT is involved. You don't need all
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:03.760]   this weird, fancy,
[01:03:03.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   shaking, 90 blade contraptions.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.760]   If you have a really precisely
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:09.760]   milled razor, 10 cent
[01:03:09.760 --> 01:03:11.760]   blade gives you a perfectly nice shave. It's what I
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.760]   use as well. I think it's really cool. You buy
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   this thing up front, and then your cost
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:17.760]   of replacing blades is very, very low,
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.760]   so you quickly make up the cost of having this
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.760]   beautiful piece of
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   machined equipment. I like tools, and this is
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   a really cool tool.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:27.760]   It's time to say no to subscriptions and yes to a razor
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:29.760]   that will last you a lifetime.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   Visit hensonshaving.com/cal
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.760]   to pick the razor for you, and use that code
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:35.760]   CAL, and you will get two
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   years worth of blades for free with
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:39.760]   your razor. Just make sure that you add them to your
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:41.760]   cart before you type in that
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.760]   promo code. That's 100 free blades
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.760]   when you head to h-e-n-s-o-n
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:47.760]   h-e-n-s-o-n
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.760]   h-e-n-s-o-n-shaving.com/cal
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:51.760]   h-e-n-s-o-n-shaving.com/cal and use that code
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:53.760]   h-e-n-s-o-n-shaving.com/cal and use that code CAL.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:55.760]   I also want to talk about our friends at Huel.
[01:03:55.760 --> 01:03:57.760]   h-u-e-l
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.760]   h-u-e-l
[01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.760]   Longtime listeners know my approach to
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:03.760]   healthy eating is to automate
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   breakfast and lunch.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:07.760]   I don't want to think about it.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:09.760]   I want as much as possible to have the food
[01:04:09.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   I eat for these meals to be
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   convenient and preplanned and healthy.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.760]   And then I can care about food for dinner
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.760]   and cook and appreciate things
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.760]   and that's when I can actually expend energy on food.
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:21.760]   But I don't want to waste time and energy
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:23.760]   thinking about breakfast and lunch. I want to automate it to be
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.760]   things that I know are good,
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.760]   will give me energy, and I don't have to worry about it.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:29.760]   This is where Huel Black
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.760]   Edition enters the scene.
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:33.760]   It is a high-protein, nutritionally
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:35.760]   complete meal in a convenient shake.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.760]   I like to use it as a
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.760]   breakfast replacement.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   I know it will give me everything
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   my body needs in just two scoops.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.760]   This includes 27 essential vitamins and
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   minerals and 40 grams of protein.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   Each scoop contains
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:51.760]   200 calories, so if you do two scoops,
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.760]   you get roughly a normal-sized 400
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   calorie meal, though you can adjust
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.760]   that depending on how much
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.760]   you want to consume.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:01.760]   400 calories, so it works out to be about $2.50
[01:05:01.760 --> 01:05:03.760]   a meal, so it's
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:05.760]   cheap, but it gives you what you need.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:07.760]   Huel Black Edition is vegan, naturally
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.760]   gluten-free, lactose-free, zero artificial
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   sweeteners, naturally flavored,
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:13.760]   low GI, omega-3
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:15.760]   and 6, GMO-free, palm oil-free,
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.760]   vegan, vitamin D2
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   and D3 are in there. It's available in nine
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.760]   flavors. I like the flavors. It's a good
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.760]   flavored shake.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:25.760]   If you go to Huel.com/questions,
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:27.760]   you will get a free
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   t-shirt and shaker with your first order.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:31.760]   I use the shaker because
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:33.760]   you put in the scoops in the water,
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:35.760]   it has the little ball in there to shake it up.
[01:05:35.760 --> 01:05:37.760]   You know how much to put in.
[01:05:37.760 --> 01:05:39.760]   It's convenient. So go to Huel.com/questions
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.760]   to try out Huel
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.760]   Black Edition and get your free t-shirt
[01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:45.760]   and shaker.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.760]   Let us do some questions,
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.760]   all vaguely about
[01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.760]   organization productivity outside the context
[01:05:51.760 --> 01:05:53.760]   of work. Jesse, what do we
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:55.760]   have on the docket first?
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   - First question is from Yui.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:05:59.760]   How do you manage your personal and family
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:01.760]   related tasks like life
[01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:03.760]   admin? I figure we should start
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:05.760]   with the core tech question.
[01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.760]   What tools am I using right now
[01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.760]   in my household?
[01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:11.760]   My wife and I are using
[01:06:11.760 --> 01:06:13.760]   Trello
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.760]   to organize and keep
[01:06:15.760 --> 01:06:17.760]   track of all of the various
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.760]   different tasks in our
[01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.760]   shared household life.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:23.760]   So there's three boards here that are relevant to me.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.760]   Two of them are shared with her and one
[01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:27.760]   of them is just for me. So the one for me I
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:29.760]   call personal and these are things
[01:06:29.760 --> 01:06:31.760]   that it's for me to do.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.760]   She doesn't need to know about.
[01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:35.760]   Some of it's actual personal like it doesn't
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:37.760]   affect the family or family stuff that
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.760]   I thought of I need to do. I'm going
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.760]   to do it. I'll just put it right on my list.
[01:06:41.760 --> 01:06:43.760]   And then we have two shared one.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:45.760]   One that just has generic family
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:47.760]   stuff and one that's specific
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   for financial and financial
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   related tasks. For the shared
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:53.760]   boards, they both have
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:06:55.760]   a Julia's,
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.760]   Julie and Cal is going to do
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.760]   column
[01:06:59.760 --> 01:07:01.760]   as well as sort of just general capture columns
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:03.760]   for different categories of tasks.
[01:07:03.760 --> 01:07:05.760]   Things get moved on to my
[01:07:05.760 --> 01:07:07.760]   list or her list once a decision has
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:09.760]   been made about who is going to do them.
[01:07:09.760 --> 01:07:11.760]   Then there's a list for what's actually
[01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:13.760]   being worked on this week.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:15.760]   So things can be captured on here
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.760]   and at some point they might get moved
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:19.760]   to one of our responsibilities and
[01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:21.760]   then we look at the list of our responsibilities
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.760]   to try to figure out things to work on
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   each week. We do do a rough
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:27.760]   weekly plan similar to what Sarah talked about
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.760]   earlier though I like the detail that Sarah gave
[01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:31.760]   so maybe we need to up our game there.
[01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.760]   We also rely heavily on a Google
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   calendar. So our
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.760]   calendar show up, her calendar
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:39.760]   and my calendar just share on each other's.
[01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:41.760]   So I can see anything
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.760]   she adds, she can see anything I add.
[01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:45.760]   So either of us can add things,
[01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.760]   family things, household things and the other person
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:49.760]   will see it. Critical to our operations,
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:51.760]   I in particular have a pretty complicated
[01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:53.760]   calendar and so for her
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.760]   to be able to see my time and
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:57.760]   when might work or might not work and vice
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:07:59.760]   versa, that's really useful.
[01:07:59.760 --> 01:08:01.760]   We bought one of these digital
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.760]   picture frames
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:05.760]   that displays that shared
[01:08:05.760 --> 01:08:07.760]   calendar in our kitchen. It's a touch
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:09.760]   screen and you can see
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:11.760]   our shared calendars there and get a sense of what's going on
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.760]   in the day. We're not using it much though.
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:15.760]   Because we both check our
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:17.760]   normal calendars enough on our
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:19.760]   normal devices and everything is shared on
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:21.760]   there that having another
[01:08:21.760 --> 01:08:23.760]   interface for it didn't turn out to be as useful
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.760]   as we suspected it might be.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.760]   And then the final thing we do, this is a
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:29.760]   conceptual system, not a technical system
[01:08:29.760 --> 01:08:31.760]   is we are big on something that
[01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.760]   Sarah talked about in the deep dive earlier
[01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:35.760]   which is there are clear spheres of
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:37.760]   responsibility. So there's certain
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:39.760]   types of tasks that show up all the time
[01:08:39.760 --> 01:08:41.760]   that we've just figured out.
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.760]   I always do this, you always do that.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.760]   That's useful for the system as well.
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:47.760]   So it's not everything has to be considered
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.760]   and planned and assigned
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:51.760]   when it comes to doing the
[01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.760]   budget or paying
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.760]   our estimated quarterly taxes
[01:08:55.760 --> 01:08:57.760]   for example or mowing the
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   yard. These are just on my list.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:01.760]   And so it doesn't have to go
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:03.760]   through a full system of being surfaced
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:05.760]   and captured and assigned.
[01:09:05.760 --> 01:09:07.760]   I just do them. Typically these
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:09.760]   things will, a lot of them are recurring on my
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:11.760]   calendar. I just know I do it on the weekend.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:13.760]   We do throw in spheres of responsibility
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:15.760]   to try to reduce
[01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:17.760]   pressure for bespoke
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:19.760]   on-demand scheduling as much as possible.
[01:09:19.760 --> 01:09:21.760]   That more or less works. But Sarah
[01:09:21.760 --> 01:09:23.760]   had some great ideas in this deep dive.
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:25.760]   We'll probably check in.
[01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.760]   Check in on our system soon
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.760]   and see where we might
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:31.760]   need some upgrades.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:33.760]   How often do you check the Trello?
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.760]   Weekly plan.
[01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:37.760]   So you just look at it once and then...
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.760]   Yeah, that's what I do with my work Trello's as well.
[01:09:39.760 --> 01:09:41.760]   When I build my weekly plan
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.760]   if there's key things
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.760]   I want to get done, those get moved
[01:09:45.760 --> 01:09:47.760]   onto my weekly plan. I'll highlight
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:49.760]   them in there. And I can do the same with personal
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:51.760]   things. Hey, remember these three things have to get done
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.760]   this week. If I have a lot of little things
[01:09:53.760 --> 01:09:55.760]   you know, so if I'm doing a
[01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:57.760]   weekly review on either
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.760]   a professional or personal Trello,
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.760]   I'm like, man, there's 10 or 15 little things.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.760]   Right? To make that
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:05.760]   concrete in my work life,
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:07.760]   this week I had a huge number of
[01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.760]   little things that all involved just my
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:11.760]   class. Just little things that
[01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:13.760]   had to happen as we wrapped
[01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.760]   up the semester. In that case
[01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.760]   I won't copy all
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.760]   that to my weekly plan, but I'll say in my
[01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:21.760]   weekly plan, we got a
[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:23.760]   big bunch of tasks. They're small
[01:10:23.760 --> 01:10:25.760]   that need to get done on
[01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.760]   a few different things. So
[01:10:27.760 --> 01:10:29.760]   have a... and I'll put a plan for it.
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:31.760]   Have a 30 minute task block
[01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.760]   at least three times this week and go to the Trello
[01:10:33.760 --> 01:10:35.760]   and just start
[01:10:35.760 --> 01:10:37.760]   task whacking. This, this, this, and this.
[01:10:37.760 --> 01:10:39.760]   So I'll go back
[01:10:39.760 --> 01:10:41.760]   to the Trello, I guess is what I'm saying, is if
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.760]   my weekly plan says, I have moved
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.760]   a whole bunch of stuff for us to do this
[01:10:45.760 --> 01:10:47.760]   week and a lot of it's small. You just need to have
[01:10:47.760 --> 01:10:49.760]   sessions that just start, start whacking
[01:10:49.760 --> 01:10:51.760]   through it. And so in that case I will return
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:53.760]   to the Trello. But the big things
[01:10:53.760 --> 01:10:55.760]   when I'm doing my weekly plan, that's when I figure out what
[01:10:55.760 --> 01:10:57.760]   I want to do that week. And the big things I'll actually
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.760]   put it onto my plan. Make sure to do this.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.760]   If it's really big, I'll put it onto my calendar.
[01:11:01.760 --> 01:11:03.760]   And for the little things, I'll just
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:05.760]   remind myself in the weekly plan, hey, there's a bunch of
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:07.760]   little things. So here's how much
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.760]   you need to go back to this and just
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:11.760]   start going through things. Got it. And the
[01:11:11.760 --> 01:11:13.760]   other times you go to Trello is when you add new
[01:11:13.760 --> 01:11:15.760]   work to it. Yeah. Yeah. So if I'm
[01:11:15.760 --> 01:11:17.760]   shutting down at the end of the day and I've captured
[01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   stuff, I'll put it
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.760]   into, put in the Trello. So I see Trello
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   a lot, but it's not a
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:25.760]   systematic part of
[01:11:25.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   my plan. Oh, check Trello every morning,
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:29.760]   check Trello every hour. It's once I
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.760]   do the weekly plan, it's more ad hoc
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.760]   when I go back in there
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   and deal with it. Got it.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.760]   I like Trello. I met the CEO once, you know.
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.760]   Yeah, I think you mentioned that.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.760]   Yeah. Nice guy. Rich
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:43.760]   guy. All right.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:45.760]   Let's move on. What do we got next?
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.760]   All right. Next question is from
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.760]   Gerald. Do you think that if you don't have
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   at least an informal plan for every
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:53.760]   hour of the day, you are losing part of your day
[01:11:53.760 --> 01:11:55.760]   to ineffectiveness, even if it's recreation
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.760]   or family time? Or do you think having
[01:11:57.760 --> 01:11:59.760]   intentions for every part of your day leads
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.760]   to burnout?
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:03.760]   Well, Gerald, I mean, I do stand by
[01:12:03.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   time blocking at the level of intensity
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.760]   that I recommend for the professional day
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:09.760]   will burn you out if you don't have a break
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.760]   from it. So if you're
[01:12:11.760 --> 01:12:13.760]   locked in,
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.760]   what's next? Oh my god,
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.760]   I have a limited amount of time to get
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   this done. I'm going to let the pressure
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:21.760]   of that time boundaries actually motivate
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.760]   me to focus even more. I mean, that's
[01:12:23.760 --> 01:12:25.760]   a very effective way
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   of producing a lot of cognitive
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.760]   output in a fixed amount of time. But if you're doing
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:31.760]   that all hours of the day, you will burn out.
[01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:33.760]   It's just too much.
[01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.760]   On the other hand, I think you are right.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.760]   If you come to your evenings
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:39.760]   and say, "All right, I'm
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.760]   done with work. Time to relax
[01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.760]   and maybe get some stuff done."
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:45.760]   You're not going to end up as relaxed as you
[01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   think. Stuff is not going to get done. But
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   more importantly, you're not going to actually commit
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.760]   to the type of activities that maybe would give you
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.760]   satisfaction or meaning.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:55.760]   You're going to drift from thing to thing.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:57.760]   Your phone is for sure going
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:12:59.760]   to insert itself into your time there and
[01:12:59.760 --> 01:13:01.760]   really dominate your attention. Your head's going to hit
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:03.760]   the pillow. You're not going to be particularly happy. So we need
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   a middle ground between
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.760]   I'm looking at my planner and I got
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.760]   seven minutes to get these three things done.
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:11.760]   And I've just been on my phone
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:13.760]   for the last four hours. And
[01:13:13.760 --> 01:13:15.760]   I guess I need to go get
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.760]   a napkin because my eyes are bleeding
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.760]   from staring at
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.760]   memes on my screen.
[01:13:21.760 --> 01:13:23.760]   We need something in between.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.760]   So I recommend sketching a plan.
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:27.760]   I use that terminology a lot. Sketch a
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:29.760]   plan for your evening. Sketch a
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:31.760]   plan for your weekend.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:33.760]   And what that means can vary
[01:13:33.760 --> 01:13:35.760]   depending on the specificity. So it might
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:37.760]   mean, "Look, okay, at this exact
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:39.760]   time tonight, someone's coming over.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:41.760]   I want to watch this show." And so some stuff might have
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.760]   time. Other stuff might be more
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:45.760]   lower grain. Like, try to
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:47.760]   take care of the packed stuff
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   right after work. And
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.760]   let's try to exercise.
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.760]   Here's what we're going to do for dinner.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:55.760]   Tonight, you know, let's
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   get in some reading time on my book.
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   So most of it's not attached to
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:01.760]   times. It's relatively
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.760]   loose. But it gives you some
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.760]   sense of, "I want to do this and that
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.760]   and here's what's happening tonight." And you're
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.760]   sketching a plan for a reasonable night. And then you do
[01:14:09.760 --> 01:14:11.760]   your best to more or less follow that. And if you missed
[01:14:11.760 --> 01:14:13.760]   time, something you added a little bit too much to it
[01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   and something took more time, that doesn't really
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:17.760]   matter at all.
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   What matters is, "I had some intentionality
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:21.760]   with my time. I thought through, like, what do I
[01:14:21.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   want to do tonight?" And I more or less followed
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:25.760]   that the best I could. That's the win
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:27.760]   here. Not, "I got
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.760]   through this many things," or "I'm on top of things."
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.760]   It's like, "I wasn't adrift."
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:33.760]   And these sketch plans can have plenty
[01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:35.760]   of downtime, but it's downtime on
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:37.760]   your terms. You say, "Well,
[01:14:37.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   in downtime, I could just sort of look at my phone
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.760]   while I'm eating dinner. Or, you know, if I
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   ate early, I
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   could go for a walk on this nature trail
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.760]   and listen to this novel
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   I'm really enjoying and really get downtime
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.760]   that I really enjoy and is really relaxing
[01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:53.760]   and it feels really intentional."
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:55.760]   Or, "If I think about it,
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:57.760]   why don't we start bedtime
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:59.760]   45 minutes earlier? Like, I can actually
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:01.760]   read a book with each of the kids, and, you know, that's actually
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:03.760]   going to be really enjoyable, but I had to think about that
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:05.760]   if we were just going through the motions and just looked up
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:07.760]   and said, 'It's bedtime,' we wouldn't be able to do it." So, I'm
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:09.760]   a big believer in sketching a plan
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:11.760]   for non-professional time.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:13.760]   Intention is what matters,
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.760]   but don't care so much
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.760]   about how much you're fitting to that plan or whether you get
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:19.760]   everything done. I just want you to avoid
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.760]   wandering haphazardly
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.760]   during your time. And there's a difference.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.760]   There is a difference on the spectrum from wandering
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:27.760]   haphazardly to being incredibly locked in.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:29.760]   There is a gap
[01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.760]   in between there, which is where I think evenings
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:33.760]   and weekends can comfortably exist.
[01:15:33.760 --> 01:15:35.760]   Alright,
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.760]   what do we got next?
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:39.760]   I like this question. It's from Ricky.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.760]   "There is one area of my personal
[01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.760]   productivity system that I haven't found a
[01:15:43.760 --> 01:15:45.760]   good way to handle ongoing activities.
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:47.760]   Usually, these are things that can sometimes be
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:49.760]   broken up into projects, but the overall
[01:15:49.760 --> 01:15:51.760]   area is something that you're never
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:53.760]   done with, like getting better at hockey, a
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:55.760]   hobby of mine. Any suggestions on
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.760]   how to handle staying on top of these?"
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:59.760]   So, Ricky, there's
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:01.760]   a different category
[01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:03.760]   of organizational commitment that
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:05.760]   becomes relevant here. This is
[01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.760]   what we can call systems, habits,
[01:16:07.760 --> 01:16:09.760]   or routines.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:11.760]   So, it's things that have been worked into your schedule
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.760]   that you do on a
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:15.760]   regular basis, ad infinitum.
[01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:17.760]   This is just what I
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:19.760]   do. I exercise on Monday, Wednesday,
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.760]   and Fridays, and I do it after work,
[01:16:21.760 --> 01:16:23.760]   and I do it in the basement gym,
[01:16:23.760 --> 01:16:25.760]   and that's just what I do on those days.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   Or I
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:29.760]   play hockey with
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:31.760]   this adult league on
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.760]   Saturday mornings, and I do rink time
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.760]   on Monday
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:37.760]   evenings, and
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:39.760]   then I run two days a week
[01:16:39.760 --> 01:16:41.760]   for exercise. I just do
[01:16:41.760 --> 01:16:43.760]   that. It's not a task that I'm done, and I take it
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:45.760]   off my list. It's just part of my routine. So, we all
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   have some systems,
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   routines, and habits
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:51.760]   in our lives where we just get used to doing
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:53.760]   it. So, how do we
[01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:55.760]   install these things? Well, typically
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.760]   you put them on your calendar,
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:16:59.760]   and/or you do some
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.760]   sort of metric tracking on it. So, you have something
[01:17:01.760 --> 01:17:03.760]   to check off each day, "Did I really do this?"
[01:17:03.760 --> 01:17:05.760]   So, you instill the habit. There's a lot that's
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.760]   been written on how to instill a habit.
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:09.760]   And then once it's there, it
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:11.760]   will become more of a background
[01:17:11.760 --> 01:17:13.760]   part of your life. It generates a sense of
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:15.760]   identity, positive feedback,
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760]   and then it's more likely to stick in.
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:19.760]   The issue is you can only fit so many of these.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:21.760]   So, if you don't have
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.760]   any, that's a problem, because it's a very powerful
[01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.760]   weapon. When you work something
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:27.760]   into a background
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:29.760]   routine in your life, it just happens
[01:17:29.760 --> 01:17:31.760]   every week. You can
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:33.760]   just look up a year later, and typically
[01:17:33.760 --> 01:17:35.760]   really cool stuff has happened.
[01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:37.760]   It's the proverbial exercise
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   routine. You make it a routine.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.760]   You stop thinking about it. You just do it. But then
[01:17:41.760 --> 01:17:43.760]   a couple years later, you say, "Actually, I'm in pretty good shape.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:45.760]   This paid off over time. I'm glad this is
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:47.760]   a part of my life."
[01:17:47.760 --> 01:17:49.760]   Another example would be my five books
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:51.760]   per month routine.
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:53.760]   I just do that. And now
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:55.760]   I don't think much about it. It's just that this is what I
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.760]   do. I read five books a month. We talk about them on the
[01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.760]   podcast. And that's really
[01:17:59.760 --> 01:18:01.760]   positive over time in my life, but I don't have to think
[01:18:01.760 --> 01:18:03.760]   about it. It's something I've instilled.
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:05.760]   But there's a limited number of things you could do.
[01:18:05.760 --> 01:18:07.760]   Maybe a
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:09.760]   fitness thing, a high-quality
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:11.760]   leisure thing. There's a few
[01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:13.760]   of these you can do where you're
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.760]   able to regularly put aside and protect
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:17.760]   time for a habit, routine, or ritual.
[01:18:17.760 --> 01:18:19.760]   And so you want to choose them very carefully.
[01:18:19.760 --> 01:18:21.760]   If you're not doing any,
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   you're leaving a powerful weapon in the armory,
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   and that's an issue. But if you have
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   five or six different things, they're going to collide,
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.760]   and you're going to have to fail
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.760]   in your commitment to execute again and again.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.760]   That destabilizes your commitment, and it
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:35.760]   eventually will dissolve.
[01:18:35.760 --> 01:18:37.760]   So when it comes to these serious
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.760]   "I do it all the time," five
[01:18:39.760 --> 01:18:41.760]   is probably the limit, depending on how big
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:43.760]   we're talking about. And maybe three is more
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:45.760]   reasonable. So it's almost like you want to have these
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.760]   slots written up on your wall.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:49.760]   It's a draft.
[01:18:49.760 --> 01:18:51.760]   What do I want to draft? I have three slots for
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:53.760]   major routines I could have in my life outside of
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:55.760]   work. What are they going to be?
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:57.760]   And if something hasn't earned its place,
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:59.760]   I'm going to take that and replace it with something that's
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:01.760]   even more valuable. So you do want to take those seriously
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:03.760]   because you only have a limited
[01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.760]   capacity if you really want to stick with them.
[01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:07.760]   But you do want to be using these.
[01:19:07.760 --> 01:19:09.760]   So sports or
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.760]   athletic pursuit could be one. Everyone
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.760]   should have something here that has to do with fitness
[01:19:13.760 --> 01:19:15.760]   probably, just doing it again and again
[01:19:15.760 --> 01:19:17.760]   relating to fitness. I really like
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:19.760]   the idea of having some sort of intellectual, high-quality
[01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:21.760]   leisure in here, something you do
[01:19:21.760 --> 01:19:23.760]   on a very regular basis above the
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.760]   normal baseline that the average person would do
[01:19:25.760 --> 01:19:27.760]   that's pushing your mind, that's
[01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:29.760]   helping you psychologically or philosophically
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:31.760]   or theologically in some sort of
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:33.760]   regular way. I think that's really
[01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:35.760]   important. Beyond there,
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.760]   it just kind of comes to your interest. Maybe
[01:19:37.760 --> 01:19:39.760]   it's cooking or maybe it's a craft
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:41.760]   like with woodworking or knitting.
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.760]   I don't know. There's different things you could have
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:45.760]   in there. Maybe it's
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:47.760]   programming or microelectronics.
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.760]   But they have three, maybe four
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:51.760]   of these things that get serviced
[01:19:51.760 --> 01:19:53.760]   with rituals that you instill as, "I just do this
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.760]   on these days. I just always do that."
[01:19:55.760 --> 01:19:57.760]   I think that's part of a deep life.
[01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.760]   That's what I do with hockey,
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.760]   if I was you, Ricky. Golf.
[01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.760]   Golf, sure.
[01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.760]   Tennis.
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:07.760]   Tennis and golf. Just read a book
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:09.760]   about tennis.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:11.760]   I have a few.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:13.760]   Not too many, not too few.
[01:20:13.760 --> 01:20:15.760]   I like those.
[01:20:15.760 --> 01:20:17.760]   All right, let's do... We have a longer
[01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:19.760]   deep plate. Let's do another. We'll do one more question.
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:21.760]   All right, sounds good. We got a question
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:23.760]   from John.
[01:20:23.760 --> 01:20:25.760]   "I'd like to calculate my implicit hourly
[01:20:25.760 --> 01:20:27.760]   rate to determine if I should
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:29.760]   outsource a task instead of doing it myself.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:31.760]   I struggle, though, when it comes to
[01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:33.760]   personal tasks that would take place
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:35.760]   outside of work hours, like yard work,
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.760]   home improvement, stuff like that. For these
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   types of tasks, it's unlikely I would use the time
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.760]   saved from outsourcing the task
[01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:43.760]   to do more work that
[01:20:43.760 --> 01:20:45.760]   would earn my hourly rate
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:47.760]   because it's the weekend and I don't want to work then anyway."
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:49.760]   Yeah, so I've heard about this
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:51.760]   approach. This is the approach
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:53.760]   where you take your salary
[01:20:53.760 --> 01:20:55.760]   and you divide it by the number of hours
[01:20:55.760 --> 01:20:57.760]   you work, and then you say, "This
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:20:59.760]   is implicitly my hourly rate."
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.760]   And the idea is, in a professional context,
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:03.760]   when you're considering
[01:21:03.760 --> 01:21:05.760]   whether to do a particular
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.760]   annoying task, I'm going to
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:09.760]   format a presentation
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.760]   or
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.760]   whatever, fly
[01:21:13.760 --> 01:21:15.760]   a better flight that's going to save me time
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.760]   that's more expensive or something like this, you say, "Well,
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.760]   how much would it cost for me to
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.760]   hire someone? How much would it cost for me to take the
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.760]   better flight?" And then say,
[01:21:23.760 --> 01:21:25.760]   "Is that
[01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:27.760]   more or less than what
[01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:29.760]   it would cost me in terms of my hourly rate?"
[01:21:29.760 --> 01:21:31.760]   So if my hourly rate is
[01:21:31.760 --> 01:21:33.760]   $500 and it would take me
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   three hours to do this annoying task, but
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.760]   I could hire someone for $300 to do it,
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760]   you should hire someone for $300 because
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:41.760]   you're not out $300, you're actually
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:43.760]   saving $1,200. That's the
[01:21:43.760 --> 01:21:45.760]   mentality. It's a
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:47.760]   hack or heuristic that people sometimes use
[01:21:47.760 --> 01:21:49.760]   in work. John is asking about trying to
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:51.760]   do this with chores outside of work,
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:21:53.760]   and he says, "Ah, the analogy
[01:21:53.760 --> 01:21:55.760]   kind of breaks down because it's not as if
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:21:57.760]   the three hours I spend
[01:21:57.760 --> 01:21:59.760]   doing yard work is three
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.760]   hours I could be earning $1,500
[01:22:01.760 --> 01:22:03.760]   working because if I wasn't doing the yard work on
[01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:05.760]   Saturday, I wouldn't be working anyways."
[01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:07.760]   And I agree with that, John. I don't think
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.760]   the monetary framework
[01:22:09.760 --> 01:22:11.760]   is necessarily what
[01:22:11.760 --> 01:22:13.760]   you want to use for evaluating
[01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:15.760]   the worth of activities
[01:22:15.760 --> 01:22:17.760]   outside of work, at least in a very
[01:22:17.760 --> 01:22:19.760]   basic way. There's another
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:21.760]   way where I think money does matter here, but let's put that aside
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:23.760]   for now. Instead, the cost
[01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.760]   I want you to think about is in
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.760]   footprint on your schedule
[01:22:27.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   and stress.
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:31.760]   And so
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:33.760]   you look at, "How big of a footprint
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.760]   on my schedule is this particular household
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:37.760]   thing going to have?" If it's highly
[01:22:37.760 --> 01:22:39.760]   disruptive, it eats up
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:41.760]   the core of the weekend
[01:22:41.760 --> 01:22:43.760]   day that you otherwise as a family could be doing
[01:22:43.760 --> 01:22:45.760]   lots of other things, that's a heavy cost.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:47.760]   If it's something that's very stressful for you,
[01:22:47.760 --> 01:22:49.760]   that's also a heavy cost.
[01:22:49.760 --> 01:22:51.760]   This was like me doing
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.760]   my own taxes.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.760]   My issue is not that I
[01:22:55.760 --> 01:22:57.760]   am not
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.760]   quantitative or mathematical enough
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:01.760]   to understand taxes. The issue is I'm too
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.760]   mathematical and quantitative, and so
[01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:05.760]   my mind would
[01:23:05.760 --> 01:23:07.760]   hone in on the
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.760]   inevitable ambiguities or inconsistencies
[01:23:09.760 --> 01:23:11.760]   in the process of trying to
[01:23:11.760 --> 01:23:13.760]   fill out these different tax forms, and it would drive
[01:23:13.760 --> 01:23:15.760]   me crazy. And at some point, my
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:17.760]   wife said, "You're hiring someone to do the taxes."
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.760]   Because most people are like, "It's fine.
[01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:21.760]   This is probably fine. I know what this means.
[01:23:21.760 --> 01:23:23.760]   Fine." And I'm
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:25.760]   obsessing about, "Well, wait a second. How does this
[01:23:25.760 --> 01:23:27.760]   match with this? And is this really...?" And I'm trying to figure out
[01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.760]   the whole thing. It's my type of... So that's a high
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:31.760]   stress impact. So it's very costly
[01:23:31.760 --> 01:23:33.760]   to me. So when it comes
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.760]   to outsourcing or eliminating
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:37.760]   non-work
[01:23:37.760 --> 01:23:39.760]   obligations, that's the cost that you care about.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:41.760]   If it has a highly disruptive
[01:23:41.760 --> 01:23:43.760]   footprint on your schedule,
[01:23:43.760 --> 01:23:45.760]   outsource or eliminate if you can.
[01:23:45.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   If it has a high impact in terms of your
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   stress level, outsource
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.760]   or eliminate if you can.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   That's what you should be thinking about, not
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:55.760]   what your time is worth or
[01:23:55.760 --> 01:23:57.760]   your hourly rate or something like this.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.760]   I agree that that doesn't come into it.
[01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:01.760]   So money is relevant here in the sense that outsourcing
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.760]   can take
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.760]   money, and that's
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.760]   fine. So you also have to factor in, "Can
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:09.760]   I afford this?" I do want to underscore
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   though a point. We talked about this
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:13.760]   in the deep dive earlier in this episode
[01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.760]   when I was talking with Sarah Hart Unger. We talked
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:17.760]   about this a little bit, that
[01:24:17.760 --> 01:24:19.760]   I think we take off the
[01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:21.760]   table too quickly, the idea of
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.760]   investing in elimination of disruptive
[01:24:23.760 --> 01:24:25.760]   schedule footprints and
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.760]   overhead. We just
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:29.760]   take that off our list of things where it's
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.760]   valid to spend money on, even
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   if we could. And we spend that same money
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:35.760]   on other types of things. So we're very comfortable
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   when we're talking about
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:39.760]   dual-income,
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.760]   middle-class, coastal America
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   or something like this. People are very comfortable with
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.760]   "We'll spend more
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:47.760]   money to have a
[01:24:47.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   nicer car."
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   Or, "The environment's important
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:53.760]   so we're going to have a $70,000
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.760]   Tesla." We will spend, that's $50,000
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:24:57.760]   more than we need for the transportation, but
[01:24:57.760 --> 01:24:59.760]   we think it's important to us, and that's
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:01.760]   a good thing to spend money on. But if on
[01:25:01.760 --> 01:25:03.760]   the other hand, it's a few
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:05.760]   hundred dollars a month to take
[01:25:05.760 --> 01:25:07.760]   out this yard work chore
[01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:09.760]   that just eats up your schedule and
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:11.760]   is annoying for your family,
[01:25:11.760 --> 01:25:13.760]   you say, "I don't want to do that,
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.760]   because technically I could do this, and that
[01:25:15.760 --> 01:25:17.760]   feels like a waste of money."
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.760]   And we have these sort of inconsistencies
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.760]   happening all the time. "Well, here's an activity,
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.760]   a kid's kind of interested in this, we'll spend thousands
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:25.760]   on this activity,
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   but the idea that we could hire a
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:29.760]   laundry service, I could do the laundry
[01:25:29.760 --> 01:25:31.760]   technically. And so, "No, I don't
[01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:33.760]   know, I don't want to do that, that's somehow a failure." In fact,
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:35.760]   that last one is a point that Laura Vanderkam talks
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:37.760]   about a lot, is many more
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.760]   people could and should be outsourcing their laundry,
[01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.760]   but they don't,
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.760]   because it's not in this list of
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:45.760]   psychologically appropriate things to spend money on.
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:47.760]   So I think we're weird, and we'll spend
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.760]   a huge amount of money on this, and
[01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.760]   on these things that have a cost in terms
[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:53.760]   of schedule impact or stress outside of
[01:25:53.760 --> 01:25:55.760]   work, we're very reluctant to spend money.
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:25:57.760]   And I think we should change the thinking about
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   it. So I think that's one issue.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:01.760]   The other issue, and Sarah talked about
[01:26:01.760 --> 01:26:03.760]   this, is people don't like giving that advice
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:05.760]   because anytime you talk about
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.760]   investing money in anything, there's
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   this knee-jerk response of, "Not
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   everyone has the money for that."
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.760]   It's true of everything. It doesn't mean we shouldn't give
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.760]   the advice, because for a lot of people, it could be helpful.
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:17.760]   So that's what I would say, John,
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:19.760]   is look for, forget
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.760]   your hourly rate,
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:23.760]   what is the cost in terms
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.760]   of schedule disruption, what is the cost in terms of stress,
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:27.760]   and be more willing to
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:29.760]   invest in that than you might have otherwise
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:31.760]   been, more willing to invest in optimizing
[01:26:31.760 --> 01:26:33.760]   outsourcing that than you otherwise might have been.
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   The final thing I want to say is often
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:37.760]   the solution here is not financial.
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:39.760]   It's elimination.
[01:26:39.760 --> 01:26:41.760]   So you have
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:43.760]   some sort of
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:45.760]   setup in your life that
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:47.760]   actually you could just stop
[01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.760]   doing this. You
[01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:51.760]   could step down from this position,
[01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:53.760]   you could reconfigure the specific
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:55.760]   teams that your kids are on. There's some
[01:26:55.760 --> 01:26:57.760]   things you could do that might have
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:26:59.760]   a huge win in terms of schedule
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:01.760]   input or stress, and
[01:27:01.760 --> 01:27:03.760]   you don't because it's, "Well, there's some
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:05.760]   advantage to this," or someone might be disappointed.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:07.760]   And we don't take elimination
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.760]   seriously enough.
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:11.760]   But often elimination is
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:13.760]   possible, and people forget about
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   it two weeks later. No one cares, but you've had this big
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.760]   gain as well. So outsourcing
[01:27:17.760 --> 01:27:19.760]   is one way to get rid of
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:21.760]   these high-cost, out-of-work
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:23.760]   activities. Elimination is the other, and they're
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.760]   both things that we don't think enough
[01:27:25.760 --> 01:27:27.760]   about.
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:29.760]   And so I'm glad you brought this up, John, because I think
[01:27:29.760 --> 01:27:31.760]   it's, I think these are both strategies
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.760]   that when we're thinking about organizing life outside
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.760]   of work, we should all think about more.
[01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.760]   I love
[01:27:37.760 --> 01:27:39.760]   eliminating things. My wife actually has to push
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.760]   back on that. Like, "Why don't we just stop doing
[01:27:41.760 --> 01:27:43.760]   it? Why don't we just start, why don't we just cancel
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.760]   this? Why don't we, why don't we do nothing?"
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:47.760]   And it's a little more complicated
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:49.760]   than that. Like, kids
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.760]   should be doing things.
[01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.760]   But like, some sports leagues
[01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:55.760]   make your schedule impossible.
[01:27:55.760 --> 01:27:57.760]   And this sports league, they're still playing
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:27:59.760]   the sport, but it's like way more reasonable.
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:01.760]   Like, you know, sometimes those
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:03.760]   type of things. Having kids play hockey is pretty
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:05.760]   tough because like ice time is always so like limited.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:07.760]   It's late at night. It's late at night or early.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:09.760]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Hockey, hockey can be a
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:11.760]   rough one. That's the one
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:13.760]   advantage of baseball. Like
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   it can't be played early in the morning, can't be played
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:17.760]   late at night. So at least you know.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:19.760]   Unfortunately, it takes a very long time to play.
[01:28:19.760 --> 01:28:21.760]   [laughter]
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.760]   What's that? Soccer too.
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.760]   Soccer's pretty good. Yeah. There's no early morning
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:27.760]   fields. Rowing
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.760]   is bad. A lot of early morning.
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:31.760]   A lot of early mornings with rowing.
[01:28:31.760 --> 01:28:33.760]   All right. So I want to change
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:35.760]   gears. I've got a
[01:28:35.760 --> 01:28:37.760]   kind of hot take on
[01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.760]   AI I want to get to. Before
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:41.760]   we do, just to take care of some business
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.760]   here, let me mention another sponsor
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.760]   that makes this show
[01:28:45.760 --> 01:28:47.760]   possible. And that's our friends at Field
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:49.760]   of Greens.
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.760]   This is a whole
[01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.760]   organic fruit and vegetable non-water
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:55.760]   down supplement.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.760]   So what you do with Field of Greens
[01:28:57.760 --> 01:28:59.760]   is, we've
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.760]   talked about this before, but you want to automate
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:03.760]   what you can about your health or fitness. Fields of
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:05.760]   Greens is this powder supplement you add in water,
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.760]   take it, and you know,
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.760]   regardless of what you're eating that
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:11.760]   day for whatever meal, that you're getting things
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.760]   that your body needs.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:15.760]   A lot of
[01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:17.760]   these existing fruit and vegetable supplements
[01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:19.760]   aren't
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.760]   great, right? Because they just use
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:23.760]   extracts of common
[01:29:23.760 --> 01:29:25.760]   produce, department fruits and vegetables with few health benefits.
[01:29:25.760 --> 01:29:27.760]   The nice thing about Field of Greens is
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.760]   they care a lot about exactly where
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:31.760]   the beneficial substances
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:33.760]   in their supplements actually
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:35.760]   come from. Each
[01:29:35.760 --> 01:29:37.760]   ingredient in Fields of Greens is scientifically chosen
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:39.760]   to support vital organs like heart,
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:41.760]   lungs, and kidney health.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:43.760]   Others support immune system,
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.760]   blood pressure, metabolism, and healthy
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:47.760]   weight loss.
[01:29:47.760 --> 01:29:49.760]   So what you do is you just take your Field of Greens every
[01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:51.760]   day as a supplement to whatever eating
[01:29:51.760 --> 01:29:53.760]   you're doing, just to make sure that your body has
[01:29:53.760 --> 01:29:55.760]   enough of the things that is there
[01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:57.760]   that is good for your
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.760]   body.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.760]   So you'll probably look better
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.760]   and feel healthier fast.
[01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.760]   Your energy will also go up as well
[01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.760]   if you start a
[01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:09.760]   Fields of Green habit.
[01:30:09.760 --> 01:30:11.760]   Your best proof, however, will be at your next checkup
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.760]   when your doctor says, "Whatever
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:15.760]   you're doing, it's working.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:17.760]   Keep it up."
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:19.760]   So let me help you get started with 15% off.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:21.760]   Visit fieldofgreens.com
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.760]   and use the promo code
[01:30:23.760 --> 01:30:25.760]   DEEP. That's promo code
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:27.760]   DEEP@fieldsofgreens.com.
[01:30:27.760 --> 01:30:29.760]   DEEP@fieldsofgreens.com.
[01:30:29.760 --> 01:30:31.760]   Also
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:33.760]   want to mention our friends at ExpressVPN.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.760]   Let me put on my
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:37.760]   computer scientist hat
[01:30:37.760 --> 01:30:39.760]   here. I don't know what
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.760]   a computer scientist hat would actually look like,
[01:30:41.760 --> 01:30:43.760]   but we can assume it would be pretty nerdy.
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:45.760]   Let's be
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.760]   honest about it. It would involve
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:49.760]   a circuit board and
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.760]   a Star Trek reference. But if I can
[01:30:51.760 --> 01:30:53.760]   put on my computer scientist
[01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:55.760]   hat for a second, I will tell you
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:57.760]   you should be using a VPN.
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:30:59.760]   All right, here's the idea. Here's how a VPN works.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:01.760]   Instead of directly connecting
[01:31:01.760 --> 01:31:03.760]   to a site or service from your phone or computer,
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.760]   you instead form an encrypted
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:07.760]   connection to a VPN server.
[01:31:07.760 --> 01:31:09.760]   Over this encrypted connection,
[01:31:09.760 --> 01:31:11.760]   you tell the VPN server
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:13.760]   this is the site or service I really
[01:31:13.760 --> 01:31:15.760]   want to access. The VPN server then
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:17.760]   talks to that site or service on your behalf,
[01:31:17.760 --> 01:31:19.760]   encrypts the response, and passes it
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:21.760]   back to you on that encrypted connection.
[01:31:21.760 --> 01:31:23.760]   Why does that matter?
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:25.760]   Because everyone who is watching your
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   connection now has no idea
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   what site you're visiting
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:31.760]   or what service you're using.
[01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:33.760]   Now here's the thing. That's a big
[01:31:33.760 --> 01:31:35.760]   deal because if you're not using VPN,
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:37.760]   people are paying
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:39.760]   attention to that. If you're using a
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.760]   wireless connection,
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:43.760]   let's say at a coffee shop,
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.760]   anyone nearby can sniff
[01:31:45.760 --> 01:31:47.760]   your packets. They can look at your packets.
[01:31:47.760 --> 01:31:49.760]   Even if the contents of what you're sending is
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:51.760]   encrypted, you're using something like SSL,
[01:31:51.760 --> 01:31:53.760]   they can see what website you're talking to or
[01:31:53.760 --> 01:31:55.760]   what service you're using. Your internet
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:57.760]   service provider at home, it
[01:31:57.760 --> 01:31:59.760]   knows who you're talking to. It can
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   gather and sell that data, and you better believe
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:03.760]   they do that as well.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.760]   If you're using a VPN, all these people are
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:07.760]   out of luck. All they learn is that you're talking
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.760]   to a VPN server, they have no idea
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.760]   who that VPN server is then talking to on
[01:32:11.760 --> 01:32:13.760]   your behalf. Your internet
[01:32:13.760 --> 01:32:15.760]   activity becomes once again
[01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:17.760]   private, it becomes once again
[01:32:17.760 --> 01:32:19.760]   yours. So if you're going to use
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.760]   a VPN, I would suggest the one that I use,
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:23.760]   which is ExpressVPN.
[01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:25.760]   They're really a
[01:32:25.760 --> 01:32:27.760]   best in industry service.
[01:32:27.760 --> 01:32:29.760]   You set it up on your devices,
[01:32:29.760 --> 01:32:31.760]   it's easy to turn off and on with a click.
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.760]   And once it's on, you just use your
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:35.760]   browser or apps as normal.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:37.760]   It just works in the background. ExpressVPN
[01:32:37.760 --> 01:32:39.760]   has servers all around the country,
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.760]   I mean all around the world rather, in
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:43.760]   addition to all around the country. So wherever you
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:45.760]   are, there's probably a server nearby
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:47.760]   you can connect to and close by is
[01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:49.760]   good, because you're going to get a faster connection.
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:32:51.760]   They also have a lot of bandwidth.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:53.760]   So it really is going to be seamless, you're
[01:32:53.760 --> 01:32:55.760]   not going to notice any impact on your speed.
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:57.760]   So stop
[01:32:57.760 --> 01:32:59.760]   letting big tech
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.760]   and others leech on your data
[01:33:01.760 --> 01:33:03.760]   freely. Use my link
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.760]   ExpressVPN.com/deep
[01:33:05.760 --> 01:33:07.760]   right now and you can get three extra months
[01:33:07.760 --> 01:33:09.760]   free. That's
[01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:11.760]   expressvpn.com/deep
[01:33:11.760 --> 01:33:13.760]   to get protected
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:15.760]   with the VPN rated number one
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:17.760]   by CNET, TechRadar
[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:19.760]   and most importantly,
[01:33:19.760 --> 01:33:21.760]   me. ExpressVPN.com/deep
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:23.760]   ExpressVPN.com/deep
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   ExpressVPN.com/deep
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.760]   Alright Jesse, let's switch gears
[01:33:27.760 --> 01:33:29.760]   for something interesting segment.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:31.760]   Let's return to AI.
[01:33:31.760 --> 01:33:33.760]   We talked about chat GPT a few weeks
[01:33:33.760 --> 01:33:35.760]   ago in my article for the New Yorker about
[01:33:35.760 --> 01:33:37.760]   how it actually works. Now
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:39.760]   I want to return to the topic of
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:41.760]   how should we
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.760]   think about the AI
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:45.760]   revolution happening now? How worried
[01:33:45.760 --> 01:33:47.760]   should we be? What is the philosophically
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   the right approach
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:51.760]   to this current moment?
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:53.760]   The article I want to use as our
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.760]   foundation here, what got me thinking about this
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:33:57.760]   was the article I'm bringing up on the screen
[01:33:57.760 --> 01:33:59.760]   right now.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:01.760]   If you're watching,
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.760]   this is episode 247
[01:34:03.760 --> 01:34:07.760]   and you can find that at youtube.com/calnewportmedia
[01:34:07.760 --> 01:34:10.760]   or if you don't like YouTube at thedeeplife.com
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.760]   just look for episode 247 and you can find
[01:34:12.760 --> 01:34:15.760]   this segment so you can see the article on the screen.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:17.760]   If you're listening, I'll narrate what I'm talking about.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:20.760]   The article I'm talking about here is titled
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:22.760]   "There is no turning back
[01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:24.760]   on AI."
[01:34:24.760 --> 01:34:26.760]   It was written by the economist
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:28.760]   Tyler Cowen,
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:30.760]   nearby here, George Mason University,
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:32.760]   professor and prolific writer
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:34.760]   of public-facing books.
[01:34:34.760 --> 01:34:36.760]   This is from May 4th
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.760]   and he published this in Barry Weiss's
[01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:40.760]   newsletter
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:42.760]   The Free Press.
[01:34:42.760 --> 01:34:44.760]   I want to highlight a few things from this and then I'm going to
[01:34:44.760 --> 01:34:46.760]   riff on it.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:48.760]   Here's the first point.
[01:34:48.760 --> 01:34:50.760]   I'm reading this from Tyler's article.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.760]   "Artificial intelligence
[01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:54.760]   represents a truly major
[01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:57.760]   transformational technological
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.760]   advance."
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.760]   He's starting right off and saying this is
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:03.760]   a big deal.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:07.760]   He goes on to say
[01:35:07.760 --> 01:35:09.760]   "In my view, however,
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.760]   the good will considerably
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.760]   outweigh the bad."
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.760]   He makes a comparison here to Gutenberg.
[01:35:16.760 --> 01:35:18.760]   He says, "I am reminded of the advent of the
[01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.760]   printing press after Gutenberg.
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:22.760]   Of course, the press
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.760]   brought an immense amount
[01:35:24.760 --> 01:35:26.760]   of good. It enabled
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:28.760]   the scientific and industrial revolutions, among other
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:30.760]   benefits, but it also created writings by
[01:35:30.760 --> 01:35:32.760]   Lenin, Hitler, and Mao's Red Book."
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:34.760]   The printing
[01:35:34.760 --> 01:35:36.760]   press brought good, it brought bad, but in the
[01:35:36.760 --> 01:35:38.760]   end, the good
[01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:40.760]   outweighed the
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:42.760]   disruptions and negativity that came
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.760]   along with it.
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:48.760]   He goes on to say,
[01:35:48.760 --> 01:35:50.760]   "We don't know how to respond
[01:35:50.760 --> 01:35:52.760]   psychologically, or for that matter,
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:54.760]   substantively.
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:56.760]   And just about all of the
[01:35:56.760 --> 01:35:58.760]   responses I am seeing, I interpret as
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:00.760]   copes, whether from the optimist, the
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.760]   pessimist, or the extreme
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:04.760]   pessimist."
[01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:06.760]   This is the setup for Tyler's article.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.760]   He says, "I think there's this disruptive change that's coming.
[01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:10.760]   It's going to be like Gutenberg.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:12.760]   The good will eventually outweigh the bad."
[01:36:12.760 --> 01:36:14.760]   But he
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:16.760]   is making the claim that as a
[01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   culture right now, we are not psychologically
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.760]   handling well this reality.
[01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.760]   We don't know how
[01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.760]   to respond to it.
[01:36:24.760 --> 01:36:26.760]   And so he is going to move on now with a critique
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:28.760]   of how we are responding
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.760]   to what he sees to be that
[01:36:30.760 --> 01:36:32.760]   reality. So here's
[01:36:32.760 --> 01:36:34.760]   his critique. The first part of his
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.760]   critique of our current response is
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:38.760]   saying, "No one
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:40.760]   is good at protecting the
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:42.760]   longer or even medium-term
[01:36:42.760 --> 01:36:44.760]   outcomes of radical
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:46.760]   technological changes.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:48.760]   No one. Not you.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.760]   Not
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:52.760]   Eleazar."
[01:36:52.760 --> 01:36:54.760]   He's referencing here
[01:36:54.760 --> 01:36:56.760]   someone who's on the extreme
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:36:58.760]   X-risk AI is about to take over
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:00.760]   the world and enslave us.
[01:37:00.760 --> 01:37:02.760]   Not Sam Altman.
[01:37:02.760 --> 01:37:04.760]   And not your next-door neighbor.
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:06.760]   So he's arguing, "We
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.760]   are very bad at predicting the impacts of
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:10.760]   disruptive technologies in the moment."
[01:37:10.760 --> 01:37:12.760]   He makes it clear. Here's his examples.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:14.760]   "How well do people predict the final impacts
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:16.760]   of the printing press? How well do people predict
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.760]   the impacts of fire?" He's saying they didn't.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.760]   In the moment, it's very hard to understand
[01:37:20.760 --> 01:37:22.760]   what's going to happen.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.760]   And so Cowan's making this point.
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:26.760]   We know this disruptive thing
[01:37:26.760 --> 01:37:28.760]   feels like it's about to happen, but we're not
[01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.760]   handling it well, in part
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:32.760]   because we're missing the reality
[01:37:32.760 --> 01:37:34.760]   that it is very difficult to predict
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:36.760]   what really
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.760]   happens. And a lot
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.760]   of the reactions right now are what he
[01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.760]   calls "copes," which are based off of
[01:37:42.760 --> 01:37:44.760]   very specific predictions about what will
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:46.760]   happen or what definitely won't happen. And he thinks
[01:37:46.760 --> 01:37:48.760]   that's all just
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.760]   psychologically bankrupt.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:52.760]   It's not really based on reality.
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.760]   We're just making predictions we have no
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:56.760]   right to make, and then
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:58.760]   reacting to those.
[01:37:58.760 --> 01:38:00.760]   Then he goes on to apply this critique specifically
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.760]   to the existential
[01:38:02.760 --> 01:38:04.760]   risks of things like artificial
[01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:06.760]   general intelligence.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.760]   He says, "When
[01:38:08.760 --> 01:38:10.760]   it comes to people who are predicting this
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:12.760]   high degree of existential risk," he says, "I
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:14.760]   don't actually think arguing
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.760]   back on their chosen terms is the correct
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:18.760]   response. Radical
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:20.760]   agnosticism is
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.760]   the correct response, where all specific
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:24.760]   scenarios are pretty unlikely."
[01:38:24.760 --> 01:38:26.760]   I'm still for people doing
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.760]   constructive work on the problem of alignment, just
[01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.760]   as we do for all other technologies to improve
[01:38:30.760 --> 01:38:32.760]   them, but he's making the case
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:34.760]   you don't need to be worried about that.
[01:38:34.760 --> 01:38:36.760]   People should work
[01:38:36.760 --> 01:38:38.760]   on these issues, but the only
[01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:40.760]   actual intellectually consistent position
[01:38:40.760 --> 01:38:42.760]   on something like the existential risk of AI
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:44.760]   is radical agnosticism. I know a lot of stuff is
[01:38:44.760 --> 01:38:46.760]   possible. All of it's pretty unlikely.
[01:38:46.760 --> 01:38:48.760]   There's a lot of other existential risks in
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.760]   our life where it's in that same category,
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:52.760]   and we could put this in a
[01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:54.760]   similar place.
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:38:56.760]   So he goes on to say, "I'm a bit distressed each time
[01:38:56.760 --> 01:38:58.760]   I read an account of a person
[01:38:58.760 --> 01:39:00.760]   arguing himself or arguing herself
[01:39:00.760 --> 01:39:02.760]   into existential risk from AI
[01:39:02.760 --> 01:39:04.760]   being a major concern.
[01:39:04.760 --> 01:39:06.760]   No one can foresee those
[01:39:06.760 --> 01:39:08.760]   futures. Once you keep up
[01:39:08.760 --> 01:39:10.760]   the arguing, you also are
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.760]   talking yourself into an illusion of
[01:39:12.760 --> 01:39:14.760]   predictability." And he goes
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:16.760]   on to say, "Once you're trying to predict a future,
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.760]   it's easy to predict a negative future than a positive
[01:39:18.760 --> 01:39:20.760]   future, because positive futures are bespoke.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.760]   They're built on
[01:39:22.760 --> 01:39:24.760]   very specific things, lean to other very
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:26.760]   specific things. That's really hard to try to
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.760]   imagine. It's much easier to say
[01:39:28.760 --> 01:39:30.760]   'it all collapses.' That's an easier prediction
[01:39:30.760 --> 01:39:32.760]   to make."
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:34.760]   So
[01:39:34.760 --> 01:39:36.760]   he goes on to say, "Basically, so for this
[01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:38.760]   particular issue of existential risk from AI,
[01:39:38.760 --> 01:39:40.760]   he says, 'It is
[01:39:40.760 --> 01:39:42.760]   indeed a distant possibility,
[01:39:42.760 --> 01:39:44.760]   just like every other future you
[01:39:44.760 --> 01:39:46.760]   might be trying to imagine. All the possibilities
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:48.760]   are distance. I cannot stress that enough.
[01:39:48.760 --> 01:39:50.760]   The mere fact that AGI risk can be
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:52.760]   put on par with those other also-distance
[01:39:52.760 --> 01:39:54.760]   possibilities simply should not impress you very
[01:39:54.760 --> 01:39:56.760]   much." There's a lot of potential
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:39:58.760]   futures to negative things happen. We're already
[01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:00.760]   used to that. AI doesn't have
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:02.760]   a particularly new thing to offer
[01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:04.760]   to that landscape.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:06.760]   So in the end, when he's thinking about how do we
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:08.760]   consider AI,
[01:40:08.760 --> 01:40:10.760]   he says, "Look, if
[01:40:10.760 --> 01:40:12.760]   someone is obsessively arguing about the details
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:14.760]   of AI technology today,
[01:40:14.760 --> 01:40:16.760]   or arguments they read on a blog like
[01:40:16.760 --> 01:40:18.760]   'Less Wrong' from 11 years ago,
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.760]   they won't see this. But don't be
[01:40:20.760 --> 01:40:22.760]   suckered into taking their bait.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:24.760]   The longer historical perspective you
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   take, the more obvious this point will
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.760]   be."
[01:40:28.760 --> 01:40:30.760]   So let me step back here for a second.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:32.760]   What he's arguing
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:34.760]   that I agree with, I think,
[01:40:34.760 --> 01:40:36.760]   is an unusually
[01:40:36.760 --> 01:40:38.760]   pragmatic take
[01:40:38.760 --> 01:40:40.760]   on this issue, given our current
[01:40:40.760 --> 01:40:42.760]   cultural moment, which I'm going to summarize everything I
[01:40:42.760 --> 01:40:44.760]   just said. We are bad at
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:46.760]   predicting the impacts of technologies,
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.760]   so don't trust people who are being very
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.760]   specific about what's
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:52.760]   going to happen with AI and then
[01:40:52.760 --> 01:40:54.760]   trying to react to those.
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:56.760]   We can't figure that
[01:40:56.760 --> 01:40:58.760]   out with AI, just like in
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:00.760]   15-whatever, Franzi Gutenberg
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:02.760]   couldn't even look 20 years into the future
[01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   about what the impact of the printing
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:06.760]   press is going to be.
[01:41:06.760 --> 01:41:08.760]   So the problem I see, and this is what I
[01:41:08.760 --> 01:41:10.760]   think Cowan is very right about,
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:12.760]   the problem I see with the current discussion about
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:14.760]   artificial intelligence and its impact is that
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:16.760]   what a lot of people are doing
[01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:18.760]   is they're looking at
[01:41:18.760 --> 01:41:20.760]   often cherry-picked examples
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.760]   of these technologies at work.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.760]   And because these are linguistic examples,
[01:41:24.760 --> 01:41:26.760]   if we're talking about chatbot examples, they
[01:41:26.760 --> 01:41:28.760]   feel very
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:30.760]   close to us as human
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:32.760]   beings. We then try to
[01:41:32.760 --> 01:41:34.760]   extrapolate what type of mind
[01:41:34.760 --> 01:41:36.760]   could produce the type
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:38.760]   of thing I'm seeing in this example. We might imagine
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:40.760]   my 4-year-old couldn't do that,
[01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.760]   maybe my 13-year-old could answer those
[01:41:42.760 --> 01:41:44.760]   questions, so maybe this thing is like
[01:41:44.760 --> 01:41:46.760]   a 13-year-old's mind in there. Once
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:48.760]   we've imagined the type of mind
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.760]   that could produce the type of things we've seen,
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:52.760]   we then imagine the type
[01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.760]   of impacts that that type of
[01:41:54.760 --> 01:41:56.760]   imaginary mind might have.
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:41:58.760]   Well, if we had that type of mind, it could do this and this
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:00.760]   and that. Now we've created imagined
[01:42:00.760 --> 01:42:02.760]   scenarios based off of imagined understandings
[01:42:02.760 --> 01:42:04.760]   of the technology, and we treat that
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.760]   like this
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:08.760]   will happen, and then we get worried about
[01:42:08.760 --> 01:42:10.760]   those scenarios.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:12.760]   This is exactly what Cowan is saying that we shouldn't do.
[01:42:12.760 --> 01:42:14.760]   These aren't actually strong predictions.
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:16.760]   These are thought experiments.
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:18.760]   If we had a mind that could do this,
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:20.760]   what types of damage could it wreak? And then we're
[01:42:20.760 --> 01:42:22.760]   getting upset about the impacts
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:24.760]   of those thought experiments.
[01:42:24.760 --> 01:42:26.760]   So what I think we should do instead,
[01:42:26.760 --> 01:42:28.760]   culturally speaking,
[01:42:28.760 --> 01:42:30.760]   is stop reacting to thought experiments
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.760]   and start reacting to actual
[01:42:32.760 --> 01:42:34.760]   impacts.
[01:42:34.760 --> 01:42:36.760]   I don't necessarily want to hear any more stories
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:38.760]   about, "Well, in theory,
[01:42:38.760 --> 01:42:40.760]   a chatbot that could do this could also
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:42.760]   do that, and if it could do that, this industry could disappear."
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:44.760]   I think for the broader
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:46.760]   public, what you should filter for
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.760]   is tangible impacts.
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:50.760]   This industry changed.
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:52.760]   This job doesn't
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:42:54.760]   exist anymore. This company just
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:56.760]   fired 30% of its staff.
[01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.760]   When you see actual, tangible
[01:42:58.760 --> 01:43:00.760]   benefits, not predictions about what hypothetical
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:02.760]   minds might reap, that's
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:04.760]   what you should filter for. That's what you should
[01:43:04.760 --> 01:43:06.760]   use to refine your understanding of whatever
[01:43:06.760 --> 01:43:08.760]   ongoing change is happening and adjust
[01:43:08.760 --> 01:43:10.760]   accordingly. I think that's the filtering
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.760]   we have to do now. And look, there's
[01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.760]   no shortage of people
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:16.760]   actually attempting things
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.760]   that will generate real impacts. I spoke
[01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.760]   on a panel a couple of weekends
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:22.760]   ago out in San Francisco on generative AI.
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:24.760]   I spoke on the panel with one of the VCs
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.760]   that funded OpenAI.
[01:43:26.760 --> 01:43:28.760]   He was saying OpenAI
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:30.760]   already is bringing in, on track to bring
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:32.760]   in more than $100 million in revenue,
[01:43:32.760 --> 01:43:34.760]   commercial revenue of people
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.760]   and companies paying for API
[01:43:36.760 --> 01:43:38.760]   access to their GPT-4
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:40.760]   back-end language
[01:43:40.760 --> 01:43:42.760]   model. It's possible they'll be
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.760]   on track for billion-dollar revenue,
[01:43:44.760 --> 01:43:46.760]   annual revenue within a year. It's an
[01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.760]   amazingly fast climb. But the point is, there is
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:50.760]   a ton of people
[01:43:50.760 --> 01:43:52.760]   investing money to
[01:43:52.760 --> 01:43:54.760]   try to use this technology and integrate it into their
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:56.760]   work. So it's not as if there
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:43:58.760]   is a shortage of people
[01:43:58.760 --> 01:44:00.760]   doing things that could generate impacts.
[01:44:00.760 --> 01:44:02.760]   So my,
[01:44:02.760 --> 01:44:04.760]   I think the time is right then. My advice is let's filter
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:06.760]   for actual impacts. That's what, unless
[01:44:06.760 --> 01:44:08.760]   you're in a very rarified position that needs to
[01:44:08.760 --> 01:44:10.760]   very specifically make predictions about
[01:44:10.760 --> 01:44:12.760]   what's going to happen to my company in the next six months,
[01:44:12.760 --> 01:44:14.760]   filter for impacts.
[01:44:14.760 --> 01:44:16.760]   If you hear
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:18.760]   someone say, "This could happen
[01:44:18.760 --> 01:44:20.760]   because of this example,"
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:22.760]   change that to the Charlie Brown voice.
[01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:24.760]   What you want to hear is,
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.760]   "This company just shut down.
[01:44:26.760 --> 01:44:28.760]   That's interesting. That's a data point
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.760]   you should care about.
[01:44:30.760 --> 01:44:32.760]   This publishing imprint just
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:34.760]   fired all of its authors. Ooh, that's a data point.
[01:44:34.760 --> 01:44:36.760]   Okay, now I'm starting to understand what's going on."
[01:44:36.760 --> 01:44:38.760]   Because there's no real reason
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.760]   to get upset about things that
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:42.760]   are these predictions that are based off
[01:44:42.760 --> 01:44:44.760]   of hypothetical minds because most of them won't come true.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:46.760]   This is Cognitive Behavioral
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:48.760]   Therapy 101.
[01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.760]   It's called the Predicting the Future, Cognitive
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.760]   Distortion. It's not worth getting upset
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:54.760]   about predicted futures. It's much better
[01:44:54.760 --> 01:44:56.760]   to confront things that actually
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:58.760]   have happened.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:00.760]   Now there is one
[01:45:00.760 --> 01:45:02.760]   place where I disagree some with Cowan.
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:04.760]   So I think
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:06.760]   Cowan takes this for granted
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.760]   that we know now that there will be a major disruption
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:10.760]   Gutenberg style.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:12.760]   He takes that for granted. And I think very
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.760]   wisely says, "You kind of
[01:45:14.760 --> 01:45:16.760]   have to just go along for the ride, react
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:18.760]   to actual impacts, not the prediction of impacts,
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:20.760]   etc., etc."
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:22.760]   I'm not convinced yet
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:24.760]   that a major disruption is going to happen.
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:26.760]   I'm not convinced that it's not going to happen
[01:45:26.760 --> 01:45:28.760]   either. But we need
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:30.760]   to still take seriously
[01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:32.760]   and tell disproved what I call
[01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:34.760]   the AI null hypothesis.
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:36.760]   The AI
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:38.760]   null hypothesis is
[01:45:38.760 --> 01:45:40.760]   the claim
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:42.760]   that the ultra-large
[01:45:42.760 --> 01:45:44.760]   language model revolution that kicked
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:46.760]   off two years ago with GPT-3 in the
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.760]   next five or seven years
[01:45:48.760 --> 01:45:50.760]   is not actually going to make
[01:45:50.760 --> 01:45:52.760]   a notable impact on
[01:45:52.760 --> 01:45:54.760]   most people's lives.
[01:45:54.760 --> 01:45:56.760]   That hypothesis
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:58.760]   has not yet been disproven.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:00.760]   The way that will be
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:02.760]   disproven, and this is
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:04.760]   Karl Popper here, the way that
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:06.760]   hypothesis will be proven
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:08.760]   is when actual impacts,
[01:46:08.760 --> 01:46:10.760]   not predictions of impacts, not thought experiments
[01:46:10.760 --> 01:46:12.760]   about if it could do this, then it could do that,
[01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.760]   when actual impacts do show up that begin
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:16.760]   having a material impact on the day-to-day
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:18.760]   experience of people in their lives,
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:20.760]   then it will be disproven.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:22.760]   But until we get there, we do have
[01:46:22.760 --> 01:46:24.760]   to keep that as one of the possibilities going
[01:46:24.760 --> 01:46:26.760]   forward. And based on what I know
[01:46:26.760 --> 01:46:28.760]   right now, I would say it's
[01:46:28.760 --> 01:46:30.760]   not a given.
[01:46:30.760 --> 01:46:32.760]   It's not even necessarily the
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.760]   likely outcome, but probably the percentage
[01:46:34.760 --> 01:46:36.760]   chance here that the AI null
[01:46:36.760 --> 01:46:38.760]   hypothesis proves true is probably somewhere between
[01:46:38.760 --> 01:46:40.760]   10 to 50%. It's non-trivial.
[01:46:40.760 --> 01:46:42.760]   And so I think we
[01:46:42.760 --> 01:46:44.760]   do have to keep that in mind.
[01:46:44.760 --> 01:46:46.760]   It's possible
[01:46:46.760 --> 01:46:48.760]   as well that
[01:46:48.760 --> 01:46:50.760]   it turns out that these
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:52.760]   ultra-large language models, though
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:54.760]   impressively linguistic, when we begin to try to
[01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:56.760]   make them focused in and bespoke on these
[01:46:56.760 --> 01:46:58.760]   particular issues, the issues
[01:46:58.760 --> 01:47:00.760]   with hallucination, the issues with
[01:47:00.760 --> 01:47:02.760]   non-conceptual thinking, the
[01:47:02.760 --> 01:47:04.760]   limits that turn out to emerge
[01:47:04.760 --> 01:47:06.760]   from under the hood, what you're doing is
[01:47:06.760 --> 01:47:08.760]   token guessing with the goal of trying to create
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:10.760]   grammatically correct sentences that match content
[01:47:10.760 --> 01:47:12.760]   and style cues, that that may end
[01:47:12.760 --> 01:47:14.760]   up being more limited than we think.
[01:47:14.760 --> 01:47:16.760]   The computational expense is larger than it's worth it.
[01:47:16.760 --> 01:47:18.760]   We have a
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:20.760]   OpenAI gets a couple hundred billion dollars worth of
[01:47:20.760 --> 01:47:22.760]   API subscriptions, and then it dwindles back down
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:24.760]   again because it turns out, "Huh, this is not really
[01:47:24.760 --> 01:47:26.760]   opening up something that I didn't already
[01:47:26.760 --> 01:47:28.760]   wasn't already able to more or less
[01:47:28.760 --> 01:47:30.760]   do or to use a bespoke AI
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:32.760]   model or to actually just hire someone to do this."
[01:47:32.760 --> 01:47:34.760]   And that's very possible.
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:36.760]   And that we're actually at the peak right now
[01:47:36.760 --> 01:47:38.760]   of 100 million people
[01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.760]   just liking to use the chatbot and being
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:42.760]   impressed by what it does. I'm not saying that's
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:44.760]   going to happen, but it's also not a weird
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:46.760]   thesis. So I do think that needs to
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:48.760]   be in the hypothesis, as the AI null
[01:47:48.760 --> 01:47:50.760]   hypothesis itself is something that's still
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.760]   on the table. So we have
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:54.760]   a wide extreme of possibilities here
[01:47:54.760 --> 01:47:56.760]   from the AI null hypothesis
[01:47:56.760 --> 01:47:58.760]   to the most extreme
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.760]   to the AI null hypothesis.
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:02.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:04.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:06.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:08.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:10.760 --> 01:48:12.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:12.760 --> 01:48:14.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:18.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:20.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:20.760 --> 01:48:22.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:24.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:26.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:28.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:28.760 --> 01:48:30.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:32.760]   And I think that's a good thing.

[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:42.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:44.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:44.760 --> 01:48:46.760]   And I think that's a good thing.

[01:48:48.760 --> 01:48:50.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:50.760 --> 01:48:52.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:54.760]   And I think that's a good thing.

[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:10.760]   And I think that's a good thing.

[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:40.760]   And I think that's a good thing.

[01:50:42.760 --> 01:50:44.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:46.760]   And I think that's a good thing.
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:48.760]   And OpenAI talks about it as a reasoning agent.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:50.760]   And OpenAI talks about it as a reasoning agent.
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:52.760]   They talk about some of the things that these models have to learn to do
[01:50:52.760 --> 01:50:54.760]   They talk about some of the things that these models have to learn to do
[01:50:54.760 --> 01:50:56.760]   in order to win at the text guessing game.
[01:50:56.760 --> 01:50:58.760]   in order to win at the text guessing game.
[01:50:58.760 --> 01:51:00.760]   They're like, "Well, it's as if it understands this or that
[01:51:00.760 --> 01:51:02.760]   because it has to be able to understand these things
[01:51:02.760 --> 01:51:04.760]   to be able to do better at predicting the text.
[01:51:04.760 --> 01:51:06.760]   But in the end, all it's doing is predicting text."
[01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:08.760]   And it often...
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.760]   There's lots of interactions that lots of people have had
[01:51:10.760 --> 01:51:12.760]   There's lots of interactions that lots of people have had
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:14.760]   that are non-useful and non-impressive,
[01:51:14.760 --> 01:51:16.760]   and they post those on Twitter.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:18.760]   So I do think that effect is going on as well.
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:20.760]   None of this is helped by...
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.760]   There's not a lot of transparency from OpenAI.
[01:51:22.760 --> 01:51:24.760]   There's a lot of questions we have that we don't understand
[01:51:24.760 --> 01:51:26.760]   about how this technology works.
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:28.760]   There's not a lot yet on how people are using this concretely.
[01:51:28.760 --> 01:51:30.760]   We get the chatter on social media.
[01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:32.760]   We get the chatter on YouTube.
[01:51:32.760 --> 01:51:34.760]   And I'm trying to work on this topic now.
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:36.760]   Boots on grounds.
[01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:38.760]   Real companies actually using these interfaces.
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.760]   Are they having transformative change?
[01:51:40.760 --> 01:51:42.760]   Or is it being very minor?
[01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:44.760]   I don't see a good sense yet.
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:46.760]   I saw one concrete thing where the Chegg CEO,
[01:51:46.760 --> 01:51:48.760]   I saw one concrete thing where the Chegg CEO,
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:50.760]   that online homework thing,
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:52.760]   their sales went down, and they contributed it too.
[01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:54.760]   But that's whatever.
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:56.760]   These are things we should focus on.
[01:51:56.760 --> 01:51:58.760]   These are things we should focus on.
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:00.760]   What are concrete impacts?
[01:52:00.760 --> 01:52:02.760]   Maybe students can...
[01:52:02.760 --> 01:52:04.760]   It's good at generating text on topics.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:06.760]   So maybe that's going to make the places
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:08.760]   where you buy the pre-written solutions
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:10.760]   less valuable.
[01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:12.760]   And now create mills where you just,
[01:52:12.760 --> 01:52:14.760]   instead of paying students, just have ChatGPT
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:16.760]   generate a bunch of those essays.
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:18.760]   Maybe.
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:20.760]   I'm also not convinced, however, that
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:22.760]   these responses aren't
[01:52:22.760 --> 01:52:24.760]   pretty easily identifiable.
[01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:26.760]   At some point you identify the...
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:28.760]   It's not hard for teachers to identify the ticks of these models
[01:52:28.760 --> 01:52:30.760]   versus their students.
[01:52:30.760 --> 01:52:32.760]   So there we go. But that's a concrete thing.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:34.760]   So it's like, how worried does that make you?
[01:52:34.760 --> 01:52:36.760]   That thing by itself does it.
[01:52:36.760 --> 01:52:38.760]   But these are the type of things we should be looking for.
[01:52:38.760 --> 01:52:40.760]   The other thing I thought about is
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:42.760]   OpenAI is real big on... It does a lot of useful
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:44.760]   stuff for coders. They have a customized
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:46.760]   version that helps you if you're coding.
[01:52:46.760 --> 01:52:48.760]   And it can generate
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:50.760]   early versions of code or
[01:52:50.760 --> 01:52:52.760]   help you understand library interfaces or this or that.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:54.760]   But what came to mind is
[01:52:54.760 --> 01:52:56.760]   the biggest productivity boost
[01:52:56.760 --> 01:52:58.760]   in coding in the last
[01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:00.760]   20 years
[01:53:00.760 --> 01:53:02.760]   was when the common interface
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:04.760]   development environments like Eclipse
[01:53:04.760 --> 01:53:06.760]   introduced... I don't know the exact
[01:53:06.760 --> 01:53:08.760]   terminology for it, but it's where
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:10.760]   it auto fills
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.760]   or shows you, for example, here...
[01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:14.760]   You're typing a function. Here's all the
[01:53:14.760 --> 01:53:16.760]   parameters you need to give me.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:18.760]   So you don't have to look it up in the documentation.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:20.760]   Or if you have an object, an object-oriented
[01:53:20.760 --> 01:53:22.760]   programming, and you're like, "I don't know the methods
[01:53:22.760 --> 01:53:24.760]   for this object." You just type the object name,
[01:53:24.760 --> 01:53:26.760]   press period, and there's a big list. "Oh, here's all the different
[01:53:26.760 --> 01:53:28.760]   things you can do with this." And you select one and it says,
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:30.760]   "Oh, here is the
[01:53:30.760 --> 01:53:32.760]   parameters." And I noticed
[01:53:32.760 --> 01:53:34.760]   this when I'm coding my Arduino
[01:53:34.760 --> 01:53:36.760]   with my son
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:38.760]   to build video games in Arduino. It's really
[01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:40.760]   useful. It's like, "Oh, I need to draw a circle."
[01:53:40.760 --> 01:53:42.760]   Instead of having to go look up how
[01:53:42.760 --> 01:53:44.760]   to do that, you just start typing
[01:53:44.760 --> 01:53:46.760]   in "draw" and it's like, "Oh, here's all the different
[01:53:46.760 --> 01:53:48.760]   functions to start with draw. Oh, here's draw circle."
[01:53:48.760 --> 01:53:50.760]   You click on it. It's like, "Okay, so here's
[01:53:50.760 --> 01:53:52.760]   the parameters. Give it the center
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:54.760]   and the radius and the color." Like, "Great. I don't have to
[01:53:54.760 --> 01:53:56.760]   look this up." That's a huge productivity win.
[01:53:56.760 --> 01:53:58.760]   It makes programming much easier.
[01:53:58.760 --> 01:54:00.760]   No one thought about that as,
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:02.760]   "Is this industry going to be
[01:54:02.760 --> 01:54:04.760]   here?" But it was a huge
[01:54:04.760 --> 01:54:06.760]   win, just like version
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:08.760]   control. It was a huge win and made
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.760]   things really much more productive
[01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:12.760]   for software developers. But it wasn't,
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:14.760]   "Will this field still
[01:54:14.760 --> 01:54:16.760]   exist?" And so there's definitely a future
[01:54:16.760 --> 01:54:18.760]   where the
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:20.760]   LLM impact on coding
[01:54:20.760 --> 01:54:22.760]   is like those things. Like, "Wow, a bunch of things
[01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:24.760]   got a lot easier. I'm really happy.
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:26.760]   I'm glad that got easier." It reminds
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:28.760]   me of when GitHub came around or IDE
[01:54:28.760 --> 01:54:30.760]   started doing autofill.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:32.760]   It wasn't an existential risk to our industry,
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:34.760]   but it's a march towards making our life easier.
[01:54:34.760 --> 01:54:36.760]   So there's a future in which
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:38.760]   these are the type of things we're talking about.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:40.760]   And so, I'm
[01:54:40.760 --> 01:54:42.760]   waiting to see. I want to see concrete.
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:44.760]   I want to see concrete things.
[01:54:44.760 --> 01:54:46.760]   We'll find out. But anyways, AI null hypothesis
[01:54:46.760 --> 01:54:48.760]   is possible. You should talk about it. Regardless
[01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:50.760]   of what happens, focus on the impacts. Filter the
[01:54:50.760 --> 01:54:52.760]   predictions. People like making
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:54.760]   predictions, but a lot of them are nonsense.
[01:54:54.760 --> 01:54:56.760]   Speaking of nonsense,
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:54:58.760]   we should probably wrap this up, Jesse.
[01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:00.760]   Thank you, everyone who listened. We'll be back
[01:55:00.760 --> 01:55:02.760]   next week with another episode of the show.
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:04.760]   And until then, as always,
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:06.760]   stay deep.
