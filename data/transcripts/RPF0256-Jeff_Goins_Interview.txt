[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060]   Today in radical personal finance we talk art and the work of art
[00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.840]   with
[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.960]   writer
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.960]   Jeff Goines
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.320]   Welcome to the radical personal finance podcast. My name is Joshua sheets, and I'm your host. Thank you for being with me today
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.640]   This is the show where each and every day we try to break down the mysteries of life
[00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.880]   Well, at least as far as they pertain to finance and one of those mysteries is how do you make money doing something that you love?
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.520]   that you really care about and
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.360]   How do you make a transition from something you don't love to something that you do?
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.920]   My guest today has done exactly that
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400]   Jeff
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:03.680]   Coins is a really interesting guy. I was able to catch up with him recently at the fin con 2015 conference
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.120]   That was where this interview was recorded where he was a speaker and he's also written a new book on
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:17.280]   The challenge of finding work that you love and it's it's really a useful topic as it relates to personal finance
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.940]   The title of the book is the art of work a proven path to discovering what you are meant to do
[00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.760]   And I know this is something that many of you find yourselves challenged by any of us
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.200]   I should include myself in that many of us find ourselves challenged by how do we discover?
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.280]   where we're best suited to spend our time and
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.600]   Jeff's book might be a valuable resource for you, but even better than the book today. I have the author himself
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.080]   So when you can know the author and you don't have to deal with just the book, it's even better
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.640]   So we'll get to the interview just a moment before we do right before the interview starts
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.480]   Let's talk about sponsors sponsor of the day. Number one today is
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.520]   Patrick snow the publishing doctor
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:04.220]   We're gonna talk a lot about writing today and writing is definitely something that many of us desire to do
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.360]   Jeff is an expert on that. You should check out Jeff's work on writing
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.080]   He has lots of information lots of advice lots of tidbits for you
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.080]   If you would like to publish a book of your own and you would like some alternative views or probably better put
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.820]   Complimentary views to Jeff's work reach out to Patrick snow. He's the publishing doctor
[00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:29.760]   He is an expert at guiding people through the process of publishing their own book. He is actually my personal publishing coach
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:36.320]   I hired him to work with me as I work to put together the first of the radical personal finance books
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.020]   Definitely been a challenge, but I'm working my way through the process little by little and Patrick has been an immense help to me
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.640]   Essentially basically saving me tons of time and tons of research
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.520]   It's a lot easier to simply go to an expert and ask an expert instead of spending hours and hours and hours and hours trying
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.480]   To find the answers yourselves. It's it's well worth the time and money for me
[00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.600]   So to find out more about Patrick go to the publishing doctor comm
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.920]   the publishing doctor
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.080]   comm and
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.920]   You'll be able to find out some information about him and some of the clients that he's coached if you'd like to spend a little
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:11.480]   Bit more time with him before you do that go and pull up in your podcatcher
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.480]   I just navigate back to episode
[00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.520]   252 of the show and that is a lengthy interview with Patrick snow himself
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.360]   So you can get to know him before you get in touch with him
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.160]   And if you are interested in potentially working with him, he is happy to offer you a complimentary 30 to 60 minute consultation
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.920]   Where he can get to know you a little bit and he can share with you some ideas and some information that might be helpful
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.720]   And he'll let you know whether or not he might be a good a good source for you
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:40.400]   The best way to get in touch with him is text him your name and your area code

[00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.000]   And I will make sure that information is in the show notes for today's episode
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.720]   That's a that's sponsored that in one Patrick's know the publishing doctor
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:06.960]   Sponsor the day number two is why nab you need a budget the budgeting software that I use and love
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.200]   As we talk about transitioning you'll hear in this interview
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.560]   I'll talk I'll ask Jeff a couple of questions about transitioning from a day job to a business
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.280]   But one of the most important things about that is how do you handle the finances?
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.600]   It's all well and good if you are, you know, 16 or 18 years old and you can you know
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.120]   live on a shoestring
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.560]   but what about those of us who are supporting our families and
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.800]   Making sure that we're taking care of our financial responsibilities while we also continue to pursue work that we love
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.920]   Well, we needed some good tools and one of the foundations of a good tool is a good budgeting tool and for years
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.600]   Even though I was a financial advisor
[00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.280]   I never found a good budgeting tool that would work for me with an irregular income my income fluctuates dramatically
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.000]   until I tried why nap and
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.800]   Why nap is awesome?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.240]   It's the number one most recommended sponsor and most requested sponsor from the show audience
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.200]   And if you'd like some more information navigate back to episode 246 of the show
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:09.160]   You'll hear my personal story with why nap through that interview with the founder of the company Jesse Mecham episode 246
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:15.600]   Check that episode out or if you'd like to go ahead and just try the software yourself go to radical personal finance comm slash why nab?
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:21.640]   Why n a B download a free 30-day trial give it a shot put your stuff in there work on it for 30 days
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.640]   30 days isn't gonna be enough time for you to master budgeting
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.620]   But it's gonna be enough time for you to get a handle of the software to see if it would be useful for you
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.280]   And then after 30 days if it is useful, you can go ahead and buy it if not, no big deal

[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.360]   Let's get to the interview
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.320]   Jeff welcome to radical personal finance. Thanks, Joshua glad to be here
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.720]   So you've got quite the story and I love to profile stories like yours
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.040]   where people lay out a plan and just simply start pursuing the plan and
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.640]   Totally transform their life. So what's your story?
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:03.860]   Well, first of all, I like that, you know, I said, hey, it's good to be here
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.120]   Which is like a thing that people say on the podcast when they're not actually here
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.020]   But we're actually really isn't this a lot better than a Skype connection? Yeah, it's great
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:15.660]   and we've got you know this you've got the the track in the background of the
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:18.780]   ambience people talking
[00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:25.060]   So my story is I didn't necessarily start with a plan. I'm not sure that plans work
[00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.000]   I like what Jason freed from
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.380]   37 signals now base camp, you know what he says about plans. He says plans or guesses
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:39.220]   They're good insofar as they kind of point you in a direction and you start moving and realize
[00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:42.500]   Okay, none of this is working out the way that I thought it would right?
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.020]   So I guess in a way my career was was that it was sort of a you know
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.780]   Something I scribbled on a napkin and then started moving and threw the napkin away
[00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:53.340]   in college I
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:07:00.620]   Grew up in Illinois outside of Chicago went to college in Illinois. I didn't know what I was gonna do. So I studied Spanish
[00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:06.580]   That's a very high high productive financially career, isn't it?
[00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.580]   Well, I mean to sort of it could be but to complement it with an even more practical
[00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:15.580]   Field I decided to double major in Spanish and religion
[00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:19.220]   just because I was interested in it and
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:25.780]   and so yeah, I just wanted to travel and do fun things and so I went to Spain for a semester and
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:29.660]   that really opened up my eyes to the world and
[00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.540]   Changed the way I looked at my own life and and also the things that I was doing and realized I want to do something
[00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:41.620]   That has a global impact right that isn't just you know, something in my my hometown or whatever
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.140]   So I graduated college and so I've got this Spanish degree
[00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:51.300]   I've got a degree in religion for you know what I'm not sure and I decide to build on this
[00:07:51.300 --> 00:07:53.820]   Opus that I'm going to
[00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:58.300]   Travel the country for a year with a band and play music
[00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:01.620]   Because you studied music at college, too, right?
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.220]   No, cuz none of these things are related at all and I've always wanted to be a musician
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.060]   I was a musician for you know, ever since I was 16 years old. I played guitar
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:16.420]   But I always wanted to you know, do the professional musician thing, which I think is you know
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:21.860]   Something that every musician wants to do I guess and so I did it for a year and that year
[00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:27.980]   I I was the band leader. I was the guitarist. I drove our van and
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:34.620]   Once a week, I would write an update on a website. I mean, this is probably a decade ago, right?
[00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.980]   And we didn't call it a blog
[00:08:37.260 --> 00:08:42.260]   But that was just about to become a thing and and I would write this update of here's what we did
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:45.900]   Here's where we went. Here's what North Dakota is like, you know or whatever and
[00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.300]   that was
[00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:52.860]   My most exciting part of my week probably I loved playing shows. It was fun
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.660]   It was all great
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:54.700]   But I would you know
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:01.160]   I would play for 1,200 people and I would come back to this host home this place where we were staying in somebody else's house
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.900]   sleeping on their couch to keep expenses down and
[00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:12.220]   I would you know stay up late at night writing the blog post that summarized our week and that was telling me something
[00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.740]   I didn't know what it was telling me at the time, but it but it was very telling and so I ended that year
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.780]   kind of finished that up and
[00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.420]   Moved to Nashville to chase a girl
[00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:27.700]   Got her after some after some significant struggle
[00:09:27.700 --> 00:09:29.940]   married her and
[00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:36.260]   Started I was a telemarketer then I worked for a nonprofit as a marketing director again
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.340]   You know, there's there's a very consistent pattern in my career
[00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:44.180]   And really, you know really got this job with no credentials no marketing credentials
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:48.620]   But they saw that I was a writer which meant that I spent a few semesters
[00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:52.860]   tutoring other students and writing because there's always something that came naturally to me and
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.660]   So this guy this the executive director of the nonprofit said hey, I see that you're a writer. I'm like I am
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.620]   Okay, and so I I got that job and did that for seven years
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:06.460]   first as a
[00:10:06.460 --> 00:10:13.540]   Marketing director then as a communications director and there I learned all about online marketing because we had no money as a nonprofit
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.020]   So I'm like, well, what's free?
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.420]   Well, the internet is kind of free and blogging which had become a thing is free
[00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:26.140]   And so I found all of these free new media tools where we could connect with an audience and get them to you know
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:31.260]   donate or participate in our programs and that's how I found out about online marketing and
[00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:37.020]   As you know as that was sort of winding down as I realized I'm not sure I want to keep doing this
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:39.020]   I was approaching my 30s and
[00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:44.660]   Then all this all these memories of writing and you know when I when I was at the band
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.240]   I started doing this thing that Parker Palmer calls listening to your life
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:52.460]   He says before you can tell your life what you want to do with it, which is the plan approach
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.500]   you need to listen to your life telling you who you are and
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:11:01.900]   So I I realized when I was listening to my life the thing that it was telling me was I'm a writer
[00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:06.500]   And so that's you know, so that's how all these things sort of collided it, you know
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:10.880]   By the time I was 30 I became a full-time writer and what's interesting is
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:17.980]   You've fully taken on that identity even with your branding. I mean you call yourself Jeff Goins writer
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:22.020]   Yeah, so I guess you listened and followed through. Did you feel like a
[00:11:22.820 --> 00:11:29.180]   Fake when you started doing that? Yeah, I did. In fact, I wasn't I didn't even want to call myself a writer
[00:11:29.180 --> 00:11:33.340]   I had a conversation with a friend of mine around this time that I was kind of exploring
[00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.700]   I think we these milestones in our lives where we start to get an itch
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.020]   We're trying to find a satisfying way of scratching that itch and maybe the itches
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:48.380]   I'm tired of being in debt right or the itches. I'm tired of working a job that I hate right for me
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:52.420]   It was neither of those things. It was I'm worried that in ten years
[00:11:52.420 --> 00:11:55.460]   I'm gonna have a midlife crisis because what I'm doing is good enough
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:59.940]   And I think the really dangerous place that we find ourselves in careers these days is
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:03.880]   Not that you hate your job and you have to get out of it if you hate your job
[00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:08.700]   That's actually really good news because you know right to do something, right?
[00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:13.860]   If you kind of sort of maybe like it it's like being in a in like a not great relationship, right?
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:17.900]   It's it's not a good place to be because you're gonna settle for the status quo
[00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:23.900]   And it will slowly kill you and I feared getting to the end of my life and going man
[00:12:23.900 --> 00:12:26.820]   I missed it or getting to 40. It was really my fear
[00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:33.340]   Not getting to 40, but you know getting to 40 and realizing I I settled, you know
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:37.540]   And I'm I was in my late 20s. I felt like there's still some risk in me. I can still do something new
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:44.040]   What do I really want to do? And I had a conversation with my friend Paul at the time and he said what's your dream?
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:49.680]   And I realized how much life had beat me up that I that I couldn't answer that question
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.680]   I said I don't have a dream and
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:54.600]   He said really because I would have thought your dream was to be a writer
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:01.400]   And I think it's interesting that that the people around us often notice things in us that we fail to see ourselves
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:05.560]   That's been my experience. And so I
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.960]   Said yeah, I guess you're right. My my dream is to be a writer someday
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.440]   And he looked at me and he said Jeff you don't have to want to be a writer
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:17.080]   you are a writer you just need to write and
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:24.040]   This this was sort of an epiphany for me because I was doing the writing on the side and I was thinking about it and dreaming
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:24.960]   About it and hoping for it
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.840]   But I had this idea that like there was like a writer title with a capital W
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:34.320]   And I didn't know what you had to do to earn that title, but I didn't feel like I was worthy of it
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:39.880]   Right, and I thought what if what if you just call yourself a writer and then start writing and for me
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.920]   I learned an important lesson that activity follows identity that before you can do something
[00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:49.120]   I think you have to become someone and if you don't believe that thing about yourself
[00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:52.160]   I don't think you're ever going to do your best work. I
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   Remember reading an essay years ago by Mark Ford who at that time was writing under the pen name Michael Masterson
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.980]   And a publication called early to rise and he wrote about writing
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:08.440]   He was a writer for years and he talked about he had had that same dream as a young man
[00:14:08.440 --> 00:14:10.560]   And I believe if my details are right
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:15.360]   He was 17 years old and he was in school and his dad was coaching him and he was saying what do you want to do?
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.400]   I'm gonna be a writer his dad just simply said well, when's the last time you've written and he realized well
[00:14:20.400 --> 00:14:26.760]   Writers are simply people who write yeah, and you cease to become a writer when you stop to write
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:31.420]   Oh, you need to do is start writing. Yep, and it's interesting because we're here at FinCon
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:36.040]   2015 and yesterday in Carl Richards talk he made the point about
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:40.240]   Artists that very few of us identify as artists, right?
[00:14:40.240 --> 00:14:46.000]   Once we're older he said he does this you go into a kindergarten classroom and ask the kids
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Well, how many of you artists and every one of them raises their hands?
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.080]   Well, they're all artists and many years later that's been beaten out of us and very few of us
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.560]   I think he said seven people in the room raised their hand as oh, I'm an artist
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:02.860]   yeah, and it's so fascinating because you have to believe that you are something and then do
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:07.000]   And then or I'm not sure if you just made a statement
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.280]   Maybe I disagree with you or you sometimes you do and then over time you start to believe
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:16.640]   Yeah, I don't know if it's one or the other but just doing seems to be the core the core function
[00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:23.800]   Yeah, it is interesting to me. And I think it's you can call yourself a writer and if you're not writing you're not a writer
[00:15:23.800 --> 00:15:25.800]   You're a liar
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:31.640]   And I also think you can do do do do and never believe
[00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:37.120]   Something about yourself see that and that sabotages the work to like we we probably
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.240]   Have met people at this conference who've done that, you know, I mean people all the time, you know
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:45.880]   They got a blog and there's like a million people that read that blog and they go
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:49.680]   Oh, that's just something that I do right? Like are you kidding me? Like that's amazing
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.760]   And you don't have I mean, I think it's sort of this false humility
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.480]   But I think it actually affects the work that we do
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:16:02.360]   Having a healthy confidence and this is who I am. This is what I do is powerful going back to the kidner
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:09.400]   Kindergarten, er, you know story. I have a three-year-old so go before that and he is like the most confident person
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:12.920]   I know right cuz he cuz cuz life hasn't taught him shame
[00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:13.400]   Yeah
[00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:15.960]   I remember when he was like one
[00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:20.680]   His name's Aiden and the music turned on one day and we never showed him how to dance
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:25.020]   Right because mostly because I do not know actually how to show anybody how to do that
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.040]   My wife could but you know one day the music comes on. We're just hanging around the house
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:33.960]   We're I think maybe we're even like watching a movie and the credits rolled and they start playing this
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:40.920]   You know kind of dancey music. He just starts dancing his hips start moving and I thought wow, isn't it interesting?
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:47.520]   That we don't we're born knowing how to dance, but we have to learn shame
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:52.480]   Yeah, and and if my son were here and you asked him, who are you? What's your name? What do you do?
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:56.760]   You know all these kind of questions that we ask people he would probably say I'm Superman
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:03.360]   If you know cuz he wears all these superhero and he's like totally serious about it, and I just want more of that
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:06.120]   I want to go. Hey, I am this thing and yeah
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:12.520]   I'm gonna go like push this down when Aiden just looks at me really hard and I go buddy. What are you doing?
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:13.880]   He was these are my lasers
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:17.880]   He's expecting me to fall down. Okay. Well, of course, I've got a
[00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:24.960]   But you know like I mean, he's not perfect if I throw, you know, green balls at him he falls down
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:27.860]   He knows that kryptonite kills Superman. So there's that
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:35.360]   So at this point, I know that you built over the last few years a pretty effective business
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:38.400]   Yeah, but I'd like to talk to you about that time of transition
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.960]   What was it like and I know the inside scoop that at this point you left your job to build your business
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:48.280]   What was the process to that in your mind and in your life? I?
[00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   We use this term called
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.720]   You know make the leap like this is the thing that people say in these kind of conversations and I hate that
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:17:59.600]   terminology because I think it creates
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.240]   An idea that is false
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.900]   Creates this idea that if you work up enough momentum and you wait and wait and wait and sketch out your plan and you plan
[00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:14.540]   Perfectly that there's this moment where you know, and then you do it and everything's great and I don't believe in that moment
[00:18:14.540 --> 00:18:17.620]   I don't think it's it exists and it's not what I did
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.320]   You know for seven years, you know
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:25.360]   Most of my 20s I dreamt of being a writer doing something because I would have you know
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.440]   Like I thought in the in the back of my mind, maybe I could do this someday
[00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:32.640]   But I wasn't very serious about it, which is why the identity thing is so important to me
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   I felt like I was half-heartedly
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:37.720]   Doing the doing part of it and it wasn't working
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:41.680]   And so when I had a conversation with Paul because you're a writer
[00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:46.480]   You just need to write and I I had done enough of the other thing where I was playing the amateur
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:51.840]   Where where I was faking it and not making it. I was like, well, maybe I need to become this
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:57.400]   Maybe I actually need to get serious. What would change if I woke up every day and thought like a writer
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.820]   What a professional writers actually do as your dad said they get up and write every day
[00:19:01.820 --> 00:19:06.800]   That's the only thing that I knew right and and I couldn't control the outcome, but I could control the process
[00:19:06.800 --> 00:19:12.120]   so I started a blog, you know my eighth and you know and a whole slew of failed blogs and
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:17.660]   And I started a blog and I started writing every day and there was this discipline to the process
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.720]   I wrote every single day for a year on that blog publishing words every every time and
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:29.440]   That year I grew an audience because because I had failed a lot of different ways
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.280]   I figured out ways to not do it. But also I think because there was this
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.640]   Confidence not like I knew what I was doing but just like hey
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:44.120]   I'm just gonna put this out here. And so the first year built an audience of about 10,000 email subscribers
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.960]   And I remember coming to a conference like this and somebody saying in passing
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:53.860]   Oh, you know, you've got like a six-figure business there and I was like no no, it's more like a three-figure business
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.640]   I think I made like a hundred bucks last year somehow
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:58.280]   I don't even know, you know
[00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:02.140]   But I had this community of people and I didn't know what to do with it
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:06.960]   and so I did the thing that people talk about doing, you know, I surveyed people and found out what they wanted and
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:11.480]   I was I wasn't really taking it seriously until my wife and I got pregnant and
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:15.800]   And we're getting ready to have our son Aidan and I was like, oh, yeah like got it
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.280]   Got you know working for this nonprofit. This is not gonna cut it
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:21.180]   My wife wanted to stay home, but definitely wasn't gonna cut it
[00:20:21.180 --> 00:20:26.700]   And so I had this I was forced to make money my son forced me into entrepreneurship
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.700]   I really would have be here if it weren't for him
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:33.040]   You know, he'll get to go, you know when he asked me for money later on
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.560]   I'm sure he'll remind me of that. I would imagine so we'll make sure
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.840]   Yeah, I know you said I you don't want to buy me a car but
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:43.120]   What's it look, you know, like let's give a little credit where credit's due
[00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:45.640]   Take my commissions now
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:51.000]   So the first year of that was really about building the audience not as if this was planned at all
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.680]   It wasn't but I was trying to be intentional with what I had what so what can I do?
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:59.180]   Well, I know I need to build an audience and then I know if I'm gonna sell something that audience
[00:20:59.180 --> 00:21:01.180]   I can just like think of what I want
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:06.920]   Them to buy or I could ask them so I asked them and everybody said well we wanted you know
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:12.600]   we would buy an e-book from you about how to become a writer and so I sold this e-book for like three dollars and
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:19.200]   Replaced and then tripled both my income and my wife's income in that second year
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:23.320]   and so what we had done was we didn't take a lead because it took two years of
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.120]   intentional not quite knowing what to do but taking the next step kind of effort and
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:31.640]   At the end of that year my wife was like when are you gonna quit your job?
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.640]   And I was like that wasn't even the plan
[00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:37.920]   Like I was just trying to make sure you could stay home and be a mom for a while because that's what you wanted to
[00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:43.720]   Do but all of a sudden this thing became so much bigger than we realized and so I went to my boss who was really
[00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:47.040]   A mentor of mine. It wasn't this like stuck in a cubicle kind of thing
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:52.700]   And I'm you know, really big on stressing if you don't hate your job if you feel like you're safe
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:21:56.000]   That might be a really bad place to be because that's where I was
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.280]   And so I went to my boss and I said, you know
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.760]   Here's what happened and I'm thinking it might be time to move on
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.280]   And I'm just really worried that I might disappoint you that you've invested in me and mentored me for seven years
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:12.840]   You hired me when nobody else would hire me when when TJ Maxx told me they wouldn't hire me because I didn't have the right
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:20.100]   Qualifications you hired me. So thank you and he called me a writer before I was calling myself one and he said Jeff
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:24.360]   I'm not disappointed. I'm really proud and in fact, I've been waiting for this
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:29.120]   Like I've been seeing this coming for a while. I think instead of saying take a leap
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:35.760]   We need to replace that terminology with build a bridge because that's what we did and it took two years Wow
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:44.280]   You've written since that time ebooks books what's been the theme of your writing over this career?
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:51.780]   Well online, I think I'm known sort of as a writer's writer and I write about the writing process and that's great. I love that
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.800]   with the books and I teach online courses and speak and
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.880]   And you know kind of do those three things online courses speaking and writing
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:07.720]   Books and blog posts and stuff. I think really what it comes down to is kind of this conversation that we're having here
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.720]   I like talking about
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:13.440]   Who you are and and what you're going to do in the world
[00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:18.720]   And so I'm 32 now and and I'm doing this this thing that I was doing at 27
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:22.880]   I'm still listening to my life and I'm going what are the themes that are emerging?
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:24.640]   What do I continue to learn?
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:31.440]   so if when I was 12, I was drawing pictures of Garfield and when I was 16, I was writing emo love songs and
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.440]   you know when I was
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:37.880]   22 I was sleeping on a friend's couch, you know as a telemarketer
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.960]   Obviously, there's good jobs and there's bad jobs and there's oh crap
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:43.300]   I didn't I shouldn't have done that with my life, you know moments
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:48.720]   But what are the things that I've had in common in different seasons of my life that have continued to emerge?
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:52.300]   I think it comes down to I like connecting with people
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:56.440]   I like creating and I like not just creating for the sake of creating but creating stuff
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.720]   That's going to motivate people to change their lives in some way. And so when I'm writing about writing
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:05.680]   I'm really writing about no you're a writer and what can you do today?
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.180]   You can get up and live into that identity and when you know
[00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:14.320]   I was writing my last book the art of work, which was sort of the grander question
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.140]   How do you find a calling or a purpose in your life?
[00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:24.620]   Same kind of thing like how do I creatively inspire people to figure out who they are and therefore discover what they want to do
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:28.000]   In writing about writing, which I know has
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.340]   The art of work went a little bit beyond just writing but or went a lot beyond writing
[00:24:33.340 --> 00:24:37.260]   But in writing about writing have you ever wondered or felt like you're in some ways
[00:24:37.820 --> 00:24:39.820]   Almost running a Ponzi scheme
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:43.620]   Yeah, yeah, of course I get I get those emails
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:50.620]   Yeah, writing about writing podcasting about podcasting blogging about blogging, you know, we all kind of sneer at these things
[00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.580]   I
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:58.660]   What I get I get really worried about is when somebody reads my blog and then they go like replicate that because they think that's
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:03.660]   The path like oh like he wrote about writing and now he's writing other books and doing other things and that that's what you have
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:05.660]   to do
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.660]   That's that's probably not the right idea
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:12.580]   It's the right idea for me because right before I started my blog again
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.980]   This was like the eighth attempt at trying to not suck at this thing
[00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:21.700]   I when I did start my blog when I started going to write a commas just because I couldn't I couldn't buy Jeff goings
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:27.740]   Calm so it's like well like I'm gonna write like I'm gonna write stuff. So like goings writer. That sounds kind of cool and
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:33.860]   So first I started writing about leadership and I tried to be like Michael Hyatt and then second
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:37.460]   I wrote about marketing and I tried to be like Seth Godin and these things didn't work
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.420]   They just didn't work
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.540]   and so I would go to
[00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:42.340]   work as a
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:49.340]   Communications director and what I did all day long was coach writers and and I would work with our marketing team to create collateral
[00:25:49.340 --> 00:25:55.140]   That we would send out to people and I really liked that. I really liked helping people
[00:25:55.140 --> 00:25:57.860]   learn how to write better and
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:04.740]   Share their messages and connect them with an audience and and so I thought well like maybe I'll just share a little bit about this
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:07.340]   On my blog and when I did that it immediately
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:13.580]   Connected with people when I'd write like the Seth Godin s, you know vague sort of, you know intuitive
[00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:16.660]   Like what is he saying? And I feel like I just got incepted kind of thing
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:21.940]   You know, I would try to write that be very mysterious and nobody would read it and then I would I would write this thing about
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:27.900]   Writing. Hey, here's four steps to finding your writing voice or something that felt very rudimentary to me like obvious
[00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.060]   And people loved it like, you know
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:34.340]   I mean like four people and then that four became seven and twelve and so on but seriously like
[00:26:34.340 --> 00:26:39.300]   Nobody read this and then you know, two people goes hey, I like this and I go hey, maybe there's something to that
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:44.420]   I think there's two things that helped me process this one. I love what Derek Sivers says about this
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.780]   He says what's obvious to you is amazing to others
[00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:48.300]   All right
[00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:52.620]   This idea that you can just go find your passion and do whatever you want in the world and live on a beach and everything
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.540]   Will be great. I
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:00.980]   Don't think is a good idea and I don't think it's it's reality right? But but you know more importantly on the good ideas side
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.420]   I don't think it's actually the path to fulfilling work
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:08.060]   I think the path to fulfilling work is yeah finding what you're passionate about
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:14.140]   What do you love doing then? How does that intersect with a skill that you have probably something that's obvious to you?
[00:27:14.140 --> 00:27:18.500]   That's amazing to other people that you take for granted. Oh, that's just something that I do
[00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:24.420]   And then the third intersection is what do people want? Like what do they actually need?
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:31.100]   How can you help people and I think when you satisfy those three areas skill passion and demand you I mean
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:37.620]   That's a pretty good definition of a calling right? And so when I started writing about writing that was one of those
[00:27:37.620 --> 00:27:43.180]   Intersections since I found other intersections, but I really really like it
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:47.160]   I like coaching and encouraging other writers and creatives and you know
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:49.220]   The business reaches sort of expanding
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:53.740]   But yeah, I I get the Ponzi scheme thing
[00:27:53.740 --> 00:27:58.700]   But but no, I find it really fulfilling because I think everybody has a voice
[00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:03.380]   Everybody has a message worth sharing and in many ways I get more fulfillment
[00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.420]   From propping up those people and helping them get the attention there
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:12.340]   They're writing deserves then just you know me getting another email subscriber on my list. I
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:18.840]   Asked the question just because I think it is a common. Yeah, you know something that some people look at totally in every area
[00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:20.560]   There's a need for
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.600]   There's a white there may be a white space opportunity
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:28.880]   And so when who has an eevee strunk right wrote the elements of style and sits down and writes this
[00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:34.720]   It probably did seem very obvious to him and he made I hope a little bit of money selling this book
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:39.680]   That's become a classic but it filled a need but the next person that comes along the need was already met
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:47.120]   Yeah, and so there's one Michael Hyatt. There's one Seth Godin, but there's one Jeff Goins and he was a great writer
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:54.440]   He was a literary guy. And so I look at people who do this, right? I mean Stephen King did on writing right Steven Pressfield
[00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:57.640]   You know wrote the the War of Art
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:29:02.560]   You know sort more like writers who you know, not dead guys writers who are alive today
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:07.680]   and Lamont bird by bird and I think the challenge there is
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:14.640]   To not get stuck in that to continue to do creative work while you're telling people how to do creative work
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:19.800]   And I will say it's a challenge because there's that line of writers who want to get better
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:24.240]   You know that are knocking at my door never gets smaller. It always gets longer
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.240]   There's always more people want to share their message and I love that
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   But I realized I can only give what I have to give what I'm getting and so if I'm giving giving giving and I'm not
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:40.680]   Actually doing what I feel is important interesting creative work then that well is gonna run dry. And so
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:44.440]   I don't feel like a fake necessarily
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:50.640]   but I but I see like the tendency to like be talking about the thing that I'm no longer doing and
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.080]   that is
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:58.600]   Scary in a good way. I think that fear forces me to continue to create art hopefully and
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:06.240]   Stay creative and continue to kind of hone my craft. Have there been any changes in your character as an entrepreneur?
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.280]   versus previously as an employee
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:13.720]   Character
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:21.240]   You know, I don't know I don't know if this you know sort of satisfies that field of character, but I think that's um, I
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:24.300]   Think that when I was an employee I did have this
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:30.680]   I was never entrepreneurial like I wasn't I never I was never entrepreneurial in the sense that like I cared about making money
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.000]   In fact, I kind of cared about the opposite of it
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:38.200]   So I'm touring this, you know with this band for a year and I made like eight thousand dollars that year
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:42.440]   And I was like, this is great, you know, like I get I have a place to sleep
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.520]   I have food to eat and and I get to you know
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:50.480]   Live my dream at the time which was play music and I moved in Nashville and I got a raise
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.040]   I made twelve thousand dollars that first year sleeping on a couch eating peanut butter and jelly
[00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:59.920]   walking to Walmart once a week to get my bare necessities walking to
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:03.820]   Circuit City to check my email because I didn't have a computer or a cell phone or anything
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:06.800]   And I was okay with that
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:12.360]   but what I realized what I've since realized is an entrepreneur is
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:19.720]   somebody who creates opportunities not only for themselves but for other people and since starting a business and I just sort of fell into
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:24.040]   This in the sense that I liked the freedom of working for myself
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.840]   But you know the bottom line stuff the financial side of it
[00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:32.760]   I was oblivious to it because I always had a job. I was always very frugal
[00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:38.100]   So I never I was never in debt never did any of that stuff the one time my wife and I bought a car cuz mine
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.640]   Mine, you know broke down and we had we were paying for it. We're paying it off
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:46.360]   I was like we got a we got to pay that down very quickly and get rid of that
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:50.840]   Because I was just really afraid of owing people things. I didn't need to have an abundance
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:55.720]   I was just was that from your parents influence or just you or what what contributed to that? That's a good question
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.640]   When I was a kid at dinnertime
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:04.080]   The phone would ring and my parents would say don't answer that because those are bill collectors and that like, you know
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:08.520]   Ten years old I knew what a bill collector was and so I just knew that it was like, you know
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:14.360]   So we had lots, you know, so there was debt and you know, my parents did the best that they could but they struggled and
[00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:18.340]   I saw that struggle and it didn't make me want to go make a million dollars
[00:32:18.340 --> 00:32:19.680]   It just made me go
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:24.960]   I'm gonna count every penny and I was the I was the eldest sibling and I think there's some of that in the birth order
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:31.000]   But I was just like I'm not going to like I'm always gonna make sure I've got some security
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.320]   So even when I was making $12,000 a year, I had security, you know, I was saving money every month
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:43.040]   And and so when I became an entrepreneur, I realized looking back now I go
[00:32:43.040 --> 00:32:49.800]   Oh when I was an employee, I was very entitled. I wasn't planning for the worst-case scenario. I was hoping for the best
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:55.480]   I was being frugal as best I could but I wasn't creating opportunities for other people. It was all about me
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.240]   One of the most exciting things about running a business right now
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:05.380]   I think is not being a solopreneur which which I don't fit that category anymore. It's building a business
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:10.640]   That's big enough that it can employ me and other people probably not hundreds or thousands of people
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:15.200]   But a few people whose lives I get to impact because for years now
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.180]   I've been impacting the lives of our customers my readers that that sort of thing now
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:24.480]   I thought now what I'm really excited about is impacting the lives of people on my team
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:27.580]   And that was something I never thought about, you know in my 20s
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.580]   I just thought I just need a paycheck to take care of myself
[00:33:29.580 --> 00:33:34.160]   I think being an entrepreneur can not always but
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:40.020]   Certainly can make you less selfish and more generous and that's what it's done for me
[00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:46.820]   What caught you started as a solopreneur just writing working on your blog kind of doing your thing
[00:33:46.820 --> 00:33:53.960]   What encouraged you or caused you to make this switch from solopreneur to business owner?
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.460]   Just laziness, I guess like I did
[00:33:57.460 --> 00:34:01.140]   It's ironic because I'm like, I don't want I don't want to do these things
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:03.140]   I'm gonna hire people to do these things and
[00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:08.400]   In effect, I'm going to create more work for myself because I'm gonna have to hire these people and show them how to do this
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:13.540]   Or manage them or you know, like now I've got to manage people and do these things and in the short term
[00:34:13.540 --> 00:34:15.020]   It's more work, right?
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.300]   Because you've now got these people that you have to show how to do things that are not gonna do it perfectly
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.580]   And you still have to make sure these things get done and instead of just doing it yourself like hair do this thing and I'll
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:28.820]   Show you how to do it and it takes more time and it's more exhausting
[00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:34.300]   I tried it once about a year ago and it didn't work very well. And so I was like, ah, like I'm not gonna do that
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.620]   I'm just gonna you know, do the solopreneur outsource to VA kind of things
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.060]   and then I
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:46.300]   Tried it again this year and I really kind of organized things and said, okay like what does management look like?
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:48.620]   what does this look like and we started building systems and
[00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:53.820]   And now it's working a lot better mostly because I
[00:34:53.820 --> 00:34:56.180]   invested in people
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:34:59.500]   earlier on but what motivated it was I
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:05.300]   Initially thought well, I don't want to do this. I'm gonna get people to do it now. I
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:12.820]   As objectively as I can I look at what I'm doing and what our organization is trying to do and I go is does it really?
[00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:15.100]   serve our
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:16.860]   organizational goals
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:19.820]   For me to check my email two hours a day
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:22.300]   Which I could do if I you know when I get 500 emails in a day
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:27.600]   Is that really the best use of my gifts if I were my own boss, which sadly I am
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.700]   I love what Seth Godin says about this. He says the world's worst boss is you right?
[00:35:32.700 --> 00:35:35.420]   You know and I was like, oh man, I've got a terrible boss
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:38.340]   He's such a jerk
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:41.080]   You know like when when I
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:47.140]   Realize that it's it challenged me and
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:55.060]   And it changed, you know my perspective and so now it's I'm thinking well
[00:35:55.060 --> 00:36:01.700]   What what my best use of time if I were my own boss is to hey Jeff write something create something
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.300]   Spend some time, you know thinking of how we can grow the business
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:11.740]   Like I sort of serve this creative role in in the organization not not managing people
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:15.100]   I've never been good at that not like watching the bottom line
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.080]   That's important and I and I have to be aware of kind of the like the big numbers
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:25.300]   But like looking at spreadsheets, you know for hours every month is not a good use of my time because I'm not good at that
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:29.560]   And so it was it went from being probably this sort of selfish lazy
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:35.340]   I don't want to do that to going, you know, like if I were working for me, I you know manager
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:38.820]   Jeff would say to employee Jeff you shouldn't be doing that and
[00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:45.040]   And I realized okay, I'm gonna get people around me who can do that because I could probably figure it out and do it
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.040]   Okay, but I just I'm very uncomfortable
[00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:51.180]   Doing things that aren't the the best thing that I should be doing right now
[00:36:51.180 --> 00:36:55.640]   This is one of the aspects of your work that I've admired because I've been aware of
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:37:00.380]   Your work for a while and I've seen you make this transition from well
[00:37:00.380 --> 00:37:06.020]   I put stuff out on a blog and I just kind of do this solopreneur thing and then over the last couple years
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.020]   I've watched your business just
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:14.860]   From the outside. I haven't reviewed your tax returns, but from the outside it seems to have transformed from
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:20.060]   just me kind of putting some things out on the internet into a business and
[00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:22.900]   the
[00:37:23.220 --> 00:37:28.900]   In many ways I see you everywhere now versus before it was just like oh this this small community of people
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:33.860]   And that's the I guess the stage right where I'm at when I started radical personal finance
[00:37:33.860 --> 00:37:37.940]   Almost a year and a half ago at that time. I was just burned out
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.860]   I just wanted to do my dinky little podcast
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:44.100]   Yeah, you know sit down in front of a microphone in my bedroom and just like put it out there and just do that
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.620]   Yeah, I didn't want to do anything else
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:51.060]   But it took about six months for me to decompress and just kind of relax and then I'm now I've realized
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.580]   that I
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:38:00.820]   Have to I have a responsibility to make a change and instead of just doing my dinky little solo printer podcast
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:02.820]   I need to build a business
[00:38:02.820 --> 00:38:05.340]   Behind it. And so that's a major
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:08.300]   focus what were the
[00:38:08.300 --> 00:38:17.020]   Biggest influence what have been the biggest influences for you over the past a couple years in making this transition
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:19.540]   What's been the biggest source of encouragement for you?
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:22.780]   Well, we mentioned Michael Hyatt
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:29.940]   He's a friend of mine and really a mentor first from afar and now closer up and he said this thing
[00:38:29.940 --> 00:38:36.940]   To me recently. He said because I cuz he's way into the team-building thing, you know was CEO of a publishing company
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:40.900]   We had 500 people under him at one point so he gets it
[00:38:40.900 --> 00:38:41.180]   You know
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:45.900]   He knows how to build big businesses and I kind of assumed that when he got out of that
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:49.260]   He would do the solar pure thing and I asked him about that and he said yeah
[00:38:49.260 --> 00:38:53.940]   I did it for like a month and then like I realized I didn't want to do these things and it wasn't a good use
[00:38:53.940 --> 00:38:55.140]   of my time
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:59.060]   Not in some sort of arrogant way, but and I only have so many hours in a day
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:03.380]   How do I want to spend them? And if I'm gonna you know help people with that time?
[00:39:03.380 --> 00:39:08.060]   What is the the the best, you know bang for my buck and he said this he said if
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:13.340]   Your dream is so small that you don't need a team to accomplish it
[00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:20.820]   Then you need to dream bigger you need to have a vision that exceeds your resources and then go find
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:25.060]   Those resources. I remember reading a story about Henry Ford
[00:39:25.060 --> 00:39:26.660]   where
[00:39:26.660 --> 00:39:30.140]   They were sort of they were talking about the actual timeline for how
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:31.420]   You know
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:38.300]   He created an efficient automobile and and everybody kind of credits Henry Ford for creating the assembly line
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:41.260]   or you know sort of maximizing that anyway and
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:50.260]   What they don't realize at least based on on this Harvard Business Review story is that what came first was the vision Henry Ford saw?
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:51.180]   lots of
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:57.400]   Expensive automobiles that you know, the upper class could afford but nobody else could afford and he said this is not right
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:59.660]   We need to create
[00:39:59.660 --> 00:40:06.020]   Automobiles at this price point so that anybody in the middle class can afford them and people thought he was crazy
[00:40:06.020 --> 00:40:10.820]   They thought you're never gonna be able to get those resources, you know steel is expensive. This is expensive, etc
[00:40:11.420 --> 00:40:14.900]   So, you know, you're you're just this is what it's kind of cost and he said no
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:20.700]   This is our price point and we're going to have to build a system that allows us to grab those resources
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:28.220]   In a in an efficient cost-effective way to get that outcome and I think a lot of times we go. What are my resources?
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:31.020]   I'll find whatever resources and I'll try to do something with that and
[00:40:31.020 --> 00:40:36.060]   Innovation is always a process of looking ahead saying what's my vision?
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.180]   What do I want to see and then figuring out a path to get there?
[00:40:40.180 --> 00:40:44.140]   That's I think that's the only way innovation happens something new innovation means creating something new
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:50.500]   So, you know those things inspire me way more than just hey quit your job and work
[00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:53.140]   You know a few hours a week and live on a beach or whatever
[00:40:53.140 --> 00:40:59.500]   I think that work for me is something that's really fulfilling not in a weird workaholic way
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:04.260]   but like every day I get up and I go to work and I kiss my kid and I think about my wife and
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:10.140]   And my son Aiden says, you know, daddy don't go and we've gotten really good about talking about this for a while
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.900]   I sort of felt guilty and I was like because I can control my own schedule
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:16.540]   Maybe I should spend more time at home and you know, I'm home a lot
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:20.700]   But and I mean randomly take days off when we go to the zoo
[00:41:20.700 --> 00:41:26.060]   But we started talking about this as a family and my wife Ashley does a really good job of this. She goes nobody
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:30.940]   Daddy has to go to work because you know, we have a house so we have things to pay for
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:35.340]   but you know because you know, there's also you know people out there that
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:43.420]   you know your dad is influencing and impacting and and that's what he does and and we talk about it a lot not as like
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:49.040]   Work is a bad thing to be avoided and leisure is a good thing that we need to maximize more time with
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:54.060]   And so finding work that is inspiring not always easy and not always fun
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.540]   I mean, it's hard work, but but doing that and seeing other people who think like that
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:03.180]   so, you know Mike Hyde is an example of that where their work is a means to
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:05.900]   Achieve their purpose to make an impact on the world
[00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.300]   I find that really inspiring and try to integrate that into the work that I do
[00:42:09.300 --> 00:42:18.160]   Physically where and how do you work? I have an office in downtown Franklin
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.980]   We live in Franklin, Tennessee outside of Nashville
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:24.220]   And so I get in the car and I drive like a mile to work and it's a little
[00:42:24.220 --> 00:42:27.660]   Office without a window
[00:42:27.660 --> 00:42:32.420]   Above this cafe off of Main Street and the rent is really affordable for a long time
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:34.420]   I just worked in my house
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:37.260]   but there's something really good for me about
[00:42:37.260 --> 00:42:41.200]   Going from one place to another, you know
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:43.420]   I like
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:48.180]   Separation from work and the rest of life not because I the two don't really integrate because I think they do
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:52.180]   But because if I don't have that separation that one mile quick five minute drive
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:56.140]   To sort of reset my brain from you know playing
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:01.620]   Star Wars fighting, you know light everything's a lightsaber with my son in the morning - I gotta send him
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   You know send an email or something
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:11.960]   Resetting my brain into a different mode that drive helps accomplish that and then coming back even more important importantly at the end of the day
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:13.980]   I go
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:19.340]   Look like I need to stop thinking about work and be present to my family and it forces me to be present to both things
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.500]   That I'm doing
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:26.940]   So I like the physicality of having to leave home and it could be like walking across my yard or going to a certain part
[00:43:26.940 --> 00:43:29.220]   In my house, which it was for a while, but now
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:30.460]   You know
[00:43:30.460 --> 00:43:32.460]   I just I drive to this office and I've got a
[00:43:32.460 --> 00:43:38.620]   Desk and I just bring my laptop there and lots of lots of books and papers and things and that's where I do my work
[00:43:38.620 --> 00:43:43.980]   Are you creative on a schedule or do you write when creativity strikes randomly? I?
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:46.220]   both
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:51.420]   You know, there's that that old quote that I only write when I'm inspired. I just happen to be inspired every morning at 9 a.m
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:57.020]   And and there's that there's days where I don't want to create and I go well, it's your job, man
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:01.180]   So get up and do it anyway, and I force myself to sit down and miraculously something comes
[00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:05.740]   the challenge is because there's lots of interesting science about this that
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:11.180]   We get our best ideas when we're not ready to capture them, right?
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:17.120]   And I read some studies about this why when your brain is doing another activity
[00:44:17.120 --> 00:44:22.180]   It can be more creative and when you're under stress and anxiety, you don't do your best creative work now
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.820]   We've all had deadlines and stress and you know
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:27.740]   We kind of pull a rabbit out of her hat but typically you do your best work when you don't have to do it
[00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:28.940]   Which is kind of interesting
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.460]   Or at least you get your best
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:36.560]   Creative ideas in those settings and that's why you get ideas in the shower all the time or when you're driving a song lyric will come
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:42.440]   Or whatever. So what I do is I used to go. Oh that idea will come back later. It never comes back
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.700]   I forget I go. This line was brilliant. I
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:49.740]   I'm okay with letting things go. I used to really obsess about that
[00:44:49.740 --> 00:44:52.060]   I feel like this was my magnum opus and I've lost it forever
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.940]   So I I am creative on a schedule
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:45:01.780]   But then once that time is over ideas come through come to me throughout the day. So I just capture them
[00:45:01.780 --> 00:45:07.700]   I just usually pull up my phone or a notepad and I write them down like one or two words in Evernote
[00:45:07.700 --> 00:45:12.380]   I like using Evernote because I put on my phone and then the next morning I wake up I pull up Evernote and I go
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.380]   oh, yeah, I'm gonna write about that and
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:19.460]   And I use what's called what I call a three bucket system. I've got ideas
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:26.300]   Drafts and then published pieces so I you know, the first bucket is throughout the day
[00:45:26.300 --> 00:45:32.700]   I capture stuff on Evernote and put it into an idea bucket and then the next morning I get up during my scheduled time
[00:45:32.700 --> 00:45:35.700]   To write I take one of those ideas and I draft them into something
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:36.420]   That's very rough
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:38.820]   Then I put and then I put it into a folder and I leave it there
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:44.420]   And then I pull something out of that folder something older and I edit it and get it ready to publish
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:49.620]   And so when I'm constantly filling those buckets, I feel like I'm you know doing my work
[00:45:50.060 --> 00:45:56.420]   What do you write in software or what do you write it when I'm blogging I write in by word
[00:45:56.420 --> 00:46:01.180]   which is don't you know a little minimalist blogging software tool and
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:06.520]   And then when I'm writing for for a book, I usually write in Scrivener
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:09.420]   I wish I had better systems for this because I'm messy
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:14.700]   There's post-it notes and all kinds of things and I'm a very like when whatever I publish
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:18.740]   I want it to be very neat right, but my process is is pretty messy
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:23.620]   But those are two tools that I use consistently awesome final question if you were
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:28.720]   Speaking to somebody who's in a similar situation. You've given a lot of advice
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:35.380]   Already within this context, but you're going back and you're speaking to someone who's in a similar situation as you
[00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:39.940]   Life's going okay, but I would like to explore something else
[00:46:39.940 --> 00:46:44.940]   What's your coaching advice for them of how to pursue that in an intelligent way?
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:50.900]   So, you know going back to that little matrix that we talked about passion skill demand
[00:46:50.900 --> 00:46:55.400]   I think it's helpful to ask those three questions. What do I love? What am I good at?
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:47:00.100]   What do people want and and assume that you don't know the answers to any of those questions, right?
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:03.980]   Because I think we we like I thought man if I could just play music for a year
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:08.980]   This would be amazing and I didn't hate it. And I think there's this whole idea that once something becomes your job
[00:47:08.980 --> 00:47:11.260]   It's not fun anymore
[00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:14.540]   It's still fun, but it does change right it becomes work
[00:47:14.540 --> 00:47:16.700]   And I'm not one of those people that think you know
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:19.140]   You can't take your passion and turn it into work
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:24.100]   But it changes and I think there are very few things that there are very few passions that once they become jobs
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:26.460]   There's the same level of fulfillment
[00:47:26.460 --> 00:47:32.320]   Surprisingly writing has been that thing for me. It's just that fun and and that fulfilling
[00:47:32.320 --> 00:47:35.540]   so
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:38.940]   So for me what that
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.220]   what I would say is
[00:47:41.220 --> 00:47:48.340]   find something that you are good at that you enjoy doing and do it for six months and
[00:47:48.340 --> 00:47:52.100]   See if there's resonance see if there's connection
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:57.140]   So, you know with a blog and I had to do this seven different times before I could find something that stuck
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:48:00.440]   Try an idea be fully committed to it
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:06.820]   Write every day or create every day or do that craft every day and put it out there in some way blogging is great
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.320]   Podcasting is great because you put it on the internet people like magically find it
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.660]   You have to like go knock on a bunch of doors, right?
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:13.940]   It's good to knock on doors, too
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:18.700]   But it's you know random people go Harry I found this thing you're like really like I thought nobody was listening
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.620]   But nobody was paying attention and I think practices is good
[00:48:22.620 --> 00:48:30.260]   Practicing in public is even better because you're going to quickly see what resonates when I'm delivering a talk as a speaker
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:32.700]   which is something that I never thought I would do and I
[00:48:33.700 --> 00:48:40.820]   Volunteered to speak for free at this local event because I wanted to see could I do speaking should I do speaking and when I spoke?
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:44.700]   Very poorly in front of this audience of people but did the best that I could at the time
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:47.740]   And people came up to me afterwards and said good job
[00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:52.260]   I wanted to shake my hand and you know gave me a standing ovation, which was weird
[00:48:52.260 --> 00:48:55.780]   It like I realized there's resonance here
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:59.020]   This is something that I can pursue as opposed to spending a year
[00:48:59.020 --> 00:49:02.620]   Preparing to do that thing and then going oh this wasn't what I was supposed to be doing
[00:49:02.620 --> 00:49:07.780]   So I think finding something and putting it out there and seeing how it connects with people is the best way to figure out
[00:49:07.780 --> 00:49:12.220]   Am I on the right track and if not do something else, but really commit to it
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.900]   awesome advice
[00:49:14.900 --> 00:49:20.900]   Websites books courses share with the audience where they can find you and where they can connect with your work and the different
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:27.660]   Products and pieces that you have available for them. Yeah. Thanks. So the best place to go is my blog goins writer calm
[00:49:27.660 --> 00:49:34.800]   That's like coins because we're at FinCon but with a G or as they reminded me in middle school
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:37.820]   And I you know, I hope this is a pg-13 podcast
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:44.340]   Groins without the R, but you know, sorry for that word picture, but you'll you know, you won't be able to forget that
[00:49:44.340 --> 00:49:48.140]   If you go to goinswriter.com
[00:49:48.140 --> 00:49:53.900]   You can sign up for my email newsletter, which we send out once a week get a bunch of tips on writing creativity
[00:49:54.540 --> 00:50:00.620]   Business and you'll get the first two chapters of my new book the art of work for free. Awesome Jeff. Thanks for coming on
[00:50:00.620 --> 00:50:02.620]   Thanks, Joshua
[00:50:02.620 --> 00:50:05.740]   Here's my question as we go today
[00:50:05.740 --> 00:50:08.500]   Are you working on the process?
[00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:14.260]   If you hear stories like Jeff's and stories like mine stories like so many people that I bring on the show
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:17.620]   I hope you hear that. It's not a direct linear process
[00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:23.620]   It's a little bit here a little start little stop little step work a little bit on this work a little bit on that
[00:50:23.700 --> 00:50:25.700]   It's not a linear direct process
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:32.500]   But the process of doing the work can be really really fulfilling. So get out there and do the work
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.660]   You can find all the information about Jeff on his website
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:41.420]   Just link in the show notes go and read some of the stuff. He's an excellent writer. You'll enjoy his books
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:46.460]   You'll enjoy who he is. What I most appreciate about Jeff is he's a very down-to-earth and accessible person
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:50.840]   He doesn't pull the facade that so many people do. I'm mr. Bigshot. Mr. Success
[00:50:51.100 --> 00:50:57.220]   He's a very relatable person and and I find that personally very attractive and very useful and he's an excellent coach
[00:50:57.220 --> 00:51:02.780]   So check out his information link in the show notes to his websites. Thank you for listening today. I appreciate so much
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:06.420]   Thank you to each and every one of you who support the show directly on patreon
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:12.660]   Although I talk about sponsors in the beginning of the show the primary basis of the financial income for me is
[00:51:12.660 --> 00:51:17.340]   Through the patreon program and that's where individuals just like you sign up to support the show
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:22.220]   For a couple bucks a month or different levels and send me money directly
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:26.100]   And that's how I'm able to continue to bring you the depth and the breadth of shows
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:32.140]   That I bring you through here through the end of the year is November 5 today and through the end of the year
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:35.140]   I would love to publish for you a course
[00:51:35.140 --> 00:51:40.140]   For the patrons of the show and I know very clearly what I want that course to be at this point in time
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.500]   I want that course to be a discussion to the basic
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:50.260]   Foundational framework and I want to offer it a really low price and the way I can do that is with the support of
[00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:55.820]   The patreon patrons I intend to offer some very high price courses in the future some very high price services
[00:51:55.820 --> 00:52:00.260]   But I also want to offer low price services to help people who are just getting started and who are really struggling
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:03.840]   And so the way that I can do that is through the patreon program
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:08.740]   So I've set on the milestone goals if we can get the income for the show to four thousand dollars a month from you the patrons
[00:52:08.740 --> 00:52:14.220]   I will create that course and that course I will provide it free to all of the patrons of the show and that'll allow people
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:16.220]   in the future to be able to sign up for
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:20.380]   Sign up for a patreon program for a buck or five bucks and have access to that course
[00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:24.380]   So, please let's try to get to four thousand bucks by the end of the year so I can launch that in January
