[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.900]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:05.900]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.640]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.720]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.760]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.520]   This podcast is separate from my teaching
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.360]   and research roles at Stanford.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.400]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.280]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.360]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.540]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.480]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.760]   Our first sponsor is Inside Tracker.
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.180]   Inside Tracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.480]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.260]   to help you better understand your body
[00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.680]   and help you reach your health goals.
[00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.060]   I've long been a fan of getting blood work done.
[00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.760]   And the simple reason for that
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.980]   is that most of the things that you want to know
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.680]   about your health, such as hormones, metabolic factors,
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.480]   blood sugar levels, et cetera,
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.920]   can only be analyzed from blood.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.340]   And nowadays, there are also excellent DNA tests
[00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.540]   that can also give you valuable information
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.180]   about what's going on at the cellular, molecular,
[00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.600]   even the neural circuit level within your brain and body.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.940]   Inside Tracker makes getting blood and DNA tests easy.
[00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.860]   You can go to a testing site where they draw your blood,
[00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.080]   they take your DNA sample,
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.640]   or they can come to your home if you prefer that.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.920]   As well, they have a really amazing dashboard.
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.380]   The dashboard lets you understand
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.420]   what your levels of various hormones
[00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.320]   and metabolic factors, et cetera, mean,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.000]   and what you should do about them.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.480]   And I think that that's one of the main things
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.320]   that really separates Inside Tracker
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.560]   apart from other blood and DNA tests.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.900]   Most tests, you get the results back,
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.160]   but there are no directives about what to do specifically
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.200]   in order to bring the numbers into the ranges
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.320]   that you would like for your goals.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.040]   Inside Tracker makes all of that extremely simple
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.800]   and extremely clear.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.320]   If you'd like to try Inside Tracker,
[00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.320]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.160]   And if you do that,
[00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.460]   you'll get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.640]   Use the code Huberman at checkout.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.320]   That's insidetracker.com/huberman
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.760]   to get 25% off any of Inside Tracker's plans.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.960]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Athletic Greens.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.600]   Athletic Greens is an all-in-one
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.040]   vitamin mineral probiotic drink.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.920]   I started taking Athletic Greens back in 2012,
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.080]   and I've taken it ever since,
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.600]   so I'm delighted that they're sponsoring the podcast.
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600]   The reason I started taking Athletic Greens,
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.360]   and the reason I still take it now,
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.400]   is that Athletic Greens really lets me cover
[00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.480]   all my nutritional bases in terms of vitamins,
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.000]   minerals, and probiotics.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.080]   There's so much data now pointing to the fact
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.780]   that the gut microbiome and the gut brain axis
[00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.920]   is important for metabolism and for endocrine health.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.220]   The vitamins, minerals, and probiotics in Athletic Greens
[00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.060]   make me feel confident that I'm covering all my bases.
[00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.200]   I do take other supplements, but with Athletic Greens,
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.380]   I know that I've got all the foundational stuff handled.
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.900]   It also tastes really good.
[00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.060]   Tastes fine on its own.
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.680]   You can mix it with water, which is what I do.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.980]   I add a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice,
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.600]   'cause I like a little tartness flavor in there as well,
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.720]   but most people just mix it with water.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.200]   It mixes up super easily.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.960]   I drink it once or twice a day, usually once mid-morning,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.980]   and once again in the afternoon.
[00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.540]   If you'd like to try Athletic Greens,
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.800]   you can go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400]   and if you do that, you can claim their special offer,
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.920]   which is a year's supply of vitamin D3K2.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.200]   There is now a ton of evidence that vitamin D3
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.120]   is involved in countless metabolic processes,
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.760]   hormonal processes that are important for overall health
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.020]   and wellbeing.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020]   Vitamin D3 you can get from the sun, of course,
[00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:31.000]   but most people are deficient in vitamin D3.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.840]   So if you go to athleticgreens.com/huberman,
[00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.080]   you'll get the Athletic Greens,
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.440]   you'll get the year's supply of vitamin D3 and K2,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.320]   and you'll get five free travel packs.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.240]   So once again, it's athleticgreens.com/huberman
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.760]   to get Athletic Greens, the vitamin D3K2,
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.460]   that's a year supply, plus the five free travel packs.
[00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:52.820]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Monkpack.
[00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.480]   Monkpack is a company that makes keto-friendly snacks
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.860]   that taste incredible,
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.160]   but have just one gram of sugar or less,
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.100]   and indeed, they taste incredible.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.740]   In fact, my production team here
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.400]   at the Huberman Lab Podcast teases me
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.360]   because I actually have to keep the boxes
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.220]   of Monkpack bars in my basement,
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.360]   'cause otherwise I'll tear through all of them.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.200]   I remember the first time I tasted it,
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.260]   I was like, all right, here we go, a keto bar.
[00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.040]   I'm not a big fan of bars in general,
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.400]   most of them don't taste good to me,
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.140]   and I tasted the Monkpack bars,
[00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.000]   and they are absolutely awesome.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.760]   They come in a lot of different flavors.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.880]   I'm partial to the caramel sea salt one,
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.440]   but they also have sea salt dark chocolate,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.560]   peanut butter dark chocolate,
[00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.760]   they have a bunch of flavors, they're all incredible.
[00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.080]   I've tried them all, which is why I keep them in my basement.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.480]   As I've mentioned previously on this podcast,
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.560]   I'm neither keto nor carbo.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.080]   I don't really follow a particular diet in that sense.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.720]   I eat in a way that maximizes my alertness
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.520]   and my levels of focus during the day when I want to work,
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.620]   and that maximize my transition to sleep at night.
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.440]   So I basically eat low carb keto-ish during the day,
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.040]   and I know the ketonistas will say that I'm not in ketosis,
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.900]   and I can manage to get into ketosis,
[00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.420]   but the main idea is I keep my carbohydrates low
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.340]   during the day, and then at night, I do eat carbohydrates.
[00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:04.820]   So for me, the Monkpack bars are a really good snack,
[00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.320]   usually in the afternoon, maybe with a cup of coffee,
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.500]   especially if I'm going to train soon after that,
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.300]   or if I just want a snack and I'm going to continue working.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.220]   As I mentioned before, they're absolutely delicious.
[00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.000]   They also don't have any of the stuff that's bad for you.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.500]   No soy, trans fat, sugar alcohols, artificial colors,
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.940]   all that stuff that we know we should avoid.
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.620]   If you want to try Monkpack bars, you can go to Monkpack,
[00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.740]   that's M-U-N-K, monkpack.com,

[00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.140]   That's monkpack, M-U-N-K-P-A-C-K.com,
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.900]   and enter the code Huberman at checkout
[00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.380]   to get 20% off your purchase.
[00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.180]   This month, we're talking all about hormones.
[00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.020]   Hormones are incredible, and they control so many processes
[00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.640]   in the brain and body.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.000]   Last episode, we talked about the role of estrogen
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.380]   and testosterone.
[00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.260]   Today, we're going to talk about how hormones
[00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:59.080]   impact feeding and hunger, as well as satiety,
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.580]   the feeling that you don't want to eat
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.740]   or that you've eaten enough.
[00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:04.040]   Now, it's important to understand
[00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.700]   that hormones don't work alone in this context.
[00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:08.520]   Today, I'm going to describe some hormones
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.780]   that have powerful effects on whether or not
[00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:14.780]   you want to eat more or less or stop eating altogether,
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.820]   but they don't do that on their own.
[00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.800]   They do that in cooperation with the nervous system.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.060]   So today, I would say as much or perhaps even more
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.660]   than any other episodes, we're going to hear
[00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.900]   a lot of biology, but there are multiple,
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.500]   what I'm going to call entry points for tools
[00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.700]   that you can apply in order to regulate
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:35.120]   your levels of hunger, your meal timing,
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:38.400]   your levels of satiety of not wanting to eat more,
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.360]   and many of this is actionable with behaviors,
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.380]   but of course, we're also going to talk about supplements,
[00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:44.720]   and we're actually going to talk about
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:46.600]   a little bit of brain machine interface,
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.520]   devices that can actually be involved
[00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:50.520]   in manipulating these incredible things
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:54.220]   that we think of as hunger and appetite and satiety.
[00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:56.120]   So the first thing that you need to know
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.820]   about the nervous system side,
[00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:00.200]   the neural control over feeding and hunger,
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.660]   is that there's an area of your brain
[00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.240]   called the hypothalamus.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.780]   It's in the forebrain, which tells you
[00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.040]   it's in the front of your brain,
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:08.660]   and it's at the base of the forebrain.
[00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:11.380]   Now, the hypothalamus contains lots of different kinds
[00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.820]   of neurons doing lots of different kinds of things.
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.200]   There are neurons in your hypothalamus
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:18.620]   controlling sexual behavior, controlling body temperature,
[00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:20.160]   controlling circadian rhythms,
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.800]   the desire to sleep or be awake,
[00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.940]   even neurons controlling rage.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.100]   There are actually neurons that if we were to stimulate them
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.580]   would send you or anyone into a rage.
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:31.600]   They're just powerful control centers
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:32.800]   for the brain and body.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:36.120]   There's a particular area of the hypothalamus
[00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:39.040]   called the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.480]   And it's one that researchers have been interested
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.440]   for a long time now in terms of its relationship
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.880]   to hunger and feeding.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.480]   And the reason is it creates these paradoxical effects.
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.360]   What do I mean by that?
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:53.960]   What they found was that sometimes lesioning
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:56.840]   or disrupting the neurons in the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.200]   would make animals or people hyperphagic.
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.500]   They would want to eat like crazy.
[00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.700]   And other lesions in other individuals or animals
[00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.980]   would make them anorexic,
[00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.780]   would make them not want to eat at all.
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.420]   It would make food aversive.
[00:08:10.420 --> 00:08:12.920]   So that means that the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.980]   is definitely an interesting control station
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:16.860]   for hunger and feeding and satiety,
[00:08:16.860 --> 00:08:18.900]   but it doesn't really tell you what's going on
[00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:19.980]   at a deeper level.
[00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.840]   In fact, it's a little bit confusing or paradoxical.
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.760]   It turns out that there are multiple populations
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:25.600]   of neurons in there.
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.580]   We're going to talk about those.
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:28.260]   Some are promoting feeding
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:32.080]   and some are promoting not feeding or not eating.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.540]   Now, the other neural component of all this
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:36.140]   that you need to know about
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:37.980]   actually has to do with your mouth.
[00:08:37.980 --> 00:08:39.280]   So there's an area of your cortex.
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.920]   So that's a little bit further up in your brain
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:43.560]   called the insular cortex.
[00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:45.960]   And it processes a lot of different kinds of information,
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.400]   mostly information about what's going on inside you,
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.420]   so-called interoception.
[00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:54.000]   The insular cortex has neurons that get input
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.560]   from your mouth, from the touch receptors in your mouth.
[00:08:57.560 --> 00:08:59.860]   An insular cortex has powerful control
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:02.520]   over whether or not you are enjoying what you're eating,
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.860]   whether or not you want to avoid what you're eating,
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:06.200]   whether or not you've had enough,
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.020]   or whether or not you want to continue eating more.
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.860]   And that has to do, believe it or not,
[00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:13.460]   with the touch or sensation of eating.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.520]   I'm very familiar with this.
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.940]   I'm one of these people I love eating so much
[00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:19.740]   that I just like the mere act of chewing.
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:21.740]   I like celery sticks enough.
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.020]   I'm not crazy about them, but they taste fine to me
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:25.060]   and I like chewing on celery sticks,
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:27.560]   but I actually just like chewing on them.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.700]   I could eat all day long,
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.060]   except that it's not healthy to do that.
[00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.220]   But the mere act of chewing for me is very pleasurable.
[00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:37.820]   People who chew gum feel this way as well.
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.140]   And just as a point about gum or chewing,
[00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:43.700]   if you chew something like celery or cucumber slices
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:44.900]   or chew gum,
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.240]   provided it doesn't have any sugar or caloric content,
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.940]   it's not going to drive increased hunger.
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.780]   That generally isn't the case.
[00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:55.120]   But if you eat something with sugar, as we'll find out,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.240]   it has a very specific action in the insular cortex
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:09:59.640]   and in other areas of your nervous system
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.720]   that promotes the desire to eat more.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:03.020]   But the key point right now
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.420]   is to know that you've got these two brain areas,
[00:10:04.420 --> 00:10:06.060]   the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[00:10:06.060 --> 00:10:09.420]   that's involved in hunger and lack of hunger,
[00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.940]   sort of an accelerator and a break on feeding.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.660]   And you have this insular cortex
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.240]   that gets input from your mouth and cares about chewing
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.260]   and the consistency of foods
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.660]   and all sorts of interesting things
[00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:21.100]   that are just very tactile.
[00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:23.180]   And I think most people think about the touch receptors on,
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.300]   excuse me, the taste receptors on the tongue,
[00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:26.900]   but we often don't think about
[00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:30.260]   the touch or tactile essence of food.
[00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.860]   The thing that comes to mind just now
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.700]   is I've gone to sushi several times
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.620]   and some people really like the urchin.
[00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.440]   I don't like the urchin.
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:37.280]   There's something about it
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.880]   that kind of creeps me out about the consistency.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:40.000]   Other people love it.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.340]   So it's highly individual and it's probably learned.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:44.780]   And there's some probably cultural background to this
[00:10:44.780 --> 00:10:46.420]   if you were raised eating urchin.
[00:10:46.420 --> 00:10:50.440]   Some people love that consistency or that touch.
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.680]   So touch has a lot to do
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.820]   with whether or not you want to eat or not.
[00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:56.540]   Now let's get back to the ventromedial hypothalamus.
[00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.300]   Sometimes it makes animals or people want to eat more,
[00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.140]   sometimes less.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.340]   So what's going on there?
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.640]   There's a classic experiment that was done
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.200]   in which researchers took two rats
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.760]   and so-called parabios to them to each other.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.580]   What that meant is that they did a little surgery
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:12.380]   and they linked their blood supply
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:15.140]   so that they were forever physically linked to one another
[00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.620]   and could exchange factors in the blood,
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:18.720]   but their brains were separate,
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.680]   their mouths were separate,
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:21.940]   and they essentially did everything separately
[00:11:21.940 --> 00:11:23.260]   except that they were linked to one another.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:25.100]   So they had to walk together and go to the same places
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.000]   in order to do it.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.680]   This parabiosis experiment
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:31.720]   revealed something really important.
[00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:33.860]   When they lesioned the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:37.180]   in one of the rats that was connected to the other rat,
[00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.920]   that rat got very, very fat.
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:43.340]   It's just really obese, huge rat, super rat, jumbo rat.
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:46.360]   The other one, however, got very thin.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.920]   It actually lost weight
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.180]   despite consuming the same amount of food
[00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:53.060]   that it had prior to the other one getting the lesion.
[00:11:53.060 --> 00:11:54.080]   So what does this tell us?
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:56.540]   This tells us that there's something in the blood
[00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:59.080]   that's being exchanged between the two animals
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:01.700]   because it was their blood supply that was linked,
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.420]   and that tells us that there's hormone or endocrine signals
[00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.620]   that are involved in the desire to eat
[00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:09.260]   and hunger and appetite.
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.560]   And so next, we're going to talk about
[00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.520]   what those endocrine signals are,
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.560]   and then I'm going to immediately point
[00:12:14.560 --> 00:12:16.640]   to some entry points that you can use,
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.200]   and you can use these
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:20.780]   even if you're not parabiosed to anything,
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:24.840]   and that can allow you to time your meal frequency
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.580]   and predict when you're going to be hungry or not,
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.200]   as well as drive up appetite.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:30.520]   Believe it or not, there are people out there
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.320]   who are trying to eat more,
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.300]   although I think far many more people are trying to eat less
[00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:38.440]   because nowadays the data just point to the fact
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.520]   that there is essentially an epidemic of diabetes,
[00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.440]   type 2 diabetes, and obesity.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.080]   And most everyone agrees now
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:48.280]   that maintaining a healthy body weight
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.680]   and body weight composition
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.760]   is one of the best paths to longevity
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.120]   and to just feeling very good
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:54.360]   and actually being able to think.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.680]   Cognitive functioning is actually linked
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:13:00.820]   to levels of adipose tissue and so forth.
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.000]   So let's talk about the endocrine factors
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.840]   that regulate feeding, hunger, and satiety.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.160]   One of the really exciting things to emerge
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.600]   in the science of feeding and appetite in the last 20 years
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.580]   is the discovery of another brain area,
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:16.560]   not just the ventromedial hypothalamus,
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.720]   but it's an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.880]   And the arcuate nucleus
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.840]   has some really fascinating sets of neurons
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:28.340]   that release even more incredible molecules
[00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:30.420]   and chemicals into the blood.
[00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.640]   And these chemicals act as accelerators
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:35.080]   on feeding and appetite or breaks.
[00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:36.320]   And the really cool thing
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.280]   is that you can actually control these molecules
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:40.480]   through simple behaviors.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:43.240]   And once you understand what these molecules are,
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.480]   you'll start to understand why that's the case
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:48.180]   and the control points that you have right now
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:50.960]   in order to control your appetite in either direction,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.940]   increase or decrease.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.060]   So first of all,
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.680]   there are a set of neurons in this arcuate nucleus
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.920]   called the PMOC neurons, okay?
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.540]   I don't want to get into what the acronym stands for,
[00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:03.000]   but I'll do it anyway.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.880]   It's the pro-opiomelanocortin system, okay?
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.900]   So these are PMOC neurons, pro-opiomelanocortin.
[00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.440]   And if you heard Milano,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.780]   that should tell you it has something to do with pigmentation
[00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:17.720]   in skin cells or in hair cells,
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:20.800]   pigmentation of some sort because of melanin.
[00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.520]   Last episode, I talked a little bit
[00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:26.000]   about the relationship between light, dopamine, and melanin.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.520]   So you should already be thinking, wait,
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.440]   Milano means it probably has something to do
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.160]   with that system, and indeed it does.
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.160]   Now, the POMC neurons make something called alpha-MSH,
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:42.000]   melanocyte stimulating hormone.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.140]   Alpha melanocyte stimulating hormone.
[00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:47.080]   If you don't want to remember any of the other acronyms
[00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:50.880]   and terms I've talked about this episode so far,
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:53.800]   do try and remember MSH, okay?
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.360]   Mouse, Sam, hamster, MSH, okay?
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:00.400]   MSH reduces appetite.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.760]   And it's a powerful molecule, all right?
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:06.920]   So just put that on the shelf, MSH reduces appetite.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:08.880]   Now there's another population of neurons
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:11.760]   in the arcuate nucleus called the AGRP neurons.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:13.660]   And there, I'm truly not going to read you
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:15.280]   what that stands for 'cause it's related
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:17.380]   to the mouse strain it was first identified in,
[00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:22.380]   but humans have these cells as well, but AGRP neurons.
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.980]   The AGRP neurons stimulate eating.
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:29.760]   And anytime you are approaching food
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:32.820]   or you feel some excitement about food or anxiety,
[00:15:32.820 --> 00:15:34.700]   because some people actually experience
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.160]   a kind of heightened anxiety,
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.760]   some people actually get a little bit of a resting tremor
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:40.160]   before they eat, even if they don't have
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:41.520]   any sort of eating disorder,
[00:15:41.520 --> 00:15:44.660]   there's kind of a ramping up of autonomic activity.
[00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:48.720]   That's largely due to the activity of these AGRP neurons.
[00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:53.600]   So the activity in these AGRP neurons goes way up
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:57.000]   when animals or people are starved.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:58.680]   And I don't mean starve for long periods of time,
[00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.120]   but I mean, when they haven't eaten for a while.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.120]   And the activity of MSH,
[00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:07.400]   the release of MSH goes up when we've eaten.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:10.000]   However, there are other things that will stimulate
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.160]   the release of things like MSH.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.440]   So just briefly, the experimental evidence.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.600]   If you kill AGRP neurons, animals and people stop eating.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:22.200]   There are people who have lesions, they just stop eating.
[00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.500]   They become anorexic.
[00:16:23.500 --> 00:16:25.720]   That's actually, I know you're familiar with anorexia
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.960]   as a clinical term, but that's actually a term
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:29.940]   that's used in the scientific literature
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.680]   about a pattern of behavior, okay?
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:34.280]   As well as a clinical term, of course.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.740]   If you were to stimulate the AGRP neurons,
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:39.920]   animals or people eat like crazy.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.860]   They will eat to the point where they burst,
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.660]   which just sounds horrible, but it just tells you
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.720]   this is the accelerator on eating.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.200]   And yes, as relationship to the ventromedial hypothalamus
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.020]   I talked about earlier,
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.160]   but I don't want to go back there just yet.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.640]   We will circle back.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:55.600]   So melanocyte stimulating hormone,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.400]   such an interesting hormone.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.440]   This thing can shut down the desire to eat.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.380]   The melanocyte stimulating hormone
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.160]   is released from the medial pituitary.
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.740]   We talked about the pituitary last time.
[00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:12.440]   This is a gland that is very closely positioned
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:13.400]   to the hypothalamus.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.960]   Actually, some of the hypothalamus neurons
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.560]   actually project their neural connections
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.160]   directly into the pituitary to release things
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:22.680]   like gonadotropins and luteinizing hormone,
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:23.780]   stuff we talked about last time
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.560]   in reference to testosterone and estrogen.
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:30.300]   But MSH is released from the medial portion
[00:17:30.300 --> 00:17:35.300]   of the pituitary and it stimulates the desire to not eat,
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:36.580]   to cease eating.
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.100]   What's really interesting
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:41.800]   is that melanocyte stimulating hormone
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.120]   is activated by ultraviolet light.
[00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:48.360]   And it's not activated by ultraviolet light to the skin
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.920]   or directly to the pituitary.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:53.920]   It's activated by ultraviolet light to the eyes.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:56.240]   Now, if you've been watching this podcast
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:58.160]   or listening to this podcast for any period of time,
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.820]   or you've heard me on other podcasts,
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.660]   or you follow my Instagram,
[00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:04.180]   I am a big fan of this whole thing of getting morning light
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:06.360]   in order to synchronize circadian rhythms, et cetera,
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.000]   avoiding light in the middle of the night.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.600]   This is yet another reason why getting ample light,
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:16.720]   ideally sunlight, but it could be other sources of UV light
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.200]   to the eyes, stimulates MSH,
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.680]   this has been shown over and over again,
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.680]   and keeps the desire to eat or appetite in check
[00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:27.280]   in healthy ranges.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.660]   This is also why in the spring and summer months,
[00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.300]   animals and people eat less.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.000]   Now, for hibernating animals, it's different
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:37.040]   because the bear hibernate,
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.460]   actually bears don't truly hibernate technically
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.840]   by scientific criteria, they don't hibernate,
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:43.560]   but they go into a kind of torpor.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.520]   The hibernating animals, they don't eat much
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.540]   'cause they're in burrows or dens,
[00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:50.120]   or they're just wrapped up in a little ball
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:51.720]   or whatever it is that hibernating animals do.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.480]   So they're of course going to eat far less in the winter,
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.600]   but that's a unique scenario.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.880]   We are not hibernating animals,
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:59.480]   but humans generally have greater appetite
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:01.280]   in the cold winter months.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.660]   It's not just because of the holidays
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.140]   and the abundance of food that we're presenting ourselves
[00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:07.740]   with, but when we get a lot of sun,
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:12.260]   our appetite is reduced, or at least it's easier to control.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:14.660]   And that is due in part,
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:17.820]   because if you're getting ample sunlight to the eyes,
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:21.440]   it's converted into a signal for the MSH neurons,
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.380]   the neurons that release MSH, excuse me,
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:26.340]   these POMC neurons release MSH,
[00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:29.560]   and then MSH can bind its receptors
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:34.260]   and can keep the brake on appetite in check.
[00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:36.000]   So the takeaway tool from this
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.360]   is make sure you're getting enough light,
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:40.360]   not just in the morning, but throughout the day.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:42.160]   And yes, it has to be light to your eyes,
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:44.520]   and blasting your eyes with sunlight or artificial light
[00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.220]   to the point where it's damaging or painful
[00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.200]   won't accelerate or improve this process.
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.700]   It's about getting photons, ultraviolet light to the eyes,
[00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:53.560]   consistently throughout the day.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.720]   That's best accomplished by not wearing sunglasses,
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.000]   provided you can do that safely.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.140]   And if you don't have access to enough sunlight,
[00:20:01.140 --> 00:20:03.520]   then you can do this with artificial light.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.860]   This also points again to our old friends, the blue blockers.
[00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:09.820]   Many people know I'm not a huge fan of blue blockers,
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:11.600]   especially not during the daytime,
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.740]   because they block a lot of the UV
[00:20:13.740 --> 00:20:15.100]   and shorter wavelength light
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.620]   that you want and need to create alertness,
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.620]   but also to create release of MSH from the medial pituitary.
[00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:28.320]   Now, there are people out there, subcultures,
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:31.360]   that actually inject MSH,
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.480]   that are taking MSH or things similar to it.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.640]   I am not suggesting people do that,
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:40.240]   but there are three main consequences of doing that.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:42.960]   First of all, it reduces appetite, no surprise there.
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.280]   They're actually using it as a dieting drug.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.000]   This is kind of in the underground.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:48.400]   I don't know what the legal status is.
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.200]   And again, I'm not promoting that people do it.
[00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:55.200]   Two, it makes them very, very tan, which makes sense, right?
[00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.800]   Melanocyte stimulating hormone.
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:01.780]   And the third is it purportedly, never tried it,
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:04.820]   purportedly sends libido through the roof
[00:21:04.820 --> 00:21:06.540]   to the point where it's actually distracting
[00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:08.240]   for other activities.
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:10.220]   It actually can create priapism,
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:13.380]   which is a kind of chronic erection in males
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.800]   to the point where it actually can be physically damaging
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.960]   to the genitalia.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.120]   So this is a drug of,
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:20.920]   or I don't know whether or not to call it a drug.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:24.960]   It's a substance that one can regulate with healthy levels,
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.560]   with sunlight and perhaps artificial UV light.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:32.500]   I have not heard much about treatments for obesity
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:35.900]   involving getting ample sunlight or getting ample UV light,
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:38.720]   but to me, the logic is just very clear.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.040]   And so if you're pursuing those avenues,
[00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.040]   you certainly should talk to your physician,
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.120]   but you might want to think about
[00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:46.960]   how some of those logic hangs together.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:48.300]   Absolutely fascinating hormone.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.320]   I think most people aren't aware of it.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.360]   And the subcultures that are aware of it
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:55.900]   are using it to very particular endpoints,
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:21:59.120]   and they're using it at super physiological levels.
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.720]   That's enough about that, 'cause I really don't know.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.920]   I've talked to a few people in research,
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.000]   believe it or not, for this podcast.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.400]   I reached out to a few people and asked whether or not
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:10.280]   these side effects, in air quotes,
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:12.080]   that I've heard about are true, and indeed they're true.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:14.080]   But again, that's super physiological.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:18.260]   Controlling MSH, it's actually alpha MSH levels
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:22.720]   through viewing ultraviolet light seems like an interesting
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:25.800]   and mechanistically logical thing to do
[00:22:25.800 --> 00:22:29.000]   if your goal is to keep appetite in check.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.520]   So MSH inhibits hunger.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.760]   Next, let's talk about a hormone peptide
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.920]   that activates hunger.
[00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.980]   And this is a really interesting one
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.880]   because it relates to when you get hungry,
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.800]   in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.060]   And it's called ghrelin.
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:49.600]   It's spelled G-H-R-E-L-I-N.
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.580]   Ghrelin is released actually from the GI tract.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.580]   And its main role is to increase your desire to eat.
[00:22:58.580 --> 00:23:02.000]   And it does that through a variety of mechanisms.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.800]   Part of that is to stimulate some of the brain areas,
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:08.040]   the actual neurons that make you want to eat.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:11.000]   In addition, it creates food anticipatory signals
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:11.960]   within your nervous system.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.460]   So you start thinking about the things
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:15.380]   that you happen to like to eat
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:17.760]   at that particular time of day.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.800]   And this is fascinating.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:23.040]   Ghrelin is sort of like a clock, a hormonal clock
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:25.360]   that makes you want to eat at particular times.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.740]   Now, the signal for ghrelin
[00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:30.120]   is reduced glucose levels in the blood.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:33.800]   We're going to talk a lot today about glucose and insulin,
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:36.280]   ways to manage glucose and insulin.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:38.680]   But for now, the simple version of this
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.840]   is you normally want your glucose
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.640]   to be in a kind of modest range.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.880]   And I'll explain what that range is in a little bit.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.720]   But if it drops too low,
[00:23:48.720 --> 00:23:51.400]   ghrelin is secreted from your gut.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:54.880]   It activates neurons in your brain at various locations,
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.200]   including the PMOC neurons
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:00.800]   and the other neurons of the arcuate.
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:03.920]   It also activates the VMH in particular ways.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:06.640]   And it might even activate some of these neurons
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:08.440]   that are in the periphery in your mouth
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:10.160]   that actually make you kind of salivate
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.920]   and want to eat, right?
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:14.860]   We all know about the famous Pavlovian experiments
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:15.840]   of Pavlov's dogs.
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:17.320]   You know, they start salivating to the bell
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.600]   after the bell was presented with food,
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:19.440]   you remove the food,
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:21.960]   and then just the bell can stimulate the salivation.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:23.780]   We become Pavlovian at times.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.640]   But rarely has it ever discussed
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.780]   what the neural pathways for that are.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:29.600]   And it turns out that these hormones
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.080]   that are secreted from the gut
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.480]   can stimulate the neurons to create a sensation
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:37.680]   and a desire for certain foods at certain times of day.
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:40.880]   You've done this experiment.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.120]   If you are somebody who eats breakfast
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.180]   at more or less the same time each day,
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:48.960]   let's say 8 a.m., plus or minus 20 minutes,
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.720]   and then you eat lunch 1230, plus or minus 20 minutes,
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:54.060]   or let's say you're somebody like me
[00:24:54.060 --> 00:24:56.080]   who typically skips breakfast
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.080]   and just eats lunch usually around 1130 or 12
[00:24:59.080 --> 00:25:00.200]   or something like that,
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:04.280]   your ghrelin secretion will start to match
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:06.480]   when you typically eat.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:07.640]   And it does that.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.440]   And it's able to override the low levels of glucose
[00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:13.440]   in your bloodstream because the ghrelin system
[00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:18.300]   also gets input from a clock in your liver
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:19.960]   that is linked to the clock
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.840]   in your hypothalamus in your brain.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.280]   And what this means is if you eat at regular mealtimes,
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:25.840]   you will start to get hungry a few minutes
[00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.920]   before those mealtimes.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.600]   If you've ever wondered why
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.760]   your stomach kind of starts to growl
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.880]   because it's a particular time of day,
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.500]   you're like, "Oh, I must want to eat."
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.000]   Well, that's ghrelin.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.680]   And for those of you that don't know
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:40.400]   why your stomach growls, I'll also tell you that today.
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:42.000]   It's actually really interesting.
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   It's not at all what you expect.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.680]   And it's not just the gurgling of liquids in your stomach.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:47.860]   That's not what it is.
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.780]   It's actually a muscular phenomenon.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:55.240]   So ghrelin is secreted as a kind of food anticipatory signal
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:58.520]   to get you motivated to go eat at regular times.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.440]   So nowadays there's a lot of interest
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.980]   in intermittent fasting.
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:06.120]   There's also a lot of interest in just what meal plans
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.320]   and schedules and what to eat in general
[00:26:08.320 --> 00:26:11.720]   in order to maximize one's health and wellbeing
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.920]   and people have all sorts of cosmetic reasons
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:16.240]   and brain reasons and metabolic reasons
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:18.520]   for wanting to control this kind of stuff.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:20.120]   So let's make it really simple
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.300]   by first looking at the extremes.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.040]   Some people need to eat every two or three hours.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:27.280]   They feel this, "I need to eat every two or three hours
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.500]   or else their blood sugar drops."
[00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:33.320]   In general, blood sugar doesn't drop so low
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.820]   that they truly need to eat
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:37.560]   in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:38.760]   Although sometimes that can happen.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.440]   Some people are truly hypoglycemic, low blood sugar.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:45.920]   But most people, as the blood sugar starts to head down
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:49.560]   towards the low-ish ranges, ghrelin is secreted.
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:53.520]   And so for those people, not eating on the clock
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.900]   is very disruptive to them
[00:26:54.900 --> 00:26:57.480]   because it activates these neurons in the brain.
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.260]   For people who eat once a day or twice a day
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:03.200]   or tend to shift their meals, they might eat a lot,
[00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.960]   but during a limited so-called feeding window,
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:06.800]   it's kind of interesting,
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:09.920]   humans now eat and talk about foods in ways
[00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:13.040]   that for years I used to hear about in classes and courses
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:15.240]   and research lectures about feeding animals,
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:16.640]   restricted feeding windows.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.600]   And we owe a great deal of gratitude to Sachin Panda,
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.920]   who was a colleague of mine when my lab was in San Diego
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.440]   at the Salk Institute,
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.840]   who really is one of the pioneers
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.520]   of this restricted feeding window work
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:31.680]   and has done beautiful work.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.540]   He has a book that's excellent called "The Circadian Code"
[00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:35.720]   that I highly recommend.
[00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:37.580]   And he's done a lot of important work
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:40.360]   on neurons in the retina that control circadian timing,
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:41.480]   but also the relationship
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:44.240]   between feeding windows and health.
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:48.360]   And he's sort of the major proponent out there,
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.820]   among the major proponents I should say, of circadian eating,
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:52.920]   that means eating during the daytime, not at night,
[00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:54.060]   or intermittent fasting,
[00:27:54.060 --> 00:27:55.280]   restricting feeding windows
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.520]   to anywhere from four to six to eight hours.
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.720]   I'll use myself as an example
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:03.880]   of the transition from regular feeding schedule
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.040]   to a more intermittent-ish fasting,
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.160]   although I don't really fall into true intermittent fasting.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.240]   So I was one of these people that just got so accustomed
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:16.280]   to waking up and eating about an hour after I woke up,
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.480]   that to go from eating every three or four hours
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:21.920]   to eating twice a day, lunch and dinner,
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:23.800]   maybe a couple of snacks in the afternoon or something,
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.620]   at first was excruciating.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:26.600]   I remember thinking like,
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.800]   this is really brutal, pushing out, feeding.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:31.580]   I didn't think I could exercise unless I had eaten first.
[00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:35.440]   We now know that during most all forms of exercise,
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:38.300]   unless you're really focused on optimal performance,
[00:28:38.300 --> 00:28:39.720]   like you've got to hit key lifts,
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:42.900]   or you have to sprint at your maximum speed,
[00:28:42.900 --> 00:28:46.040]   and maybe even then, that you can exercise faster just fine
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.420]   because you're mainly relying on sources like glycogen
[00:28:49.420 --> 00:28:52.140]   from the liver, some undigested food sometimes,
[00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:53.840]   as gross as that might seem, it's true,
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:58.580]   as well as body fat if the exercise bout is extremely long.
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.780]   But what that means is that if you suddenly go
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:04.960]   from eating on a very regular schedule to skipping a meal
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:08.560]   or pushing your meal timing out or shifting it at all,
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.080]   you're going to have ghrelin in your system.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:12.640]   And that ghrelin is going to stimulate the desire to eat
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.400]   by acting at the level of your brain.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.140]   And it is indeed at that point, just mental.
[00:29:17.140 --> 00:29:18.680]   When we hear about just mental, just physical,
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.760]   it's really kind of the same thing
[00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:21.640]   'cause it's all chemicals, brain and body,
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:24.260]   but it's the stimulation of neurons that anticipate feeding.
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.660]   You're stimulating the arcuate nucleus neurons
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.260]   that make you want to eat those AGRP neurons.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.920]   So ghrelin stimulates the AGRP neurons,
[00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.560]   which makes you want to eat.
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.580]   So what can you do with this?
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:37.760]   What this means is if you want to start shifting
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.380]   your feeding schedule to one where you're not eating
[00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.120]   quite as frequently, and there are some advantages to that
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:46.560]   that aren't just in the biochemistry and health related,
[00:29:46.560 --> 00:29:48.620]   cellular health related things,
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.160]   but some of them include not having to think about
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.820]   or buy food, right?
[00:29:52.820 --> 00:29:54.800]   You actually don't have to think about food all day
[00:29:54.800 --> 00:29:56.440]   if you're not eating so often.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.160]   The other is it gives you a far more social flexibility,
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.000]   right?
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:02.740]   You can go to a noon meeting if you have to,
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.960]   or you can go out to dinner at a particular time.
[00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.540]   And I guess it makes it kind of tough
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.060]   if you want to meet somebody for breakfast,
[00:30:08.060 --> 00:30:09.860]   'cause then you're the dork who's just like
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:11.800]   sipping black coffee and like refusing everything.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.420]   But anyway, I've been that dork.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:17.320]   So it's one of those things you just kind of work with.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.960]   But the fact of the matter is ghrelin secretion
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.140]   because of its relationship to the nervous system
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:28.960]   can be shifted by about 45 minutes per day.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.080]   Now it's going to vary.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:33.160]   Some of you have more so-called willpower, you know,
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:35.840]   but if you really want to just start pushing
[00:30:35.840 --> 00:30:39.260]   that first meal out or shifting it in any direction,
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:40.900]   some people might want to eat in the early part of the day
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:42.020]   and not in the evening,
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.080]   trying to shift the meal times out,
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.780]   the spacing by about 45 minutes
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:50.360]   is what the neural circuits that link the ghrelin system
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:52.120]   to the neural circuits that control feeding
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.200]   really can handle, because it's a form of neuroplasticity.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.460]   And so what this would look like is
[00:30:56.460 --> 00:30:58.600]   if you normally you eat breakfast at eight o'clock,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:00.260]   plus or minus 20 minutes,
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.620]   and you want to start eating your first meal at noon,
[00:31:02.620 --> 00:31:04.260]   you would take maybe four or five days
[00:31:04.260 --> 00:31:05.480]   and just start pushing the meal out
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:07.740]   by about 45 minutes to an hour each day.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:09.600]   So it's not quite as painful.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.400]   Or you can just take the plunge and just do it all at once.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:16.120]   I have a colleague who was a neurosurgeon at Stanford,
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.040]   came up through my lab, he's now at Neuralink,
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:19.140]   and he has a great practice.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:21.400]   He keeps his ghrelin system at random.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.760]   What he does is he skips one meal per day,
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.200]   and he makes his external schedule dictate that.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:28.960]   So sometimes he skips breakfast.
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.080]   Sometimes he skips lunch.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.080]   Sometimes he skips dinner.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.840]   He just skips one of the three major meals per day.
[00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:34.760]   And in doing that,
[00:31:34.760 --> 00:31:37.760]   the ghrelin system is always kind of kept off kilter.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.200]   And it probably also allows him
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.020]   to have a lot of neural flexibility,
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:43.240]   what we call top-down control, just the knowledge,
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:47.160]   oh, the hunger I'm feeling isn't necessarily hypoglycemia.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:49.420]   And in his case, it's almost certainly not.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.640]   And therefore, what I'm feeling here
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.200]   is an activation of these AGRP neurons,
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.020]   and therefore I can push my meal schedule
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.640]   around however I want.
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:31:59.600]   Now, I should mention that top-down mechanisms
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.080]   are powerful, belief, motivation.
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:03.980]   These things can really shift neural circuits.
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:06.540]   We're going to talk more about that a little bit later.
[00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:10.300]   But there are also people who are genuinely hypoglycemic
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:11.720]   and that need to take really good control
[00:32:11.720 --> 00:32:13.980]   of their blood sugar levels and try and keep them stable.
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:15.360]   And so, of course,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:17.180]   you want to do what's medically safe for you.
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.460]   I'm not at all recommending that people
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.300]   that suffer from hypoglycemia suddenly
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.280]   disrupt their blood sugar patterns in any direction.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:26.480]   That wouldn't be healthy.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.540]   But for most people out there
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.740]   who have reasonable blood glucose levels,
[00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.280]   it's kind of interesting and kind of fun
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:33.760]   to play with these parameters
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:35.600]   in order to optimize what you want to do.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   And sometimes that might change
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.280]   across the year with schedules.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.200]   Many people find great benefit in having flexibility
[00:32:42.200 --> 00:32:43.580]   over when they eat.
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:47.040]   Regularity of eating equals regularity of ghrelin secretion
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.080]   equals regularity of activity of these AGRP neurons,
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:53.220]   meaning you will be hungry at very regular intervals.
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.500]   So that's something that you can work with.
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:57.140]   It's grounded in deep mechanism of hormone
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.620]   and neural systems.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:00.380]   And there's a lot of modern research
[00:33:00.380 --> 00:33:02.180]   to support what I just said.
[00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.460]   So if MSH inhibits feeding, makes us want to eat less,
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:10.140]   and ghrelin makes us want to eat more,
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:14.680]   there's another hormone called CCK, cholecystokinin,
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:19.460]   that is potent in reducing our levels of hunger.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.300]   Now, I learned about CCK back when I was an undergraduate,
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   so well over 20 years ago, when it was first discovered,
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.440]   and there was a lot of excitement about CCK at that point
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:32.460]   as a diet drug.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:34.940]   Anytime there's a molecule or a chemical
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:38.500]   discovered in the brain or body that can suppress feeding,
[00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.900]   the diet industry just goes wild.
[00:33:40.900 --> 00:33:42.200]   They think, okay, this is going to be the thing
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:45.300]   that's going to allow people to move from being obese
[00:33:45.300 --> 00:33:48.820]   to losing all sorts of unhealthy weight, et cetera.
[00:33:48.820 --> 00:33:51.700]   A similar phenomenon was observed with leptin.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:55.580]   Leptin is a hormone that's made by body fat
[00:33:55.580 --> 00:33:58.840]   that signals to the brain when there's a lot of body fat,
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:01.100]   and in animals, injections of leptin
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:02.860]   can make fat animals thin.
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:05.800]   They lose a lot of adipose or fat.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.980]   In humans, it didn't work out that way.
[00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.020]   It just, the studies were done,
[00:34:10.020 --> 00:34:12.820]   and leptin was successful in treating a certain rare form
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:15.480]   of diabetes, but it really wasn't very potent
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:17.340]   as an anti-obesity drug.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:22.340]   Similarly, CCK has been looked at as an obesity drug,
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:25.520]   something to reduce obesity,
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.120]   but it had some pretty unhappy side effects,
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:31.400]   actually caused some pretty serious side effects.
[00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.300]   Now that's as a drug.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:38.300]   However, CCK, when released at normal levels by your gut,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:42.160]   has a powerful effect in suppressing appetite
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:43.500]   for a period of time,
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:48.400]   and there are healthy and direct ways to activate CCK.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:52.060]   Now, CCK is in the GI tract.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:53.900]   It's released from the GI tract,
[00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:56.640]   and its release is governed by two things.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:59.920]   One is a subset of very specialized neurons
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.640]   that detect what's in the gut,
[00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:04.240]   the specific contents of the gut,
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.500]   and by certain elements of the mucosa,
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.240]   the mucus lining of the gut and the gut microbiome.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:16.240]   So what's really interesting is that CCK is stimulated
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:20.480]   by fatty acids and particular fatty acids
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:23.540]   that we'll talk about, amino acids,
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.480]   and particular amino acids that we'll talk about,
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.920]   as well as by sugar.
[00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:31.040]   Now let's put sugar on the shelf for a moment.
[00:35:31.040 --> 00:35:32.680]   We're going to talk a lot about sugar
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:37.680]   because if CCK inhibits appetite and reduces feeding,
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:42.160]   and it can be triggered by fatty acids, amino acids,
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:43.860]   or sugars, then you might say,
[00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:45.380]   well, then eating a lot of sugar
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.240]   should make us not want to eat more,
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:49.180]   but we all know that eating sugar
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:52.120]   makes us want to eat far more.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:53.980]   That's the role of a lot of sugars,
[00:35:53.980 --> 00:35:55.720]   and that has to do with a separate mechanism
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.500]   we'll talk about today.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:02.100]   So which fatty acids in the gut stimulate the release of CCK?
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:04.760]   It turns out it's the omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:08.160]   the ones that come from algae or krill or fish oil.
[00:36:08.160 --> 00:36:10.840]   I talked about this in the episode on nutrition
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:13.720]   and some of the things related to the gut microbiome,
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:15.420]   but I'm going to revisit that now.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:21.380]   Omega-3 fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid, CLA,
[00:36:21.380 --> 00:36:24.400]   either from food or from supplements,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.520]   stimulate the release of CCK,
[00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:29.780]   which then reduces or at least blunts appetite.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.360]   And I'm not talking about blunting appetite to anorexic
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.920]   levels where you don't want to eat at all.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:36.440]   I'm talking about regulating appetite to the point where
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.600]   animals and people don't over-consume.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:40.960]   So it's keeping appetite at a healthy level.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.700]   The other thing that stimulates CCK that I mentioned
[00:36:44.700 --> 00:36:46.180]   are amino acids.
[00:36:46.180 --> 00:36:49.380]   So when we eat, we have the ability to break down
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:53.860]   different macronutrients, you know, carbohydrates,
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.060]   fats, or proteins into sugars and glucose
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:36:59.980]   that then we can convert to ATP and all that stuff
[00:36:59.980 --> 00:37:01.420]   from the Krebs cycle from high school.
[00:37:01.420 --> 00:37:02.500]   We're not going to go into that today.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.140]   That's for a future episode.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:07.420]   But amino acids are one of the things
[00:37:07.420 --> 00:37:09.120]   that we are eating for.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:12.720]   Amino acids both can be used as energy
[00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:15.160]   through a process called gluconeogenesis
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:17.360]   of converting proteins into energy,
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.840]   or those amino acids can be broken down
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.940]   and then rebuilt into things like preparing, excuse me,
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:24.160]   repairing muscle tissue,
[00:37:24.160 --> 00:37:26.440]   as well as other forms of cellular repair.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.760]   They're involved in all sorts of things related
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.640]   to protein synthesis.
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:31.240]   What does this mean?
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:35.100]   If we eat the proper amino acids at the proper levels,
[00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:38.740]   if we ingest omega-3s and CLAs, conjugated linoleic acids
[00:37:38.740 --> 00:37:41.520]   at the proper levels, or get them from supplements,
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.400]   there's a blunting of appetite.
[00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:46.480]   Appetite is kept clamped and we don't become hyperphagic.
[00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:47.560]   We don't overeat.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.600]   We tend to eat within healthy or normal ranges.
[00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:55.020]   So this is very important because most people
[00:37:55.020 --> 00:37:57.520]   don't understand that when we're eating,
[00:37:57.520 --> 00:38:02.020]   we are basically fat foraging and amino acid foraging.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.600]   And there are several studies now have shown
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:07.160]   that people and animals will essentially eat
[00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:11.540]   until they feel they've consumed enough omega-3s,
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:15.640]   omega-6s, CLAs, and certain amino acids.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.540]   In other words, even if it's not conscious,
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:21.780]   we are eating until we trigger the activation of CCK.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:23.920]   Now, there are other reasons why we shut down eating too,
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:28.060]   are literally the volume of food in our gut can be large
[00:38:28.060 --> 00:38:29.980]   and we can feel very distended.
[00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.420]   That's the physical reason, obviously.
[00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:34.820]   There are other reasons.
[00:38:34.820 --> 00:38:37.000]   Maybe we just have top-down control.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:39.960]   We have knowledge that this is the end of the meal
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:41.340]   and we stop 'cause we have to go back to work
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.480]   or to a meeting, or we tell ourselves that we've had enough.
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:48.040]   But at a subconscious level,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.140]   the gut is informing the brain via CCK and other mechanisms
[00:38:52.140 --> 00:38:54.420]   when we've ingested enough of what we need.
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.380]   And these omega-3s and CLAs and certain amino acids
[00:38:58.380 --> 00:39:00.680]   are vital for sending out that signal
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:01.800]   that we've had enough.
[00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.600]   Now, which amino acids is actually really interesting?
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:05.860]   We have essential amino acids
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:07.980]   and we have non-essential amino acids.
[00:39:07.980 --> 00:39:11.620]   Among the essential amino acids, there's one in particular
[00:39:11.620 --> 00:39:14.740]   that can trigger the release of CCK very potently,
[00:39:14.740 --> 00:39:16.700]   and that's glutamine.
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:19.220]   Glutamine is a very interesting amino acid.
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:22.220]   First of all, it's been shown in a few studies
[00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:25.340]   to play a role in bolstering the immune system.
[00:39:25.340 --> 00:39:27.340]   It can increase the number of killer cells
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.380]   in the immune system.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:31.560]   It is consumed in supplement form.
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:33.540]   People can take a teaspoon of glutamine,
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:35.740]   or some people take glutamine throughout the day
[00:39:35.740 --> 00:39:37.980]   if they're really into it, or for whatever reason,
[00:39:37.980 --> 00:39:39.540]   they think they're battling off an infection
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.060]   or something of that sort.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:43.580]   Glutamine can also, of course, be derived from foods.
[00:39:43.580 --> 00:39:45.940]   And you can just put into the internet,
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.380]   do an internet search and find out
[00:39:47.380 --> 00:39:48.740]   what foods are rich with glutamine.
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:51.140]   Some of the ones that I'm aware of off the top of my head
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.180]   are like cottage cheese and things of that sort,
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:55.140]   but other foods have glutamine as well.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:59.100]   Once a threshold level of glutamine
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:01.420]   and other essential amino acids are reached,
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:04.420]   once a threshold level of these alpha three,
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:07.620]   excuse me, omega-3 fatty acids and CLAs are reached,
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:11.640]   CCK is released, and it helps reduce the activity
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.900]   of those AGRP neurons that promote feeding.
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:16.860]   So as you can see, feeding is an interplay
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:18.420]   between brain and body,
[00:40:18.420 --> 00:40:20.100]   and it's some of the micronutrients
[00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.160]   and even the breakdown of particular nutrients
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:24.100]   that's putting the accelerator
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.040]   or the brake on the feeding process.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.700]   It's not just one thing.
[00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:29.620]   So from an actionable standpoint,
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:34.060]   you, we should probably all be trying to get
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:37.460]   our omega-3, omega-6 ratios correct anyway,
[00:40:37.460 --> 00:40:39.180]   because they are antidepressant.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:41.720]   I talked about the peer-reviewed studies on that.
[00:40:41.720 --> 00:40:44.020]   They are healthy for the gut microbiome,
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:47.420]   and we should be seeking sufficient glutamine.
[00:40:47.420 --> 00:40:49.060]   Now, whether or not you decide to supplement
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:50.920]   with glutamine or not is up to you.
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:55.060]   One of the reasons why one might want to do that,
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.840]   and again, you should always check with a doctor,
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:59.280]   especially if you have any predisposition to cancers
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:03.620]   or you have cancer, many cancers and tumors like glutamine.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:04.980]   So that's something to note,
[00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:07.620]   but one reason why you might want to supplement
[00:41:07.620 --> 00:41:09.580]   with glutamine or consider eating foods
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:10.660]   that are rich in glutamine
[00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.700]   isn't just to keep your appetite in healthy ranges,
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:18.500]   but as well, glutamine can actually reduce sugar cravings.
[00:41:18.500 --> 00:41:19.940]   So this is very interesting.
[00:41:19.940 --> 00:41:20.780]   I have a friend,
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.980]   he's an absolute chocolate sweets addict.
[00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:26.940]   He's a grown adult, but he eats candy and chocolate
[00:41:26.940 --> 00:41:29.820]   as if he was like a 14-year-old kid
[00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:31.620]   hanging out at the local convenience store.
[00:41:31.620 --> 00:41:33.280]   It's really incredible.
[00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.940]   And he has probably a sugar addiction,
[00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:38.060]   but he's very aware of this,
[00:41:38.060 --> 00:41:40.380]   and he's managed to kick all other addictions.
[00:41:40.380 --> 00:41:43.400]   So for whatever reason, it stimulates his brain and body
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.880]   in the ways that make him want more, but he hates this.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.900]   It's actually quite frustrating for him.
[00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:50.160]   He's somebody who cares a lot about his health.
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:53.400]   He took the approach that I know many other people have
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:55.180]   who know about this role of glutamine
[00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:58.760]   of taking a teaspoon or a couple teaspoons of glutamine
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.060]   several times throughout the day
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.620]   or any time he craves sugar.
[00:42:02.620 --> 00:42:05.940]   And indeed, glutamine will reduce sugar cravings.
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.560]   Some people who are really on the kind of ketogenic front
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:11.120]   will mix it with a little bit of half-and-half,
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:13.040]   and down that, because I guess it makes it taste better,
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:14.320]   it's a little bit chalky.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:16.800]   So glutamine has some very interesting properties,
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.680]   but I think for most people that aren't suffering
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:20.900]   from adverse levels of craving,
[00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.440]   making sure you're getting the right omega-3s,
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:26.480]   that can come from a variety of sources.
[00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:29.540]   Check out the episode we did on nutrition
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.920]   if you want to learn more about that, and CLAs,
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.040]   and making sure that you're getting enough glutamine
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.440]   is going to be important for making sure
[00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:39.220]   that the CCK signal gets through.
[00:42:39.220 --> 00:42:41.100]   The one thing I do want to mention about glutamine,
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:46.100]   it's a minor effect, but it alone can have a small increase,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:49.180]   excuse me, it alone can increase blood sugar.
[00:42:49.180 --> 00:42:51.360]   It's not a huge increase in blood glucose,
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.540]   but because the gut takes proteins
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.620]   and breaks them down into these amino acids
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:42:58.460]   and essentially looking for glutamine and things like it,
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:00.280]   other essential amino acids as well,
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.940]   when you ingest glutamine or branched-chain amino acids,
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:08.820]   there is a small but real increase in blood glucose,
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:11.300]   and that's because they are essentially food,
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.380]   and there I'm talking about the supplemental version.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:17.660]   So just know, glutamine can increase blood sugar slightly,
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:19.380]   especially diabetics should know that.
[00:43:19.380 --> 00:43:21.520]   It can reduce sugar cravings,
[00:43:21.520 --> 00:43:25.060]   and just know that what your gut is doing at a core level
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:26.580]   is it's forging, it's waiting,
[00:43:26.580 --> 00:43:29.620]   and it's trying to assess levels of omega-3 fatty acids,
[00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.460]   conjugated linoleic acid,
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:33.360]   and glutamine and other essential amino acids.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:37.020]   You are essentially trying to eat to get these nutrients,
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:39.360]   and then a signal can be deployed up to your brain
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.900]   that you're not really interested in eating that much more.
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:45.060]   Whenever preparing an episode for this podcast,
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.260]   I'm always faced with a particular challenge,
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:49.440]   which is how many tools should I offer
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:51.620]   that involve doing something new,
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:53.820]   you know, a new behavior or a new exercise,
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.860]   supplements, something, things of that sort,
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:43:58.860]   and how many should be related to not doing things,
[00:43:58.860 --> 00:43:59.680]   avoiding things.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.380]   It's never really fun to talk about all the things
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:02.540]   that we're supposed to avoid,
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.780]   but some of them are so powerful
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:08.120]   in light of the mechanisms of a given topic
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.980]   that I'd be remiss if I didn't mention them.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.220]   So now you understand how hormones and peptides
[00:44:14.220 --> 00:44:16.800]   like CCK and ghrelin impact appetite.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:20.600]   There's one particular aspect of food
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.740]   that can powerfully impact CCK,
[00:44:22.740 --> 00:44:26.140]   and I think most people, I'm guessing 99.9% of people
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.300]   out there are not aware of this,
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.940]   and it has to do with highly processed foods.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:32.700]   There's a lot of reasons why one would want
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:34.980]   to avoid highly processed foods.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:36.560]   In fact, if you're interested in that topic
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.860]   and the history of whole foods
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.900]   transitioning to highly processed foods in this country,
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.780]   I highly recommend you listen to a YouTube video
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.460]   by Dr. Robert Lustig.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:47.500]   He's at University of California, San Francisco.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:48.580]   It's very easy to find.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:50.480]   Put Stanford, Robert Lustig.
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:52.380]   It was a talk hosted by Stanford.
[00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:55.540]   Gives a beautiful description of the history of this
[00:44:55.540 --> 00:44:58.140]   and why the food industry started packing in
[00:44:58.140 --> 00:44:59.780]   additional sugars and salts
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:01.700]   and turning foods into commodities.
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.420]   It's really fascinating.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:04.780]   It has no conspiracy theory.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:06.540]   It's just all scientific facts.
[00:45:06.540 --> 00:45:07.940]   It's really a wonderful lecture.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:09.340]   It has millions of views.
[00:45:09.340 --> 00:45:11.340]   Should be very easy to find.
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.460]   We can provide a link to that, and we will.
[00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:16.140]   There's another reason to avoid
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.220]   highly processed foods, however,
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:22.020]   and that has to do with what's called emulsifiers.
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:23.940]   Now, many of you are familiar with emulsifiers,
[00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:25.220]   even though you don't know it.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:28.180]   When you put detergent in the laundry,
[00:45:28.180 --> 00:45:31.100]   that contains emulsifiers.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.620]   The goal of that detergent is to bring together
[00:45:33.620 --> 00:45:36.220]   fatty molecules with water molecules
[00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:38.420]   and be able to dissociate them and break them up
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:41.220]   to get the stains out of clothes and things of that sort.
[00:45:41.220 --> 00:45:46.540]   There are a lot of emulsifiers put into processed foods,
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.760]   and those emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.120]   to occur that extends the shelf life of those foods.
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:54.540]   So it's like candy bars and cereals
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:57.520]   and all sorts of things that are in processed foods,
[00:45:57.520 --> 00:46:00.340]   the worst of which are the typical kind of pastries
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:01.540]   that you see at the convenience store,
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.500]   but this extends into chips of various kinds
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:06.380]   and even some meats of various kinds.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.700]   They pack this stuff into meats.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:10.560]   They have names like soy lecithin and other things.
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:12.460]   Why are emulsifiers bad?
[00:46:12.460 --> 00:46:14.000]   Okay, there are a lot of reasons why they're bad,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.340]   but the reason why they're bad for the mechanisms
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.980]   that we've been talking about today
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.380]   is that when you ingest those foods,
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.100]   you're bringing those emulsifiers into your gut,
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.100]   and those emulsifiers strip away
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:28.220]   the mucosal lining of the gut,
[00:46:28.220 --> 00:46:31.540]   and they actually cause the neurons that innervate the gut
[00:46:31.540 --> 00:46:33.060]   that extend those little processes
[00:46:33.060 --> 00:46:37.620]   we call axons into the gut to retract deeper into the gut,
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:40.780]   and as a consequence, you're ingesting a bunch of food,
[00:46:40.780 --> 00:46:43.900]   and the signals like CCK never get deployed.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:46.220]   The signals that actually shut down hunger
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:47.640]   are never actually triggered,
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.940]   and so as a consequence, you want to eat far more
[00:46:49.940 --> 00:46:51.680]   of these highly processed foods.
[00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.580]   In addition, if you then go
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:55.400]   from eating a highly processed food
[00:46:55.400 --> 00:46:57.420]   to non-highly processed foods,
[00:46:57.420 --> 00:47:01.220]   you're not able to measure the amounts of amino acids,
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.460]   sugars, and fatty acids in those foods as accurately.
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:07.760]   You've actually done structural damage at a micro level,
[00:47:07.760 --> 00:47:11.820]   but structural damage to the mucosal lining of the gut.
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:13.140]   Now, this can all be repaired
[00:47:13.140 --> 00:47:14.980]   if you stay away from highly processed foods
[00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.260]   for some period of time,
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.500]   but the negative effects of these emulsifiers
[00:47:18.500 --> 00:47:22.340]   are quite real, so to make it really clean and simple,
[00:47:22.340 --> 00:47:25.660]   emulsifiers from highly processed foods
[00:47:25.660 --> 00:47:27.620]   are limiting your gut's ability
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.420]   to detect what's in the foods you eat
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.800]   and therefore to deploy the satiety signals,
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.680]   the signals that shut down hunger.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.700]   In addition to that, there's a parallel mechanism at play
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.540]   that I talked about in a previous episode,
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:41.380]   but I'll remind you again that you have neurons in your gut
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:45.960]   that are sensing sugar and are sending a subconscious signal
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:48.360]   up to the brain via the vagus nerve,
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:52.300]   and those neurons trigger the release of dopamine,
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:54.100]   which makes you crave more of that food.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.340]   So now you've got parallel signals
[00:47:56.340 --> 00:47:58.240]   making you want to eat more sugar,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.420]   making you unaware of how much sugar you've eaten
[00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:04.580]   and that are disrupting the inputs to the nervous system
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.360]   that signal to the rest of your brain and body
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.420]   that you've obtained enough fatty acids
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.940]   and you've obtained enough amino acids.
[00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:14.020]   So these highly processed foods are really terrible,
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.140]   and I'm not out here to say
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.540]   never enjoy a processed food of any kind.
[00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:20.840]   I'd be a hypocrite 'cause I do eat processed foods
[00:48:20.840 --> 00:48:23.140]   from time to time, although the ones that I tend to eat,
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.760]   I try and make of the healthier variety,
[00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.840]   but eating whole foods has tremendous value
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:29.700]   and eating highly processed food
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.860]   has tremendous negative impact on the gut
[00:48:32.860 --> 00:48:34.500]   and on the gut-brain axis.
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.900]   And so recently there was a paper
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:38.700]   that came out in Cell, Cell Press Journal.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:41.980]   It's kind of the apex of cell journals, which is phenomenal.
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.580]   This paper showed that ingesting highly processed food
[00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:49.400]   leads to more intake of not just highly processed foods,
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.820]   but other types of food in general.
[00:48:51.820 --> 00:48:54.080]   There was kind of an overeating compensation
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.720]   generally across foods
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.700]   for people that consume these highly processed foods.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:58.860]   And there are a lot of other reasons
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.420]   to avoid highly processed foods.
[00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:02.940]   So again, I don't like to focus too much on the do nots.
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.320]   I like to arm you with tools to do,
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:08.040]   but I think this visual of certain foods
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.160]   and these emulsifiers actually stripping away
[00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:12.540]   some of the critical lining of your gut
[00:49:12.540 --> 00:49:14.280]   and disrupting the hormone signaling
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.420]   to the brain controlling feeding is important enough
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:21.020]   and cryptic enough, meaning it hasn't been talked about,
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.080]   it works at a subconscious level,
[00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:25.960]   and that it's important that people are aware of it
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:27.900]   so they can make decisions about what they do want to eat
[00:49:27.900 --> 00:49:29.900]   or not want to eat for themselves.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:31.980]   Before moving on, I just want to say one more thing
[00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:34.220]   about highly processed foods.
[00:49:34.220 --> 00:49:36.800]   There was an absolutely beautiful study
[00:49:36.800 --> 00:49:39.220]   done by my colleague, Chris Garner at Stanford,
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:41.140]   exploring whether or not certain diets
[00:49:41.140 --> 00:49:42.180]   were better than others.
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:45.880]   They looked at vegan, vegetarian, omnivore.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:47.820]   I don't know if they looked at all meat or not,
[00:49:47.820 --> 00:49:49.340]   but they looked at the different forms of diets,
[00:49:49.340 --> 00:49:50.780]   intermittent fasting, et cetera.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.180]   And they essentially found that whichever diet
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.220]   people adhered to, whichever one they followed,
[00:49:57.220 --> 00:50:00.380]   was equivalent to the others provided that they followed it,
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.440]   they lost the equivalent amount of weight.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:06.260]   There really wasn't a strong effect of the food type
[00:50:06.260 --> 00:50:08.240]   or the pattern of eating, et cetera.
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:09.900]   However, in a study like that,
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:12.900]   adherence is very high because people are a part of a study.
[00:50:12.900 --> 00:50:15.900]   And for many people, the ability to adhere
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.020]   to a certain eating plan is one of the most,
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:21.440]   if not the most powerful determinants
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:23.100]   of whether or not a given diet,
[00:50:23.100 --> 00:50:25.520]   meaning nutritional plan, works.
[00:50:25.520 --> 00:50:28.400]   Now, this thing about highly processed foods, however,
[00:50:28.400 --> 00:50:32.180]   is really diabolical because it truly says,
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:35.020]   and I think the recent data in cell metabolism
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:36.500]   and other journals really proves
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:38.540]   that a calorie is not a calorie.
[00:50:38.540 --> 00:50:41.060]   That's absolutely absurd because of these emulsifiers
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:44.300]   and the content of these highly processed foods.
[00:50:44.300 --> 00:50:47.820]   In fact, the data in humans points to this.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:50.740]   So what they did is they took inpatient adults,
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:52.980]   so they had total control over their food intake,
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:55.180]   and they received either ultra-processed
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:58.400]   or unprocessed diets for 14 days as a short study.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:02.140]   The diets were matched for calories, sugar, fat, fiber,
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:04.140]   and macronutrients, so everything else was matched.
[00:51:04.140 --> 00:51:08.740]   Just processed or non-processed is the major variable.
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:12.360]   And basically what they found is that the people
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.580]   who were eating the processed food diet
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.840]   happened to eat much more, right?
[00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.340]   This was after this period of putting them on either diet
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:21.260]   and clamping for all other variables.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:23.060]   Then they would eat much more,
[00:51:23.060 --> 00:51:25.140]   and the body weight changes were much more.
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:28.780]   And those body weight changes were such
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:30.020]   that they couldn't be accounted for
[00:51:30.020 --> 00:51:31.660]   by just increased calories.
[00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:34.680]   So the bottom line is that highly processed foods
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:35.560]   are just bad for you.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.920]   They increase weight gain.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:38.700]   They disrupt the lining of your gut
[00:51:38.700 --> 00:51:40.980]   in a way that disrupts things like CCK
[00:51:40.980 --> 00:51:42.680]   and proper satiety signals.
[00:51:42.680 --> 00:51:46.180]   And they contain a bunch of things, in particular sugars,
[00:51:46.180 --> 00:51:47.620]   but other things as well,
[00:51:47.620 --> 00:51:50.000]   that disrupt not just the hormonal systems,
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.480]   but also the neural systems that control the desire to eat
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:55.120]   after the diet is done.
[00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:56.540]   So there's just so many reasons
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.560]   why these highly processed foods are terrible,
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.820]   and they can explain a lot of the ill health effects
[00:52:01.820 --> 00:52:03.860]   that we've seen in the last 50 years,
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:05.780]   not just in the United States, but all over the world.
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:09.160]   The enormous increase in diabetes, juvenile diabetes.
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:14.080]   It's just remarkable how far down the path of dad,
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   we've gone, and it's clear,
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:18.560]   it's almost a smoking gun what the cause of this is.
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:20.360]   If you'd like to learn more about that,
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.160]   please refer to the Lustig lecture.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:27.080]   He also spells out why non-processed foods
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:30.640]   is far more economical in terms of just at the level
[00:52:30.640 --> 00:52:32.020]   of the household or individual,
[00:52:32.020 --> 00:52:33.820]   as well as at the societal level.
[00:52:33.820 --> 00:52:34.820]   Really interesting stuff.
[00:52:34.820 --> 00:52:36.520]   I highly recommend you check it out.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.440]   So now let's move on to some other hormones
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:43.200]   that regulate hunger and satiety, in particular insulin.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.140]   Now you've probably heard of insulin before.
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:48.540]   Insulin is the thing that's lacking in type one diabetics.
[00:52:48.540 --> 00:52:50.740]   That's why they have to inject insulin whenever they eat.
[00:52:50.740 --> 00:52:53.320]   The reason they have to do that is because when they eat,
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.820]   their foods are broken down into glucose.
[00:52:55.820 --> 00:52:57.580]   And in order to shuttle glucose
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:59.660]   to the appropriate tissues in the body,
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:03.380]   and also to keep glucose levels in check, you need insulin.
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.900]   So the simplest way to think about insulin and glucose
[00:53:06.900 --> 00:53:11.180]   is that when you eat, that food is broken down into sugars.
[00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:15.360]   That's true whether or not it's fats or it's sugars,
[00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:17.880]   or eventually if it's proteins,
[00:53:17.880 --> 00:53:20.300]   they are oxidized into fuels, as we say.
[00:53:20.300 --> 00:53:24.960]   And those fuels can be used, as the name fuel implies,
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:27.220]   into energy, they're eventually made into ATP.
[00:53:27.220 --> 00:53:28.380]   There's a bunch of biochemical steps
[00:53:28.380 --> 00:53:29.840]   that we're not going to go into today,
[00:53:29.840 --> 00:53:30.820]   but that's essentially how it works.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:32.800]   You break down food into glucose.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.960]   Now, if you're ketogenic,
[00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:36.080]   we'll talk about that in a little bit,
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:40.440]   but in general, you eat, food is turned into glucose.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:44.360]   Your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range.
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:48.540]   Hypoglycemic means too low, hyperglycemic means too high,
[00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:53.520]   and what they call the euglycemic, EU glycemic,
[00:53:53.520 --> 00:53:55.840]   is the healthy range.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:58.200]   Now, what those healthy ranges are,
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:02.140]   in general, the healthy range, the euglycemic range,
[00:54:02.140 --> 00:54:06.360]   is about 70 to 100 nanograms per deciliter,
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:07.600]   but most of you aren't walking around
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.920]   with a glucose monitor.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:12.080]   Some of you are, but most of you are not.
[00:54:12.080 --> 00:54:14.480]   The more important question for us to address right now
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:16.480]   is why is it important that glucose
[00:54:16.480 --> 00:54:18.040]   be kept at a particular level?
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:21.960]   Once you understand that, keeping glucose in check
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.200]   starts to have a rationale behind it,
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.320]   and the ways to do that start to make a lot more sense.
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:32.320]   So the reason is, if glucose levels get too high
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:35.920]   because of the way that our cells, in particular neurons,
[00:54:35.920 --> 00:54:40.400]   interact with glucose, high levels of glucose
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.520]   can damage neurons, it can actually kill them.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.920]   You can start getting what are called peripheral,
[00:54:44.920 --> 00:54:46.640]   excuse me, neuropathies.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:49.120]   One of the symptoms of some forms of diabetes
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:52.600]   is that people start losing the sensation of touch
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:55.040]   in their fingers or their hands or their feet,
[00:54:55.040 --> 00:54:56.560]   and they can start going blind.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:59.640]   There's diabetic retinopathies.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:02.320]   So it's very important that insulin
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:04.600]   manage your glucose levels.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.680]   Now, there's also type 2 diabetes
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:10.900]   where there's insulin secreted from the pancreas,
[00:55:10.900 --> 00:55:13.500]   but people are insulin insensitive.
[00:55:13.500 --> 00:55:15.680]   There's a disruption in the receptors,
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.200]   and insulin insensitivity
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.760]   isn't quite the same as having no insulin at all,
[00:55:20.760 --> 00:55:22.920]   but it parallels some of the same mechanisms.
[00:55:22.920 --> 00:55:25.040]   Now, type 1 diabetes is often picked up
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:28.520]   because someone has a sudden weight loss
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:30.380]   because they're not processing blood sugar
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:31.600]   the same way they were before.
[00:55:31.600 --> 00:55:34.500]   Type 2 diabetes is often, although not always,
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:37.960]   associated with being overweight and with obesity.
[00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:40.820]   Both of them are challenging conditions.
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:43.440]   Type 2 diabetes almost always can be managed
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:45.600]   by managing one's weight.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:50.040]   And of course, there are prescription drugs
[00:55:50.040 --> 00:55:51.860]   and supplements that can help manage those.
[00:55:51.860 --> 00:55:53.640]   We're going to talk about all of that.
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.200]   But for most people that don't have diabetes,
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:58.080]   the important thing is to manage glucose,
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:01.200]   to keep it in that euglycemic range.
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.460]   And there are a number of different ways to do that.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.880]   Some of them are behavioral, some of them are diet-based,
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:09.040]   and some of them are based
[00:56:09.040 --> 00:56:10.680]   on supplements or prescription drugs.
[00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:12.160]   So let's talk about those now.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:15.920]   So if you eat, and in particular, if you eat carbohydrates,
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:17.320]   blood glucose goes up.
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:20.640]   If you eat fats, blood glucose goes up to a far less degree.
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:23.920]   And if you eat proteins, depending on the protein,
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:26.120]   it'll eventually be broken down for fuel
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:29.400]   or assembled into amino acid chains for protein synthesis
[00:56:29.400 --> 00:56:32.600]   and repair of other tissues and bodily functions.
[00:56:32.600 --> 00:56:37.300]   But glucose goes up and then is kept in range.
[00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:40.700]   When you are hungry, you secrete a different hormone,
[00:56:40.700 --> 00:56:42.440]   and that's called glucagon.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:47.440]   And glucagon's main role is to pull stores of energy
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:50.820]   out of the liver and the muscles.
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.820]   And once those are depleted,
[00:56:52.820 --> 00:56:55.680]   you'll eventually tap into body fat, okay?
[00:56:55.680 --> 00:56:56.740]   So, and this is for people
[00:56:56.740 --> 00:56:58.500]   that have a typical blood glucose range,
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:02.080]   so that 70 to 100 euglycemic range.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:05.320]   So the two kind of push and pull systems
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.480]   that we're going to think about now to keep this simple
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.320]   is that you have the insulin system managing glucose,
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:14.520]   and you've got the glucagon system pulling energy
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:18.200]   out of your liver and muscles for immediate fuel,
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:22.440]   and eventually you'll pull fuel out of body fat
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.200]   if you've been active for a very long time
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.460]   and all your glycogen stores are depleted
[00:57:26.460 --> 00:57:28.360]   or close to depleted.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.960]   So what does this all mean?
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.600]   There's a lot of important biochemistry
[00:57:32.600 --> 00:57:34.720]   and a lot of important cellular processes involved
[00:57:34.720 --> 00:57:37.140]   in whether or not you're anabolic or catabolic,
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.420]   whether or not you're breaking things down
[00:57:38.420 --> 00:57:39.520]   or building things up.
[00:57:39.520 --> 00:57:44.340]   Let's talk about feeding in a simpler way, however,
[00:57:44.340 --> 00:57:47.560]   and let's weave the tools to manage blood glucose
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.240]   to keep it in check as we do that.
[00:57:50.240 --> 00:57:52.280]   So let's say you had a meal,
[00:57:52.280 --> 00:57:56.220]   and that meal consisted of rice, a carbohydrate,
[00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:00.700]   some meat or fish, let's say a piece of salmon,
[00:58:00.700 --> 00:58:02.840]   and some vegetable, some fibrous vegetable
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.240]   like asparagus or cabbage or something like that.
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:09.020]   If you were to eat all of that at once,
[00:58:09.020 --> 00:58:10.900]   you take a bite of one, a bite of the other,
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:12.520]   you mix it up, one of these,
[00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.520]   it all ends up in the same place kind of people,
[00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:15.980]   mix it all up,
[00:58:15.980 --> 00:58:18.520]   then you will experience an increase in insulin
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:23.400]   and increase in blood glucose that's moderately fast.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.760]   It's going to increase pretty quickly.
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:28.820]   What's remarkable is that the order that you consume
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:31.360]   each macronutrient has a pretty profound influence
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:36.360]   on the rate of insulin and glucose secretion into the blood
[00:58:36.360 --> 00:58:39.000]   and how quickly those levels rise.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.140]   So if you, we'll make it really simple,
[00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:42.520]   if you were to eat the rice first,
[00:58:42.520 --> 00:58:44.920]   your glucose would rise in a sharp spike,
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.680]   especially if it doesn't contain any fats
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:48.540]   to slow the absorption.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:51.480]   Now, that might be good if you're very hungry
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:53.880]   and you want to get an increase in glucose.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:56.840]   In fact, this is the reason why you're often served bread
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:58:58.660]   before meals because it's,
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:59:00.540]   and sometimes it's bread and butter,
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:02.840]   but, or chips before meals or appetizer
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:05.120]   are designed to get your blood glucose going up high
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:07.880]   because big steep increases in blood glucose
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:12.240]   tend to promote the desire to consume more glucose.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.800]   And this also relates to the dopamine system
[00:59:14.800 --> 00:59:17.060]   and the way that something tasty in the mouth
[00:59:17.060 --> 00:59:20.740]   and sugar in the gut and fats and sugars in the mouth
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:23.400]   trigger the activation of a lot of systems
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:26.380]   in the brain and body to consume more of whatever you have
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:28.520]   or whatever is available to you.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:33.100]   So the basic idea is that eating carbohydrates
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:35.040]   and or fats early in a meal
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:37.320]   will give a steep rise in blood glucose.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.960]   However, if you were to eat the fibrous thing first,
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:43.520]   so a lot of chewing, but not a big rise in blood glucose,
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.440]   'cause in general there's,
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:45.920]   unless it's laden with sugar or something,
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:50.640]   we're just talking about some vegetable, fibrous vegetable,
[00:59:50.640 --> 00:59:54.640]   that will actually blunt the release of glucose
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:57.300]   until you eat the fish and the rice.
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.320]   But believe it or not,
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:01.240]   it will actually blunt the glucose increase
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:02.980]   that the rice would cause.
[01:00:02.980 --> 01:00:04.480]   Now, I'm not talking about neurotically
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.660]   eating each macronutrient separately in sequence.
[01:00:06.660 --> 01:00:07.880]   I'm just trying to give you a picture
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.940]   of what's happening ordinarily.
[01:00:09.940 --> 01:00:11.280]   So what this means is
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:14.900]   if you feel a lot of food-related anxiety,
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:16.480]   or you feel you're one of these people
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:19.540]   that you can kind of sense like your blood sugar
[01:00:19.540 --> 01:00:21.080]   increasing very quickly,
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.120]   a lot of people can sense this, some people can't,
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.520]   has a lot to do with how well they manage their blood sugar
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:27.520]   as well as some of the psychological factors.
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:29.800]   And yes, there are family and historical reasons
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:31.800]   where I've got friends who had a lot of siblings
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.980]   and when they sit down to eat,
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:34.420]   they have to really suppress the desire
[01:00:34.420 --> 01:00:37.700]   to not beat up everyone else at the table
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.540]   and take all the food.
[01:00:38.540 --> 01:00:39.920]   It's sort of like not,
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.360]   it's hard for them to understand
[01:00:42.360 --> 01:00:45.380]   that there's plenty to go around because of their upbringing.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:47.740]   So there are psychological top-down effects.
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:50.340]   A lot of the psychology around food
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:52.080]   is geared towards getting people to be relaxed
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:53.760]   when they eat and these sorts of things.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:55.560]   But these blood sugar effects are real,
[01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:58.700]   just cellar and basic biochemistry
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:01:02.800]   of how the body manages sugars ingested into the blood.
[01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:04.580]   So what does this all mean?
[01:01:04.580 --> 01:01:07.720]   It means that if you want a steep increase in glucose,
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:08.800]   you are very, very hungry,
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.360]   then you should eat the carbohydrate-laden food first,
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.000]   or you should eat a bunch of macronutrients combined.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.320]   So that would be like the hamburger or the sandwich,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:20.780]   the bread, the whatever's in that sandwich altogether.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.880]   Usually that's protein and vegetables as well.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.760]   If you want to have a kind of more modest increase
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.200]   in glucose or you want to blunt the increase in glucose,
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:35.440]   then have the, at least some of the fibrous thing first,
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.140]   and then the protein, and then the carbohydrate,
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:39.760]   you will notice that your blood glucose
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:42.560]   will rise more steadily
[01:01:42.560 --> 01:01:45.800]   and that you'll achieve satiety earlier in the meal,
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:48.160]   or at least you won't get this huge peak.
[01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:50.360]   It's sort of the Thanksgiving meal effect.
[01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:51.440]   Some of you are international,
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:54.200]   so if you don't celebrate Thanksgiving as a time of year
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:57.280]   where, used to be the one time a year or two times a year
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:58.920]   where Americans would give themselves permission
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.840]   to eat enormous meals.
[01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.820]   Now that seems to happen a lot more often,
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.640]   but there is this effect of you're full
[01:02:04.640 --> 01:02:05.900]   and yet you're hungry for more.
[01:02:05.900 --> 01:02:07.800]   That's because your blood glucose has gone through the roof
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:10.100]   and it's triggered a number of other mechanisms.
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:12.560]   There's also usually a lot of alcohol consumption
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.640]   and alcohol itself, because it's a sugar,
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:21.080]   will increase blood glucose very, very sharply.
[01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.520]   It depends on the alcohol.
[01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:24.440]   Some alcohols have more sugar than others,
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.120]   but basically what you're trying to avoid
[01:02:26.120 --> 01:02:27.600]   are steep increases in blood sugar.
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:28.960]   And the order that you eat foods
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:31.160]   has an enormous impact on that.
[01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:32.800]   The other thing that has an enormous impact
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:37.800]   on how long and shallow or how steep that curve of glucose
[01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:42.780]   is depends on whether or not you recently were moving,
[01:02:42.780 --> 01:02:45.560]   are moving, or start moving after you eat.
[01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.900]   So it turns out that your blood glucose levels
[01:02:48.900 --> 01:02:52.340]   can be modulated very, very powerfully by movement.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:55.020]   If you did any kind of intense exercise
[01:02:55.020 --> 01:02:58.120]   or even just walking or jogging or cycling,
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.140]   anything before you eat,
[01:02:59.140 --> 01:03:01.240]   your blood glucose levels will be dampened somewhat.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:04.500]   And that has to do with the release of something called,
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:07.020]   some people call it GLUT4, which sounds like glutton.
[01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:08.940]   Other people call it GLUT4.
[01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:11.820]   These are things that are involved in shuttling glucose
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:13.320]   to particular cells in the body,
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.240]   namely toward muscle and glycogen stores
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:17.360]   and away from body fat stores.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.720]   It has to do a sequestering of glucose from the blood.
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.360]   The point is that if you're somebody who struggles
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:23.520]   with blood sugar regulation,
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.120]   in addition to getting your body weight in a healthy range,
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:28.360]   doing all the other sorts of things
[01:03:28.360 --> 01:03:29.560]   that you should be doing,
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.280]   the key thing is to try and get some movement
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:36.060]   sometime circa meal.
[01:03:36.060 --> 01:03:38.200]   Now, very few people can actually eat and walk
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:40.440]   at the same time, although I do it all the time,
[01:03:40.440 --> 01:03:42.060]   not because I'm trying to regulate my blood sugar,
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.040]   but just 'cause I tend to be busy, I eat and drive.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.400]   I'm busy if I'm not giving this podcast or sleeping,
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:50.540]   I'm eating, except the early part of the day when I fast.
[01:03:50.540 --> 01:03:53.680]   But the bottom line here is that if you, for instance,
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:57.300]   take a 30-minute walk after a meal,
[01:03:57.300 --> 01:03:59.160]   your blood glucose will be blunted
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:01.100]   in ways that are beneficial.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:04.740]   If you have exercised in the recent hours before a meal,
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:05.740]   that can be beneficial.
[01:04:05.740 --> 01:04:07.840]   The order that you consume foods is beneficial.
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:09.880]   And there are a few things that you can consume
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.220]   that can also adjust blood glucose levels.
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:13.360]   So let's talk about those,
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.800]   but I thought it was important to really tamp down
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:18.040]   that it's not just what you eat,
[01:04:18.040 --> 01:04:19.120]   we talked about that before,
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.320]   but also the order that you eat those things,
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.940]   believe it or not, whether or not you combine
[01:04:22.940 --> 01:04:25.920]   macronutrients, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats,
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.940]   and fibrous vegetables,
[01:04:27.940 --> 01:04:31.000]   and whether or not you've moved recently,
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.440]   the higher intensity of the movement,
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:35.040]   the greater the GLUT4 increase,
[01:04:35.040 --> 01:04:37.440]   and the more that the blood glucose will be blunted
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:40.160]   and you'll shuttle more of that to glycogen and muscle stores
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.440]   and even just moving after a meal,
[01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:46.340]   even just a calm, easy walk can really adjust the ways
[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:49.080]   in which blood sugar regulated for the better.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:52.680]   I don't want to perseverate on this processed foods,
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:54.160]   hidden sugars thing too much,
[01:04:54.160 --> 01:04:56.680]   but understanding now a little bit
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:05:00.320]   about how insulin and glucose work,
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.000]   you can probably imagine why hidden sugars
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.180]   are such an attractive thing from the standpoint
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:07.120]   of processed food manufacturers,
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:10.980]   because if they can put sugar in that you can't even taste,
[01:05:10.980 --> 01:05:13.880]   that sugar is going to amplify the amount of glucose,
[01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:16.480]   it's going to increase the rate of glucose increase
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.720]   into your bloodstream and it's going to promote more feeding.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:21.600]   So in that case, you're really being tricked,
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:22.960]   it's not that you're actually reaching
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.440]   for the additional appetizer
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:26.160]   and your blood glucose is going up,
[01:05:26.160 --> 01:05:29.400]   the food that you ate is actually increasing your appetite
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.920]   as you eat it, it's a positive feedback loop.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:34.760]   So don't want to demonize those any more
[01:05:34.760 --> 01:05:35.720]   than I already have,
[01:05:35.720 --> 01:05:38.520]   but you should be aware that these things are happening
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.720]   at the level of your bloodstream and brain.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:44.480]   The other thing I'd like to address for a moment
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:47.140]   is this notion of stable blood sugar
[01:05:47.140 --> 01:05:50.620]   versus labile blood sugar or unstable blood sugar.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.520]   Some people just have stable blood sugar,
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:55.680]   they can go long periods of time without eating
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:57.920]   and feel fine, other people get really shaky,
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.480]   really jittery and or when they do eat,
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:04.640]   they feel really keyed up, sometimes they'll even sweat,
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.920]   sometimes their vision will go blurry
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.760]   and some of that can actually be
[01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:12.000]   because they've become hyperglycemic.
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.520]   And those effects that you experience
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:18.240]   when you are hyperglycemic are the early warning signs
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:20.280]   of the kinds of things that damage neurons
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.440]   and lead to the really terrible stuff
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:24.520]   they talked about before like peripheral neuropathies.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:26.260]   Now it takes some time for those things to occur,
[01:06:26.260 --> 01:06:27.760]   those neuropathies to occur,
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.100]   but whether or not your blood sugar is all over the place
[01:06:30.100 --> 01:06:32.020]   or whether or not it's stable
[01:06:32.020 --> 01:06:33.920]   can be impacted by a number of things.
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:36.840]   One of those things is exercise.
[01:06:36.840 --> 01:06:38.920]   So these days there's a lot of interest
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.340]   in what they call zone two cardio,
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:42.060]   which is that kind of steady state cardio
[01:06:42.060 --> 01:06:45.540]   where you can just nasal breathe even at pretty high output
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:47.740]   where you could maybe have a conversation,
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:50.840]   although I'm such a huge proponent of nasal breathing
[01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:52.840]   during exercise, most forms of exercise,
[01:06:52.840 --> 01:06:54.400]   especially zone two cardio
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.520]   that you probably shouldn't be talking
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.760]   while you're doing that cardio
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:59.920]   unless it's absolutely essential.
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:02.920]   But periods of zone two cardio
[01:07:03.200 --> 01:07:06.980]   that last anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour
[01:07:06.980 --> 01:07:09.120]   or sometimes more for you endurance athletes
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:13.280]   can create positive effects on blood sugar regulation
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:17.120]   such that you, people can sit down
[01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.600]   and enjoy whatever it is, the hot fudge sundae
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.900]   or whatever the high sugar content food is.
[01:07:21.900 --> 01:07:24.840]   And blood glucose management is so good,
[01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:28.560]   your insulin sensitivity is so high, which is a good thing,
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.900]   that you can manage that blood glucose
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.940]   to the point where it doesn't really make you shaky,
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.640]   it doesn't disrupt you.
[01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.400]   And to say nothing of the weight related issues
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.760]   or the adipose fat gain, et cetera,
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:43.900]   that's a separate issue 'cause people vary there.
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:47.600]   But basically doing zone two cardio
[01:07:47.600 --> 01:07:50.740]   for 30 to 60 minutes three to four times a week
[01:07:50.740 --> 01:07:52.880]   makes your blood sugar really stable.
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:55.620]   And that's an attractive thing for a variety of reasons.
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:58.680]   On the flip side, high intensity interval training
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:01.200]   or resistance training, AKA weight training,
[01:08:01.200 --> 01:08:04.560]   are very good at stimulating the various molecules
[01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:07.100]   that promote repackaging of glycogen.
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:10.900]   So sprints, heavy weightlifting, circuit type weightlifting
[01:08:10.900 --> 01:08:13.680]   provided there's some reasonable degree of resistance.
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:16.100]   Those are going to trigger all sorts of mechanisms
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:18.800]   that are going to encourage the body
[01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:22.060]   to shuttle glucose back into glycogen,
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.760]   convert into glycogen into muscle tissue,
[01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.640]   restock the liver, et cetera.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:28.380]   Depleting one's glycogen actually takes some time.
[01:08:28.380 --> 01:08:31.100]   If you do a couple sets of tricep extensions
[01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:33.440]   and some crunches, you're not depleting your glycogen.
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:37.600]   Glycogen depleting workouts are very high intensity.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:39.720]   Generally they're less than an hour or so,
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   but those are the sort that are going to lead
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.780]   to big increases in the kinds of enzymes
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:47.440]   and metabolic pathways that are going to repack glycogen
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.400]   and shuttle most things towards restorage of foods,
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:53.460]   not into adipose tissue, not into fat,
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.860]   but taking glucose and making it into fuels
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:08:58.600]   that you can access later for more of that high intensity
[01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.560]   activity.
[01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:01.480]   And I should mention that one of the advantages
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:04.240]   of high intensity interval training
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.120]   or weightlifting of various kinds is that it also,
[01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:13.280]   it causes long standing increases in basal metabolic rate.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:14.760]   I don't want to go too far down this path
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:16.200]   'cause we're going to do an entire month
[01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:19.680]   on human performance and athletic performance,
[01:09:19.680 --> 01:09:22.680]   but it's not just the increases in muscle
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.560]   that increase metabolism because muscle burns more energy
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.640]   than other types of tissues, except your brain,
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:31.500]   which truly burns the most energy
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:34.760]   and is the main reason why your basal metabolic rate
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:35.640]   is what it is.
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:39.680]   Well, high intensity training, so it could be sprints,
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:41.220]   it could be a high intensity interval training
[01:09:41.220 --> 01:09:43.180]   of different kinds, it could be weight training,
[01:09:43.180 --> 01:09:47.220]   also has an effect of increasing thermogenesis
[01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:50.520]   even long after you've completed the exercise.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:53.580]   So there's a long tail, there's a kind of post exercise
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:55.860]   metabolic effect that's also beneficial.
[01:09:55.860 --> 01:09:57.400]   So it's not an either or,
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:09:59.240]   it's really that high intensity interval training
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:01.600]   and resistance training and things of that sort
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:05.680]   are very good for one reason and the zone two cardio
[01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.080]   is very good for other reasons.
[01:10:07.080 --> 01:10:09.360]   And now you can see why it's just a healthy thing
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.420]   and why most people should probably be doing exercise
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:14.180]   most days of the week, if not every day of the week.
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:17.500]   If your goal is to manage blood glucose
[01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:21.100]   and your goal is to manage some of the metabolic factors
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.240]   that control repackaging of glycogen
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:25.680]   and encouraging excess glucose
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.400]   to not get diverted into body fat stores.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.620]   We haven't talked a lot about lipids today
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:32.660]   and that's because most of today's discussion
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:36.120]   is about hormones and insulin is the dominant hormone
[01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:39.980]   in terms of mobilizing and managing glucose in the body,
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:44.400]   at least for most people, but fats are very important
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:47.240]   and there's just a little anecdote about fats
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:49.060]   that I think will be useful in thinking about
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:52.900]   why you want to manage what they call the LDL or HDL ratios.
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:54.920]   And this is deserving an entire episode,
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:57.220]   many perhaps even several episodes,
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:01.540]   but some of you may be familiar with LDLs and HDLs,
[01:11:01.540 --> 01:11:05.320]   some of you may not, the LDL is low density lipoprotein.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:08.140]   This is the one that you don't want it to be too high,
[01:11:08.140 --> 01:11:09.840]   Costello's dreaming, he's barking,
[01:11:09.840 --> 01:11:13.060]   he loves all forms of cholesterol,
[01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:15.640]   but that's just Costello dreaming.
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:18.020]   So LDLs are the ones that you want to keep low,
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:19.960]   you don't want those to go excessively high.
[01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:22.320]   HDLs, the high density lipoproteins
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:26.080]   are the ones that are the so-called healthy lipoproteins.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:28.600]   That's all fine and good,
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:30.960]   but you might ask yourself, what are they doing?
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.840]   What is the actual role of these things?
[01:11:32.840 --> 01:11:36.680]   And why would you want healthy levels of HDL
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:38.460]   and not too much LDL?
[01:11:38.460 --> 01:11:43.460]   Well, one of the reasons is that fats don't like water,
[01:11:43.460 --> 01:11:45.600]   they are hydrophobic.
[01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:48.920]   And yet you need to move fats in your bloodstream,
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.720]   all tissues in your body need fats, they need cholesterols,
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:54.400]   last episode we talked about how cholesterol
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.520]   is a precursor to the sex steroid hormones,
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.760]   estrogen and testosterone and other hormones as well.
[01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:04.280]   Well, HDL and LDL actually coat fats
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:07.120]   to allow them to be transported through the bloodstream.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.000]   They do a number of other things as well,
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.260]   but HDL is a key component of the delivery system
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:16.400]   that brings those fats to the liver, ovaries,
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.380]   testes and adrenals.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.280]   In other words, having adequate levels of HDL is good
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.800]   because it allows fats to be delivered to the tissues
[01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:29.000]   that manufacture testosterone, estrogen, cortisol
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:31.460]   in healthy levels and the liver.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:35.300]   So this is why when LDLs are too high,
[01:12:35.300 --> 01:12:37.240]   what's happening is you're not getting fats
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:40.040]   to the correct tissues and you can get buildup of fats
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:44.020]   like fatty liver disease and some of these things can happen.
[01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.600]   High sugar content can even lead
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:47.880]   to some of these fatty liver conditions
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:48.720]   that's starting to happen.
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.280]   This is actually the first time in human history perhaps
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:52.780]   that we're aware of anyway,
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.360]   that we're starting to see liver conditions
[01:12:55.360 --> 01:12:59.140]   that normally were associated only with severe alcoholism
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.560]   starting to come from sugar content.
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.560]   So what does this mean?
[01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:04.120]   This means keep your LDL and HDL ratios proper.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.840]   You want those HDLs in order to deliver fatty molecules
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:10.900]   to the very tissues that use cholesterol
[01:13:10.900 --> 01:13:13.040]   in order to manufacture hormones.
[01:13:13.040 --> 01:13:16.120]   So how do you keep LDLs and HDLs in their proper ratios?
[01:13:16.120 --> 01:13:19.000]   Well, a lot of people don't realize this,
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.680]   but the debate about dietary cholesterol
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:26.080]   and its relationship to LDL and HDL ratios
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.480]   is a barbed wire debate.
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.020]   I don't want to get into it right now.
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:32.280]   There are still a lot of open questions
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:35.120]   as to how much dietary cholesterol
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.920]   impacts LDL and HDL ratios.
[01:13:36.920 --> 01:13:38.880]   I don't want to get into that now.
[01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:40.860]   I'm not taking a stance either way.
[01:13:40.860 --> 01:13:42.520]   But what is very clear
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:45.840]   is that having highly elevated glucose
[01:13:45.840 --> 01:13:48.680]   consuming too much sugar or not managing glucose
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.360]   in your body through some of the mechanisms
[01:13:50.360 --> 01:13:52.840]   that we've been talking about up until now
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:56.560]   can also negatively impact LDL/HDL ratios.
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:59.140]   So managing glucose goes way beyond
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:00.920]   just managing blood sugar
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:03.480]   and making sure that you don't lay down too much body fat,
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.920]   making sure your metabolism stays high,
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:06.500]   making sure you're not getting jittery at meals.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:08.880]   It also has to do with making sure
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:12.140]   that you're creating enough of the molecules, HDL,
[01:14:12.140 --> 01:14:15.660]   and not too many of the molecules, LDL,
[01:14:15.660 --> 01:14:18.640]   that are going to disrupt the delivery of things
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.160]   to the organs of your body
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.780]   that allow you to make healthy levels
[01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:24.120]   of testosterone, estrogen, and so forth.
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.060]   If that wasn't clear, let me make this ultra simple.
[01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.360]   You want healthy levels of HDL
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.800]   and you want low levels of LDL
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:33.600]   because if you have ovaries,
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:38.120]   it will allow the fats that need to get to the ovary
[01:14:38.120 --> 01:14:40.780]   to produce estrogen to get there.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.080]   And if you have testes,
[01:14:42.080 --> 01:14:45.440]   it will allow the fats and the cholesterol molecules
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.640]   that you need in order to manufacture testosterone
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:51.280]   to get to the testes.
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:54.200]   As well, in order to have proper adrenal function
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:55.440]   and proper liver function,
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.200]   you want HDL and LDL in the healthy, correct levels.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.860]   So now we've talked a lot about behavioral tools
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:04.080]   and the underlying biological mechanisms
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.760]   that justify those tools in particular circumstances.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:11.040]   Now I'd like to turn to supplements and prescription drugs
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:13.500]   that regulate the hormone systems
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:16.000]   controlling feeding and satiety.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.540]   There are a huge number of these.
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:19.960]   Some have more powerful effects than others.
[01:15:19.960 --> 01:15:21.740]   There are two that I want to describe
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:24.960]   because they've been getting a lot of attention recently.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.240]   First of all, there's a prescription drug, metformin,
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:30.720]   which was developed as a treatment for diabetes
[01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:34.440]   and it works potently to reduce blood glucose.
[01:15:34.440 --> 01:15:38.560]   It has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucose.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:43.560]   Metformin involves changes to mitochondrial action
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.520]   in the liver.
[01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:49.440]   That's its main way of depleting or reducing blood glucose.
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:52.260]   And it does so through the so-called AMPK pathway
[01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:56.820]   and it increases insulin sensitivity overall.
[01:15:56.820 --> 01:15:58.720]   Metformin is a powerful drug.
[01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:01.460]   In fact, I'm surprised that so many people
[01:16:01.460 --> 01:16:05.440]   have sought it out given that most of the people
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.700]   that I'm aware of that sought it out are not diabetic.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:10.780]   I think for diabetics, it seems to be a useful drug.
[01:16:10.780 --> 01:16:13.280]   For non-diabetics, it can also, of course,
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:14.520]   lower blood glucose.
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:17.680]   It also has the potential to make people hypoglycemic,
[01:16:17.680 --> 01:16:19.520]   genuinely hypoglycemic.
[01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:23.000]   So you really need to approach metformin with caution.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.360]   I get a little concerned when I hear about people
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:28.920]   blasting metformin simply because fasted states
[01:16:28.920 --> 01:16:31.300]   or low blood sugar states are healthy.
[01:16:31.300 --> 01:16:34.880]   Doing that pharmacologically can have long-standing effects.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:37.580]   You really want to approach that with caution.
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.160]   Now there's a comparable drug.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.540]   It really should be called a drug,
[01:16:42.540 --> 01:16:44.200]   but it's non-prescription.
[01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:46.280]   That's also in fairly prominent use out there
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:51.280]   called berberine, B-E-R, B-E-R-I-N-E, berberine, correct.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.100]   So berberine is a really interesting compound.
[01:16:58.100 --> 01:17:01.340]   Its actions very much mimic metformin.
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:04.060]   So let's talk about berberine for a second.
[01:17:04.060 --> 01:17:08.380]   Berberine actually comes from various plants and tree bark.
[01:17:08.380 --> 01:17:10.120]   It is sold in supplement stores.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:11.400]   It's sold online.
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.520]   It is, as far as I know, unregulated.
[01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.600]   It is powerful.
[01:17:14.600 --> 01:17:16.400]   If you're going to experiment with berberine,
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.240]   you definitely want to talk to your doctor
[01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:20.800]   and you want to approach it with caution.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:25.800]   It also works to activate the so-called AMPK pathway.
[01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:28.680]   AMPK, by the way, stands for adenosine monophosphate
[01:17:28.680 --> 01:17:30.840]   activated protein kinase, AMPK,
[01:17:30.840 --> 01:17:34.100]   and it inhibits a protein tyrosine phosphase, 1B pathway.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:36.460]   I think that's enough nomenclature.
[01:17:36.460 --> 01:17:39.040]   It activates a certain pathway that's associated
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.920]   with fasting and low blood glucose.
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.340]   The effects of berberine are, as far as I can tell,
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:49.680]   when looking at the literature, are very similar,
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.800]   if not identical, to metformin.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:57.000]   Now, the number of studies out there on this are many,
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.600]   so I'm just going to review a few of them
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:00.080]   and their major effects.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:03.840]   As always, I invite you to check out examine.com.
[01:18:03.840 --> 01:18:05.480]   It's a wonderful website where you can put in
[01:18:05.480 --> 01:18:08.900]   any supplement or compound or biological goal,
[01:18:08.900 --> 01:18:11.800]   for that matter, and it will list out the various effects
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:14.460]   in the human effect matrix, so studies on humans,
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:17.360]   if they're available, and it will tell you
[01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.960]   whether or not there's strong effects or weak effects
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.460]   or modest effects, and it will point
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:24.040]   to the specific subject population, a wonderful resource.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.820]   So berberine, not surprisingly, has very strong effects
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:28.960]   in lowering blood glucose.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:30.920]   There are four studies on this.
[01:18:30.920 --> 01:18:33.280]   In fact, they say that berberine is one of the more,
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.160]   if not the most effective supplements
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:36.360]   for lowering blood glucose.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:39.600]   It talks about dosages there, although I'll just mention
[01:18:39.600 --> 01:18:43.240]   that I've tried berberine, and the dosages that are typical
[01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:48.240]   on the bottle of most supplements is much higher
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.240]   than I needed.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:51.840]   So when I took berberine, two things happened.
[01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:55.640]   First of all, I got a pretty splitting headache.
[01:18:55.640 --> 01:18:57.220]   It gave me pretty vicious headaches.
[01:18:57.220 --> 01:18:59.860]   So for me, it was a no almost immediately.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:03.260]   The other thing is I became so hypoglycemic
[01:19:03.260 --> 01:19:05.420]   that in order to get my blood sugar back up,
[01:19:05.420 --> 01:19:07.520]   I think I ate something like 10 donuts,
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:10.880]   and I didn't feel like I had ingested all that much sugar.
[01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:11.860]   It was really kind of weird.
[01:19:11.860 --> 01:19:13.200]   I was hyperphagic for sugar.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:14.560]   I was craving sugar, craving sugar,
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:16.320]   and I was very thirsty as well.
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:19.660]   And so I don't want to promote any bad behavior,
[01:19:19.660 --> 01:19:21.440]   but I know that certain people use this
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:22.980]   when they've overeaten sugars,
[01:19:22.980 --> 01:19:24.360]   or they're doing their cheat days,
[01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.820]   something that I'm personally just not a fan of,
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:28.620]   and they want to keep their blood sugar in check,
[01:19:28.620 --> 01:19:30.200]   or they know they're going to consume a huge meal.
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:32.960]   They'll take berberine to keep blood glucose clamped,
[01:19:32.960 --> 01:19:34.440]   and it does do that.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.240]   It has very strong effects.
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:39.520]   Three peer-reviewed studies on HbA1c levels.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:42.640]   HbA1c is something that can be measured in a blood test
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.880]   that is sort of an average readout
[01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:47.000]   of your blood sugar levels over the previous
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.080]   two or three months, sometimes shorter period,
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:53.680]   but that's mostly what HbA1c is about.
[01:19:53.680 --> 01:19:58.480]   So it radically decreases your blood sugar levels.
[01:19:58.480 --> 01:20:00.200]   It actually lowers cholesterol.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:02.080]   It acts, remember, on the liver,
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.200]   and the liver is involved in cholesterol metabolism.
[01:20:06.200 --> 01:20:09.280]   And remember, it's both sugars, blood glucose,
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:13.940]   and dietary fats, perhaps, it's still heavily debated,
[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.280]   in terms of how your blood total cholesterol,
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:18.820]   HDL and LDL, are regulated.
[01:20:18.820 --> 01:20:20.800]   So it seems to lower total cholesterol,
[01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:25.360]   and it seems like it lowers HDL and LDL in parallel.
[01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:27.080]   So that's interesting.
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:29.480]   One study showed a minor increase in HDL,
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.200]   the so-called good cholesterol.
[01:20:31.200 --> 01:20:32.920]   Insulin levels dropped, not surprising.
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.740]   Another study showed a slight decrease in LDL.
[01:20:35.740 --> 01:20:37.000]   Those seem to be kind of minor.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.160]   Here's a kind of interesting one,
[01:20:38.160 --> 01:20:39.760]   just to help you remember berberine,
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.720]   as if the fact that it comes from tree bark
[01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:44.740]   isn't trigger enough to remember it.
[01:20:44.740 --> 01:20:48.040]   Direct contact of berberine on canker sores
[01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.120]   seems to eliminate canker sores very quickly,
[01:20:50.120 --> 01:20:51.220]   which is kind of cool.
[01:20:51.220 --> 01:20:52.600]   I haven't had canker sores in a few years,
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.700]   but when I did get them, they are extremely painful.
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:56.540]   Don't like those.
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:20:57.480]   So that's kind of interesting.
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.800]   And there's some study references there.
[01:20:59.800 --> 01:21:01.680]   I find it amazing that these compounds exist.
[01:21:01.680 --> 01:21:03.400]   You've got this prescription drug metformin,
[01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:05.720]   and then you've got berberine, the stuff from tree bark,
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:07.000]   and they have effects that are
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.840]   essentially equivalent to one another.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.020]   So again, I'm not promoting their use
[01:21:11.020 --> 01:21:14.440]   or even their exploration, but those compounds do exist.
[01:21:14.440 --> 01:21:15.480]   They're out there.
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:17.840]   And check out examine.com if you'd like to learn more.
[01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:19.840]   Certainly do your reading, do your homework
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:21.840]   before you start just popping the stuff.
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:26.840]   And if you have hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia,
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.940]   be especially careful.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:32.480]   And also do understand that dosages
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:33.820]   and dose requirements vary.
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:36.500]   So if you do go down this path,
[01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:37.920]   really approach things carefully.
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:40.320]   Always start with the lowest amount
[01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.800]   that you could get away with.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:44.160]   For me, the headache thing just made it a no-go.
[01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.880]   I do keep a bottle of it in full disclosure
[01:21:47.880 --> 01:21:52.480]   in the odd chance that I feel like eating a ton of donuts.
[01:21:52.480 --> 01:21:55.920]   It's not so much about not ingesting the calories.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.160]   It's just that I don't like the feeling
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:59.320]   of being hyperglycemic, the blurry vision,
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.720]   just feeling lousy.
[01:22:00.720 --> 01:22:02.580]   I do love donuts.
[01:22:02.580 --> 01:22:05.520]   Other things that impact blood glucose in supplement form.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:10.000]   Chromium has been shown in 29 studies to have a minor,
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.380]   I want to emphasize a minor effect
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.080]   on reducing blood glucose.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.240]   Things like L-carnitine,
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:16.260]   something we've talked about here on the podcast before
[01:22:16.260 --> 01:22:19.220]   in terms of its relationship to power output
[01:22:19.220 --> 01:22:23.280]   in ATP production for both aerobic and anaerobic exercise,
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:26.920]   as well as sperm quality and egg quality.
[01:22:26.920 --> 01:22:28.600]   We talked about that long ago.
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:34.680]   Things like panache ginseng can have positive effects on,
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:37.120]   I should say, can have effects
[01:22:37.120 --> 01:22:39.280]   of reducing blood glucose slightly.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:41.740]   I don't want to give a valence to or judgment
[01:22:41.740 --> 01:22:43.160]   to whether or not it's positive or negative.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:44.360]   Here's something that's interesting
[01:22:44.360 --> 01:22:45.200]   that you should know about.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:49.340]   Caffeine has very reliably been shown
[01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:53.440]   to increase blood glucose just a little bit, okay?
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:56.500]   So I always thought that caffeine would drop blood glucose,
[01:22:56.500 --> 01:23:00.380]   but it actually can increase blood glucose just slightly.
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.140]   Things like magnesium.
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:04.480]   Talked about magnesium as a tool
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:07.920]   for enhancing the passage into sleep.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:10.740]   In particular, magnesium threonate and biglycinate.
[01:23:10.740 --> 01:23:14.800]   Magnesium can also have a modest reduction in blood glucose.
[01:23:14.800 --> 01:23:15.720]   You're starting to get the impression
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.140]   everything reduces blood glucose,
[01:23:17.140 --> 01:23:18.400]   but that's certainly not the case.
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:21.440]   And then a couple episodes ago
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:22.480]   when we were discussing nutrition,
[01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.060]   we talked about artificial sweeteners,
[01:23:24.060 --> 01:23:27.320]   sucralose, aspartame, nutra-sweet.
[01:23:27.320 --> 01:23:29.720]   Some of those are generic names.
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:31.040]   Some of those might be brand names
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:33.760]   and how they have negative effects on the gut microbiome
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.280]   and that's supported by a number of studies.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:37.920]   There's one artificial sweetener.
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:41.280]   It's stevia, S-T-E-V-I-A,
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:44.080]   which seems to lower blood glucose just slightly.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:48.640]   And I still can't find data on whether or not stevia
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:52.060]   impacts the gut microbiome in either direction.
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.380]   Many of the things that I consume
[01:23:53.380 --> 01:23:55.020]   do have small amounts of stevia in them.
[01:23:55.020 --> 01:23:56.860]   So I'd love to know if anyone out there
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:59.500]   is aware of quality peer-reviewed research
[01:23:59.500 --> 01:24:03.420]   as to whether or not stevia impacts the gut microbiome
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:07.500]   similarly or differently from other artificial sweeteners.
[01:24:07.500 --> 01:24:08.340]   Please let me know.
[01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:09.360]   Please send me the references.
[01:24:09.360 --> 01:24:10.200]   I'd really appreciate it.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.840]   You can put it in the comment section on YouTube
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.680]   or elsewhere.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:16.180]   Comment section on YouTube would be the best place.
[01:24:16.180 --> 01:24:18.520]   So stevia seems to lower blood glucose a little bit,
[01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.560]   which makes it kind of an attractive artificial sweetener
[01:24:21.560 --> 01:24:24.780]   if one is going to use artificial sweeteners.
[01:24:24.780 --> 01:24:27.600]   But remember, sweet taste itself stimulates
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:30.280]   the desire to eat, which will increase more blood glucose.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:32.260]   So I'm guessing that they probably cancel each other out.
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:35.020]   So you have to think logically about these things.
[01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:37.920]   Vitamin B3, so some of the B vitamins do indeed
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:41.460]   stimulate appetite by triggering increases in blood glucose.
[01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:44.260]   Vitamin B3 in particular, I don't know if B6 does.
[01:24:44.260 --> 01:24:46.460]   Things like zinc seem to lower blood glucose.
[01:24:46.460 --> 01:24:49.080]   And then there've been an enormous number of other things
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:53.480]   that have been tested for their roles in blood glucose.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:56.100]   Apple cider vinegar, anything acidic.
[01:24:56.100 --> 01:24:59.340]   This is well known now that any kind of acidity,
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:01.260]   so it could be lemon juice or lime juice
[01:25:01.260 --> 01:25:04.740]   or apple cider vinegar, lowers blood glucose slightly.
[01:25:04.740 --> 01:25:06.500]   Some of those can also have other effects
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:08.140]   that we're not talking about today.
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:09.240]   So that's kind of interesting
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:13.860]   because there's a movement now towards creating,
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:16.100]   sort of people talk about becoming more alkaline,
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:18.000]   you know, I hate to break it to you,
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:21.260]   but you don't really want your body to be too alkaline.
[01:25:21.260 --> 01:25:23.900]   You want to stay in the right pH or else you start,
[01:25:23.900 --> 01:25:26.700]   there are conditions that make you more alkaline.
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:29.280]   You don't want to be too acidic or too alkaline.
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:33.580]   If you see a beverage or something that purports
[01:25:33.580 --> 01:25:34.980]   that ingesting that beverage
[01:25:34.980 --> 01:25:37.060]   is going to make you more alkaline,
[01:25:37.060 --> 01:25:38.380]   that is absolutely false.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:39.740]   There's no evidence for that.
[01:25:39.740 --> 01:25:42.860]   It's impossible biochemically, it's just marketing.
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.180]   But nonetheless, ingesting foods that are acidic
[01:25:47.180 --> 01:25:51.860]   can make some slight adjustments to the pH of the gut
[01:25:51.860 --> 01:25:55.860]   in ways that can slow or alter the absorption of foods
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:57.940]   and can blunt blood glucose.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.260]   You can try this sometime if you want.
[01:25:59.260 --> 01:26:01.340]   If ever you're feeling kind of over sugared out,
[01:26:01.340 --> 01:26:03.080]   like you ate something with too much sugar,
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:05.060]   you can drink a small amount of lemon juice
[01:26:05.060 --> 01:26:06.460]   mixed with water or lime juice.
[01:26:06.460 --> 01:26:08.260]   And you'll notice that it will blunt
[01:26:08.260 --> 01:26:11.420]   that kind of hyperglycemic effect just a little bit.
[01:26:11.420 --> 01:26:14.360]   Again, you don't want to use this as a medical tool,
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:17.140]   but the effect is fairly potent.
[01:26:17.140 --> 01:26:18.860]   And then, excuse me.
[01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:21.880]   And then there are a number of other things like capsaicin
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:24.060]   and hot chili peppers that will lower blood glucose.
[01:26:24.060 --> 01:26:25.580]   The list goes on and on.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:30.240]   The most powerful one is absolutely berberine and metformin,
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:32.960]   but that's really heavy caliber stuff.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.100]   And the other ones I mentioned have more minor effects.
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:37.580]   I do want to mention,
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:38.860]   because I'm sure some of you out there
[01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.340]   are curious about the ketogenic diet,
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:42.020]   I'm going to do an entire episode
[01:26:42.020 --> 01:26:44.700]   about ketosis and the brain and the body.
[01:26:44.700 --> 01:26:49.700]   But the ketogenic diet has been shown in 22 studies
[01:26:49.700 --> 01:26:51.800]   to have a notable decrease on blood glucose.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.140]   And that is not surprising
[01:26:53.140 --> 01:26:56.700]   because the essence of the ketogenic diet
[01:26:56.700 --> 01:27:00.820]   is that you're consuming very little or zero of the foods
[01:27:00.820 --> 01:27:04.180]   that promote big spikes in insulin and glucose.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:06.380]   If you consume enough protein,
[01:27:06.380 --> 01:27:09.180]   some of that protein can be converted into glucose,
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:11.140]   of course, through gluconeogenesis.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:14.320]   But the ketogenic diet has very strong support
[01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:19.240]   for its role in regulating blood sugar, which is glucose.
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:22.440]   But the specific effects of the ketogenic diet
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:25.380]   and one particular effect that I'll address later,
[01:27:25.380 --> 01:27:26.840]   but I'll mention now,
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.580]   which is the ability of the ketogenic diet
[01:27:29.580 --> 01:27:32.980]   to adjust thyroid hormone levels
[01:27:32.980 --> 01:27:34.520]   in ways that make it such
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:36.580]   that if you return to eating carbohydrates
[01:27:36.580 --> 01:27:38.780]   after being in ketosis for too long,
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:41.860]   you don't manage thyroid and carbohydrates as well.
[01:27:41.860 --> 01:27:43.460]   That has been shown as well.
[01:27:43.460 --> 01:27:45.140]   So we're going to dive deep into ketosis
[01:27:45.140 --> 01:27:46.260]   in a future episode.
[01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:48.800]   So for you ketonistas out there, don't worry.
[01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:51.180]   I certainly have nothing against ketogenic diet.
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:52.940]   I actually don't have anything for
[01:27:52.940 --> 01:27:54.780]   or against any particular nutrition plan.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:56.140]   I know what works for me,
[01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:57.380]   at least at this stage of my life,
[01:27:57.380 --> 01:27:58.940]   and I'll update it if I need to.
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:28:00.900]   I'm simply trying to get you as much information
[01:28:00.900 --> 01:28:02.380]   as I possibly can
[01:28:02.380 --> 01:28:04.820]   so that you can navigate through that landscape
[01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:08.520]   in a way that's in keeping with your particular goals.
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:10.900]   So now you understand a lot about blood sugar
[01:28:10.900 --> 01:28:12.060]   and how it's managed
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.940]   and the ways that you can manage it better
[01:28:13.940 --> 01:28:16.380]   depending on your particular needs.
[01:28:16.380 --> 01:28:19.860]   This is also a good opportunity for us to look back
[01:28:19.860 --> 01:28:22.020]   at some of the medical literature
[01:28:22.020 --> 01:28:25.340]   because it really points to just how far we've come
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:28.020]   in terms of understanding these important mechanisms.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:29.980]   And it points us in the direction
[01:28:29.980 --> 01:28:32.440]   of some actionable protocols.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:37.440]   So diabetes, which is these huge increases in blood glucose
[01:28:37.440 --> 01:28:40.020]   because there's no insulin,
[01:28:40.020 --> 01:28:43.380]   was known about as early as 1500 BC,
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:45.220]   which is just incredible.
[01:28:45.220 --> 01:28:49.760]   And the way physicians then understood
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:51.940]   that certain people had high blood glucose
[01:28:51.940 --> 01:28:54.400]   without actually knowing what blood glucose was
[01:28:54.400 --> 01:28:57.380]   is that they would take the urine of particular patients
[01:28:57.380 --> 01:29:01.780]   and they'd find that ants preferably moved toward
[01:29:01.780 --> 01:29:06.300]   and consumed the urine of certain patients and not others.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.320]   And they understood that there was something in that urine
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:11.460]   that was correlated with the sudden weight loss
[01:29:11.460 --> 01:29:14.140]   and some of the other probably very unfortunate health
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:17.200]   symptoms that these people were experiencing.
[01:29:17.200 --> 01:29:21.080]   So they knew that there was something in blood and urine.
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:25.180]   But you might not be asking yourself, wait, that's urine.
[01:29:25.180 --> 01:29:29.940]   But as I tell every kid that I meet, two things,
[01:29:29.940 --> 01:29:31.940]   I tell a kid, your brain is here.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:33.140]   I make them point to their head.
[01:29:33.140 --> 01:29:35.120]   And then I tell them, do you know what?
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:37.900]   Do you know that your urine is actually filtered blood?
[01:29:37.900 --> 01:29:39.500]   And they usually go, hmm.
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.520]   I get parental permission to do this first,
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:44.380]   but most adults don't realize that your urine
[01:29:44.380 --> 01:29:46.660]   is actually just filtered blood.
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:49.660]   And that's why if you see blood in your urine,
[01:29:49.660 --> 01:29:50.700]   that's a problem.
[01:29:50.700 --> 01:29:54.360]   You want to filter the blood, but urine is filtered blood.
[01:29:54.360 --> 01:29:59.360]   Now, this business of measuring blood sugar from the urine
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:03.000]   has been something that lasted way beyond
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:06.240]   these early stages of 1500 BC.
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:09.260]   Turns out that as late as 1674,
[01:30:09.260 --> 01:30:13.760]   physicians at Oxford University were figuring out
[01:30:13.760 --> 01:30:18.400]   who had pathologically high levels of blood glucose
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:20.840]   by analyzing their urine.
[01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:23.640]   And again, they were measuring the sweetness of their urine.
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:25.580]   But, and this is medical fact,
[01:30:25.580 --> 01:30:27.460]   they would do this by taking urine samples
[01:30:27.460 --> 01:30:31.300]   from different patients and tasting them.
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:34.460]   And they developed an intuitive sense
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:39.000]   of what excessively sweet urine was relative
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.700]   to the other urines that they had tasted.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:42.620]   So for those of you that are in the medical profession
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:45.340]   or those of you that are seeking out the medical profession,
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:48.060]   do understand this is not done anymore.
[01:30:48.060 --> 01:30:51.320]   And you can also just reflect on how far we've come
[01:30:51.320 --> 01:30:53.740]   in terms of the medical profession itself
[01:30:53.740 --> 01:30:55.780]   in our ability to measure things from the blood
[01:30:55.780 --> 01:30:57.140]   and measure things from urine
[01:30:57.140 --> 01:31:02.140]   without having to ask ants which urine is sweeter
[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:04.940]   or ask oneself which urine is sweeter.
[01:31:04.940 --> 01:31:08.420]   So indeed, we are making progress as a species.
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:09.660]   Before we close out today,
[01:31:09.660 --> 01:31:11.400]   I want to talk about one more tool
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:14.400]   that many of you will probably find useful.
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:15.940]   I certainly have.
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:18.140]   I'm a big consumer of caffeine,
[01:31:18.140 --> 01:31:20.180]   although I don't consume a ton of it.
[01:31:20.180 --> 01:31:21.740]   I consume it very consistently.
[01:31:21.740 --> 01:31:24.440]   So I'm big on consuming mate,
[01:31:24.440 --> 01:31:27.340]   which is a strong caffeinated tea.
[01:31:27.340 --> 01:31:30.140]   And I generally do that early in the day,
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.440]   although I do delay about two hours after I wake up
[01:31:32.440 --> 01:31:34.440]   for reasons I've talked about in previous episode
[01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:37.520]   to maintain that nice arc of alertness and focus.
[01:31:37.520 --> 01:31:40.500]   I do drink black coffee as well, mushroom coffee as well.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.740]   I love that stuff.
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:45.120]   But mate, also called yerba mate,
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:49.440]   is an interesting compound because unlike coffee,
[01:31:49.440 --> 01:31:50.820]   it has been shown to increase something
[01:31:50.820 --> 01:31:54.860]   called glucagon-like peptide, GLP-1,
[01:31:54.860 --> 01:31:56.620]   and increase leptin levels.
[01:31:56.620 --> 01:31:58.580]   Now, we didn't talk a lot about glucagon today.
[01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:01.580]   Glucagon is really elevated in the fasting state.
[01:32:01.580 --> 01:32:04.560]   I mentioned that it's sort of the opposite of insulin
[01:32:04.560 --> 01:32:06.420]   in kind of rough terms.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:08.940]   That's one way to think about it.
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:13.260]   But GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide one
[01:32:13.260 --> 01:32:15.740]   is increased by ingesting mate,
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:19.800]   and it acts as a pretty nice appetite suppressant.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:22.100]   Now, I'm not trying to suppress my appetite.
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.240]   I like to eat, as I mentioned before,
[01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.920]   but it works really well to stimulate the brain
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.100]   and to give you a level of alertness
[01:32:31.100 --> 01:32:33.160]   and to do a lot of the things that coffee does.
[01:32:33.160 --> 01:32:34.940]   It also contains electrolytes.
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:39.400]   So we, meaning our neurons and our brain,
[01:32:39.400 --> 01:32:42.900]   run on a variety of factors, electrical activity
[01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:44.280]   and chemical transmission, et cetera,
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:46.340]   but they require adequate levels
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:48.820]   of sodium, potassium, and magnesium.
[01:32:48.820 --> 01:32:51.820]   Actually, if you were to learn the biology
[01:32:51.820 --> 01:32:53.580]   or the physiology of the action potential,
[01:32:53.580 --> 01:32:54.920]   the firing of a neuron,
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.180]   something we teach every first-year neuroscience student,
[01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:00.340]   and I'd be happy to teach you if you're interested,
[01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:03.200]   you'll hear about sodium rushing into cells
[01:33:03.200 --> 01:33:06.360]   and potassium entering and leaving cells
[01:33:06.360 --> 01:33:08.720]   in order to allow neurons to communicate.
[01:33:08.720 --> 01:33:11.320]   Electrolytes are critically important
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:13.460]   for the function of the nervous system.
[01:33:13.460 --> 01:33:16.420]   And many things that act as diuretics
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:20.220]   that promote excretion of water, like caffeine,
[01:33:20.220 --> 01:33:22.560]   can also take electrolytes out
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:24.380]   along with, in particular, sodium.
[01:33:24.380 --> 01:33:26.780]   And sometimes the lightheadedness or the brain fog
[01:33:26.780 --> 01:33:28.380]   that people experience isn't just
[01:33:28.380 --> 01:33:29.540]   because electrolytes are low,
[01:33:29.540 --> 01:33:31.860]   but because they're kind of out of balance.
[01:33:31.860 --> 01:33:36.060]   So I like mate because it has electrolytes, it has caffeine.
[01:33:36.060 --> 01:33:38.780]   It stimulates the release of this glucagon-like peptide,
[01:33:38.780 --> 01:33:40.980]   GLP-1, and it's been a big help to me
[01:33:40.980 --> 01:33:43.660]   in extending that early morning fasting window
[01:33:43.660 --> 01:33:46.580]   out to about noon or so when I eat my first meal.
[01:33:46.580 --> 01:33:48.020]   It also just tastes really good.
[01:33:48.020 --> 01:33:49.420]   I don't drink it out of the gourd,
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:50.860]   even though I have Argentine lineage.
[01:33:50.860 --> 01:33:53.820]   The gourd to me is, it's just kind of an inconvenience.
[01:33:53.820 --> 01:33:55.740]   I drink it out of a mug.
[01:33:55.740 --> 01:33:56.980]   There's no promotional here.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:34:00.140]   I have no relationship to any yerba mate plantations
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:01.960]   or companies.
[01:34:01.960 --> 01:34:03.780]   I just happen to really like the stuff.
[01:34:03.780 --> 01:34:08.540]   And the fact that glucagon-like peptide-1 is enriched
[01:34:08.540 --> 01:34:11.500]   or is released more when you drink mate,
[01:34:11.500 --> 01:34:15.020]   and the fact that GLP-1 can regulate blood sugar
[01:34:15.020 --> 01:34:17.860]   in ways that keep your blood sugar in that,
[01:34:17.860 --> 01:34:22.200]   we called you got glycemic, not too high, not too low mode,
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.040]   is one reason why ingesting mate is attractive to me.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.420]   If you go to South America, what you'll see,
[01:34:28.420 --> 01:34:31.020]   especially among Uruguayans, but also Argentines,
[01:34:31.020 --> 01:34:34.140]   is people actually carry a thermos of this stuff with them
[01:34:34.140 --> 01:34:36.540]   around and bring it to meals in restaurants.
[01:34:36.540 --> 01:34:38.380]   And that's just considered cultural convention.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.100]   It's not unusual to see that.
[01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:41.940]   So we don't see that so much here in the States,
[01:34:41.940 --> 01:34:43.540]   but I happen to really love this stuff.
[01:34:43.540 --> 01:34:46.380]   I brew my own because that's the most economical way
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.220]   to do it.
[01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:48.520]   And I really enjoy it.
[01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.940]   It can be a little bitter for some people.
[01:34:50.940 --> 01:34:53.220]   The real key there, if you want to know the mate trick,
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.860]   is to not use water that's really boiling hot.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:57.200]   You go just shy of boil,
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.980]   and then it doesn't have that same kind of tobacco-like
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:04.700]   or really acidic flavor to it.
[01:35:04.700 --> 01:35:07.020]   It's a little bit, just a little bit sweeter,
[01:35:07.020 --> 01:35:08.580]   although not quite sweet.
[01:35:08.580 --> 01:35:13.140]   So Yerba Mate GLP-1 can manage, in healthy ways,
[01:35:13.140 --> 01:35:16.200]   leptin levels, glucose levels, and glucagon levels
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:19.700]   in ways that if it serves you, you might want to try.
[01:35:19.700 --> 01:35:23.220]   So once again, we covered an enormous amount of material
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:27.300]   focused on how hormones regulate feeding, hunger,
[01:35:27.300 --> 01:35:30.280]   and when one feels they don't need to eat,
[01:35:30.280 --> 01:35:33.040]   so-called satiety that you've had enough.
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:34.980]   As always, we covered a lot,
[01:35:34.980 --> 01:35:38.680]   but I could not be exhaustive about all the information
[01:35:38.680 --> 01:35:39.860]   related to this topic.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:41.100]   It's just so vast.
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:43.900]   For instance, we did not talk about thyroid hormone,
[01:35:43.900 --> 01:35:47.020]   an extremely important hormone and pathway
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:48.380]   in the body and brain.
[01:35:48.380 --> 01:35:50.620]   We are going to do an episode related to thyroid
[01:35:50.620 --> 01:35:53.100]   and tools to regulate thyroid, I promise.
[01:35:53.100 --> 01:35:54.660]   Having seen this episode,
[01:35:54.660 --> 01:35:58.820]   you will be able to digest that material with far more ease.
[01:35:58.820 --> 01:36:02.700]   We also didn't talk about the fact that testosterone
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.420]   and estrogen can impact blood glucose in ways
[01:36:05.420 --> 01:36:07.200]   that are opposite to one another,
[01:36:07.200 --> 01:36:09.220]   that when estrogen levels are high,
[01:36:09.220 --> 01:36:11.620]   appetite tends to be reduced.
[01:36:11.620 --> 01:36:13.700]   When testosterone levels are high,
[01:36:13.700 --> 01:36:15.140]   appetite tends to increase.
[01:36:15.140 --> 01:36:17.220]   So there are all sorts of interesting interplays
[01:36:17.220 --> 01:36:18.720]   between the various hormones,
[01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.660]   but that's much too much of a deep dive for now.
[01:36:21.660 --> 01:36:24.460]   Right now, we've just focused today mainly
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.180]   on things like ghrelin,
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:29.260]   on things like melanocyte-simulating hormone,
[01:36:29.260 --> 01:36:32.940]   incredible, powerful hormone that can suppress appetite,
[01:36:32.940 --> 01:36:36.540]   on things like cholecystokinin that comes from the gut
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:38.280]   and can suppress appetite,
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:40.500]   on things like food emulsifiers,
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:42.540]   on the fact that when you're eating,
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:44.700]   you are amino acid seeking,
[01:36:44.700 --> 01:36:46.380]   even though you might not realize it,
[01:36:46.380 --> 01:36:49.540]   that you are also seeking out particular fatty acids,
[01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:53.400]   in particular the conjugated linoleic acids and omega-3s.
[01:36:53.400 --> 01:36:55.840]   So I've tried to give you a number of actionable tools.
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:58.720]   Many of them are behavioral.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.940]   Some of them are based on supplements
[01:37:00.940 --> 01:37:02.500]   or even prescription drugs.
[01:37:02.500 --> 01:37:04.560]   Again, always do what's best for your health
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:07.560]   and do that in company with a healthcare professional.
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:08.400]   I'm not a physician.
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:09.840]   I don't prescribe anything.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.160]   I'm a professor.
[01:37:11.160 --> 01:37:12.420]   I profess a lot of things.
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:13.880]   And I try and share with you what I think
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.660]   to be the best high quality peer-reviewed literature.
[01:37:16.660 --> 01:37:18.200]   So that's what I've done today.
[01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:20.400]   Really appreciate your time and attention.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:21.920]   Many of you have continued to ask
[01:37:21.920 --> 01:37:23.800]   how you can help support the podcast,
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.080]   and we really appreciate the question.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:27.320]   There are several ways to do that.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.000]   The first is to like a video that you've seen,
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.360]   if you like it, and please subscribe to the YouTube channel.
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:35.740]   That's perhaps the most important thing
[01:37:35.740 --> 01:37:37.080]   about the YouTube channel.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:38.540]   As well, leave us a comment.
[01:37:38.540 --> 01:37:40.220]   If you leave us a comment in the comment section,
[01:37:40.220 --> 01:37:43.120]   that helps us, and please ask questions.
[01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.600]   Those questions and your comments
[01:37:44.600 --> 01:37:46.900]   do inform content of future episodes.
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:49.440]   We read them all, except the negative ones.
[01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.260]   I'm just kidding.
[01:37:50.260 --> 01:37:51.600]   We read them all.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.960]   In addition, please subscribe on Apple and/or Spotify
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:57.500]   or both, if you like.
[01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.260]   And on Apple, you have the opportunity
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:01.160]   to leave us up to a five-star review,
[01:38:01.160 --> 01:38:02.400]   if you feel we deserve that.
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.520]   Apple also lets you leave a comment,
[01:38:04.520 --> 01:38:06.760]   some feedback for us as well.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:08.220]   Please do check out our sponsors
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:10.920]   that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast.
[01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.460]   That's the best way perhaps to support the podcast.
[01:38:13.460 --> 01:38:15.240]   As well, we have a Patreon account.
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:18.000]   It's patreon.com/andrewhuberman,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.700]   and there you can support the podcast
[01:38:19.700 --> 01:38:21.440]   at any level you like.
[01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:24.640]   And today, as well as in previous episodes,
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:26.380]   I've mentioned various supplements.
[01:38:26.380 --> 01:38:28.600]   If you're interested in seeing what supplements I take
[01:38:28.600 --> 01:38:31.600]   and you want to explore for some other supplements as well,
[01:38:31.600 --> 01:38:36.600]   you can go to Thorne, T-H-O-R-N-E.com/u,
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:38.940]   the letter U, /huberman.
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:41.340]   Thorne is a supplement company
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:43.800]   that we believe to have the highest stringency
[01:38:43.800 --> 01:38:46.960]   in terms of what they put in the various supplements
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:48.440]   that they make, and the amounts that they put
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:49.400]   are very accurate.
[01:38:49.400 --> 01:38:51.480]   They've partnered with the Mayo Clinic.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:53.600]   They've partnered with all the major sports teams,
[01:38:53.600 --> 01:38:56.080]   and we've partnered with them because we believe
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:58.840]   in their levels of stringency and accuracy.
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.840]   If you go to thorne.com/u/huberman,
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.800]   you can see what I take,
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:07.400]   and you'll also get 20% off any of those supplements
[01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:10.240]   or any of the other supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:39:10.240 --> 01:39:13.140]   So that's where you can find out more about supplements
[01:39:13.140 --> 01:39:14.280]   and the ones that I take.
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:16.320]   And again, you get the 20% discount
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:18.800]   on any supplements that Thorne makes.
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:21.680]   And last but not least, thank you for being with us.
[01:39:21.680 --> 01:39:22.840]   I hope you learned a lot.
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:25.380]   I hope you explore some of the tools
[01:39:25.380 --> 01:39:27.160]   and that the mechanistic information
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:28.940]   that you learned today will serve you well.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:31.360]   If you know anyone that's interested in this topic,
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:33.440]   or you think that someone could benefit from it,
[01:39:33.440 --> 01:39:35.580]   please suggest the podcast to them as well.
[01:39:35.580 --> 01:39:38.400]   And most of all, thank you for your interest in science.
[01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:40.980]   [upbeat music]
[01:39:40.980 --> 01:39:43.560]   (upbeat music)
