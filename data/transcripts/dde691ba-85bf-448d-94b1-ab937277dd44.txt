[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:15.620]   I am James Hong and welcome to the Surpassing Value Podcast.
[00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.740]   The fuel and desire for this podcast was born out of a compulsion to flesh out what's
[00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.600]   been going on in the midst of an ocean of megaphones that may not actually withstand
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.620]   the test of scrutiny.
[00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:32.340]   As a signpost theologian, I will do my best to filter out the impurities and point people
[00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.360]   in the right direction.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.300]   In this bonus episode of the Surpassing Value Podcast, I wanted to talk about Christmas
[00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.620]   from a historical and biblical perspective.
[00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.900]   It's a bonus episode because I'm recording this after Episode 10 and by the time this
[00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.180]   episode drops, we should be on Episode 3.
[00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.020]   Today is December 12th of 2020.
[00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:11.580]   So for this episode, we're going to be talking about the birth of Christ and the Magi because
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.060]   quite frankly it is relevant to Christmas.
[00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.300]   If you're hearing this, it might be Christmas Day because my plan is to drop this on Christmas
[00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:27.780]   Day and for most of the nation, Christmas invokes rom-coms, presents, hot chocolate,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.500]   Santa Claus, reindeers, and the like.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.340]   For another significant portion, this might even include a nativity scene.
[00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.300]   However, for Christians, it should invoke a lot more.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.980]   The reason it should invoke a lot more is because the very nature of the day is based
[00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.260]   on the birth of our Savior.
[00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:53.700]   To be clear, we're not exactly sure on what exact date Christ was born, so this day is
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.500]   more of a commemoration of his birth than it is an anniversary of sorts.
[00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.780]   For Christians, this day celebrates the day that God took on human flesh, entered the
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.500]   world by condescending to where we were, was praised by a few, and entrusted to people
[00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.620]   of low societal value.
[00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.900]   What is extremely noteworthy about this grand paradox of God taking on human flesh is the
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:33.100]   sheer exhibition of the immense power of God as he holds all things together.
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:40.140]   Colossians 1:15-20 states, "He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
[00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.380]   creation. For by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible
[00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:50.780]   and invisible, whether thrones or dominions, or rulers or authorities. All things have
[00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:55.860]   been created through him and for him. He is before all things, and in him all things hold
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:01.060]   together. He is also the head of the body, the church, and he is the beginning, the firstborn
[00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.740]   from the dead, so that he himself will come to a first place in everything. For it was
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.940]   the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in him, and through him to reconcile
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:17.020]   all things to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, having made peace through
[00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.180]   the blood of his cross."
[00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:32.660]   Consider these few verses in light of the power of God, this all-powerful and holy God.
[00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:36.820]   The God who destroyed the world with an apocalyptic flood.
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.860]   The God who humbled unbelieving Pharaoh and made his own people to suffer because of this
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.380]   unbelief.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.780]   God turned water into blood, thunder and hail to envelop Egypt, a darkness so thick that
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:57.260]   the Egyptians couldn't see in front of them, and caused the death of their firstborn.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.780]   The God who parted the Red Sea and allowed only Israel to pass.
[00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.220]   The God whom Moses couldn't see, but only could see the trail, because Moses or any
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.540]   other man would have died thus, causing Moses' own appearance to physically change.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.200]   The God whom Elijah called upon when he battled the prophets of Baal.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.420]   The God who destroyed the Assyrians and the Babylonians, the two international world empires
[00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.980]   that took turns dominating the globe.
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:37.760]   Christ is the image of that God, but also the firstborn of all creation.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:46.980]   So one of many aspects we learn from the Incarnation is that this same all-powerful God is also
[00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:55.500]   a loving God who cares for all humanity deeply and profoundly.
[00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:59.180]   Or else why would he send his only begotten?
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.380]   Imagine the power of Christ that in him all things were created, both in heaven and on
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.120]   earth.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.260]   He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.380]   I want to illuminate this aspect of holding together because I do think it is profound.
[00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.220]   A hydrogen bomb is 1000 times more devastating than an atomic bomb.
[00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.180]   A hydrogen bomb is 1000 times more devastating than an atomic bomb.
[00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:42.700]   The atomic bomb was what was dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki that killed 129,000 and 226,000
[00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.480]   people, respectively.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:50.860]   This is how a hydrogen bomb works, and I'll be quoting from Science Drug.
[00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.900]   "A hydrogen bomb basically works with the help of fusion reaction, but it includes fission
[00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.940]   reaction as well.
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:05.820]   Fission reaction releases a lot of energy, whereas fusion reaction requires energy to
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:06.820]   take place.
[00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:11.500]   Hence, the reaction starts with the fission reaction, where the neutrons collide with
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.380]   the uranium or plutonium and release excess amount of energy which creates high pressure
[00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:18.880]   and temperature.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.920]   This gives a perfect environment for hydrogen and helium to fuse with each other.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.680]   This generates even more energy and results in an explosion.
[00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.340]   Enormous amount of energy is released, which can be highly destructive.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:44.800]   Hence, we can say that hydrogen bomb has greater power than the atomic bomb."
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:51.720]   Enormous amount of energy is released, an enormous amount of energy is released that
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:58.440]   is highly destructive, much more destructive than the atomic bomb.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:11.700]   This is all being held together on this molecular level that we cannot see with the naked eye.
[00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:15.940]   God holds all of this together.
[00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:23.980]   Doesn't that give you a deeper understanding and appreciation for the God who descended
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:35.500]   and took on human flesh and holds all things together when you consider His power?
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:43.180]   God is holding all these things together and if you were to just let it go, things wouldn't
[00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.140]   just spin out.
[00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:58.820]   A more accurate logical next step would be an explosion, an unfathomable one.
[00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:05.140]   Circling back here to the birth of Christ, for the rest of the episode, I want to point
[00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:13.620]   out some interesting tidbits that could each be expanded upon further, but we'll have
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:17.260]   to settle for a flyover.
[00:08:17.260 --> 00:08:20.840]   Consider the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.180]   You have Abraham who amongst other things twice refused to recognize Sarah as his wife
[00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.100]   due to him being afraid of his own safety.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:33.000]   You have Jacob who deceived Esau out of his birthright so fled for his own safety.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.940]   You have Judah who slept with Tamar the prostitute and wanted her dead because she had become
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:40.780]   pregnant out of wedlock and then relented when finding out that he was the father of
[00:08:40.780 --> 00:08:42.020]   the child.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.820]   You have Ruth the Moabite who was not even Jewish.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.820]   You have David who murdered Righteous Uriah.
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.060]   You have Solomon who had a harem of wives and concubines and completely disobeyed God's
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:54.900]   commandments in the latter portion of his life.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:00.620]   You have Manasseh who led Israel into wanton sin and gross idolatry, worshiping every other
[00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:04.420]   God as opposed to the one true God.
[00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:13.580]   You have the Messiah, the King, born to a teenager of very low societal status.
[00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:21.260]   Right from the beginning, you have God showing he works through imperfect people.
[00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:26.940]   Don't get it twisted, many of the people named were in fact righteous people.
[00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:35.860]   But my point is, while being righteous, they were also clearly flawed and imperfect.
[00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:43.700]   God brought forth the Messiah through what could easily be deemed the riffraff of society.
[00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:50.180]   Moving on into Matthew 2, you see the Magi coming from the East.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:55.000]   And contrary to Christian cartoons, it doesn't say that there were three of them.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.300]   If you saw my post for this episode, my Facebook post, I hope you noticed that I didn't choose
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:04.060]   an image that had three individuals on camels, despite the fact that I was tempted to do
[00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.060]   so because so many of them were so well done.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:11.380]   It could have been three, but there was probably at least a little more than three, we just
[00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.380]   don't know.
[00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:16.980]   Moreover, they probably didn't come right when Jesus was born.
[00:10:16.980 --> 00:10:19.620]   There's probably a bit of a time gap.
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:25.140]   We're going to talk about them anyway, since most of us associate the Magi with the birth
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:27.340]   of Christ.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:32.340]   We don't know a ton about the Magi, but we do know this.
[00:10:32.340 --> 00:10:38.500]   They were probably extremely wealthy as indicated by the gifts they brought, being able to receive
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:43.820]   Herod as an audience, and the probable length of their journey having come from what Matthew
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.780]   describes as the East and not some nearby town.
[00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:53.660]   The Magi were actually a very powerful group of Medes, M-E-D-E-S, who were exceptionally
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:58.500]   learned religious men who also acted as king makers.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:04.860]   They were a powerful priesthood with immense political clout.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.080]   You could think of them as corollaries with the Pharisees, but replaced Judaism with some
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.820]   sort of astrological paganism.
[00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:17.620]   You see them in Jeremiah 39 and Daniel 2.
[00:11:17.620 --> 00:11:22.380]   In Daniel 2, Nebuchadnezzar has a dream and tells the Magi that they must interpret the
[00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:27.060]   dream or be killed along with all the other designated wise men.
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:31.380]   The Magi responded that they weren't able to interpret his dream, and even further that
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.940]   no man on earth could do so.
[00:11:33.940 --> 00:11:39.340]   Daniel is to be killed along with Hananiah, Misael, and Azariah, Shadrach, Meshach, and
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:43.380]   Abednego, since they were also considered to be part of the group of sages.
[00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:47.700]   Let me read to you Daniel 2 verses 10-30.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:56.780]   It states, "The Chaldeans answered the king and said, 'There is no person on earth who
[00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:01.780]   could declare the matter to the king, because no great king or ruler has ever asked anything
[00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:06.260]   like this of any soothsayer priest, sorcerer, or Chaldean.
[00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:10.380]   Moreover, the thing which the king demands is difficult, and there is no one else who
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:16.060]   could declare it to the king except gods, whose dwelling place is not with mortal flesh.'
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:19.660]   Because of this, the king became angry and extremely furious, and he gave orders to kill
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.660]   all the wise men of Babylon.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:25.820]   So the decree was issued that the wise men be killed, and they looked for Daniel and
[00:12:25.820 --> 00:12:27.500]   his friends to kill them.
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:31.020]   Then Daniel replied with discretion and discernment to Ariok, the captain of the king's bodyguard,
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.100]   who had gone out to kill the wise men of Babylon.
[00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.940]   He said to Ariok, the king's officer, 'For what reason is the decree from the king so
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.940]   harsh?'
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.020]   Then Ariok informed Daniel of the matter.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:45.940]   So Daniel went in and requested of the king that he would give him a grace period so that
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.820]   he might declare the interpretation to the king.
[00:12:48.820 --> 00:12:52.900]   Then Daniel went to his house and informed his friends, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
[00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:57.060]   about the matter, so that they might request compassion from the God of heaven concerning
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.060]   this secret, so that Daniel and his friends would not be killed with the rest of the wise
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:03.460]   men of Babylon."
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:08.060]   "Then the secret was revealed to Daniel in a night vision.
[00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.780]   Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.
[00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.780]   Daniel said, 'May the name of God be blessed forever and ever, for wisdom and power belong
[00:13:15.780 --> 00:13:16.780]   to Him.
[00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.420]   It is He who changes the times and the periods.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.580]   He who removes kings and appoints kings.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.020]   He gives wisdom to wise men and knowledge to people of understanding.
[00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:28.620]   It is He who reveals the profound and hidden things.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:32.460]   He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with them.
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:37.660]   To you, God of my fathers, I give thanks and praise, for you have given me wisdom and power.
[00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:42.100]   Even now you have made known to me what we requested of you, for you have made known
[00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:43.980]   to us the king's matter.'
[00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:49.660]   Thereupon Daniel went to Ariok, whom the king had appointed to kill the wise men of Babylon.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:53.720]   He went and said this to him, 'Do not kill the wise men of Babylon.
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:58.140]   Take me into the king's presence, and I will declare the interpretation to the king.'
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:14:01.860]   Then Ariok hurriedly brought Daniel into the king's presence and spoke to him as follows,
[00:14:01.860 --> 00:14:07.940]   'I have found a man among the exiles from Judah who can make the interpretation known
[00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:08.940]   to the king.'
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:11.300]   The king said to Daniel, 'Whose name was Belshazzar?
[00:14:11.300 --> 00:14:16.460]   Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen and its interpretation?'
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.620]   Daniel answered before the king and said, 'As for the secret about which the king has
[00:14:20.620 --> 00:14:25.900]   inquired, neither wise men, sorcerers, soothsayer priests, nor diviners are able to declare
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.180]   it to the king.
[00:14:27.180 --> 00:14:34.540]   However, there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and He has made known to King Nebuchadnezzar
[00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:37.060]   what will take place in the latter days.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:40.880]   This was your dream and the visions in your mind while on your bed.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:45.820]   As for you, O king, while on your bed your thoughts turned to what would take place in
[00:14:45.820 --> 00:14:51.540]   the future, and He who reveals secrets has made known to you what will take place.
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:56.740]   But as for me, the secret has not been revealed to me, for any wisdom residing in me more
[00:14:56.740 --> 00:15:02.180]   than in any other living person, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known
[00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:11.060]   to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.'"
[00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.820]   God goes on to interpret the dream through Daniel.
[00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.660]   Afterwards, Nebuchadnezzar gives glory to God.
[00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:24.800]   Daniel 2, 46-49 states, "Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and paid humble respect to
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:29.100]   Daniel and gave orders to present to him an offering and incense.
[00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:34.620]   The king responded to Daniel and said, 'Your God truly is a God of gods and a Lord of kings
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.380]   and a revealer of secrets, since you have been able to reveal the secret.'
[00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:42.760]   Then the king promoted Daniel and gave him many great gifts, and he made him ruler over
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:48.860]   the entire province of Babylon and chief prefect over all the wise men of Babylon.
[00:15:48.860 --> 00:15:53.780]   And Daniel made a request of the king, and he appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:16:01.060]   over the administration of the province of Babylon while Daniel was at the king's court."
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:11.100]   The God of the Jews is shown to be who He really is, which is the king of the universe,
[00:16:11.100 --> 00:16:19.740]   above the perceived greatest worldly sages known to mankind at the time, which were the
[00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:22.380]   Magi.
[00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:28.020]   The Magi also understood this as well, as they had previously just stated in this passage,
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:33.540]   that the Magi couldn't fulfill King Nebuchadnezzar's request, nor could any other man alive.
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:39.940]   It had to be, even in their own words, "heavenly wisdom."
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:50.740]   Undoubtedly these former pagan, worldly learned astrologers now begin to learn the one true
[00:16:50.740 --> 00:17:02.260]   religion of Judaism, the God of Daniel, the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:08.820]   Not only did faithful Daniel teach them this, but also many must have been converted after
[00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:21.100]   realizing that the one true God was not only all-powerful, but also kind and merciful.
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:27.580]   Despite the fact that they were immersed in their own pagan religion and not the true
[00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:35.380]   religion of Judaism, God shows them kindness through Daniel, and they are all saved.
[00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:44.060]   Psalm 103 8 states, "The Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding
[00:17:44.060 --> 00:17:48.940]   in loving kindness."
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:56.380]   Daniel had undoubtedly discipled this group of men, and the faith of the one true God
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:18:02.860]   was passed down from generation to generation.
[00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:11.140]   When you skip ahead to Daniel chapter 9 verses 24-25, one would be easily able to generally
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:16.880]   tell when the Messiah would be born by estimating backwards.
[00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:23.060]   So if you can get the general time period down, you know the city because of Micah 5:1-2.
[00:18:23.060 --> 00:18:27.340]   So you have the general time, you have the exact city.
[00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:35.940]   And so these group of men who were discipled by Daniel pass down the faith of the one true
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.060]   God.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:46.660]   And then the spiritual descendants, who were also probably the genetic descendants also,
[00:18:46.660 --> 00:18:54.340]   came from the East to worship the King of the Jews.
[00:18:54.340 --> 00:19:02.700]   What else is interesting about this time period when Jesus was born, was that the entire world
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.260]   had this expectation of a coming King.
[00:19:06.260 --> 00:19:13.500]   It wasn't just the Magi in the East, it wasn't just Israel, it was the entire world.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:19.700]   Daniel Woodhead, Professor Woodhead, writes, and I quote, "Historians record for us that
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:24.340]   at that general time there was a strange expectation in the world for a coming king.
[00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:28.400]   The people in the East had it, which partly explains why the Magi came.
[00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:32.540]   People in many places were anticipating the arrival of a king, something even the Roman
[00:19:32.540 --> 00:19:34.660]   historians acknowledged.
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:39.860]   Suetonius wrote in the Twelve Caesars, "There had spread over all the Orient an old and
[00:19:39.860 --> 00:19:46.340]   established belief that it was fated at that time for men coming from Judea to rule the
[00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:47.340]   world."
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:52.980]   Writing during the second century A.D. about such things as Vespasian's conquering of
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:58.380]   Israel in A.D. 70, Suetonius looked back and said that the first century was a day when
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:03.180]   there was an expectation for men coming from Judea to rule the world.
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:07.060]   Consequently, people's eyes were focused upon that place.
[00:20:07.060 --> 00:20:12.020]   Tacitus, the famous Roman historian, tells of the same belief in the anals, that there
[00:20:12.020 --> 00:20:18.620]   was a firm persuasion that at this very time the East was to grow powerful and rulers coming
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:22.380]   from Judea were to acquire a universal empire.
[00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:28.380]   Josephus, in the Wars of the Jews, said that the Jews had a belief that, about that time,
[00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:35.340]   one from their country should become governor of the "habitable earth."
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:44.140]   Moreover, God must have given these faithful believers, these magi who believed, some kind
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:49.460]   of certain sign perhaps connected with Numbers 24.17.
[00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:56.220]   Numbers 24.17 says this, "I see him, but not now; I look at him, but not near.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:04.020]   A star shall appear from Jacob, a scepter shall arise from Israel, and shall smash the
[00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:10.640]   forehead of Moab, and overcome all the sons of Sheph."
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:16.660]   Whatever the case these magi saw, whether it was a star or perhaps it was a manifestation
[00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:25.900]   of God's glory as alluded to in Matthew 24 and Zechariah 14, whatever it was, it caused
[00:21:25.900 --> 00:21:34.260]   them, as Matthew 2.10 states, when they saw this star or manifestation of God's glory,
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:42.820]   it caused them to rejoice with exceedingly great joy.
[00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:50.580]   To put it another way, when they saw that sign of the Messiah, they rejoiced upon rejoicing
[00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:58.860]   with great, great rejoicing, and then upon seeing the Messiah, they worshiped him.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:04.380]   Even the gifts they brought showed an understanding of who Christ was.
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:09.260]   Gold as a symbol of kingship and royalty, frankincense was an incense as a symbol of
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:15.800]   deity, and myrrh, an embalming oil, as a symbol of humanity and death.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:18.920]   You know how the rest of this portion of the story goes.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:24.140]   After worshiping, they return to their own country without seeing Herod after being warned
[00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.620]   in a dream.
[00:22:25.620 --> 00:22:29.260]   Joseph and Mary escape to Egypt with Jesus.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:34.300]   Herod slaughters all the babies under two because he had been tricked by the magi and
[00:22:34.300 --> 00:22:36.740]   was afraid of Jesus.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:41.540]   An angel appears to Joseph in a dream after Herod dies, and they return from Egypt to
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:44.540]   Israel.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:54.240]   As Christians, we commemorate this day as more than just materialism.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:23:03.620]   Isaiah 9.6 states, "For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us, and the
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:09.900]   government will rest on his shoulders, and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor,
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.260]   Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:19.580]   The child was born, but the son was given.
[00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:28.580]   The child was born, but the son was given.
[00:23:28.580 --> 00:23:30.700]   Thanks for making it to the end.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:35.820]   I'll continue to try to make the journey worth it.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:40.100]   To Him be honor, glory, and eternal dominion.
[00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   Merry Christmas.
