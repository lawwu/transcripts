[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160]   How do you wash an eye properly?
[00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.520]   Do you use soap and flush it with water or do you just flush it with water, or should
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.520]   you not even do that?
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.520]   Should you use saline?
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.040]   I realize these might sound like low-level questions, but these are the things that people
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:15.520]   deal with on an all-too-frequent basis.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.320]   For most people, most of the time, actually, the eyes are a very good, clean environment.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:29.520]   Actually our tears contain enzymes that help break down bacteria and bacterial toxins.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.520]   For most people, regular eye-washing doesn't have to be any part of their standard routine.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.440]   In terms of the surface of the eye, the part of your eye, the conjunctiva, over the whites
[00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.920]   of the eyes, underneath the eyelids, anything underneath the eyelids, it's pretty self-cleaning,
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.080]   and actually our tear production and blinking is very good at keeping our eyes clean.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:58.840]   The eyelids, eyelashes, can be another story, and especially as we age, our skin is breaking
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.720]   down a little differently than when we were younger.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.460]   You can develop what we sort of nickname "scurf," which is little dead skin bits that accumulate
[00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.000]   around the eyelashes.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.040]   A lot of people develop what we call blepharitis, which just means inflammation of the eyelashes.
[00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.640]   For that, doing some eye scrubs is a good idea.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.760]   They actually sell little pads that you can buy that you rip open and you can use to lightly
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.960]   clean the eyelashes.
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.400]   You can also just use like a No More Tears Baby Shampoo.
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.640]   Just pump a little bit into the palm of your hand once or twice a day, dilute it with a
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.240]   little water and under the sink, and either with your finger or an edge of a washcloth,
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.560]   just very lightly rub the eyelashes.
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.920]   What I like to do- With the eyes closed.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.640]   With the eyes closed, and don't scrunch them closed too tight because you're actually burying
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.160]   the eyelashes, the roots of the eyelashes when you really scrunch closed.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:00.800]   Just gently close your eyes, just real gentle closure, and then just lightly scrub.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:01.800]   It shouldn't be abrasive.
[00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.520]   You're not trying to exfoliate the eyelids or eyelashes in any way.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.400]   Just lightly rub with that kind of dilute No More Tears Baby Shampoo, and that can really
[00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.560]   help people with their eye comfort.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.320]   If you feel like you've got something in your eye, your ideal eye wash is actually going
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.120]   to be a sterile saline solution, a saltwater solution that they sell little bottles over
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.400]   the counter, eye wash solutions like that.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.920]   A lot of people who wear contacts will have that kind of eye wash solution, just a sterile
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.680]   saline eye wash.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:35.680]   Just pure saltwater.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.100]   It doesn't have to have any other chemicals or preservatives in it.
[00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.520]   You can, of course, use- Not actual seawater or saltwater.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:45.120]   Not saltwater, thank you.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.920]   Not saltwater out of your salt pool, not saltwater out of the ocean, but like a saline saltwater
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.640]   that's available in a sterile.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.360]   Now you can also just use artificial teardrops and some of those come in non-preservative,
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.440]   some of those come in preserved versions.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.680]   Those are all also completely safe to use in the eye.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.200]   And there you can sort of spritz into your eye, hold the lid open and give it a little
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.240]   spritz.
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.760]   If you feel like you've got something in your eye, a piece of dirt or a lash that's not
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.040]   coming out, just to rinse it.
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:20.520]   But having a regular routine, you're not going to hurt anything with the occasional eye rubbing.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.400]   We all do these things just kind of as a, even a nervous habit or just absentmindedly,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.080]   you might scratch your arm or rub your eyes or things like that.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   That's fine.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.760]   You're not going to hurt anything.
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.720]   There are conditions where people sort of develop kind of almost like a psychological
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.720]   habit.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.880]   There are certain conditions where people actually do too much eye rubbing.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.960]   It can be dangerous if you're in that group.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.200]   But for the regular run of the mill, everyday, occasional eye rubbing, fine.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.680]   If you certainly, if you get a lash in there and you're trying to rub it and blink it and
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.680]   tear it out.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.840]   And again, in that situation you can use some artificial tears, wetting drops, saline drops.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.720]   Those would be the way to do it.
