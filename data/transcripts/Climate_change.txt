[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.880]   Hello everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai and I am recording from the hot tub because
[00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.800]   I'm trying to get some work done and relax at the same time.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.160]   And it's funny because one of the things that has exploded in terms of spending during the
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.080]   coronavirus pandemic and the lockdown is one, online purchases, right?
[00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.240]   But two, it's home improvement stuff.
[00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.640]   So a lot of people are doing a lot of work on their homes and a lot of people are spending
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.080]   money on hot tubs and pools and so forth.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.480]   So if you're thinking about getting a hot tub and you live in a moderate climate area
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.160]   or a couple of the seasons are kind of cold, like below 60 degrees, I highly recommend
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.160]   getting a hot tub.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.280]   The hot tub is amazing.
[00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.080]   It's a place to relax.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.160]   It's a place to meditate.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.800]   I think about a lot of ideas from my hot tub and it's really, really helpful.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.280]   So the topic I want to talk about in this episode is on climate change and how it might
[00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.380]   affect real estate values.
[00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.160]   Because for the longest time, well not the longest time, for the past, I'd say five or
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.640]   six years, since 2014 at least, but actually since I was a kid, I've always wanted to own
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.720]   beachfront property.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.560]   You know, beachfront, you walk out onto your deck and then you go down the stairs and then
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.640]   you just take a dip in the ocean and then come out.
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.840]   Or you just walk across your lawn and into the ocean.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.600]   I mean, that was always a dream of mine and it always sounded so amazing.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.680]   However, what I've realized after looking at beachfront properties and talking to my
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:41.520]   parents and experiencing several natural disasters is that there's just more maintenance and
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.360]   risk required.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.000]   So if you are able to walk out of your home, you know, you're on this nice lawn, of course
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.360]   there's a pool and a jacuzzi spa, and you just walk out off your lawn into the sand,
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.960]   I mean that's amazing, right?
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.960]   Amazing.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.480]   You can see those little crabs, you know, going sideways, crawling up and down.
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:06.000]   You can see these little fish, the small fish swimming around.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.120]   It's pretty amazing, but the water, if it just rises like a foot, I would say your home
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.880]   might be flooded.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.960]   And so flood insurance does cost money.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.160]   I did talk to one of these agents in Hawaii in the Kahala area, which is a really nice
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:27.400]   area in Oahu, about how much flood insurance costs for this one home.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.080]   And he was saying it was about $3,000 or so.
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.520]   And this was an expensive home.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.520]   I was just looking for fun.
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.280]   It was a $7 million home.
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.560]   But it's always fun to look at these nice homes, right?
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.720]   And just kind of dream and imagine to motivate yourself.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.560]   It motivates me to try to, you know, think about these things so that I can just figure
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.040]   out a way to get there.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.360]   So flood insurance is something important to think about.
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.040]   And the other thing is just the maintenance of owning this home near the beach or on the
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   beach, right?
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:06.160]   You've got wind and maybe more moisture, actually definitely more moisture, pounding away at
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.480]   the walls and at the windows and the seams that are going to crack.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:16.360]   So when you've got wind and you've got sun just baking the stucco or the wood, causing
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.240]   it to expand and then shrink at night, there's just a lot more maintenance work to be done.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.760]   So the question is, is owning beachfront property or lakefront property worth it with climate
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.880]   change on the horizon?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.880]   It's tough to say because climate change is a slow-moving phenomenon.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.600]   And there's this one study that I highlight in the Post that says they estimate maybe
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.680]   13 million people will move away from the coast and head inland by the year 2100.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.720]   And unfortunately, most of us will be dead by 2100.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.000]   So it really doesn't matter to us.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.600]   And that's just kind of the thinking a lot with climate change for many people.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.640]   Is it really going to matter if we're not going to be here?
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.940]   You know, it's so slow-moving.
[00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.880]   But as an investor, you've got to think about the future, especially if you want to buy
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.460]   real estate for generations to come.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:12.240]   So if you're buying real estate, if you're going to follow my strategy of buying, let's
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:19.160]   say, one property per child you have to make sure that at least when you're gone, you can
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.880]   provide shelter for them if they need shelter.
[00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:29.160]   It's an insurance mechanism that many of the people that I know have done, buying one property
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   per child.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.520]   You know, some people buy dozens of properties.
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.820]   I don't know who these people are, but hey, you can go that route and build passive income
[00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.680]   through real estate that way.
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.280]   But I like the goal of everybody who has kids to try to buy one property per child.
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:48.680]   And if you do buy one property per child, then you've got to think longer term.
[00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.440]   You know, your life is probably going to last maybe until 80 to 100.
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.360]   And then your kids' lives are probably going to last 80 to 100 or maybe longer.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   Who knows?
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   So you've got to be thinking about 30 to 100 years from now if you want to keep these properties
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.220]   in the family.
[00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:12.520]   So I was thinking, instead of owning beachfront property or lakeside property, it's probably
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.360]   better to own hillside property, property that has a wonderful view of the ocean or
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.880]   the body of water you're thinking about.
[00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:28.880]   From a price comparison point of view, you can see how eventually, or maybe right now,
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:34.680]   ocean view property, properties with a view on a hill might start outperforming beachfront
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.680]   property.
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:39.680]   People say there's only so much beachfront you can build on.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.680]   And that's true.
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.240]   So there's less of a supply of beachfront homes.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:49.240]   But you can see that balance change over time, especially if there's more disasters, warmer
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.400]   climates and so forth.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.520]   So it's just something to think about as you go and pursue your next property, your next
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.080]   dream property where you want to retire or just enjoy life.
[00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.600]   It's really interesting during the coronavirus pandemic that we've been locked up for so
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.320]   many months.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.800]   There's this palpable and I think obvious through the data desire to own a nicer home,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.440]   to live in your nicer home because you're spending more time in your home.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.100]   This is what I've been going through since 2012.
[00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.660]   In the past, I used to spend, I don't know, eight to 10 hours a day in the home.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.720]   After 2012, I'm probably spending 20 hours a day in the home.
[00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:31.720]   So that's a doubling of the time I spent at home.
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.280]   And that means, hey, why not spend more on the things you spend more time on and that
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   you value more of?
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.560]   So I think most people are going to place a higher value on shelter.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:46.360]   And given you place a higher value on shelter, the value of shelter should go up.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:52.480]   And you are seeing demand spread out towards less centrally located parts of your city,
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   right?
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.940]   If you don't have to commute every single day downtown, then what's the point of living
[00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.600]   close to downtown?
[00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.640]   So definitely take a look around your city and see if there are better deals on the outskirts
[00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.760]   of your city or the suburbs of your city.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:10.000]   If you can get more space and pay less, that's a no brainer.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.040]   I think that trend is going to continue concurrently with the trend of relocating to different
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.320]   cities and states to really lower your cost of living.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.400]   But I think first of all, you got to look within your city.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.920]   And I'm sure you can save 20 to 40% on living costs because that's what I did.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:31.200]   And I see it all around in many cities, you just drive 15, 30 minutes further and you'd
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.440]   save boatloads of money.
[00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:39.120]   And further, you won't be at risk of a salary cut as some companies will wisely try to do
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.600]   if you decide to relocate and work remotely forever.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.640]   So back to climate change.
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.560]   Climate change, it's going to take a while to really take effect.
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.340]   But you are seeing erosion of land on lakefront properties, beachfront properties.
[00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.040]   So that's something to be aware of.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.300]   You will have to pay for flood insurance if you're in the flood zone.
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.920]   And if you're in the hills, be aware there might be fires if you're surrounded by a lot
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   of trees.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.160]   So you've got to inquire about fire insurance as well.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:10.220]   So at the end of the day, nobody knows exactly what's going to happen, which is why we have
[00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:12.520]   homeowners insurance.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:17.000]   Ask your insurance carrier what type of homeowners insurance you have currently.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:20.760]   Hopefully you do have homeowners insurance and what it covers.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:25.640]   During this lockdown, it's good to get an idea of what your policies are covering.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:32.160]   Life insurance, homeowners insurance, renters insurance, auto insurance, umbrella policy,
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.460]   personal liability insurance, and so forth.
[00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.800]   You got to get these insurance policies downright because as we have all realized now, anything
[00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.400]   and everything can happen and you just have no idea so you might as well get protected.
[00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:51.000]   As for future property purchases, I think I'm just going to stick with what I like and
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.840]   that is owning a single family home on the top of a hill with a view of the water.
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:09:01.800]   I didn't realize, I didn't realize until just now that every single one of my properties
[00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:03.280]   is on a hill with a view.
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:08.080]   You know, we're talking Lake Tahoe, Honolulu, San Francisco, they are all on a hill and
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.240]   they're elevated.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:15.440]   And I think it's because my grandparents bought a property on the hill in Honolulu
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.400]   and I've been going back there my entire life and I've just been accustomed to that.
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:24.800]   Driving up the hill, sitting on a deck, just kind of surveying the landscape and relaxing
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:25.800]   outside.
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:27.960]   It's just that indoor/outdoor living that I really like.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.620]   And you've got to find what's good for you.
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:35.500]   If you've been used to just looking outside the window at another building, I'm telling
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:40.880]   you straight up folks that it is so much better and so much more relaxing and so much more
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.840]   calming to have that view.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:47.420]   So I do believe that view properties will outperform going forward.
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.280]   And it's funny because the only property I did sell in my portfolio was in 2017 and it
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.760]   was a house without a view.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:56.400]   It was just facing another building.
[00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.640]   And so the feng shui, as I really, really care about, wasn't really there.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:06.080]   Yeah, it faced east-west, it had three bedrooms on one floor and stuff like that.
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:11.260]   But there's really a difference when you enter a property and you can just feel the positive
[00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:13.720]   energy and the negative energy.
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:17.880]   And this is why anybody listing a property during the coronavirus pandemic and the shelter
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:23.680]   in place is probably not doing themselves a good job in terms of getting the maximum
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.800]   price.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:30.140]   It's very hard to buy property without walking through the property and feeling the property,
[00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.760]   seeing the property, touching the property.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:36.780]   And so if you're listing now, it's tough because open houses aren't back to normal.
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:41.920]   You just can't rush in to take a look at a property on a Sunday afternoon between 2 to
[00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:42.920]   4 p.m.
[00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:44.280]   You've got to make a private appointment.
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:48.920]   And so when you create that friction of buying property, that demand is just not going to
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.160]   be there.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   And that emotional buying that many sellers count on to get that top price is not going
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:56.200]   to be there.
[00:10:56.200 --> 00:11:00.900]   So on the flip side, if you're a buyer and you're pre-approved, this is your time.
[00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.940]   This is your time to hunt aggressively, to look for those deals or look for those amazing
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:10.820]   properties that you couldn't have gotten before the pandemic because there would be just a
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.500]   bidding frenzy.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.580]   This happens a lot in San Francisco.
[00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:18.380]   And I know it's happening in a lot of other places because I've surveyed my followers
[00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:19.380]   on Twitter.
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:22.740]   I've asked people on my newsletter, what are you seeing?
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:29.300]   And people from Connecticut to Michigan to Indianapolis to Seattle to Las Vegas to Tahoe
[00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:35.120]   are all saying that the uptick in buying interest is really high right now.
[00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:38.220]   And this is mid-June 2020.
[00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:43.300]   And you're seeing the U.S. Mortgage Purchase Index really ramp in May as well.
[00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.480]   So a lot of people are interested in buying.
[00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:46.480]   They're getting pre-approved.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:51.940]   And it sure seems like there is a suppression and pent up demand for real estate.
[00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.980]   And the spring buying season is just going to shift to the summer and fall.
[00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:57.180]   So just be prepared.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.180]   Watch out.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.780]   Of course, who knows what will happen.
[00:11:59.780 --> 00:12:04.620]   But people do want to own nicer properties because they're spending more time in their
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:10.140]   properties and maybe they're thinking, well, stocks have had their rebound in their run.
[00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:11.140]   They're so volatile.
[00:12:11.140 --> 00:12:15.900]   Let's just spend money and buy something that we can actually utilize and enjoy.
[00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:17.660]   And it might go up in value.
[00:12:17.660 --> 00:12:21.500]   And if it doesn't, at least we'll have a good time in the process.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:24.820]   So anyway, I hope everyone enjoyed this episode.
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.040]   It's really tough thinking about climate change and buying and all this stuff during this
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:30.040]   uncertain time.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:33.040]   There's just more uncertainty, right, with climate change.
[00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:36.060]   And we really just have to think about the present.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:37.940]   How well do we want to live right now?
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:41.020]   And I think more and more people are thinking we've been cooped up.
[00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:44.060]   Let's live a better life right now.
[00:12:44.060 --> 00:12:48.100]   And how should we think about our investments in the future if we're going to pass them
[00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:50.020]   down to our children?
[00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:52.020]   And finally, I just realized something.
[00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:56.900]   It's tough to continue to record episodes and write posts while taking care of two kids
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:57.900]   and all that.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.020]   So if you're struggling to get your work done while taking care of a family, I feel you.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:04.020]   I hear you.
[00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:08.140]   I've been waking up by 5 a.m. every single morning trying to write and record and stay
[00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:13.180]   committed to the Financial Samurai community and to stay committed to my goal of trying
[00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:17.700]   to bring knowledge and financial freedom to as many people as possible.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:23.500]   So if you can couple something enjoyable with something that takes work, I think you're
[00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.440]   going to be able to work much easier.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.260]   For example, I love going to the hot tub.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:30.060]   I can be in the hot tub for two hours.
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:31.060]   It's kind of nuts.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:32.060]   I don't know.
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.500]   Maybe in another life I was a hot tub critter.
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:38.540]   But from now on, I'm going to make it a mission to say that every single time I go to the
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:41.440]   hot tub, I'm going to record an episode.
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:44.700]   Maybe it's only five minutes or maybe it's 10 to 15 minutes.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:49.420]   Whatever the case may be, what's 10 to 15 minutes of recording if I'm going to be there
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:50.420]   for one hour?
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:55.700]   So find something you enjoy doing and couple it with some work that you have to do.
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:14:00.140]   If you do that, I think you're going to do better work, more enjoyable work, and you're
[00:14:00.140 --> 00:14:02.300]   going to last for a much longer time.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:03.300]   Thanks so much.
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.580]   If you enjoyed this episode and this podcast, please share it around and I'd appreciate
[00:14:07.580 --> 00:14:08.380]   a great review.
