[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.340]   - You're listening to Let's Talk Jobs,
[00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.500]   where we give you practical insights into jobs and careers.
[00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.380]   Today, we're talking about dealing with failure.
[00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:18.100]   We've all been there, we've all done that,
[00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.660]   we've experienced that in highs,
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.380]   and when the stakes are really huge,
[00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.300]   and we experienced at low levels as well.
[00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.460]   It's always there as a part of growth.
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.140]   Jesse, you wanna lead us off, like share your failure story
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.440]   and how you dealt with it.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.860]   - Sure, my failure story,
[00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.860]   and, you know, I wanna say that fear of failure,
[00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.500]   you know, is a real thing, like,
[00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.620]   and not that this is a surprise to anybody,
[00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.900]   but I think there's various levels of it.
[00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.460]   And my fear of failure story comes into play.
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.300]   A few years ago, I was brought on a project for a startup.
[00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.380]   And at the time the startup, all they had was a pitch deck,
[00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.420]   and I was originally brought in
[00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.300]   just to help clean up their pitch deck.
[00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.060]   They didn't have a name,
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.420]   they didn't really have a refined positioning,
[00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:10.100]   they didn't really understand the market opportunity.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.460]   They were building a product,
[00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.380]   but they weren't sure about, obviously, product market fit.
[00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.260]   They hadn't raised any money, but maybe a little bit.
[00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.540]   So in those first few months,
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.140]   it was just working through some naming options,
[00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.400]   some streamlining of the positioning,
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.820]   some trying to make the deck look a little bit better.
[00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:28.980]   So when they went and presented it
[00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.420]   in front of potential investors,
[00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.260]   they could get a little more traction.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:35.220]   And I worked with them for months and months and months,
[00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.560]   and eventually we came up with a name,
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.340]   and we were building, I was brought on as a consultant,
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.540]   but I became more and more involved with them.
[00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.540]   And originally the idea was to build this product
[00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.480]   that was, let's just say it was something like a CMS
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.480]   for 3D websites.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.040]   So something that maybe no one had specifically done before,
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.120]   there were content management systems
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.960]   that have been created to build websites,
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.820]   but not specifically for 3D websites.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.640]   At the time, not necessarily 3D,
[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.520]   but VR was becoming more of a,
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.680]   and AR was becoming more of a prominent technology.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.500]   And so I was brought on at that point
[00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.260]   when the positioning had been a little bit more refined,
[00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.620]   we had gone through some pitch deck iterations
[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.460]   to get something that was useful.
[00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.940]   They had a couple more partners and other folks
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.060]   that they had brought on to fill out the team,
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.220]   and they started to raise some money.
[00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.500]   Not a ton of money, not, you know, series A money,
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.860]   let's call it, so less than 5 million.
[00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.160]   And all of a sudden,
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.080]   what had been a project around the CMS idea,
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.540]   which seemed like it had tremendous potential,
[00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.420]   you know, there's established businesses in the space
[00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.440]   that had been getting some real traction,
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.200]   like a business like,
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.380]   forget the spacing on the name,
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.080]   the e-commerce engine, stretch of the nest that,
[00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.360]   where you can spin up a website and then the business,
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.800]   and it'll come to me in a minute.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.160]   But in any case, so we had this business idea
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.140]   and we started building out the prototypes
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.480]   and getting that ready and all sorts of things like that.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.120]   And the founders came to me and said,
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.200]   we want you to come on in a large capacity,
[00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.280]   we want you to be our first marketer.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.400]   And they said, we want you to be our CMO,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.800]   but, you know, it was a CMO with a team of one.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.800]   So, and I think that speaks to my sense of how scared I was
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.640]   of taking on a role where I didn't,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.720]   while I had run a business before and taking it on clients
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.880]   where I was responsible for developing their marketing plans,
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.160]   their brand strategy, their content marketing plans,
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.600]   their digital marketing and all of that,
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   I had never been brought in as a person with equity,
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.320]   a stake in the company with skin in the game.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.320]   And so it had a whole nother sort of level of engagement.
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:25.760]   And I was really afraid, I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.840]   I wasn't sure it was the right job for me.
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.640]   And, you know, but the founder had enough,
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   the two founders had enough confidence in,
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.800]   I guess the skills I had and the experience I had
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.200]   that they said, look, we want you to build a brand.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.320]   We want you to build out a marketing plan.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.240]   We want you to help us bring this product to life,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.520]   to market.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.160]   We want you to help us find a product market fit.
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.880]   We want you to hire a team, all that stuff.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.400]   And so I started to do that.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.920]   And then we pivoted.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:03.040]   And what was a project to build this CMS
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.560]   became a project to launch an NFT,
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.240]   line of luxury NFT watches,
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.880]   which sounds like an amazing idea, like Rolex,
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.480]   but NFT Rolexes, which is kind of what it was.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:20.360]   And the founder had all these connections
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.720]   to Italian design and had actually created then
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.160]   these digital watches.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.120]   They only existed virtually, right?
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:30.640]   And at the time, NFTs was this booming market.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:34.560]   And there was lots of hype around it.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.960]   And people like Snoop Dogg were buying NFTs
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.360]   and they were selling for millions and millions of dollars.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:45.360]   And so we pivoted and we started getting ready
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.000]   to go to market with this limited edition
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.960]   of luxury watches.
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.320]   And I had hired a team.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.120]   We had a team of amazing designers and writers
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:57.320]   and a PR person.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.320]   And I hired a social media expert
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.480]   and paid media specialist.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.080]   And some other had worked with some publications
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.280]   to get PR articles placed and found ways
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.680]   to get the CEO in front of influencers
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.720]   who could interview him and get him some traction online.
[00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:24.280]   And we started making waves and developing a brand
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:27.320]   and building all the assets we needed to go to market.
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.640]   And then I started seeding the message in the market.
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.480]   So we bought a lot of paid media
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.480]   and spent a lot of money on paid media, probably too much.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.400]   And in any event, we had a rather large following
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:49.680]   and it came to launch the campaign.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:51.640]   And it's sort of like,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.280]   this kind of market is based on exclusivity.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.120]   It's you have a limited number of things
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.960]   that you bring to the market.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.560]   People think they're valuable because they're exclusive.
[00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:03.960]   It drives up the price and they're NFT.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.120]   So they're not physical things there.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.000]   You could like bring them into your virtual world
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.720]   and put an NFT watch on your,
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.720]   in your virtual world.
[00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:17.440]   So it's, and there was a lot of sort of hype around it.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:21.400]   And what I found in developing the marketing efforts
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.160]   to bring it to life was I had to work
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.920]   with various influencers on Instagram and other places
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.760]   which would often be like these sort of side deals
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.760]   where you pay somebody $200 to tweet out like one message
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.080]   and another person would charge $20,000 for a tweet.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.560]   Like I literally had this spreadsheet
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.360]   with all the various influencers
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:45.520]   from the couple hundred dollars ones
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.880]   to the ones that were charging
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:50.200]   hundreds of thousands of dollars a tweet.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.800]   And that was in this world,
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.720]   that's how you cultivated your brand.
[00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.920]   And we launched and the site didn't work.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   And it was the, while the products were on OpenSea
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:09.520]   which was the NFT site, we sold six out of 50.
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:16.400]   And so the fear of failure kind of like manifested itself
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:20.640]   in that the project really didn't do so well.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:22.160]   And they didn't lose all their money
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.520]   but they lost a lot of it.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:26.880]   And now they pivoted to another opportunity
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.440]   in the same related space design
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.680]   and VR and that kind of world.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:36.720]   But my fear of failure kind of was, oh, I can't do this.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:38.840]   In fact, I did do it.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.960]   Like I did hire a team.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:40.800]   I did build a brand.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.920]   I did bring the project to market.
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.640]   You know, I did all the digital media stuff.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.640]   I did the PR stuff.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:48.360]   And I think some of it is related
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.400]   to what we talked about earlier
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.160]   in terms of imposter syndrome
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.400]   is the imposter syndrome was like dragging me along
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.680]   saying I couldn't do it.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:56.840]   And even if I was doing it, I'd be exposed as a fraud
[00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.840]   'cause I've never really been a CMO
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:01.040]   or whatever I was, you know, lead marketer.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:04.960]   And I was afraid that if I failed
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:06.280]   like I'd let the investors down
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.960]   or let the founders down and all this.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.600]   And in some ways we failed, but I think it's very,
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:19.680]   you know, it's a very common thing in the startup market
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.080]   especially in one that's so volatile.
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:25.080]   And so, yes, I had a definite fear of failure
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:28.320]   and a little bit of imposter syndrome thrown in.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:30.600]   And it all kind of didn't materialize
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.200]   in the way I thought it would.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.520]   And, you know, even though I was compensated fairly
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.200]   for my time there, the equity ended up,
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.040]   you know, never being worth anything.
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.360]   And though I still have quite a bit of equity,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.920]   you know, it doesn't amount to anything
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.320]   unless something significant changes.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:49.000]   It was a really good experience though.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.320]   It was a really good experience
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:53.160]   because I went through it despite all my fears.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.520]   I learned a lot about marketing,
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.280]   a lot about bringing a team together, building a brand
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.720]   which I had sort of done before,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.200]   but not in a way that I had such an ownership stake
[00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.800]   in the business.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.640]   And so some of those things like the fears,
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.640]   the fears that we bring to our job
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:14.720]   are a little bit of a reality check.
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   Like, oh yeah, you might never have done this before.
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:21.680]   But reality, in the sense of maybe it's not,
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:25.320]   it's not an experience of something that's happened
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.800]   in my past, but it's something I'm gonna do now.
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.520]   And it's sort of, I have to take that leap
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:31.520]   in order to learn.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.080]   I think that's something that as creatives
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:39.720]   and as marketers, we're sort of like the original humans
[00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:43.440]   out there on the Savannah with, you know, in a way,
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:46.600]   I think it's a little bit like,
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.440]   you're leaping into the unknown.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:50.800]   You may, you know, the earliest,
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:52.040]   I'm getting philosophical here,
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.640]   but like the earliest people,
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.320]   and they're picking up whatever they're picking up
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.160]   to go up and get food.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.360]   And they don't really know because there's no stories,
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.120]   there's no Facebook, there's no, you know,
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.600]   New York Times to tell them or Amazon to tell them
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:07.440]   how to do these things,
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:09.680]   but they're leaping out into the future to try and,
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.000]   you know, capture the bison or whatever.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.560]   And we're kind of trying to do that in a way,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:16.960]   despite the fears.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:21.920]   And I think it's somewhat heroic to take on those things
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:24.880]   that we don't think we can do.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.760]   We think we're gonna fail and do it anyway.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:29.920]   And I think that's kind of the lesson I would,
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:30.760]   you know, take from that.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.400]   Get properly prepared, you know, do all your research,
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.360]   lean into other people for things you may feel
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:39.960]   you're not strong at, but, you know, take the leap.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.800]   - How about you, Troy?
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.480]   Is there a similar story for you
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.640]   in how you dealt with failure?
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.240]   - I've actually got two totally different stories
[00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.400]   and I'll keep them short,
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:53.360]   but I just want to react to Jesse's thing
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.480]   about sort of failure.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:58.920]   I think failure, I think for most people,
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:02.880]   will define your career path more than success
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.520]   because you, by going through these moments
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.840]   and having these, you learn a lot about
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:14.640]   what situations you don't want, you know, moving forward
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.000]   in terms of how you make choices and the paths you take.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   You learn an awful lot through failure and stress
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.160]   and anxiety and all the things that go with it.
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:31.320]   The biggest, so I have a job failure
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.480]   and then I have a project failure.
[00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.480]   Job failure was a failure because I felt like
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:41.640]   I was the perfect fit for the perfect job.
[00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:44.880]   It was a technology that I loved.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.320]   It was a software as a service company,
[00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:49.200]   but it was a company that I loved the story.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:53.760]   It was, had elements of my job
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:56.960]   that I had great experience with.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.120]   I fit the profile.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:02.280]   I felt better than any other candidate
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.360]   I could possibly imagine.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.360]   But my first week on the job,
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.120]   the company fired the head of products,
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:11.760]   they fired the CEO.
[00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:14.840]   And basically it was the beginning of three years
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:19.840]   of just weirdness, unease, insecurity for me.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.960]   Like I never really do.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:24.920]   I reported at one point to the new CEO.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.840]   I reported at one point to the head of sales
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.040]   who didn't want a marketing report.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:32.760]   At one point, I wasn't sure who I was reporting to.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.160]   And there's just so many forces working against me,
[00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.800]   even though I still look back and I'm still,
[00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:44.160]   I still, to this day, I feel like,
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:47.440]   I should have done things differently.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.480]   For one, I should have been more confident in my abilities
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:52.280]   and maybe I couldn't get out of my own head
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.080]   and couldn't get past my insecurity
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:57.000]   to where I was just focused on action.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.760]   I could have been more, I could have had more action.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:01.800]   I did some good things, some good work that I'm proud of
[00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:02.880]   and I don't wanna go into details,
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.200]   but by and large, I was stuck in my head
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:08.120]   and I couldn't, I simply wanted to,
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:11.840]   I was focused on survival rather than doing the work.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:17.160]   So my takeaway there is,
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:24.120]   it's advice to myself and anybody else out there,
[00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:26.240]   but try to focus on,
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:30.400]   try to focus on the work,
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:32.600]   not necessarily the environmental forces
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:35.000]   that you don't control and feel proud of,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.080]   try to feel proud of what you do
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:39.560]   rather than proud of your standing
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:42.040]   based on what you think other people think of you.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:45.520]   Anyway, so that was my job failure.
[00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:50.920]   Project failure was,
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:55.600]   as a freelance writer, this was probably about two years ago,
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.040]   I was hired by a healthcare startup
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.800]   to write a hello world post,
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:02.520]   basically sort of announcing that they've arrived,
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.560]   they've got a sort of an early solution,
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.640]   they have a couple of rounds of funding
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:14.200]   and really tell the story of the opportunity that they saw.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:16.520]   And as storytellers, we always like to focus
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:20.080]   on personal bits of narrative,
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:22.720]   but this particular startup was co-founded
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   by a husband and wife,
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:26.960]   which that's always kind of an interesting story too.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.080]   Sometimes those work, sometimes they don't.
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:32.360]   They both had, he had a technical background
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.400]   and she had a sort of a pharmaceutical background.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.400]   And there's a great story about how they met
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:44.560]   and sort of how they both ended up at this point.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.880]   It's like, oh, this is fantastic.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:48.160]   I mean, I have this really nice,
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.400]   sort of powerful personal anecdotes
[00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:54.560]   as the jumping off point to really tell their story.
[00:15:54.560 --> 00:15:58.800]   But then like I spent probably an hour and a half
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.040]   talking with the woman and she shared all of this,
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.960]   but then after the briefing found out
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.360]   he didn't want to share any of the personal stuff.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.160]   He wanted to be focused on just the business opportunity.
[00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:13.040]   And there was elements of a story there,
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.480]   but I knew it just, I'd lost a lot of power
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   and just a really, really moving story.
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:30.240]   So I felt a little defeated the whole way through,
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.680]   but my mission at that point is like,
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.960]   I just, I wanted to write something and get it to them.
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   And I did, and then what I wrote,
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.480]   I thought was actually pretty good.
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:40.080]   They never actually used it.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:42.760]   They never actually told the whole world story.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:45.480]   They just kind of like continued down their path.
[00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:49.840]   I don't know if they're actually gonna launch ever,
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:52.600]   but my takeaway from that was like,
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:54.360]   I was hired to do something.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.240]   A certain point I realized it wasn't going well.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.360]   And so I kind of wanted to just bail fast,
[00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:03.560]   just to get something done,
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:06.000]   do what I said I was gonna do, get it to them,
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.120]   call it a day and move on.
[00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:12.800]   So that, I think, throughout your career, the listeners,
[00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:15.360]   you'll come across different circumstances
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:17.920]   that you might recognize at a certain point
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:19.200]   they're probably not winnable.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.440]   And I think it's important to just,
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.440]   rather than try to save some of those,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:27.320]   sometimes it's better just to cut your losses and move on.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:30.920]   - Yeah, I love the last part,
[00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:34.880]   'cause failure is always gonna happen, right?
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.480]   The question is, what now?
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.200]   I had an experience even just past work
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:44.960]   with some members of my team where something happened,
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:48.640]   it was unplanned for, unexpected,
[00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:50.360]   and there was a small window
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:55.360]   of which many people could see this mistake on a website.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:59.560]   And obviously they were freaked out about it,
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:00.720]   and rightfully so.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.600]   I mean, that's healthy, actually, I mean, you care.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.960]   But so my first question to them was,
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.760]   I was like, okay, cool, what did you expect to happen?
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:10.080]   What happened?
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:12.440]   And what are we gonna do now?
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.120]   Are we just gonna let it go?
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.560]   Are we gonna course correct it?
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:18.320]   Are we gonna observe and measure?
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:21.040]   And I think when you're dealing with failure,
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.920]   the best thing you can do is be objective about it
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.360]   and strip away all emotion.
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.200]   And that's actually the hardest part,
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:29.680]   but the emotion does cloud your judgment
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.120]   and makes you react too quickly,
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:34.320]   makes you make the wrong decision sometimes
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.440]   because you're making an emotional call
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:38.920]   or a reactive decision, right?
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:41.360]   So for me, and this is easier said than done,
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.800]   and of course, if the stakes are higher,
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:49.680]   your need to rapidly get to a conclusion is more paramount.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.080]   But my first guide is always like,
[00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:54.040]   I'm just gonna be objective about it
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.280]   and figure out what my ideal outcome is
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:57.800]   and document really quickly.
[00:18:57.800 --> 00:19:01.800]   And I remember earlier in my career,
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:03.800]   and there's an older video we talked about,
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.760]   which is like, I had a harsh manager
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:10.240]   and how do I deal with failure under that purview
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:13.560]   or deal with, and harsh feedback is all kind of tied to that.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.280]   What I did not do enough of during those points of failures
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:20.960]   was give myself room to breathe and think.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:24.120]   And so I immediately internalized all the failures,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:28.040]   assumed everything was true, and I became reactive.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:30.240]   I was in fix-it Felix mode on everything,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.280]   just trying to fix, fix, fix, fix, fix.
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.200]   In some instances,
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:37.480]   that actually hurt me a lot more than it helped.
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.920]   I think in those points of failures,
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.120]   I wish, what I would have done is,
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.520]   if the failure come from a source of truth
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:48.360]   that was incorrect,
[00:19:48.360 --> 00:19:50.040]   maybe you're in a position where
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.560]   maybe things aren't failures
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:54.920]   and someone else is forcing the narrative on you,
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.560]   maybe by circumstance, politics, or whatever it is,
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:02.240]   going to the individual and asking the pointed questions
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.280]   to get down to the nugget of truth
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.400]   becomes really, really important, right?
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:10.080]   The easiest open question is, what does that mean to you?
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:13.000]   And if you can ask that three times in sequence,
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.240]   you'll get down to the truth, right?
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:17.880]   If it's not an objective failure,
[00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.840]   if someone has a impression or whatever,
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:21.240]   it's like, cool, I understand your impression,
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:22.720]   what does that impression mean to you?
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:23.760]   They'll explain it.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:25.240]   Oh, interesting, you just mentioned something,
[00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.080]   like, what does that mean to you?
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:27.920]   They'll explain it again.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:30.280]   Okay, well, if that what you just said
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.320]   were to be different, how would that look like?
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.160]   And then they'll say,
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.400]   well, that's how you'll uncover the truth nugget
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.640]   behind everything, right?
[00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:39.000]   And that's how you deal with harsh feedback.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.160]   I deal with failure the same way.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:45.120]   Things are objectively failures, or they're subjective.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.040]   And in the world of web, when things are objective,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:50.520]   it's the, it's sitting down and figuring out,
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.040]   like, what's the core structure of my mind?
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.080]   I like what you said, Troy, about letting some things fail.
[00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.760]   And I'll give you guys an example.
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:00.080]   And those who work with me right now,
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:00.920]   I'm gonna out myself
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:02.920]   'cause you're about to hear my strategy.
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.560]   With web, we're a service organization,
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.520]   and we serve many masters.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:13.760]   Product marketing, comms, support, executive team,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:14.880]   you name it.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.280]   And the larger the organization,
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:18.720]   the more requests you're gonna come in.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:22.520]   And when you don't have resources to execute on it,
[00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:24.320]   you become restrained, right?
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:25.680]   Now, either quality is gonna dip,
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:28.920]   or your SLAs are not gonna be met.
[00:21:28.920 --> 00:21:33.560]   Sometimes, to get people to learn
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:36.600]   or adopt your processes, your SLAs,
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:38.360]   you almost have to allow things
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:40.680]   to fall through intentionally
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:43.080]   so they experience the failure.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.080]   Like, using failure as a tool
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.880]   to illustrate a pressure point, right?
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:50.680]   You don't do it on the big ones
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:52.320]   where everyone's gonna be at political risk,
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.520]   but you surgically pick the right ones
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:55.400]   that illustrate a point
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:57.360]   where the stakes aren't super high.
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:00.640]   And so, I actually use failure as a tool, frequently,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.520]   with either individuals.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:04.440]   And of course, these aren't all necessary failures,
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.160]   but failure here is defined as an outcome
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:10.040]   that doesn't meet your expectation, right?
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.560]   And so, maybe that's a deadline that can't be met.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:15.960]   And so, that happens all the time.
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.920]   And again, there's always gonna be scales to failure.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:20.680]   But I like what you guys are all saying, essentially.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:24.800]   It's like, strip yourself away from the emotions of it,
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.040]   diagnose and break it down,
[00:22:27.040 --> 00:22:30.000]   figure out if there's gonna be actually a plan to fix it,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.880]   or do you just let it go, right?
[00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:36.360]   And sometimes, because you're sitting so close to it,
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:38.240]   the failure feels a lot,
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:40.400]   like a bigger deal than it actually is.
