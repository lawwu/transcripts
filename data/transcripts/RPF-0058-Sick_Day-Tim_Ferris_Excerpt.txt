[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.320]   Welcome to the Radical Personal Finance Podcast. I'm your host, Joshua Sheets. This is a special
[00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.040]   sick day edition of the show. If you're not a normal listener, please check back for some of
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.800]   the more "normal" shows if you'd like to get a flavor of the show. This is just a special
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.920]   sick day version where I'm releasing some content that I think will be thought-provoking so as to
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.080]   make sure that the audience has something to keep them going each day. If you're a daily listener,
[00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.760]   you'll notice that this was actually released out of order. That's because I was flat on my back and
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.280]   unable to record the show. Today I want to bring your attention to a piece of audio that I recently
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.120]   heard when listening to Tim Ferriss' interview with Kevin Kelly. Kevin Kelly is the founder of
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.240]   Wired Magazine. I had known him as that, but I had no idea how interesting his life was
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.600]   until I listened to this interview. Again, this is on The Tim Ferriss Show, which is a podcast that
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.280]   Tim has started, which is really quite enjoyable. I haven't listened to all of the episodes,
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.920]   but the ones that I've listened to have really enjoyed the interviews that he's conducted.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.160]   What I was struck by in this selection of audio is I was struck by hearing somebody completely
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.840]   independently talk about some of the concepts that we've talked about here on the show,
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:38.560]   specifically about designing your own path and also about figuring out how to cut the fear
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.560]   out of financial insecurity. I think you'll find some of these concepts interesting. This is a
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.880]   nine-minute piece of audio. I encourage you to check for the link in the show notes or just go
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.280]   over to the fourhourblog.com/podcast, which is where Tim hosts his show, and look for the three
[00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:00.720]   episodes with his interview with Kevin Kelly. I don't know much about Kevin, or Mr. Kelly,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.320]   I guess I should call him. I don't know much about him. I haven't read any of his books before,
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.480]   but I have certainly put him on my list now as someone that I'm interested in getting to know
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.160]   a little bit. Usually I mean that in the reading his work and studying his work sense,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.960]   although I'd be honored to meet him at some point. He sounds like quite the Renaissance man,
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.760]   and he sounds like somebody who probably, if my gut instinct is any indication,
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.800]   probably embodies many of the ideas and the ideals that I think we strive for.
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.680]   In the interview, you'll hear that if you'll go and listen to the full show, I'm only excerpting
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.720]   a nine-minute section. In the interview, though, you'll hear he's quite the Renaissance man,
[00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.000]   interested and involved in many unique things. It just seems like he's built a life out of doing
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.320]   things that he loves. I don't know anything about his financial situation. I would imagine that he
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.560]   is living well comfortably. I don't know if he is wealthy or not. He and Tim later in the interview
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120]   that I've not excerpted, but they talk some about the values of being rich and the values of not
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.240]   being rich. It's also an interesting part of the show. He really just sounds like someone who's
[00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.600]   built a life and a lifestyle that he loves to live. He sounds really unique. He sounds like a
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.760]   neat guy. I'm definitely going to go and start reading some of his books and getting to know him
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:24.000]   a little bit more as a person through his work. Nothing else for right now. Enjoy this nine-minute
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.960]   excerpt of the interview and consider some of the personal finance lessons in this nine-minute
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.520]   excerpt. If you're interested in more, follow the link through or go over to the 4-Hour Blog
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:43.280]   or look up the Tim Ferriss Show on iTunes or on whatever podcatcher you use. I hope you enjoy
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.600]   that. I'll be back as soon as I can with normal shows. Thanks for listening.
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   You do have, of course, a background. A lot of people are familiar with your background
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.120]   with Wired, but perhaps you could give folks a bit of background on yourself.
[00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.520]   Is it true that you dropped out of college after one year?
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.640]   Yeah, I'm a college dropout. Actually, my one regret in life is that one year that I gave.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:09.920]   Oh, no kidding. No kidding.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.560]   Yeah, I wish I had just even skipped that. I do understand how college can be useful to people.
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:24.800]   My own children have gone through, but for me, it was just not the right thing. I went to Asia
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.600]   instead. I like to tell myself that I gave my own self a PhD in East Asian Studies
[00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:39.200]   by traveling around and photographing very remote parts of Asia at a time when it was
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.680]   in a transition from the ancient world to the modern world. I did many other things as well.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.760]   For me, it was a very formative time because I did enough things that when I finally got my
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   first real job at the age of 35â€” Wow. Which job was that?
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:05:02.160]   I worked for a non-profit at $10 an hour, which was the Whole Earth Catalog.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:07.760]   Which had been a lifelong dream. If I said, "If I'm going to have a job, that's the job I want,"
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:13.120]   it took me a long time to get it. But in between that, I did many things, including starting
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:20.080]   businesses and selling businesses and doing other kinds of things, more adventures. I
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:26.000]   highly recommend it. I got involved in Starting Wired and Running Wired for a while. I hired a
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.600]   lot of people who were coming right out of college. They were internists. They would do the
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:39.280]   intern thing. They were good, and we would hire them. After 10 years, this was their first and
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:47.360]   only job. I kept telling them, "Why are you here? What are you doing? You should be fooling around,
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.280]   wasting time, trying something crazy. Why are you working a real job? I don't understand it."
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:05.120]   I really recommend Slack. I'm a big believer in this thing of doing something that's not
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:12.240]   productive. Productive is for your middle ages. When you're young, you want to be prolific and
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:17.680]   make and do things, but you don't want to measure them in terms of productivity. You want to measure
[00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:25.040]   them in terms of extreme performance. You want to measure them in extreme satisfaction. It's
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:32.800]   a time to try stuff. Explore the extremes. Exactly. Explore the possibilities. There are
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.400]   so many possibilities. There's more every day. It's called premature optimization.
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:47.280]   You really want to use this time to continue to do things. By the way, premature optimization is a
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:51.440]   problem of success, too. It's not just the problem of the young. It's the problem of the successful
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.520]   more than even of the young. We'll get to that. That's a long answer.
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.280]   That might turn into a therapy session for me at this precise moment in time, in fact.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:06.720]   Yes, exactly. When you are exploring that Slack, I would imagine many people feel pressured,
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.400]   whether it's internal pressure or societal, familial pressure, to get a real job, to support
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.440]   themselves. A lot of the decisions are made out of fear. They worry about being out on the streets,
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.640]   or it's a nebulous terror or anxiety. How did you support yourself, for instance,
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.600]   while you were traveling through Asia when you left school?
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.920]   I totally understand this anxiety and fear and stuff. Here's the thing. I think one of the many
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:39.920]   life skills you want to actually learn at a fairly young age is the skill of being ultra-thrifty,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:46.560]   minimal, this little wisp that is traveling through time. In the sense of learning how
[00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:53.120]   little you actually need to live, not just in survival mode, but in a contented mode.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:08:00.080]   I learned that pretty early by backpacking and doing other things, especially in Asia. I could
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:06.160]   be very happy with very, very little. You could go onto websites and stuff and look at the minimum
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:13.120]   amount of food, say, that you need to live, your basic protein and carbohydrates and vitamins,
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.800]   and how much, actually, if you bought them in bulk, how much it would cost. You build your
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:25.200]   own house, live in a shelter, a tiny house. You don't need very much. I think trying that out,
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.160]   building your house on the pond like Thoreau, who was a hero of mine in high school, is
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.480]   a not just a simple exercise, it's a profound exercise because it allows you to get over the
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:42.240]   anxiety. Even if you aren't living like that, you know that if the worst came to worst,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:49.600]   you could keep going at a very low rate and be content. That gives you the confidence
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:54.560]   to take a risk because you say, "What's the worst that could happen?" Well, the worst that could
[00:08:54.560 --> 00:09:01.440]   happen is that I'd have a backpack and a sleeping bag, and I'd be eating oatmeal and whatever,
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:07.600]   and I'd be fine. I think if you do that once or twice, you don't necessarily have to live like
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.480]   that, but knowing that you can be content is tremendously empowering. That's what I did.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:20.160]   That's basically what I did. It was living in Asia where the people around me had less than I did,
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:25.840]   and they were pretty content. You realize, "Oh my gosh, I don't really need very much to be happy."
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:32.080]   And did you save up money beforehand with odd jobs, or did you do odd jobs while on the road,
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:38.480]   a bit of both? I did odd jobs before I left. I was traveling in Asia at a time when the
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:48.000]   price differential was so great that it actually made sense for me to fly back on a charter flight
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:54.560]   to the US and work for four or five months. I worked basically odd jobs. I worked from
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:10:01.600]   working in a warehouse, packaging athletic shoes, working in a technical sense of aâ€”it's
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.480]   really hard to describe, but it was a photography-related job where we were reducing
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:14.720]   printed circuit boards down to little sizes to be shipped off to be printed, and driving cars to
[00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:24.000]   whatever else I could find. That, at that time, made more money. I could live probably two years
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:31.120]   from those couple months of work. I didn't really work while I was traveling until I got to Iran
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:39.920]   in the late '70s. There, there was a very high-paying job, which was teaching English to the
[00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:44.640]   Iranian pilots who worked for the Shah. But I had sworn I was never going to teach English,
[00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:52.080]   so I actually got a job in Bellahat Helicopter, who was teaching English to the pilots. My job
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:58.000]   was running a little newsletter for the American community there. I worked there until I was thrown
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.520]   out by the coup. That was another story. Why did thatâ€”
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:06.400]   Now, just a couple of comments. Number one, for those people listening who are saying to
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:12.240]   themselves, already perhaps creating reasons why they can't do what you did now due to different
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:17.200]   economic climate or whatnot, it is entirely possible to replicate what you did. You just
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.080]   have to choose your locations wisely for that type of differential.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:26.240]   And I should also just mention to people that part of the reason I'm so attracted to Stoic
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:33.360]   philosophy, whether that be Seneca or Marcus Aurelius, is exactly because of the practice of
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:39.040]   poverty. Not because you want to be poor, but so that you recognize not only that you can subsist,
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:45.440]   but then you can potentially be content, or even in some cases be more content, with a bare minimum.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.720]   So for people who are more interested in that, I highly recommend a lot of the Stoic writings,
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.800]   and you can search for those on my blog and elsewhere.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:56.000]   Let me just add to that. There's actually a New Age version of that that was popular a
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.080]   generation ago, and the search term there is "volunteer simplicity."
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:02.400]   Volunteer simplicity.
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:07.600]   Right. And so the idea is poverty is terrible when it's mandatory, when you have no choice,
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:13.520]   but a volunteer version of that is very, very powerful. And I think attaching names sometimes
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:19.200]   to things, it makes it more legitimate. But imagine yourself practicing voluntary simplicity.
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:23.440]   And that, I think, is part of that Stoic philosophy. But there was a whole kind of a
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.800]   movement. A lot of the hippie dropouts were kind of practicing a similar thing, and there was,
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:34.800]   you know, a whole best practices that resolved around that. You can make up your own. But I
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:40.000]   think it's, to me, an essential skill, a life skill, that people should acquire.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.120]   And when you go backpacking and stuff like that, that's part of it. That's the beginnings of trying
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:52.160]   to understand what it is that you need to live as a being. And you can fill that out in any way you
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.880]   want. But that's a good way to experiment. Hey, parents, join the LA Kings on Saturday,
