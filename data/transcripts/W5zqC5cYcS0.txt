[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880]   - Low frequency sounds of the sort that your voice is,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.980]   that late night FMDJ voice,
[00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.880]   are responded to in the brain by neurons,
[00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.040]   no surprise there.
[00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.360]   But the frequency that those neurons fire
[00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.000]   is also low frequency.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.540]   In other words, when you speak in your low voice,
[00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:26.760]   the other person's brain hears that
[00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.120]   and starts firing in a low frequency tone.
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.420]   In other words, it entrains to your voice,
[00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.880]   not just the timing,
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.020]   but it's actually like you're essentially playing
[00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.020]   an emotional piano down in the low keys of their mind.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.280]   Now, when you go up to the high frequencies,
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.020]   the neurons can't follow that high frequency.
[00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.460]   So there's something special about low frequency sound
[00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.760]   that actually changes the emotional tone
[00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.300]   of the people that hear that low frequency sound.
