[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.380]   and you see that manifest itself on D-Day, where you've got 6,939 vessels, of which there are 1,213
[00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:18.480]   warships, 4,127 assault craft, 12,500 aircraft, you know, 155,000 men landed and dropped from the
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:27.700]   air in a 24-hour period. It is phenomenal. It is absolutely phenomenal. The following is a
[00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.960]   conversation with James Holland, a historian specializing in World War II, who has written
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.380]   a lot of amazing books on the subject, especially covering the Western Front, often providing
[00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:46.120]   fascinating details at multiple levels of analysis, including strategic, operational, tactical,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.820]   technological, and of course, the human side, the personal accounts from the war. He also co-hosts a
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.320]   great podcast on World War II called We Have Ways of Making You Talk. This is a Lex Freeman
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.940]   podcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the description or at lexfreedman.com
[00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:16.000]   slash sponsors. And now, dear friends, here's James Holland. In Volume 1 of The War in the West,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.700]   your book series on World War II, you write, the Second World War witnessed the deaths of more
[00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:31.200]   than 60 million people from over 60 different countries. Entire cities were laid waste. National
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:37.900]   borders were redrawn, and many millions more people found themselves displaced. Over the past couple of
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.500]   decades, many of those living in the Middle East or parts of Africa, the Balkans, Afghanistan, and even the
[00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.700]   United States may feel justifiably that these troubled times have already proved the most traumatic in their
[00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.780]   recent past. Yet, globally, the Second World War was and remains the single biggest catastrophe of modern
[00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.960]   history. In terms of human drama, it is unrivaled. No other war has affected so many lives in such a large
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.700]   number of countries. So, what to you makes World War II the biggest catastrophe in human drama in modern
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.220]   history? And maybe from a historian perspective, the most fascinating subject to study?
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.920]   The thing about World War II is it really is truly global. You know, it's fought in deserts, it's fought
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:34.840]   in the Arctic, it's fought across oceans, it's fought in the air, it's in jungle, it's in the hills,
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:43.420]   it is on the beaches. It's also on the Russian steppe, and it's also in Ukraine. So, it's that
[00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.860]   global nature of it. And I just think, you know, where there's war, there is always incredible human
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.240]   drama. And I think for most people, and certainly the true in my case, you get drawn to the human
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:59.200]   drama of it. It's that thought that, you know, gosh, if I'd been 20 years old, how would I have dealt with it?
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.880]   You know, would I have been in the Army? Would I have been in the Air Force? Would I have been on a,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.040]   you know, Royal Navy destroyer? Or, you know, how would I have coped with it? And how would I have
[00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.720]   dealt with that separation? I mean, I've interviewed people who were away for four years. I remember
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.980]   talking to a tank man from Liverpool in England called Sam Bradshaw. And he went away for four
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.620]   years. And when he came home, he'd been twice wounded. He'd been very badly wounded in North Africa.
[00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.860]   And then he was shot in the neck in Italy, eventually got home. And when he came home,
[00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:34.860]   his mother had turned gray. His little baby sister, who had been, you know, 13 when he left,
[00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:41.000]   was now a young woman. His old school had been destroyed by Luftwaffe bombs. He didn't recognize
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.340]   the place. And do you know what he did? He joined up again, went back out of Europe and was one of the
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.900]   first people in Belsen. So, you know.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.360]   What was his justification for that, for joining right back?
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:58.620]   He just felt completely disconnected to home. He felt that the gulf of time, his experiences
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.220]   had separated him from all the normalities of life. And he felt that the normalities of the life
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:11.000]   that he had known before he'd gone away to war had just been severed in a really kind of cruel way that
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.800]   he didn't really feel he was able to confront at that particular point. But he decided to rejoin,
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:20.160]   couldn't go back to the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment, so went back to a different unit. Went from kind of the
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:25.960]   Italian campaign to European theatre. Didn't see so much action at the end. But, you know,
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.920]   like a lot of British troops, if you were in a certain division at a certain time, you know,
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.020]   you ended up passing very close to Belsen. And, you know, you suddenly realized, okay,
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.760]   this was the right thing to do. You know, we did have to get rid of Nazism. We did have to do this
[00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.000]   because this is the consequence. It's not just the oppression. It's just not just the secret police. It's not
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.440]   just the expansionism of Nazism. It is also, you know, the Holocaust, which hadn't been given its
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.200]   name at that point. But, you know, you're witnessing this kind of untold cruelty. And I always, you know,
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.440]   I've always sort of, I think a lot about Sam. I mean, he's no longer with us, but he was one of the
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.580]   kind of first people that I interviewed. And I interviewed him at great length. And I know you like
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.080]   a long interview, Lex. And I totally, totally get that. Because when you have a long interview,
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.540]   you really start getting to the nuts and bolts of it. One of the frustrations for me when I'm looking
[00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:22.500]   at oral histories of Second World War vets is usually they're kind of, you know, they're put
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:27.600]   on YouTube or they're put on a museum website. They're 30 minutes, you know, an hour if you're
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.400]   lucky. And they're just scratching the surface. You never really get to know it. You feel that they're
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.300]   just repeating kind of stuff they've read in books themselves after the war and stuff.
[00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.940]   And, you know, I was kind of leave feeling frustrated that I haven't had a chance to kind
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:44.200]   of grill them on the kind of stuff that I would grill them on if I was put in front of them.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:51.440]   So Tank Man, what was maybe the most epic, the most intense, or the most interesting story
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:52.340]   that he told you?
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.040]   Well, I do remember him telling me, funny enough, it's not really about the conflict. I remember
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:07.900]   him telling me about the importance of letters. And there was this guy who literally every few
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.440]   weeks, you know, post would arrive intermittently. There was no kind of sort of regular post. So it
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.880]   was supposed to be regular, but it didn't come out regularly. So you might suddenly get a flurry
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:22.920]   of five all in one day. But he said there was this guy and his tank, a member of a different tank
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:29.080]   group. He was a good friend of his in the same squadron. He had British have squadrons for their
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.520]   armor. And which is Americans would have a company.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.780]   I should say that in your book, one of the wonderful things you do is you use the correct
[00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:41.420]   term in the language for the particular army involved, whether it's the German or the British
[00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:42.220]   or the American.
[00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:46.820]   Well, that's not to be pretentious. That's really just because you're dealing with so
[00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.280]   many numbers and different units, and it can go over your head and you can get sort of consumed
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:55.160]   by the detail if you're not careful. And as a reader, it can be very unsatisfying because
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:02.220]   you just can't keep pace with everything. So one of the things about writing in the vernacular
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:09.760]   German or in the American spelling, our more rather than our Mauer, as we Brits would spell
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.480]   it, is it just immediately tells the reader, okay, this is American. Okay, I've got that.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:17.580]   Or this is German. I've got that. Or Italian or whatever it might be. But yeah, to go back
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:24.080]   to Sam. So Sam, there was this guy in his squadron and he'd get his letters from his girlfriend,
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:30.660]   his wife. And he said it was like a soap opera. He said, we all just waited for his letters
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:38.200]   to come in so we could find out whether his daughter got to school okay or won the swimming
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:45.520]   contest or whatever it was. The sort of details of this day-to-day kind of banal life was just
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:51.100]   absolute catnip to these guys. They absolutely loved it. And then the letter arrived, the Dear
[00:07:51.100 --> 00:07:56.880]   John letter, saying, sorry, I found someone else and it's over. And his friend was just
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:01.200]   absolutely devastated. It was the only thing that was keeping him going, this sort of sense of
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:13.780]   continuity of home, this foundation of his life back at home. And Sam said he could see he was in a
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:19.780]   really, really bad way. And he thought, uh-uh, he's going to do something stupid. And he went up to him
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.840]   and he said, look, you know, I know it's bad and I know it's terrible and I know you're absolutely
[00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:26.580]   devastated, but you've got your mates here. Just don't do anything silly. Just, you know, maybe,
[00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.800]   you know, when it's all over, you can patch things up or sort things out. And he said, you know,
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.200]   you've got to understand it from her point of view, you know, it's a long way. I haven't seen you for two
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:38.760]   years, this kind of stuff, you know, so just, just don't do anything rash. And of course, the next,
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:44.260]   next engagement, two days later, he was killed. And he said it was just a kind of, he could,
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.500]   he just knew that was going to happen. So it was a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.040]   That's something I've never forgotten that story. And I just thought, you know,
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:09:01.380]   it's about human drama. That's, that's, that's the truth of it. And how people react to this
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:07.740]   totally alien situation, you know, for the most part, the second world war is fought by ordinary,
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:13.340]   everyday people doing extra ordinary things. And I think that's something that's so fascinating.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:19.260]   I suspect, I think I, instinctively, I'm quite slapdash, I think. So I think I would have,
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:24.440]   I'd have bought it literally. I don't think it would have ended well for me. I just, I'm just a bit
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:24.780]   careless.
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:32.640]   Yeah. I think I also have an element in me where I can believe in the idea of nation
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.700]   and fight for a nation, especially when the conflict is as grand.
[00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.140]   The thing's worse than death.
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:46.200]   Yes. As, as the propaganda would explain very clearly, but also in reality, yes. So a nation,
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:53.500]   you know, France, Britain was, you know, maybe facing the prospect of being essentially enslaved.
[00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:59.840]   The Soviet union was facing the prospect of being enslaved. Literally. I mean, it was very,
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:05.280]   very clearly stated what they're going to do. They're going to repopulate the land with Germanic
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:09.540]   people. So, well, they're not just going to do that. They're also going to starve lots and lots of,
[00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:16.560]   um, Soviet individuals to death by the hunger plan, for example, which is planned, you know,
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.060]   really very casually and not by the, you know, this is not SS units or anything like this. This is the
[00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:29.180]   Wehrmacht. This is the economic division of the Oberkommando de Wehrmacht, the German combined
[00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:37.780]   general staff, General Georg Thomas comes up, you know, and Hermann Backer, they come up with the,
[00:10:37.780 --> 00:10:41.180]   who's the kind of minister for food. They come up, you know, what are we going to do? You know,
[00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:47.260]   we haven't got enough food, you know, largely because German, um, farming is inefficient and
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:50.560]   they think, well, we'll get, you know, this is part of Liebenstrom. We'll go in and we'll take
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.920]   the food. And there's been this colossal urbanization of the Soviet union since the revolution in 1917.
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.400]   So they're just not going to get their food. You know, these, these people in these cities,
[00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:04.580]   because we're going to take it all. And that's going to leave to, that's going to lead to a lot
[00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:11.020]   of deaths, you know, umpteen millions is the phrase that Georg Thomas used.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:15.900]   Well, let's talk about the hunger plan. How important was the hunger plan and Liebenstrom
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:20.100]   to Nazi ideology and to the whole Nazi war machine?
[00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:27.600]   It's central to the whole thing. This is all about this notion that is embedded into Hitler's
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:35.400]   mind and into the minds of the Nazi party, right from the word go is there is a big sort of global
[00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:40.960]   conspiracy, the Jewish Bolshevik plot. I mean, completely misplaced that Jews and Bolsheviks go
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:47.460]   hand in hand and somehow dovetail. They don't obviously. And the whole ideology is to crush
[00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:53.440]   this, you know, part of the way the Nazis think, the way Hitler thinks is there is a them and there's
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:12:02.180]   us. We are the whites, Northern European Aryans. We should be the master race. We've been, we've been
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:10.940]   threatened by a global Jewish Bolshevik plot. We've been stabbed in the back in 1918 at the end of the
[00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:17.560]   the first world war. We need to have to overcome. This is an existential battle for future survival.
[00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:22.600]   It's a terrible task that has befallen our generation, but we have to do this. We have to
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:28.300]   overcome this or else we have no future. We will be crushed. It's absolutely cut and dry. And one of the
[00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:35.100]   things about Hitler is that he is a very kind of black and white, them or us, either or kind of person.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:40.540]   It's always one thing or the other. It's a thousand year Reich or it's Armageddon. There is no, there's no
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:45.120]   middle ground. There's no gray area. It's just one or the other. And that's how, that's his worldview.
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:57.460]   And the reason he came to the fore was, was because of the crystal clear clarity of his message, which is we've
[00:12:57.460 --> 00:13:04.420]   been stabbed in the back. There is a global plot. We have to overcome this. We are naturally the master
[00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:10.060]   race. We have to reassert ourselves. We have to get rid of global Jewry. We have to get rid of global
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:16.760]   Bolshevism and we have to prevail or else. But if we do prevail, what an amazing world it's going to be.
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:22.720]   So, so he starts with this, you know, every speech he does always starts in the same way, always starts
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.920]   from a kind of negative and always ends with an incredible positive, a sort of rabble rousing,
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:35.360]   endo of, of, of, of, of, if you're in the front row, spittle, halitosis and gesticulation. I mean, you've seen
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.240]   pictures of him. I mean, I don't know if you've ever seen pictures of him. He's almost, he wants to grab the air and
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:47.760]   clutch it to him. Um, you know, you can see the kind of the venom coming out of his mouth just in a single still
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:54.640]   photograph. I mean, it, it, it's amazing. There's, um, apps you can get now where, where you can translate his
[00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:59.460]   speeches and they're just, and it's just sounds, you know, by today's standards, you would just think
[00:13:59.460 --> 00:14:04.480]   what a load of absolute wibble. I mean, just total nonsense, but, but you have to kind of put yourself
[00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:12.280]   back in the shoes of people listening to him in 1922 or 23 or indeed 1933 and see how kind of captivating
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:17.480]   that is to a certain part of the, part of the population. So, yeah. So, so, so the, so to go back
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.940]   to your original point, Lieben's Rome is absolutely part of it. So what you do is you crush the Bolsheviks,
[00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:29.460]   you crush world Jewry, then you expand, you know, the Britain has had this incredible empire,
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:34.200]   global empire, you know, Germany needs that too. Germany is stuck in Europe. It doesn't have access
[00:14:34.200 --> 00:14:38.160]   to the world's oceans. So we're not going to be a maritime empire. We're going to be, we're going
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:43.260]   to be a landmass empire, the whole of landmass of Europe and into Asia. That's going to be us.
[00:14:43.260 --> 00:14:47.720]   And we're going to take that land. We're going to take the, the bread basket of, of Ukraine.
[00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:53.240]   We're going to use that for our own, own ends. We're going to spread our, our, uh, we're,
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:56.800]   we're going to make ourselves rich, but we're also going to spread our peoples. We're going to spread
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:02.780]   the Aryan Northern master race throughout, um, throughout Europe and into the traditional Slavic
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:08.720]   areas. And we will prevail and come out on top. And so you have to understand that, that, that everything
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:16.940]   about operation Barbarossa, the planned invasion of the Soviet union in June, 1941 is totally wrapped
[00:15:16.940 --> 00:15:24.920]   up in the Nazi ideology and people, you know, I've read it that historians sort of go, if only Hitler
[00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:28.440]   had realized that, you know, the Ukrainians had been quite happy to kind of fight on his side, you know,
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.540]   if only he'd, he'd actually brought some of these Jewish scientists and kind of into the Nazi fold,
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:36.360]   then Germany might've prevailed in world war two. And you kind of think, well, you're missing the
[00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:40.900]   entire point. That's just never going to happen because this is an ideological war.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:48.760]   Yeah. This is not a pragmatic, rational leader. No. I mean, part of his effectiveness,
[00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:54.660]   we should say it's probably the singular belief in this ideology. There's pros and cons
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:16:03.280]   for, for an effective military machine, probably having that singular focus is effective.
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.080]   Yes. Except that when you're making military decisions,
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:14.360]   if those decisions are always being bracketed by an ideology, which is fundamentally flawed
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:20.240]   from a pragmatic point of view, as much as a kind of, you know, a kind of reasonable point
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.560]   of view, um, you're, you're kind of opening yourselves up for trouble. I mean, this is,
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.880]   this is a problem he has with Barbarossa, you know, that they realized very early on in 1941,
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:35.200]   when they're, when they're wargaming this whole operation, that it's not going to work. And so,
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.340]   you know, there's people like general Paulus, who's on the general staff at the time, you know,
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:44.640]   he's, he's given a kind of, you know, he's in charge of kind of wargaming this and he goes,
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:51.680]   this isn't going to work. And Keitel, who is the chief of the OKW goes, no, no, no, no, no,
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.840]   go back and make it work. He goes, okay. So he comes back with a plan that does work,
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:02.940]   but it's bogus. I mean, it's just, it doesn't work because they don't have enough. They don't
[00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:07.740]   have enough motorization. You know, they go into the Barbarossa with 2000 different types of vehicle,
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:13.560]   you know, every single one of those vehicles has to have, you know, different distributor caps and
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:20.140]   different leads and plugs and all sorts of different parts. You know, there's the interoperability
[00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:27.520]   of the, of the German mechanized arm is super inefficient. And so you've got huge problems
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:32.880]   because they kind of think, well, you know, we, we took France in 1940 and that's kind of one of the
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:36.680]   most modern countries in the world with, you know, one of the greatest armies and armed forces in the
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.920]   world. And we did that in six weeks. So, you know, Soviet union, look, they struggled against
[00:17:41.920 --> 00:17:46.740]   Finland for goodness sake. I mean, how hard can it be? You know, but what you're failing to understand is,
[00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:52.440]   is that attacking the Soviet union is over a geographical landmass, 10 times the size of
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:58.480]   France, just on the frontage. And you haven't really got much more mechanization than you had
[00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:03.540]   in May, 1940, when they attacked the low countries in France. And you've actually got less Luftwaffe
[00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:10.080]   aircraft to support you. And you just do not have the operational mechanics to make it work successfully.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:16.460]   I mean, it is largely down to incompetence of the red army and the Soviet leadership in the summer
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:22.000]   of 1941 that they get as far as they do. I mean, you know, Barbarossa should never have come close
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.700]   to being a victory.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.940]   Let's talk through it. So Operation Barbarossa that you're mentioning, and we'll go back.
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:29.860]   Yes. We've jumped straight into 41.
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:30.740]   Straight into it.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:33.040]   I've eaten off two years of war.
[00:18:33.040 --> 00:18:42.640]   So this is June 1941, Operation Barbarossa, when Hitler invades the Soviet Union with, I think,
[00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.860]   the largest invading force in history up to that point.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:45.860]   Collectively. Yeah.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:52.300]   And there's three prongs, Army Group North, Army Group Center, Army Group South. North is going to
[00:18:52.300 --> 00:18:58.860]   Leningrad. Center is going, it's the strongest group going directly towards Moscow. And South is
[00:18:58.860 --> 00:19:06.140]   going and targeting Ukraine and the caucus. So can you linger on that, on the details of this plan? What
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:12.300]   was the thinking? What was the strategy? What was the tactics? What was the logistics? There's so many
[00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:18.300]   things to say, but one of them is to say that you often emphasize the importance of three ways to
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:25.020]   analyze military conflict, the strategic, the operational, and the tactical. And the operational
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:33.100]   is often not given enough time, attention. And it's the logistics that make the war machine really work,
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:34.380]   successfully or fail.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:40.940]   Yeah. That's absolutely, absolutely spot on. And it's interesting because the vast majority
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:49.980]   of general histories of World War II tend to focus on the strategic and the tactical. So what do I mean
[00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:54.460]   by that? Well, the strategic, just for the, for those who don't know, that's your overall war aims,
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:20:00.380]   you know, get to Moscow, whatever it might be, conquer the world. That's your strategy. The tactical
[00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:05.340]   side of things is that's the cold face of war. That's the attritional bit. That's the following his
[00:20:05.340 --> 00:20:11.900]   spitfire, the tank crew, the soldier in his foxhole. It's the actual kinetic fighting bit. The
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:19.580]   operational bit is the level of war that links the strategic to the tactical. So it is absolutely
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:26.860]   factories. It's economics, it's shipping, it's supply chains, it's how you manage your war. And
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:31.180]   one of the things where I think people have been guilty in the past, historians have been guilty in
[00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:38.780]   the past, is by judging warfare all on the same level. But obviously every competent nation has a
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:43.980]   different approach to war because of the nation they are, the size they are, their geographical location.
[00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:50.460]   So Britain, for example, is an island nation. Its priority is the Royal Navy, which is why the Royal
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:55.420]   Navy is known as the Senior Service. And you know, in 1939, it's easy to forget it now when you see
[00:20:55.420 --> 00:21:00.540]   how depleted Britain is today. But in 1939, it has comfortably the world's largest
[00:21:00.540 --> 00:21:10.700]   navy. There's something like 194 destroyers. I think it's 15 battleships, seven aircraft carriers,
[00:21:10.700 --> 00:21:16.860]   and another kind of six on the way. America, it's got the Pacific Ocean, it's got the Atlantic Ocean,
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:21.900]   it's got two seaboard. It has the second largest navy in the world, but a tiny army. I mean,
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:29.740]   the US army in September 1939 is the 19th largest in the world, sandwiched between Portugal and Uruguay.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:35.980]   It's just incredible. It's like 189,000 strong, which might seem reasonably large by today's standards,
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:41.980]   but it's absolutely tiny by 1939 standards. Whereas, you know, Germany's got an army of
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:49.020]   three and a half million in 1939. So, you know, these are big, big, big differences, but America's
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:52.380]   coming at it from a different perspective. Britain's coming at it from a different perspective. You know,
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:57.740]   Britain's empire is all about, you know, it's a shipping, it's a seaborne empire.
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:04.860]   Whereas, there's also another point, which is having large armies is actually inherently impractical
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:10.620]   and inefficient. Because the larger army, the more people you've got to feed, the more kind of barracks
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:14.700]   you've got to have, the more space you've got to have for training, the more people you're taking out
[00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:19.420]   of your workforce to produce tanks and shells and all the rest of it, because they're tramping around
[00:22:19.420 --> 00:22:24.540]   with rifles. You know, so there's an argument saying, actually, it's really not a very good way of doing
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:30.300]   things. So, you know, very much the British way, and subsequently, the United States way, and
[00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:37.820]   the way of Britain's dominions and empire, is to use kind of steel, not our flesh, as a principle.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:44.380]   The idea is that you use technology, mechanization, modernity, global reach, to do a lot of your
[00:22:44.380 --> 00:22:49.020]   hard yards. That's the sort of basic principle behind the strategic air campaign. When we talk about
[00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:53.580]   the strategic air campaign, we talk about strategic air forces which are operating in isolation from
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.540]   other armed forces. So a tactical air force, for example, is an air force which is offering close
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:04.860]   air support for ground operations. A strategic air force has got nothing to do with ground operations,
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:09.900]   it's just operating on its own. So that's your bomber force or whatever. You know, that's your B-17s and
[00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:15.500]   B-24s of the 8th Air Force flying out of East England, bombing the rural industrial complex of
[00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:20.540]   Germany or whatever it might be. So it's important to understand that when you compare, you have to have
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:25.020]   the back of your mind that Britain, compared to Germany, for example, is coming at it from a
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.620]   completely different perspective. And I would say one of the failures of Hitler is that he always
[00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:35.660]   views everybody through his own very narrow world view, which is not particularly helpful. You know,
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.460]   you want to get inside the head of your enemy. And, you know, he's sort of guilty of not doing that.
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:46.940]   So when you're talking about Operation Barbarossa, to go back to your original question, you're dealing
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:54.460]   with an operation on such a vast scale that that operational level of war is absolutely vital to its
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:58.940]   chances of success or failure. It doesn't matter how good your individual commanders are at the front.
[00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:04.540]   If you haven't got the backup, it's not going to work. And the problem that the Germans have is,
[00:24:04.540 --> 00:24:09.340]   yes, they've got their kind of, you know, three million men on the front, and they've got their
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:15.020]   kind of, you know, 3000 aircraft and all the rest of it. But actually, what you need to do is break it
[00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:20.700]   down. And who is doing the hard yards of that? And the way the German war machine works is that the
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:26.780]   machine bit is only the spearhead. So people always talk about the Nazi war machine. In a way,
[00:24:26.780 --> 00:24:31.660]   it's a kind of misnomer because you're sort of suggesting that it's highly mechanized and
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:35.740]   industrialized and all the rest of it. And nothing could be further from the truth. The spearhead is,
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:42.620]   but the rest of it is not. And this is the kind of fatal flaw of the German armed forces in
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:49.020]   the whole of World War II, really. But even in this early stage, because in Barbarossa,
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:55.660]   you're talking about 17 panzer divisions out of, you know, the hundred odd that are involved in the
[00:24:55.660 --> 00:25:01.820]   initial attack. Well, 17, and that panzer division is not a division full of panzers,
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:07.580]   tanks. It is a combined arms, motorized outfit. So
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:16.940]   scouts on BMWs with sidecars, armored cars, infantry, grenadiers, panzer grenadiers,
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:24.140]   which are infantry in half tracks and trucks mechanized. It is motorized artillery. It is motorized
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:29.340]   anti-aircraft artillery. It is motorized anti-tank artillery. And of course, it is tanks as well,
[00:25:29.340 --> 00:25:35.900]   panzers. But those are a really, really small proportion of, you know, you're talking less than
[00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:42.940]   20% of your attacking force are those spearhead forces. And inevitably, they are going to be
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:47.020]   attrited as they go. You know, you are going to take casualties. And not only that, you're not going
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.180]   to just take battlefield casualties. You're also going to have mechanical casualties because of the huge
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:55.740]   spaces involved. You just simply can't function. So what you see is in the initial phases of
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:02.060]   of Operation Barbarossa, they surge forward. Red Army's got absolutely no answers to anything.
[00:26:02.060 --> 00:26:08.220]   Stalin weirdly hasn't heeded all the warnings that this attack is brewing. And there have been plenty,
[00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:14.220]   incidentally. Smolensk falls on the 15th of July, you know, in less than four weeks. It's just incredible.
[00:26:14.220 --> 00:26:18.300]   Three and a half weeks, Smolensk has gone. You know, they've overwhelmed the rest of what had
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:24.300]   been Poland. They surged into what is now Belarus, taken Smolensk. You know, this is Army Group Center.
[00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:30.060]   Army Group North is thrust up into the Baltic. It's all going swimmingly well. But then,
[00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:35.500]   the next several months, they barely go 100 miles. And that's because they're running out of steam.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:41.580]   And the 16th Panzer Division, for example, by the time it's taken Smolensk, involved in taking
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:50.060]   Smolensk on the 15th of July, 1941, the following day, it's got 16 tanks left. 16. Out of, you know,
[00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:57.260]   should have 180. So it's just being a trigger. They can't sustain it. And they can't sustain it because
[00:26:57.260 --> 00:27:02.780]   as the Russians fall back, as the Soviet Red Army falls back, they do their own scorched earth policy.
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:06.460]   They also discover that the railway line is kind of a different loading gauge. So they've got to
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:13.500]   change it. So it's slightly, the Russian loading gauge is slightly wider. So every single mile,
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:19.900]   every yard, every foot, every meter that they're capturing of a Russian railway has to be moved
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:28.460]   a couple of inches to the left to make it fit the German Kriegsloch in the standard train of locomotive
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:33.580]   of the, of the, of the Reichsbahn. Just imagine what that's like. And also Soviet trains are bigger,
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:39.980]   so they can take more water, which means the water stops in between are fewer and far between. So they
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:43.900]   have to, the Germans, when they come in, their trains, their Kriegsloch are smaller. So they have to have,
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:50.060]   be re-watered more often and re-coaled more often. So they have to, I mean, it's, it's absolutely
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:55.580]   boggling just how complicated it is and how badly planned it is because they haven't reckoned on this.
[00:27:55.580 --> 00:28:00.460]   They're having to kind of think on their feet. I love the, the logistical details of all of this,
[00:28:00.460 --> 00:28:04.620]   because yes, that's a huge component of this, especially when you're covering that much territory.
[00:28:04.620 --> 00:28:13.580]   But there is a notion that if Hitler didn't stop, uh, army group center, it could have pushed all the
[00:28:13.580 --> 00:28:19.660]   way to Moscow. It was, it was only maybe a hundred miles away from Moscow. Is that, is that, is that a
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:25.740]   possibility because it had so much success in the early days pushing forward? Do you think it's
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:33.500]   possible that if Hitler, as we mentioned from a military blunder perspective, didn't make that blunder,
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:37.820]   that, uh, they could have defeated the Soviet Union right there and then?
[00:28:38.540 --> 00:28:43.180]   Well, my, my own view is that they should never have got close. You know,
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:48.780]   Red Army has plenty of men to be able to see off anything that the Germans can do. The capture of
[00:28:48.780 --> 00:28:55.180]   Kyiv, for example, in September, 1941 was a catastrophe for, for the Soviet Union and should
[00:28:55.180 --> 00:29:01.500]   never have happened. I mean, Zukov is saying to, saying to Stalin, we've got to pull back across the
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:07.660]   Dnieper. So I was going, no, I can't possibly do that. You can't abandon Kyiv. It's like third city in
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:13.100]   the Soviet Union. No way. No, absolutely not. And he goes, well, we're just, we are just going to be
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:19.260]   overwhelmed. You know, we, we, we can't hold this. And, and he says, you know, either back me or far me,
[00:29:19.260 --> 00:29:24.860]   back me or sack me. So Stalin sacks him. Uh, uh, yeah, obviously, as we know, Zukov gets, um,
[00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:31.500]   rehabilitated from pretty quick order. Uh, and Stalin does learn very quickly after, thereafter to learn
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:36.780]   the lessons. But the opening phase of Barbarossa has been a catastrophe. And so,
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:42.460]   so as a consequence of Stalin refusing to let his men retreat back across the Dnieper,
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:48.380]   which is a substantial barrier and would be very difficult for the Germans to overwhelm had they
[00:29:48.380 --> 00:29:55.420]   not, had they moved back in time. Um, you know, that's another kind of 700,000 men put in the bag. I
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:30:03.100]   I mean, that's just staggering numbers. Um, but yeah, I mean, there's so many things wrong with the
[00:30:03.100 --> 00:30:08.660]   Barbarossa plan, you know, too much over, it's just such a vast area. I mean, you're talking about kind
[00:30:08.660 --> 00:30:14.700]   of, you know, 2,500 miles or something, you know, of, of frontage, you know, maybe if you kind of put
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.500]   your, your, your Panzer groups, which are these spearheads and you put them all in one big thrust and
[00:30:19.500 --> 00:30:23.180]   just go hell for leather straight across on a kind of, you know, much more narrow front of,
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.180]   let's say kind of 400 miles rather than
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:31.420]   1200. Then they might've got, you know, they might've just sort of burnt away straight through to
[00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:39.820]   Moscow. They really caught the red army unprepared. Yeah. Is there, um, something to be said about the,
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:47.820]   the strategic genius of that or was it just luck? No, I don't think so. I mean, I think, I think,
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:51.820]   I think what's happened is you've had the, you've had the, the Soviet purges of the, of the second
[00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:57.180]   after the 1930s where they've, you know, they have executed or imprisoned 22 and a half thousand
[00:30:57.180 --> 00:31:04.780]   officers of which, you know, three out of five marshals, um, you know, God knows how many army
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:11.260]   commanders, um, et cetera, et cetera. So, so, you know, you've completely decapitated the red army
[00:31:11.260 --> 00:31:15.180]   in terms of its command structure. So before that, would it be fair to say it was one of,
[00:31:15.180 --> 00:31:19.500]   if not the greatest army in the world? Well, there was a lot of experience.
[00:31:19.500 --> 00:31:23.820]   There's, there's a lot of experience there. But also technology material,
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:27.900]   Yeah. The size of the army and the number of people that are, they're mobilized.
[00:31:27.900 --> 00:31:31.820]   Yeah. And they're the first people to kind of adapt, you know, create airborne troops, for example.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:38.620]   So yes, I think there is an argument to say that, but the decapitation is, is, is absolutely brutal.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:44.060]   If you've decapitated an army, you then got to put new guys in charge. And someone who, who looks on
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:49.340]   paper like a half decent peacetime commander might not be a very good wartime commander. The,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:54.540]   the different disciplines and different skills and what comes to it, you don't know that until you're
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:59.180]   tested. It's very hard to kind of judge. And of course, you know, Stalin is existing in a sort of,
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:04.540]   you know, a vacuum of, of paranoia and suspicion all the time, which is unhelpful when you're trying
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:12.220]   to develop a strong armed forces. So they go into Finland in, in back end of 1939 and they get there,
[00:32:12.220 --> 00:32:16.220]   you know, they get really badly hammered. They do take about, you know, 50, get the Corellia
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:22.140]   Peninsula and they do take some ground, but a huge cost. I mean, the casualties are five times as bad as
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:29.580]   those are the Finns and it's humiliation. So Hitler sees that and thinks, okay, they're not up to much
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:35.740]   cop. Then Hitler loses the battle of Britain. And he thinks I can't afford to fight a war on two fronts.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:40.860]   That's one of the reasons why Germany loses the war in 1914 to 18 is fighting on the Eastern front,
[00:32:40.860 --> 00:32:44.780]   but also fighting on, you know, the Western front at the same time. We've got to avoid that,
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.860]   but I've got to get rid of Britain and Britain hasn't come out of the fight. Britain is still fighting
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:55.260]   in the back end of 1940, having won the battle of Britain. And so maybe I'll go into the Soviet
[00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:59.100]   Union now while the red army is still weak. You know, we're not a hundred percent ready ourselves,
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.220]   but, but let's hurry the whole thing forward. Because originally he'd been thinking of planning
[00:33:02.220 --> 00:33:09.340]   an operation in 1943 or 1944. So the idea is you take Poland out, you take out France and the low
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:13.660]   countries, you conquer most of Western Europe, you knock out Britain. So therefore you don't have to
[00:33:13.660 --> 00:33:17.020]   worry so much about the United States because they're over the other side of the Atlantic.
[00:33:17.020 --> 00:33:22.060]   That then gives him, buys him the time to kind of rebuild up his strength for the all out thrust
[00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:29.340]   on the Soviet Union. The failure to subdue Britain in 1940 changes all those plans and makes him think,
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:33.260]   actually, I'm going to go in early. And he's also been kind of, you know, he's hoisted by his own
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:39.740]   petard because he, he starts to believe his own genius. You know, he, everyone told him that,
[00:33:39.740 --> 00:33:43.100]   you know, he wouldn't be able to, you know, he wouldn't be able to beat France and the low countries.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:46.540]   Everyone told him that, you know, it wouldn't work out when he went into Poland. Everyone was
[00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:52.060]   really nervous about it. You know, well, go hang you, you cautious, awful, aristocratic Prussian
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:56.540]   generals. You know, I'm, I'm the best at this. I've told you, I've shown you, I'm the genius.
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:34:00.060]   I can do it. He starts to believe his own hype. And of course, this is a problem. You know,
[00:34:00.060 --> 00:34:03.900]   he's surrounded by sick events and people are constantly telling him that he's this incredible
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:09.180]   genius. So he, he starts to believe it and he thinks everything is possible. And, and he's very
[00:34:09.180 --> 00:34:14.380]   much into this idea of, of the will of the German people. You know, this is our destiny. And either
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:18.460]   will, as I say earlier on, you know, it's the thousand year Reich or Armageddon, but momentum is
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:22.860]   with us and we need to strike it. And only by, by, by gambling, only by being bold will,
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.660]   will the Germans prevail and all this kind of nonsense. And so that's why he goes into, into
[00:34:27.660 --> 00:34:32.380]   Soviet Union in June, 1941, rather than, you know, a couple of, or even three years later.
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:35.020]   Yeah. He really hated the Prussian generals, huh?
[00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.780]   Yeah. He hated them.
[00:34:36.780 --> 00:34:42.220]   Is there a case to be made that there, he was indeed at times a military genius?
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.900]   No, I don't think so. Cause none of the plan, I mean, even the plan for the invasion of France
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:54.140]   and the low countries, isn't his. It's a, the, the, the concept is, is from Manstein's and the
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:35:00.620]   execution is Guderian's Heinz Guderian. So he, Heinz Guderian is, is the kind of, he's the pioneer of,
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:06.940]   of, of, of the, of the panzer force, the panzer thrust, this idea of the ultra mechanized combined
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:13.980]   arms, panzer arms, spearhead doing this kind of lightning fast thrust. Um, it's not Hitler's idea.
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:20.220]   He adopts it and, and takes it as his own because, you know, he's a fury. He can do what he likes.
[00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:27.500]   Um, but, but it isn't his. So it's not, you know, and up until that point, until that comes into being,
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:34.220]   till that, that plan is put forward to Franz Halder, who is the chief of staff of the German army at that time,
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:38.700]   you know, how does just thinking, how do we get out of this mess? This is just a nightmare because
[00:35:38.700 --> 00:35:42.460]   they know that France has got a larger army. They know that France has got more tanks and then the France
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:47.500]   has got double the number of artillery pieces. It's got parity in terms of air forces. Then you add Holland,
[00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:53.260]   then you add Belgium, then you add great Britain. And that looks like a very, very tough nut to crack.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:36:00.620]   I mean, the reason why France is subdued in 1940 is 50% of the Germans and their operational art and
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:07.340]   that particular instance, and 50% French failure, really an incompetence. I mean, there is a kind of
[00:36:07.340 --> 00:36:14.700]   genius to be able to see and take advantage and set up the world stage in such a way that
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:22.060]   you have the appeasement from France and Britain, keep the United States out of it, just set up the
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:27.900]   world stage where you could just plow through everybody with not, with very little resistance.
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:33.900]   I mean, there is a kind of, well, yes, if it works, if it works, but it doesn't, you know, that's,
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:37.740]   that's a problem. I mean, you know, I mean, he goes into Poland on the assumption that Britain
[00:36:37.740 --> 00:36:44.860]   and France will not declare war. You know, he, he, he is not prepared for Britain and France declaring war on
[00:36:44.860 --> 00:36:49.260]   Germany, right? He thinks they won't. That's right. So miscalculation blunder, but then
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:58.940]   France does. Right. And then that doesn't, you know, France does not successfully do anything with
[00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.820]   this incredible army that it has. It has the size, but one of the problems that France has is that it's
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:11.340]   very, very top heavy. It's, it's very cumbersome in the way it operates. Um, there's no question that,
[00:37:11.340 --> 00:37:17.100]   that it's got some brilliant young commanders, but, but at the lot, at the top, the commanders are very
[00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:23.260]   old. Most of them are first world war veterans, you know, whether he, I mean, Wegan, Gamelan,
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:30.220]   general George, um, these people, they're all well into their sixties. Um, general George is the
[00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:35.740]   youngest army commander and he's 60. You know, it's too old to be a, an army commander. You need to be in
[00:37:35.740 --> 00:37:42.060]   your kind of late forties, early fifties. And they're too just consumed by conservatism and
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:48.220]   the old ways. And what, what they assume is that any future war will be much like the first world war.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:56.380]   It'll be attritional long and drawn out, but static, but actually they're right on two parts of it. It is,
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.620]   as it turns out, it is going to be long and drawn out and attritional, but it's going to be mobile
[00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:05.420]   rather than static. And that's a big miscalculation. So here's my, here's my question. I think you're,
[00:38:05.420 --> 00:38:11.420]   you're being too nice on France here. So when, when, when Germany invaded Poland,
[00:38:11.420 --> 00:38:18.540]   it correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like France could have just went straight to Berlin.
[00:38:18.540 --> 00:38:24.620]   Yeah, they absolutely could. And they, and I know you said it's very top heavy and you're saying all of
[00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:27.980]   these things, but they literally did basically nothing.
[00:38:27.980 --> 00:38:29.100]   Yeah. They were pulling.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:37.100]   So like, uh, and I think a part of that, and I think you described this well, maybe you can speak
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:44.460]   to that is the insanity that is Hitler creating the psychological with the propaganda, creating this
[00:38:44.460 --> 00:38:51.660]   feeling that there's this Nazi force that's unstoppable. So their, their France just didn't
[00:38:51.660 --> 00:38:56.700]   want to like step into that. Maybe there were like legitimately, um, I, I hesitate to say these
[00:38:56.700 --> 00:39:03.340]   words, but scared of war a hundred percent. They are that, you know, because France has been totally
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:08.860]   traumatized by the first world war. It's fought on their land. It's fought in their industrial heartland.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:13.420]   You know, they lose three times the amount of people killed that, that Britain does. Britain's
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.260]   traumatized by it, but, but, but not to the same degree that France is front. And you know,
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:22.940]   there is just no stomach to do that again. And so that makes them risk averse. And by being
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:27.580]   risk averse, you're actually taking a far greater risk that that that's the irony of it. And the
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:33.100]   truth is also there isn't the political will and, uh, uh, a successful military can only be successful
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:37.420]   if there is a political will at the top. And the problem with France in the 1930s is it's very politically
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:44.860]   divided. It's, uh, it's, it's a time of multiple governments, multiple prime ministers, um, uh, coalition
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:51.180]   governments, really very extreme coalition governments from the sort of drawn from the left
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:57.260]   and the right, as well as the center. And, you know, this is not a coalition of, of two parties. This is
[00:39:57.260 --> 00:40:02.380]   a coalition of multiple parties. No one can ever agree anything. And that's the problem. It's amazing that
[00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:06.540]   the Magno line has even agreed, you know, this incredibly strong defensive position down the
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:11.900]   western side of France of border with, um, with Germany, which is kind of largely impregnable.
[00:40:11.900 --> 00:40:17.180]   But the problem is, is the bit that's not impregnable, which is the hinge where the Magno line ends and
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:23.180]   it sort of basically starts turning kind of towards and in a kind of north northerly direction and the
[00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:29.100]   border with Belgium. And, you know, what they should have done is built kind of border defenses all
[00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:34.380]   along the northern coast of Belgium because Belgium refused to kind of, uh, allow any allied troops into,
[00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:41.900]   into its territory. It was neutral. And France should have said, okay, fine. Well, then we'll defend our,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:46.220]   you know, we're not going to come to your rescue. If you get invaded, that's your, that's your, well, that's,
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:50.220]   that's the payoff. And the consequence of that, we are going to stockpile everything that and we're not
[00:40:50.220 --> 00:40:55.420]   going to be drawn into the neutral territory should Germany invade from the west. But they don't do that
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:41:01.100]   because of the psychological damage of having fought a war in exactly that area a generation
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:07.660]   earlier. And that's the problem. So when they went, you know, there is, uh, Germany is so weakened by the
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:12.700]   invasion of Poland. There was literally nothing left, you know, the back door from into Western
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:18.140]   Germany is completely open. And so they do what they call the SAR offensive, but it's not, it's a kind of
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:23.260]   reconnaissance in force where they kind of go across the border, kind of pick their noses for,
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:28.140]   for a few days and then kind of trundle back again. And it's just, it's embarrassing. And that is,
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:34.860]   what you're seeing there is, is a nation, which is just not ready for this, which is scared,
[00:41:34.860 --> 00:41:41.260]   which is politically divided, which is then having a knock on effect on, on the decision-making process,
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:48.540]   and which is just consumed by military complacency. And that's the big problem. There is this, you know,
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:54.460]   that the commanders at the very top of the French regime are, are complacent. They, they,
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:42:01.260]   they haven't bought into kind of modern ways. They haven't looked at how contemporary technology
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:07.020]   could help them. I mean, it is absurd, for example, that there isn't a single radio in the Chateau de
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:12.060]   Vincennes, which is, you know, it's the headquarters of the commander in chief of the French armed forces,
[00:42:12.060 --> 00:42:20.620]   which is General Marshal Maurice Gamelan. I mean, it's just unbelievable. But, but that is the case.
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:24.540]   And, and there's no getting away from that. And, and it is all the more ironic when you consider that
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:29.580]   France is actually the most automotive society in Europe. It's the second most automotive society in
[00:42:29.580 --> 00:42:34.860]   the world after the United States. By some margin, it has to be said as well, you know,
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.500]   it has a fantastic transportation system. Railway network is superb. It's, it, it, there are,
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.700]   there are eight people for every motorized vehicle in France, which is way above Germany, which is in
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:49.660]   1949, that figure is 47. For example, it's 106 in Italy.
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.940]   So France is very mechanized, very mechanized. So come on guys,
[00:42:52.940 --> 00:42:57.740]   pull your finger out, get it together. And they just don't, they're, they're incredibly slow and
[00:42:57.740 --> 00:43:03.020]   cumbersome. And what they think is when, what will happen is the Germans won't think of going, you know,
[00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:06.700]   they won't do a pincer movement because you can't possibly take motorized forces through, through the
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:11.420]   Ardennes. That's just, it's not possible, which is the hinge area between the end of the Maginot,
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.580]   the Northern part of the Maginot line, which runs down the Western, sorry, the Eastern border of France
[00:43:16.220 --> 00:43:20.860]   and the Northern bit. And so what we'll do with that hinge around the town of Sedan,
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:25.980]   we'll, we'll move into, into Belgium. We'll meet the Germans before they get anywhere near France.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:30.940]   We'll hold them. And while we're holding them, we will bring up our reserves and then we'll,
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:35.340]   we'll counterattack and crush them. That that's the idea behind it. But the problem is, is they don't
[00:43:35.340 --> 00:43:40.860]   have a means of moving fast and their communication systems are dreadful, absolutely dreadful.
[00:43:40.860 --> 00:43:44.140]   They're dependent on conventional telephone lines, which, you know,
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:49.820]   dive bombers and whatever are just kind of absolutely wrecking. Suddenly the streets are
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:54.460]   clogged with refugees and people can't move. So they're then, you know, telephone lines are down.
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:59.740]   There's no radios. So you're then dependent on sending dispatch riders on little motorbikes,
[00:43:59.740 --> 00:44:06.060]   you know, general, uh, um, Maurice Gamelan sends out a dispatch rider at six o'clock in the morning.
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:11.580]   Um, by 12 o'clock, he hasn't come back. So you then send another one. Finally, the answer comes back,
[00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.820]   uh, kind of nine o'clock at night, by which time the kind of Germans advance another 15 miles.
[00:44:15.820 --> 00:44:19.660]   And the original message that you sent at six o'clock that morning is completely redundant and
[00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:23.820]   has passed itself by date. And that's happening every step of the way, you know, so you've got,
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:28.620]   you've got overall commander, um, headquarters, then you've got army group, then you've got army,
[00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:33.500]   then you've got core, then you've got division. So the consequence of all that is that French just
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.740]   can't move. They're just stuck there. They're rabbits in headlights and the Germans are able to
[00:44:37.740 --> 00:44:43.340]   kind of move them, uh, destroy them in isolation. Meanwhile, they're able to use their excellent
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:49.180]   communications. Um, it's a very, very good effect. And you were talking about the genius of war.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:53.660]   It's not Hitler. That's a genius. If anyone's a genius, it's Goebbels, the propaganda chief,
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:45:02.300]   and it is their ability to harness that they are the Kings of messaging. You know, they don't have,
[00:45:02.860 --> 00:45:09.500]   they don't have X, they don't have social media. Um, but they do have new technology and that new
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:15.500]   technology, that new approach is flooding the airwaves with their singular message, which is always the
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:20.140]   same and has been ever since the Nazis come into power and it is using radios. And I think radios
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:25.500]   are really, really key to the whole story because there is no denser radio network anywhere in the
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.700]   world, including the United States and Germany in 1939. So while it's really behind the times in terms
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:38.540]   of mechanization, it is absolutely on top of its game in terms of comms. So 70% of households in
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:45.820]   Germany have radios by 1939, which is an unprecedented number that, that is only beaten by United States
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:51.820]   and only just. So it is, it is greater than any other, other nation in Europe. And in terms of flooding
[00:45:51.820 --> 00:45:57.580]   the airwaves, it is the densest because even for those who the 30% who don't have radios, that's not a
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:46:01.740]   problem because we'll put them in the stairwells of apartment blocks. We'll put them in squares.
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:08.700]   We'll put them in cafes and bars and the same stuff, the state, the, the, the Nazi state controls the
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:15.260]   radio airwaves as it does the movies, as it does newspapers, all aspects of the media are controlled
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:22.460]   by, by Goebbels and propaganda ministry. And they are putting out the same message over and over again.
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:27.820]   It's not, it's not all Hitler's ranting. It's entertainment, light entertainment, some humorous
[00:46:27.820 --> 00:46:35.900]   shows. Um, it is also Wagner of course, and Richard Strauss. Um, it's, it's a mixture, but the subliminal
[00:46:35.900 --> 00:46:42.140]   message is the same. We're the best. We're the top dogs. Jewish Bolshevik plot is awful. That needs
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.380]   to be, you know, that's the existential threat to us. We have to overcome that. We're the top dogs
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:51.180]   militarily. We're the best. We should feel really good about ourselves. We're going to absolutely win and be
[00:46:51.180 --> 00:46:57.500]   the greatest nation in the world ever. And Hitler's the genius. And that is just repeated over and over
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:03.580]   and over and over again. And the, you know, for all the modernity of the world in which we live in
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:09.340]   today, most people believe what they're told repeatedly. Yeah, they still do. It's if you just
[00:47:09.340 --> 00:47:13.900]   repeat, repeat, repeat over and over again, people will believe it. You know, if you're a, if you're a
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:20.780]   diehard Trump supporter, you want to believe that you'll believe everything he says. If you are a
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:26.300]   diehard Bernie Sanders, man, you know, you're from the left, you'll believe everything he says,
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:30.220]   because it's reinforcing what you already want to, what you, what you already want to believe.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.820]   But the scary thing is, uh, you know, radio is the technology of the day, the technology of the day
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:43.740]   today, which is a terrifying one for me is, uh, uh, I would say AI on social media. So bots,
[00:47:43.740 --> 00:47:50.540]   you can have basically bot farms, which I assume is used by Ukraine, by Russia, by us.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:56.860]   I would love to read the history written about this era, about the information wars,
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:03.260]   who has the biggest bot farms, who has the biggest propaganda machines. And when I say bot, I mean,
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:13.260]   both automated AI bots and humans operating large number of smartphones with SIM cards. They're just
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:20.460]   able to boost messages enough to where they become viral. And then real humans with real opinions get
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:26.780]   excited also. It's like this vicious cycle. So if you support your nation, all you need is a little
[00:48:26.780 --> 00:48:32.700]   boost and then everybody gets real excited. And then now you're chanting and now you're in this mass
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:38.700]   hysteria and now it's the 1984, two minutes of hate. And the message is clear. I mean, that's what
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:45.260]   propaganda does is it really clarifies the mind. And that is exactly what, what Hitler and the Nazis
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:49.180]   and Goebbels are doing in the 1930s while they're doing it in the 1920s as well, but more effectively
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:55.660]   once they come into power, of course. And Hitler is so fortunate that he comes,
[00:48:55.660 --> 00:49:02.700]   he takes over the chancellorship in January, 1933 at a time where the economy is just starting to turn.
[00:49:02.700 --> 00:49:07.820]   And he's able to make the most of that. And you know, if you're Germans and you've been through
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:11.820]   hyperinflation in the early 1920s, you've been through the humiliation of the Versailles Treaty,
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:20.700]   which was terrible error in retrospect. And you've been through then having got through that,
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:26.300]   you've emerged into a kind of democratic Weimar Republic, which is based on manufacturing.
[00:49:26.300 --> 00:49:32.780]   You know, Germany's a traditional genius at engineering and manufacturing and production
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:39.020]   of high quality items. They're merging through that. Then you have the Wall Street crash
[00:49:39.020 --> 00:49:45.020]   and the loans that are coming in from America, which is propping up the entire German economy,
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:50.380]   suddenly get cut off and you've suddenly got depression again and massive unemployment.
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:57.580]   And suddenly Hitler comes in and everyone's got jobs and they're rebuilding and they're growing
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:50:03.900]   their military. And the message that's coming out is we're the greatest, we're the best, we're fantastic.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:09.020]   You know, I was telling you earlier on about Hitler's speeches, starting with the dark,
[00:50:09.020 --> 00:50:14.140]   starting dark and ending in hope and light and the sunlight uplands, you know, that's what you're
[00:50:14.140 --> 00:50:17.420]   getting. You're suddenly getting this vision of hope. This is sort of, you know, my God, actually,
[00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:23.740]   this is really working, you know? Okay. So, you know, I'm not sure that I particularly buy into the
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:27.660]   kind of anti-Semitic thing, but you know, we'll sweep that under the carpet because overall,
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:31.740]   I've now got a job, I've got money, I've got my new radio, you know, and then this is a genius
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:37.340]   about the radios, for example. So they have the German receiver to start off with, the Deutsche
[00:50:37.340 --> 00:50:42.300]   Fanger, and then they have the Deutsche Kleinem Fanger, which is the German little receiver, little
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:49.980]   radio. This is genius. This is as outrageous as the arrival of the iPod. I mean, remember that,
[00:50:49.980 --> 00:50:53.180]   you know, suddenly you don't have to have a Sony Walkman anymore. You can have something really,
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:57.020]   really small and miniature and listen to thousands of thousands of thousands of songs all at once.
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:02.460]   What an amazing thing. And the Deutsche Kleinem Fanger is nine inches by four inches by four
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:08.380]   inches. It's made of Bakelite and everyone can have one because it's super cheap. It's just incredible.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:13.500]   And no one else has said that because up until that point, radios, generally speaking, are aspirational.
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:16.700]   You know, they've got sort of a walnut lacquer at the front and, you know, you have them if you're
[00:51:16.700 --> 00:51:21.580]   middle class and you show them off to your neighbors to show how kind of, you know, affluent and
[00:51:21.580 --> 00:51:27.900]   well to do you are. But suddenly everyone can have one. And if everyone can have one, then everyone can
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:31.500]   receive the same message. And you can, and you can also, and this is the whole point about the Hitley youth
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:36.380]   as well, you know, the young guys, that's where they're, they're most impressionistic. They're, they're
[00:51:36.380 --> 00:51:42.140]   least risk averse. So they're most gung ho. They're, they're most full of excitement for the possibilities
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:49.420]   of life. And they're also, their minds are the most open to suggestion. So you get the youth, you hang on,
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:53.900]   you get them. And so a whole generation of young men are brought up thinking about the
[00:51:53.900 --> 00:51:58.860]   genius of Hitler and how he's delivering us this much better nation and returning our, um, over,
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:04.380]   overhauling the humiliations of the first world war where overcoming the back, uh, the stab in the back
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:12.140]   that happened in 1918, et cetera, et cetera. And, you know, as a young 16, 17 year old German, you're
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:16.380]   thinking, yeah, I want a piece of that. And Hey, guess what? They've got really cool uniforms and,
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:20.300]   and, and, you know, come and join the SS and, you know, get the fro line. You know,
[00:52:20.300 --> 00:52:26.140]   what's not to like, you know, you can see why, why it's so clever. Uh, and what's so interesting is
[00:52:26.140 --> 00:52:34.540]   propaganda today is, is still using those, those tenets that Goebbels was using back in the 1930s.
[00:52:34.540 --> 00:52:37.580]   And this is why I would say, say that, you know, history doesn't repeat itself. Of course it doesn't,
[00:52:37.580 --> 00:52:42.140]   it can't possibly repeat itself because we're always living in a constantly evolving time,
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:47.020]   but patterns of human behavior do. And what you always get after economic crisis is political
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:51.580]   upheaval. Always, always, always, because some people are in a worse off position than they were
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:54.780]   financially before. And they're thinking, well, you know, the current system doesn't work. What's the
[00:52:54.780 --> 00:53:00.780]   alternative? So, you know, in the case of, of, of now we in the West, you know, we face, first of all,
[00:53:00.780 --> 00:53:05.820]   we face the crisis of 2008, finance crisis, 2008. Then we've had the kind of double whammy of COVID.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:12.300]   And that has been incredibly unsettling. And so we're now in a, a, a situation of, of political
[00:53:12.300 --> 00:53:16.220]   turmoil. And whether you're, whether you're, uh, whether you're pro-Trump or anti-Trump,
[00:53:16.220 --> 00:53:22.060]   what he's offering is something completely different. And, you know, it's say, you know,
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:25.940]   he, he's saying the old ways don't work. You know, I'm going to be, I'm just going to say what I think.
[00:53:25.940 --> 00:53:29.580]   I'm just going to, I'm going to come out. I'm not going to bother with all the sheen of diplomacy and
[00:53:29.580 --> 00:53:34.540]   kind of, you know, mealy mouth words that politicians always use, you know, which way you can't trust
[00:53:34.540 --> 00:53:37.980]   to anyone. I'm just going to tell you as it is. And obviously people respond to that. You know,
[00:53:37.980 --> 00:53:43.100]   you, you, you can understand why that has a, has an appeal. And if the country already feels broken
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:48.060]   and here's someone who is going to be a disruptor and going to change the, the way you go about things,
[00:53:48.060 --> 00:53:52.620]   you can see why a, a, a reasonably large proportion of the population is going to go,
[00:53:52.620 --> 00:53:54.680]   I'll have a piece of that. Thank you very much.
[00:53:54.680 --> 00:54:00.440]   And especially, uh, when the country is in the economic crisis, like Germany was,
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:06.860]   I think you've written that, uh, the treaty of Versailles created Hitler and the, uh, the
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.580]   wall street crash and the great depression brought him to power.
[00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:16.960]   And of course the propaganda machine that you describe is the thing that got everybody else
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.120]   in Germany on board.
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:23.940]   Yeah. It's, it's, it's amazing how he, he, cause he comes in with 33% of the vote.
[00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:30.020]   He had 37% of the vote of the vote in July, 1932. So again, this is another period of,
[00:54:30.020 --> 00:54:34.240]   of turmoil, just like it is in France where you're having constant different kind of coalitions and,
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:36.880]   you know, different chancellors, leaders of Germany.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:40.540]   So it's very possible he, he, he wouldn't have come to power.
[00:54:40.540 --> 00:54:44.760]   Well, he said, he said, I will only, uh, you know, the, we will only take our seats if, if,
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:48.100]   if I can be chancellor, otherwise forget it. I'm not coming into any coalition.
[00:54:48.580 --> 00:54:54.080]   So then the, uh, the government falls again in January, 1933, they have the,
[00:54:54.080 --> 00:55:00.440]   they have the election. The Nazi vote is down from where it was the previous summer,
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:05.260]   but this time they go, okay, Hitler can be chancellor, but we'll manipulate him.
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:09.620]   Oh, how wrong they were. You know, he's manipulating everyone. And then Hindenburg,
[00:55:09.620 --> 00:55:16.760]   who is the president dies the following summer. And, uh, he's able to get rid of the presidency.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:21.900]   There is no more president of Germany. There is just the Fuhrer him. And he gets rid of,
[00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:26.760]   uh, he has a, in actually enabling act, which is where all other, uh, political parties are,
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:30.380]   uh, disbanded. And suddenly you've got a totalitarian state just like that.
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:37.080]   I think there's a lesson there. Uh, there's many lessons there, but one of them is don't let an
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:41.740]   extremist into government and assume you can control them.
[00:55:41.740 --> 00:55:45.980]   Yes. The arrogance of the existing politicians who just completely screwed it up.
[00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:53.860]   I mean, there is a real power to an extremist. Like there's, uh, a person who sees the world in,
[00:55:53.860 --> 00:56:02.600]   in black and white can really gain the attention and the support of the populace.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.240]   Yes.
[00:56:03.940 --> 00:56:09.180]   Especially when there's a resentment about like treaty of Versailles, when there's economic hardship,
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:17.160]   and if there's effective modern technology that allows you to do propaganda and sell the message,
[00:56:17.160 --> 00:56:20.240]   there's something really compelling about the black and white message.
[00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:27.580]   It is because it's simple. Uh, and what Hitler does throughout the 1920s is he sticks to this.
[00:56:27.580 --> 00:56:33.040]   There, there is actually, when he comes out of prison in, so he is the Bihl putsch in November, 1923.
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:41.160]   He gets, uh, charged with treason, which he has been because he's attempting a coup and he gets
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:47.840]   sentenced to five years, which is pretty lenient for what he's done. And he then gets let out after nine
[00:56:47.840 --> 00:56:54.640]   months. Nazi party is, is, is, is banned at that point, but then comes back into being.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:57:00.960]   And the year that follows, there is then a substantial debate about where the party should
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:06.140]   go. And there are actually a large number of people who think that actually they should be
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:11.140]   looking at how the Soviets are doing things and taking some of the, some of the things that they
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:16.600]   consider to be positive out of the communist state and applying those to the Nazis. And Hitler goes,
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:22.580]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no. We, we, we've just got to stick to this kind of Jewish Bolshevik thing.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:26.500]   This is, this is how we're going to do it. This is how we're going to do it. Goebbels, for example,
[00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:32.620]   who is, who is very open. He's, he's very, very, Joseph Goebbels is, uh, he's a, he's a not very
[00:57:32.620 --> 00:57:38.180]   successful, um, uh, journalist. He is, uh, but he does have a PhD in German, German literature.
[00:57:38.180 --> 00:57:43.320]   He's very disaffected because he was born with Talapes, which is, you know, more commonly known
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:47.940]   as a club foot. He's disabled. He can't fight in the first world war. He's very frustrated by that.
[00:57:47.940 --> 00:57:53.200]   He's in a deep despair about, about the state of Germany in the first part of the early 1920s.
[00:57:53.260 --> 00:58:01.540]   He's looking for a, uh, um, uh, uh, uh, political messiah as a quasi religious messiah thinks it's
[00:58:01.540 --> 00:58:07.600]   Hitler, then discovers that Hitler is not open to any ideas at all, uh, about any deviation,
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:13.540]   but then sees the light. Hitler recognizes that this guy is someone that he wants on his side.
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:19.020]   And so then goes to make a real special effort. Come on, come to dinner. I think you're great.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:23.340]   You know, all this kind of stuff wins about over and Goebbels has this complete vault fast,
[00:58:23.340 --> 00:58:28.760]   discards his earlier kind of, yeah, you know, Hitler's right. I was wrong. Hitler is the kind
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:34.400]   of messiah figure that, that I want to follow. I want to follow the hero, hero leader. And they
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:39.720]   come on board and they absolutely work out and Hitler completely wins out of all dissenters within the,
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:43.620]   what had been the German workers party to what becomes the German national socialist party,
[00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:51.620]   becomes the Nazis. Um, he comes out, emerges as the absolute undisputed Fuhrer of that leader of
[00:58:51.620 --> 00:58:57.200]   that, that party and what he says goes and everyone toes him behind it. And part of the genius of that,
[00:58:57.200 --> 00:59:01.780]   you know, Hitler does have some genius. I just don't think it's military, but he does have some
[00:59:01.780 --> 00:59:07.760]   genius. And a question about it is the simplicity of message of what he's doing. It's that kind of us
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.380]   and them thing that we were talking about earlier on. It's the kind of either, or it's kind of,
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:16.640]   it's my way or the highway. It's kind of, this is the only way. This is how we get to the sunlit
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:25.000]   uplands. This is how we, we create this amazing master race of the, this unification of German
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   peoples, which dominates the world, which is the preeminent power in the world for the next thousand
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:37.400]   years, or it's decay and despair and being crushed by our enemies. And our enemies are the Jews and the
[00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:46.460]   Bolsheviks, the communists. And what he taps into as well is Front Gemeinschaft and Volksgemeinschaft.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:52.680]   And these are, there's no direct English translation of Volksgemeinschaft or indeed Front Gemeinschaft,
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:59.060]   but, but, but in its most basic form, it's communities, it's people community or Front
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:06.560]   Veterans community. So the Front Gemeinschaft is we are the guys, we're bonded because we were in the
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:11.880]   trenches. You know, we were in the first world war. We were the people who bravely stuck it out,
[01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:17.680]   saw our friends being slaughtered and blown to pieces. We, we did our duty as proud Germans,
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:22.620]   Germans, but we were let down by the elites and we were let down by the, by this Jewish
[01:00:22.620 --> 01:00:28.880]   Bolshevik plot. You know, we were stabbed in the back. The myth of the stabbing, stabbing in the back
[01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:35.140]   is very, very strong. So we're bound, we're, we're bonded by our experience of the first world war and
[01:00:35.140 --> 01:00:40.240]   the fact that we did what we should and what we could, and we would, we didn't fail in what we were
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:47.640]   doing. We were failed by our leaders, um, and by the elites. So that's, that's Front Gemeinschaft.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:57.440]   Volksgemeinschaft is this sense of national unity. It's, it's, it's a cultural, ethnic bonding of
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:04.320]   people who speak German, who have a, have a similar outlook on life. And again, that just reinforces the
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:10.200]   us and them good and evil, it reinforces the black and white worldview. And then you add that
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:17.960]   to this very simple message, which Hitler is repeating over and over again. Communists are a
[01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:22.080]   big threat. Jews are a big threat. They're the, they're the enemy. You have to have a, you have
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:30.320]   to have an opposition in the them and us kind of process. And that's what he's doing. And people just
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:33.900]   buy into it. They go, yeah, we're together. We're Germans. We're, we're, we're, you know,
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:42.140]   we're a brotherhood. We've got our Volksgemeinschaft. And so he cleverly ties into that and taps into
[01:01:42.140 --> 01:01:48.020]   that, but they're an irrelevance by the late 1920s, you know, by 1928, you know, the, the,
[01:01:48.020 --> 01:01:53.880]   he's not going to get a deal for Mein Kampf part two. You know, he he's, he's, he's impoverished.
[01:01:53.880 --> 01:01:58.200]   The party's impoverished. Numbers are down there. They're kind of, you know, a best and a,
[01:01:58.200 --> 01:02:02.200]   an irrelevance. We should say he wrote Mein Kampf at this time when he was in prison.
[01:02:02.200 --> 01:02:06.820]   Well, he writes, he writes most of Mein Kampf in prison, in Landsberg prison. And then he writes
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:11.980]   the rest of it in what becomes known as the Kampfhausel, which is this little wooden hut in the,
[01:02:11.980 --> 01:02:16.480]   in the Ober Salzburg. And you can still see the remnants of that. And unfortunately there's still
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:21.020]   little candles there and stuff in the woods and, you know, by, by neo-Nazis and whatnot, what have you.
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:25.840]   But that's where he wrote, wrote the rest of it. Um, I mean, it was Jean-Jacques Rousseau who says,
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.460]   man has his greatest force when surrounded by nature. That was something that kind of Hitler
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:35.200]   took very much to heart. Um, there was a, there was a mentor of his called Dietrich Eckart. Dietrich
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:40.000]   Eckart introduced him to the Ober Salzburg and the beauty of the Southwest, Southeast Bavarian
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:47.680]   Alps around Berkusgaden. And, um, uh, and that was his favorite place on the planet. And, um,
[01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:53.520]   that's where he, that's where he eventually bought the, um, the, uh, the Berghof with the royalties,
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:59.660]   it has to be said from Mein Kampf, which went from being, you know, almost pulp to suddenly being a
[01:02:59.660 --> 01:03:02.320]   runaway bestseller, unfortunately.
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:07.180]   Can you actually comment on that? It's a shitty manifesto as far as manifestos goes. I think there's
[01:03:07.180 --> 01:03:12.840]   a lot of values to understand, uh, from a first person perspective, the words of a dictator,
[01:03:13.160 --> 01:03:17.840]   of a person like Hitler, but it just feels like that's just such a shitty.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:20.300]   Yeah. I mean, you know, it's banned in a number of countries. You don't need to,
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:25.700]   cause no one's going to read it because it's unreadable. Um, I mean, it's, it's very untidy.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:32.180]   It's, it's very incoherent. It's, it's got no, um, there's no narrative arc to use the kind of,
[01:03:32.180 --> 01:03:35.700]   you know, right, a writer's phrase. I mean, it's just, it's, but, but, but it does give you a very
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.040]   clear, you know, the overall impression you get at the end of it is, is, is,
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:42.980]   is the kind of communists and the Jews are to blame for everything.
[01:03:42.980 --> 01:03:47.480]   Yeah. But there's also the component of, you know, predicting basically world war two
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:53.960]   there. So it's not just there to play. He's, he's hungry for war, right? He, he thinks that this is,
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:58.700]   this is the natural state that we have to have this terrible conflict. And once the conflict's over,
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:02.480]   Germany will emerge victorious. And then there will be the thousand year, right? I mean,
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:06.520]   I'm finding myself in, in talking to you. I keep saying this kind of, you know,
[01:04:06.520 --> 01:04:09.780]   it's Armageddon, all the thousand year, right. It's because it comes up. It's, it's, it's,
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:16.060]   it's unavoidable because that's how he's speaking the whole time. It's just the same message over and
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:22.440]   over and over and over again. It's a pretty unique way of speaking sort of allowing a violence as a
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:28.700]   tool in this picture, that there's a hierarchy, that there's a superior race and inferior races,
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:34.440]   and it's okay to destroy the inferior ones. Yeah. Usually politicians don't speak that way.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:41.760]   They just say, well, here's good and evil. We're the good guys. And yeah, maybe we'll destroy the
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:48.820]   evil a little bit. No, here is like, there's a complete certainty about a very large number of
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:54.280]   people, the Slavic people. They just need to be removed. Well, they need to be made an irrelevance.
[01:04:54.280 --> 01:04:57.240]   You know, we have to take it, we have to take it. And if that, if that kills millions of them,
[01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.520]   fine, then they can sort of squish that way over to Siberia. It doesn't matter where they go.
[01:05:00.520 --> 01:05:07.260]   We just need to populate this land that belongs to the German people because they're the superior
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:11.340]   people. There's no question that he glorifies violence and war. You know, he's absolutely
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:16.360]   chomping at the bit. And in a way, I think he's a bit disappointed that in the 1930s,
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:23.400]   the conquests that he does undertake are also peaceful. You know, March, 1938 goes straight
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.940]   into Austria. There's the Anschluss, you know, not a shot is fired. You know, 1936 goes into the
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:34.600]   Rhineland, reconquers that, retakes that over that from, from, uh, from, from the occupying allies,
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:39.920]   not a shot is fired. You know, he takes a sedation land, not a shot, barely a shot is fired.
[01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:45.380]   Um, and then goes into, into the rest of Czechoslovakia in March, 1930, 39. And again,
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:48.520]   barely a shot is fired. And, you know, it's a bit disappointing. You know, he wants to be,
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:52.700]   wants to, wants to be tested. He wants to kind of have the, have the, the wartime triumph.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:57.700]   You can see him being frustrated about this in, in the Munich crisis in 1938. He wants to fight.
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:02.760]   He's absolutely spoiling for it. He's desperate to go in. He's already in gung ho. He's built his
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:09.420]   Luftwaffe. He's, he's got his, his, his panzers. Now he's got his, his, his massive armed forces.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:14.300]   You know, he wants to test them. He wants to, wants to get this show on the road, uh, and prove it.
[01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:23.600]   You know, he is a, he's an arch gambler, Hitler. You, you make it seem so clear, but, uh, all the
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:29.160]   while to the rest of the world, to Chamberlain, to France, to Britain, to the rest of the world,
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:35.080]   he's saying he doesn't want that. He's making agreements. Everything you just mentioned,
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:40.060]   you just went through it so quickly, but those are agreements that were made that he's not going
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.940]   to do that. Uh, and he does it over and over. He violates the Treaty of Versailles. He violates
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:51.600]   every single treaty, but he still isn't doing the meeting. So maybe, maybe can you go through it,
[01:06:52.220 --> 01:06:59.520]   the lead up to the war, 1939, September 1st, like what are the different agreements? What is the
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:05.140]   signaling he's doing? Yeah. Well, and what is he doing secretly in terms of building up the military
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:09.700]   force? Yes. So he, you know, part of the Treaty of Versailles, you're not, you know, you're allowed
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:16.880]   to very, very limited, um, uh, armed forces. There's restrictions on naval expansion. There's
[01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:23.260]   restrictions on the size of the army. There's restrictions on the weapons you can use. There
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:30.520]   are, um, you're not allowed an air force, but he starts doing this all clandestinely. Um, you know,
[01:07:30.520 --> 01:07:38.320]   there are people in, um, Krupp has got, for example, which is in the Ruhr, a sort of big, um, armaments
[01:07:38.320 --> 01:07:45.440]   manufacturer. They are producing tanks and elsewhere and parts elsewhere in, in the Netherlands, for
[01:07:45.440 --> 01:07:50.280]   example, and then shipping them back into, back into Germany. They're doing panzer training exercises
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:55.620]   actually in the Soviet Union at this time. There's all sorts of things going on. The Luftwaffe is being
[01:07:55.620 --> 01:08:01.140]   announced to the world in 1935, but it's obviously been in the process of, of developing long before
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:07.100]   that. The Messerschmitt 109 single engine fighter plane, for example, is created in 1934. So they're doing
[01:08:07.100 --> 01:08:12.940]   all these things against it. And the, and the truth is, is he's just constantly pushing. What,
[01:08:12.940 --> 01:08:16.440]   what can I get away with here? What, what, what, what will probably, you know, and, and of course,
[01:08:16.440 --> 01:08:20.360]   Britain, France, the rest of the rest of the world, rest of the allies, you know, they're all reeling
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:25.860]   from, from the wall street crash and the depression as well. So have they got the stomach for this? Not
[01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:31.220]   really, you know, and perhaps actually on reflection, the terms of us, I treat you a bit harsh anyway.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.280]   So, you know, maybe we don't need to worry about it. And this is, this is no political will.
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:39.940]   There's no political will to kind of fight against what Germany's doing. Then he gets
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:43.860]   away of it. So he suddenly starts realizing that, that, that, that actually he can push
[01:08:43.860 --> 01:08:47.660]   this quite a long way because no one's going to stand up to him, which is why he makes a
[01:08:47.660 --> 01:08:51.820]   decision in 1936 to go back into the, you know, into the Rhineland, you know, which has been
[01:08:51.820 --> 01:08:57.980]   occupied by, by French, you know, um, um, allied troops. At that point, he just walks in,
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:02.060]   just goes, do your worst. And no one's going to do anything because there isn't the stomach
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:07.800]   to do anything. That was a big step in 1936, remilitarizing the Rhineland. I mean, that,
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:14.680]   that's a huge, huge step of like, oh, I don't have to follow anybody's rules and they're going to do
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.720]   nothing. And he's looking at his military and he's, and, and he's also looking at response. So one of the
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.840]   things they do is they, you know, it's really, it's very clever. So they get over the head of the,
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:31.000]   uh, army of the air, army de l'air, which is the, um, French air force. And they invite him over and
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:37.260]   they, uh, uh, milk, who is the, uh, second command of the Luftwaffe invites him over. So come and see
[01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:41.260]   what we're, what we're up to. You know, we want to be, you're our European neighbors. We're all friends
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.480]   together, this kind of stuff. Come and see what we've got. And he takes him to this airfield.
[01:09:45.480 --> 01:09:51.520]   There's a row of Messerschmitt 109s all lined up like sort of 50 of them. And the head of the army
[01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:55.780]   of the air sort of looks at him and goes, correct, that's impressive. And milk goes, well, let me go
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:10:00.080]   and take you to another airfield. And they, they go off the sort of the, uh, the back route out of the
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:04.860]   airfield and a long circuitous route in the Mercedes. Meanwhile, all the Messerschmitts take off
[01:10:04.860 --> 01:10:08.260]   from that airfield, going to land on the next airfield. Here's another, and they're all the
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:13.180]   same aircraft. And the commander in chief of the army of the air goes back to France and goes,
[01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:17.080]   we're never going to be able to eat Germany. So you would earlier, you were, you were alluding
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.260]   to this earlier on, you know, how much is this sort of this, this, this justice chutzpah of,
[01:10:21.260 --> 01:10:30.980]   of this ability to kind of portray the, the, the, the mechanized moloch. Um, yeah, it absolutely
[01:10:30.980 --> 01:10:38.300]   cows, the enemy. So, so then they're, they're increasing the effectiveness of their armed forces
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:45.220]   purely by propaganda and by, by mind games and by talking the talk. And, you know, you look at,
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:50.800]   we might all think these military parades that the Nazis have look rather silly by today's standards,
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:55.060]   but you look what that looks like. If you're the rest of the world, you're in Britain and you're
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:00.460]   still reeling from the depression and you see the triumph of the will. You see some of that footage
[01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:05.240]   and you see these automatons in their steel helmets and you see the swastikas and you see
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.060]   hundreds of thousands of people all lined up and see Kylie and all the rest of it. You're going to
[01:11:10.060 --> 01:11:15.640]   think again before you go into war with people like that. It's also hard to put yourself in the,
[01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:23.340]   in the mind of those leaders. Now, now that we have nuclear weapons, so nuclear weapons have
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:34.560]   created this kind of cloak of a kind of safety from mutually shared destruction that you think surely
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:43.480]   you will not do, you know, a million or two million, uh, soldier army invading another land,
[01:11:43.480 --> 01:11:51.340]   right? Just full on gigantic hot war. Uh, but at that time, that's the real possibility. You remember,
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:57.680]   you remember world war one, you remember all of that. So, you know, you're okay. There's a mad,
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:05.280]   uh, guy with a mustache. Uh, he's making statements that this land belongs to Germany anyway,
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:12.340]   cause it's mostly German, uh, populated. So, and like you said, Treaty of Versailles wasn't really
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:16.480]   fair and you can start justifying all kinds of things. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And maybe they got a point
[01:12:16.480 --> 01:12:20.960]   about the Danzig corridor, you know, they are mainly Germans, German speaking people there. And, you know,
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:25.320]   it's disconnected from East Prussia, which is this thing, you know, I can, I sort of get it, you know,
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:30.020]   maybe they've got a point, you know, and is Poland really a kind of thriving democracy anyway? Not
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:35.440]   really by 1930, late 1930s. It's not, it's to all intents and purposes, a dictatorship in Poland
[01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:41.840]   at that time. I mean, it's not right that you just go and take someone else's country. Of course you
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:48.660]   you can't do that, but, but you can see why in Germany people are thinking they've got a point.
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:53.320]   You can also see why in France and Britain, they're thinking, well, you know, do we really care about
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:13:00.020]   the Poles? I mean, you know, is it worth going to, to war over? Um, but there's kind of bigger things
[01:13:00.020 --> 01:13:05.540]   at play by this point. That that's the point. Yeah. But before we get to Poland, there is
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:14.860]   this meeting, September 1938. Uh, so Chamberlain made three trips to meet with Hitler. Yeah. Uh,
[01:13:14.860 --> 01:13:19.800]   which culminated in the Munich conference. Yeah. On the 30th of September. Yeah. Where was Chamberlain,
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:26.560]   Hitler, Mussolini and Delagier, prime minister of France. They met to discuss essentially Czechoslovakia
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:33.780]   without any of the government officials of Czechoslovakia participating. And Hitler promised to make
[01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:40.540]   no more territorial conquest and Chamberlain believed him. He chose to believe him. I think
[01:13:40.540 --> 01:13:44.340]   is the thing. It's the point. So, so it's very interesting. So, so Chamberlain gets a very bad
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:53.400]   press. Um, uh, well, no, I'm not, no, it's not really. Oh, it's, it's, it's, I, I just think there's
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:14:00.780]   too much retrospective view on this. And that's fine because we, the whole point of history is you can look
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:05.500]   back and you can judge decisions that were made at a certain point through the prism of what
[01:14:05.500 --> 01:14:09.180]   subsequently happened, which of course the people that are making the decisions at the time can't
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:17.720]   because they're in that particular moment. So I don't think Chamberlain did trust Hitler, but he
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:23.540]   wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. Britain was not obliged to Czechoslovakia at all. France was.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:28.880]   France had signed a treaty with, with Czechoslovakia in 1924, but, but, but, but Britain had not. So
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:33.540]   there was no obligation at all for Britain to do this. The only reason why Britain would go to war
[01:14:33.540 --> 01:14:39.440]   over Czechoslovakia is because of the threat of Nazism and what the ramifications of not going to war with
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:44.320]   him. But the problem is, is that Chamberlain is interesting because in 1935, he was, he was
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:47.640]   chancellor of his checker. And when they started to sort of think, okay, we really do need to rearm.
[01:14:47.640 --> 01:14:57.580]   He was very much in favor of, of substantially expanding and rehabilitating the Navy. So updating
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:06.740]   existing battleships and so on. And also developing the air force. There's not really much argument for
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:10.740]   having a large army because if you have a large army, you've got to maintain it. Britain is a small
[01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:15.460]   place. Where do you put them? You've also got to transport them. That's complicated. You've got to
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.600]   train them. You've got to put them in barracks. You've got to feed them all this kind of stuff.
[01:15:17.600 --> 01:15:22.260]   There's a kind of sort of impracticality about having a large army. Whereas Navy is great because
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:26.520]   you can keep them at sea and they can be, you know, on the water. Air force is slightly different.
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:31.640]   Air power is viewed in very much the same way that, that naval power is viewed. That this is,
[01:15:31.640 --> 01:15:37.640]   we're an island nation. We have a global, global assets and air power gives us the flexibility that an
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:43.920]   army doesn't. So he is all for backing the expansion of the, of the army, of the air force and the
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:48.140]   navy in 1930. Then he subsequently becomes prime minister and sticks to his guns on that. It is he
[01:15:48.140 --> 01:15:55.040]   that enables the air force and the air ministry to develop the first fully coordinated air defense
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:59.700]   system anywhere in the world. There is not an air defense system in Poland, nor Norway, nor Denmark,
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:05.020]   nor the Netherlands, nor Belgium, nor France. There is in Britain. Britain is the only one. And frankly,
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:12.000]   it pays off big time in the summer of 1940. So you have to give him credit for that. Britain,
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:18.740]   interestingly, is also the world's leading armaments exporter in the 1930s, which is amazing,
[01:16:18.740 --> 01:16:21.880]   really, when you think everyone complains about the fact that we weren't rearming enough.
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:26.260]   Actually, we were. When we had all the infrastructure there and we were expanding that infrastructure
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:32.380]   dramatically. I say we, I'm only saying that because I'm British. So they were doing that.
[01:16:32.380 --> 01:16:38.520]   But in 1938, Britain wasn't ready for war. Now, you can argue that Germany wasn't ready for war either,
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:44.500]   but Chamberlain was prime minister in a democracy, parliamentary democracy,
[01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:51.340]   when 92% of the population were against going to war in 1938. There is, there is not a single
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:58.000]   democratic leader in the world that will go against the wishes of 92% of the population.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:02.820]   Now, you could say, well, he should have just argued it better and presented his case better
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:07.200]   and all the rest of it. But at that point, there was no legal obligation to go to the defense of
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:12.440]   Czechoslovakia. You know, Czechoslovakia was another of these new nations that had been created out of
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:19.140]   1919 and the Versailles Treaty. You know, who was to say, you know, we in Britain are able to judge the
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:25.440]   rights and rights and wrongs of that, you know, how fantastic it would be to go to war with a nation a
[01:17:25.440 --> 01:17:30.440]   long way away for people whom we know very little, et cetera, et cetera. I'm paraphrasing his quote.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:37.480]   But, but I'm not saying it was the right decision. I'm just saying I can see why in September 1938,
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:44.000]   he is prepared to give him the chance. Now, I do think he was a bit naive. And it, and what he also
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.760]   does is really interesting thing. So he goes over to Hitler's flat, completely ambushes him,
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:55.820]   goes to his flat on the afternoon of 30th of September and says to Hitler, look, I've got this,
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:18:01.600]   I've drawn up this, this agreement here. Um, and this is to continue the, um, the naval agreement
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:06.400]   that we've already made. And, and by signing this, you are saying that Germany and Britain should never
[01:18:06.400 --> 01:18:12.780]   go to war with one another. And he goes, yeah, whatever, you know, signs it. Chamberlain comes
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:17.720]   back, lands at Henn and waves his, waves his little piece of paper, you know, and peace in our time and
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:21.500]   all the rest of it, which obviously comes back to bite him in a very big way. But it's interesting
[01:18:21.500 --> 01:18:28.360]   that, that, that when Hitler then subsequently goes and moves in, you know, that they, France and Britain
[01:18:28.360 --> 01:18:34.580]   decide in rather the same way that there's been discussion about deciding that large portions of
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:41.700]   Ukraine should just be handed back to, handed over to Russia without consulting Ukraine a few weeks ago.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:50.740]   Um, it is incredible. I think that, that France and, and Britain and Italy with Germany are deciding
[01:18:50.740 --> 01:18:55.260]   that, yes, it's fine for Germany to go in and take the Sudetenland, you know, about really consulting
[01:18:55.260 --> 01:19:02.180]   the Czechs. It's a sort of similar kind of scenario really. And, and it's equally wrong. Um, but when
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:08.380]   Germany does then go and take over the whole of Czechoslovakia in March, 1939, that is, that's the
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.240]   bottom line. That is, that's the point where Chamberlain goes, okay, I've given him the
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:17.420]   benefit of the doubt, no more benefits of the doubt. That's it. That is, he's, he's crossed
[01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:21.380]   the line. And so you reinforce your agreement with Poland and you do a formal agreement. You
[01:19:21.380 --> 01:19:26.880]   go, okay, we will uphold your sovereignty. You know, if you are invaded, we will go to war
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:35.200]   with you. You know, that is, that is a ratcheting up of diplomacy and politics in a very, very big
[01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:44.640]   way. And it is a, it is that decision to make a treaty with the Poles is not heeded by Hitler,
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:50.320]   but it's heeded by literally every one of his commanders. And it's also heeded by Goering,
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:56.980]   who is his number two and who is obviously the commander in chief of the, um, of, of the Luftwaffe
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:02.580]   and is, uh, president of Prussia and, you know, and all the rest of it. And, you know,
[01:20:02.580 --> 01:20:07.800]   is the second most senior Nazi. And, you know, he's going, this is a catastrophe. This is the
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.680]   last thing we want to be doing is going to war against Britain and indeed France.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:18.440]   The Munich conference is a pretty interesting moment. I would say in all of human history,
[01:20:18.440 --> 01:20:27.740]   because you got the leaders of these bigger than life nations and the most dramatic brewing
[01:20:27.740 --> 01:20:33.820]   conflict in human history, that Chamberlain, Hitler, Mussolini, Dodger. It's interesting when
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:40.180]   these bigger than life leaders are in a room together, uh, is there something that you know
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:45.760]   about, about their interactions? Yeah, I think there's, I think one of the things that's interesting
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:50.220]   is, is that Hitler's got home advantage because it's on his turf and, you know, to start off with
[01:20:50.220 --> 01:20:54.320]   the first meeting is at the Berghof, his beloved place in the Obersalzberg overlooking Berkusgaden
[01:20:54.320 --> 01:21:00.380]   in the Alps. So he's pretty confident because this is my manner. This is my turf. You know,
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:05.540]   uh, I'm not going to be bossed around by these guys, but Chamberlain, for example, is going there
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:10.540]   thinking I've been around the blocks. No one can teach me anything. I've been a politician for ages.
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:14.520]   You know, I'm not going to be kind of capped out by this, this sort of, you know, Austrian upstart.
[01:21:15.380 --> 01:21:17.800]   So they're both coming at it with a kind of sort of
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:26.160]   slight kind of superiority kind of complex. Um, interestingly, when you get to the actual
[01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:32.900]   meetings of the Bernabeu in, in Munich, um, a couple of weeks later, Chamberlain is cheered
[01:21:32.900 --> 01:21:39.560]   by the crowds when his car comes in, when he goes to his hotel, when he's moving from his hotel to
[01:21:39.560 --> 01:21:44.060]   the Bernabeu, you know, there are cars cheering him, you know, waving union jacks, all this kind of stuff.
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:50.940]   Hitler does not like that at all. Not at all. Puts him on the back foot. And that's because
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:56.660]   the German people don't want war. In the same way that the British people don't want war,
[01:21:56.660 --> 01:22:03.880]   nor do the German people. The difference is that Hitler is a dictator and an autocrat and
[01:22:03.880 --> 01:22:09.080]   has the devotion of the people. So he can do what he wants in a way that Chamberlain can't.
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:14.700]   Chamberlain's hands are tied because he is an elected prime minister, an elected leader,
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:20.580]   political leader, and he's not head of state. So there is no question that it is Hitler and
[01:22:20.580 --> 01:22:25.640]   Chamberlain that are the top dogs in this particular discussion. You know, Deladier takes a backseat,
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:30.860]   even Mussolini, although he's there, he doesn't want war either. You know, he wants to be left alone
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:34.720]   to do his own thing without anyone getting in the way, but he doesn't want, he doesn't want to sort of,
[01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:38.680]   it's not in his interest to have a European war. So he's trying to avoid it. So it is really,
[01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:44.140]   you see that the kind of alpha males in the room are Chamberlain and, and Hitler. And it's really
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:50.700]   interesting because Hitler's got this sort of slightly garrulous voice and, and yeah, very kind
[01:22:50.700 --> 01:22:56.260]   of pale blue eyes and such distinct features, quite a long nose. And, you know, he always says,
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:01.360]   this is why he has the moustaches to kind of, you know, disguise the big nose, you know, so I was
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.000]   saying to you earlier on before we started recording, he does have a sense of humor. It's not maybe not
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:10.880]   one that you and I would kind of tap into, but, but he does have one. Whereas Chamberlain is just sort
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:14.220]   of, you know, he sounds like a sort of, you know, a bit like an old man, you know, he's sort of silver
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:18.900]   haired and he looks like you're sort of archetypal kind of British gentleman who's rolled up umbrella and
[01:23:18.900 --> 01:23:23.580]   his, you know, and his Homburg hat and all the rest of it. So they're both sort of caricatures in a funny
[01:23:23.580 --> 01:23:28.920]   sort of way. And yet the consequence of these discussions, you know, these, these great
[01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:35.760]   events happening, you know, you are, you're absolutely going, even which way the Munich crisis
[01:23:35.760 --> 01:23:40.800]   comes out, you're taking a step closer to war. It's just whether the war is going to happen kind
[01:23:40.800 --> 01:23:44.300]   of next week or whether it's going to happen a year hence, but it's, you know, the Munich crisis
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:49.020]   obviously doesn't stem the inevitability of war at all. It just heightens it.
[01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:53.060]   Do you think there are words that Chamberlain should have said, could have said,
[01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:59.100]   that, uh, put more pressure on Hitler, intimidate Hitler more?
[01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:04.760]   Yeah, it's a really tricky one. It's such a difficult one because you're always looking at it
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:10.100]   through, you know, the enemy has a vote and you don't know what that vote is going to be. And you
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:14.520]   don't know what it's going to look like. There's no question that the Europe, the rest of Europe is,
[01:24:14.520 --> 01:24:22.900]   is, is, is cowed by the, um, kind of impression of military might that the Germans have put out.
[01:24:22.900 --> 01:24:28.180]   They, they, they certainly fear they are stronger than they actually are. And then on the other hand,
[01:24:28.180 --> 01:24:32.220]   they're also going, yeah, but you know, Germany doesn't have natural resources, doesn't have access
[01:24:32.220 --> 01:24:36.900]   to the world's oceans. You know, it's, it's, it's kind of, you know, it shouldn't be able to win a
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:42.420]   war. And so, so they're kind of contradicting themselves at the same time, you know, so one
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:45.520]   minute they're sort of like, Oh God, you don't want to take on those, all those Nazis and all those
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:50.140]   swastikas and those automaton stormtroopers. But on the other hand, they're then saying, but actually
[01:24:50.140 --> 01:24:53.180]   Germany doesn't have much and it's kind of, you know, in its basket, you know, it's got,
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:56.240]   it's got actually quite a lot of weaknesses and we should be able to kind of prevail, blah, blah,
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.500]   blah. We'll just impose an economic blockade and then it'll be stuffed. And Britain is not ready to
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:05.880]   fight a war in 1948, but nor is Hitler, you know, nor is Germany. So, you know, one is sort of striking
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:11.640]   out the other, but it's very easy to say that in hindsight, but at the time, you know, with people
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:15.240]   kind of digging trenches in Hyde Park in the center of London and barrage balloons going up over
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:20.600]   London and, you know, children being evacuated from the cities and 92% of the population not
[01:25:20.600 --> 01:25:25.940]   wanting to go to war, you can see why he takes the course he does. I suppose that's, that's what I'm
[01:25:25.940 --> 01:25:29.320]   saying. I'm not saying it's necessarily the right decision, but I could, I think it's an understandable
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:35.500]   decision. But what about even just on the human level? If I go into a room with a British gentleman
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:45.140]   versus going to a room with Trump, it feels like it's so much easier to read and manipulate
[01:25:45.140 --> 01:25:50.840]   the British gentleman because Trump is like Trump-like characters. It seems like Hitler's
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:56.720]   similar. Churchill is similar. It's like this guy can do anything. There's something terrifying
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.860]   about the unpredictability. Yeah. It feels like there's something very predictable about
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:06.600]   Chamberlain. Yes, I think that's true. But also one has to take a step back and think about
[01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:13.640]   what Britain represents. So therefore what Chamberlain represents in 1938, Britain has the largest empire
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:17.880]   the world has ever known in 1938. We shouldn't forget that. You know, the world of the world is
[01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:22.380]   pink, as the saying goes, you know, and that saying comes from the kind of atlas of the world where all
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:27.960]   British territories are kind of colored pink. Yeah. And on top of that, it has lots of extra imperial
[01:26:27.960 --> 01:26:33.480]   territories as well. So, you know, if you look at this, there's this incredible map of global shipping
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:39.500]   in 1937. And there's these little antlines of ships going out. And one of the strongest antlines is going
[01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:46.160]   down to Argentina and South America from Britain. So down past West Africa and down the Southern
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:52.240]   Atlantic and there it is. And that's because Britain owns most of Argentina. It owns huge, great farming
[01:26:52.240 --> 01:26:57.300]   estates and ranches. It owns the railway system. It owns many of the port facilities. So you don't even
[01:26:57.300 --> 01:27:03.160]   need an empire. You just need the, you know, you need the facilities that overseas trade and possessions
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:11.120]   can give you. And Britain not only has the largest navy, it also has the largest merchant navy, has 33% of
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:18.200]   the world's merchant shipping and access to a further 50%, you know, Greek, Norwegian, Canadian shipping that
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:25.240]   it can access. So if you've got access to 80, more than, in excess of 80% of the world shipping, that puts you
[01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.840]   in an incredibly strong position. And actually all sorts of other things have been going on. While
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.160]   they might not have been creating a huge army or producing enough spitfires that they might want to
[01:27:35.160 --> 01:27:40.720]   up until this point, what they have also been doing is stockpiling bauxite and copper and tungsten
[01:27:40.720 --> 01:27:46.720]   and huge reserves. And because Britain has this huge global reach and because it has its empire and its
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:51.740]   extra imperial assets, it can strike bargains that no one else can strike. So it can go into various
[01:27:51.740 --> 01:27:56.760]   countries around the world and can go, okay, I want you to guarantee me for the next five years,
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:28:04.480]   every bit of your rubber supply. I will pay over the asking price to secure that. And it's doing that
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:11.360]   in the 1930s. So when war comes, it's got everything it possibly needs. Now, you always need more because
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:17.080]   it's suddenly turning into a kind of, you know, a proper global long drawn out war. But that is a huge
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:23.060]   advantage. So it is with that mindset that Chamberlain is going into those talks and thinking,
[01:28:23.060 --> 01:28:26.040]   okay, well, I'm not going to get a war over the Czechoslovakian. Who cares about them?
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:33.180]   But I am going to show Hitler that I mean business. Hitler's going, who's this stuffy guy with his
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:37.120]   white hair? I don't give a toss about him. You know, and he's coming at it from a completely different
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:42.240]   perspective. And I think one of the things that's so interesting from a dramatic point of view and from
[01:28:42.240 --> 01:28:46.380]   a historian's point of view, or even a novelist point of view, in the case of Robert Harris writing
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:49.880]   his book about these negotiations, which I don't know if you've read it, but it's really, it's
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:56.160]   terrifically good. It's the fact you've got two men, two alpha males who are going to those
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:29:03.280]   negotiations from totally different perspectives and vantage points. And I think it's very easy for
[01:29:03.280 --> 01:29:11.260]   people today to forget how elevated Britain was in the late 1930s. You know, the gold standard was tied
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:18.300]   to the pound, not the dollar. And so Britain was the number one nation in the world at that time.
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:26.280]   And it just was. And it's so diminished by comparison today that it's hard to imagine it.
[01:29:26.280 --> 01:29:30.880]   And I think one of the interesting things about the historiography, about the narrative of how we tell
[01:29:30.880 --> 01:29:37.760]   World War II is that so much of it has been dictated by the shift in power that took place
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:44.360]   subsequent to 1945. And when people were starting to write these sort of major narratives in the 1970s
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:49.920]   and 80s and into the 1990s is through a prism of a very, very different world. And so one of the
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:54.580]   reasons why you have this narrative that, you know, Britain was a bit rubbish and hanging on the shirt
[01:29:54.580 --> 01:29:59.540]   tails of the Americans and, you know, all the blood was spelt in Eastern front. And, you know,
[01:29:59.540 --> 01:30:03.500]   Germany had the best army in the world and was only defeated because Hitler was mad and blah,
[01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:09.100]   blah, blah. You know, that, that kind of traditional narrative, it's, it's that narrative emerges through
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:14.280]   the prism of, of what was going on in the 1970s and what was going on in the 1980s and the changing
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.620]   world, rather than looking at it through the prism of the late 1930s or early 1940s.
[01:30:18.620 --> 01:30:24.920]   So there is this moment of decision. When do you think, what lesson do you take from that?
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:32.260]   When is the right time for appeasement to negotiate for diplomacy? And when is the right time for
[01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:44.420]   military strength, offensive, attacking, uh, for military conflict? Where's that, where's that line?
[01:30:44.580 --> 01:30:53.800]   Well, I kind of think it probably was when it was, I mean, Poland. Yeah. Honestly, I,
[01:30:53.800 --> 01:31:00.980]   I'm not sure it would have been the right decision to go to war in 1938. I just, I think it would,
[01:31:00.980 --> 01:31:06.240]   I, I'm, I can't predict because you can't second guess how things are going to play out because you
[01:31:06.240 --> 01:31:12.860]   just don't know. But, but I, I, I'm not sure that Chamberlain made the wrong decision. I'm not saying
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:16.460]   he made the right decision. I'm just like, I'm not, I'm being a bit wishy-washy about this.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:21.940]   You could have threatened it more. Imagine Churchill in those same meetings.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:26.800]   Yeah. But, but Churchill also appeases. I mean, he appeases Stalin all the time. I mean, you know,
[01:31:26.800 --> 01:31:30.980]   so the idea that Churchill's this big, strong man and never appeases, and you know, he's gung over war.
[01:31:30.980 --> 01:31:36.040]   Churchill's out of the government at that time. He, he, he recognizes you can't trust Hitler. He
[01:31:36.040 --> 01:31:42.680]   recognizes that narcissism is bad, but he, because he's out of the government, he doesn't have a window
[01:31:42.680 --> 01:31:48.840]   on exactly where Britain is at that particular time in a way that Chamberlain does. You know,
[01:31:48.840 --> 01:31:56.920]   so, so I suppose what I'm saying is Chamberlain is better placed to make those decisions than,
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:32:00.940]   than Churchill is, which again, doesn't mean that church, that Chamberlain is right. And Churchill is
[01:32:00.940 --> 01:32:07.000]   wrong. It's just, that's a massive pump to go to war in 1938 when you still don't have,
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:11.740]   you know, you've got a handful of spitfires, you've got a handful of hurricanes, you haven't got enough,
[01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:17.100]   you know, your air defense system isn't properly, properly sorted at this point. Um, your Navy is
[01:32:17.100 --> 01:32:25.140]   strong, but you know, what's that kind of look like? I mean, if you do go to war, because it's not
[01:32:25.140 --> 01:32:31.380]   going to be armies sweeping into Germany, it's just, it's going to be accelerated industrialization
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:37.260]   for a year. So no, you know, even if you go to war in 1938 over Czechoslovakia, Czechoslovakia will
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:42.400]   not be saved. That, you know, France and Britain will not be going and invading Germany that, you know,
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:47.420]   that is absolutely not going to happen. So sort of what's the point? I mean, you know, if you're not
[01:32:47.420 --> 01:32:53.300]   going to do that, why didn't you accelerate your rearmament thereafter, get your ducks in a row.
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:58.040]   And then you can consider it. I mean, after all, you know, even in September, 1939, they don't really
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:04.820]   do anything. I mean, we talked about the kind of the SAR offensive, which isn't really an offensive at
[01:33:04.820 --> 01:33:10.880]   all. It's firing one round of machine gun and scuttling back again. But I mean, they don't even do
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.840]   that then though. They're still buying time in 1939. And, you know, Britain is only just about ready to
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.260]   take on the onslaught of the Luftwaffe in summer of 1940.
[01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:21.400]   Well, nobody's ready for war.
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:24.920]   No. And you always want more than you've got at any time, even when you're winning.
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:31.380]   But like, really not ready. Even like you mentioned with Barbarossa,
[01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.520]   Nazi Germany is really not ready.
[01:33:34.520 --> 01:33:34.880]   Not ready.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:38.660]   Nobody's really, except France. I swear.
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:40.040]   France?
[01:33:40.040 --> 01:33:40.920]   I think France had radios.
[01:33:40.920 --> 01:33:43.880]   Fine. But come on. Come on.
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.740]   When Nazi Germany invades Poland, I mean.
[01:33:48.740 --> 01:33:54.580]   Yeah, it's terrible. It's terrible. Because I'm absolutely, I also do think that had France
[01:33:54.580 --> 01:33:59.980]   gone in, in some force, with some British troops as well, had they gone in, what would have
[01:33:59.980 --> 01:34:05.280]   happened is that would have, that easily could have brought down Hitler. Because most of his
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:08.880]   commanders are, his senior commanders are just thinking, what the hell is going on? This
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:14.380]   is a catastrophe. I mean, to a man. I mean, even Goering is thinking, this is a terrible idea.
[01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:19.060]   But they are absolutely not convinced. And when Hitler does his big talk to his,
[01:34:19.060 --> 01:34:24.200]   he asks all his senior commanders to come to the Berghof to brief them about the invasion of Poland.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:31.560]   It's just after the Ribbentrop-Molotov pact of the 22nd of August. He calls them all to the Berghof
[01:34:31.560 --> 01:34:35.620]   and says, come in, you know, come in mufti, come in civilian suits. They all turn up and he gives
[01:34:35.620 --> 01:34:40.440]   them this kind of huge, great speech. And says, this is the moment. This is, this is the time. This is
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:44.900]   what we're going to do. And they're all going, what? You're kidding me. What, we're going to Poland and,
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:50.100]   you know, on the 26th of August, that's the plan. Like two days time. You know, where's the plan?
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:55.560]   Well, you know, the whole point is that, you know, they're emerging and growing militarily,
[01:34:55.560 --> 01:34:59.720]   but they were supposed to have all these exercises where they, you know, coordinating ground forces,
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:05.520]   you know, the panzer spearhead with operations in the air with the Luftwaffe. None of that happens.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:10.140]   So Poland becomes the proving ground. And actually, they discover that there's lots of things that don't
[01:35:10.140 --> 01:35:16.860]   work and lots of things that are wrong. But, you know, it's flying in the face of all convention,
[01:35:16.860 --> 01:35:20.200]   military convention that, that they, you know, he does this without any kind of warning.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:25.480]   And even by the 1st of September, where there's been this kind of sort of five-day delay
[01:35:25.480 --> 01:35:31.860]   at those last minute negotiations, the last minute negotiations are thrust upon Hitler by
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:37.820]   people like Goering and by Mussolini and, and the Italians going, God, oh my God, don't do this.
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:42.380]   Don't do this. You know, there's got to be a solution. Hitler's absolutely jumping at the bit.
[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:49.040]   Well, in that case, from a dark militaristic perspective, his bet paid off.
[01:35:49.040 --> 01:35:55.040]   Well, except that it ended in ruins in May, 1945 with the total collapse of Germany. So you could
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.060]   say the worst decision he ever made was going into Poland in September, 1939. Depends the way you look
[01:36:00.060 --> 01:36:04.920]   at it. But I mean, yes, you know, it's successful in that the, you know, Poland's overrun in 18 days.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.120]   And there's, there's so many counterfactuals here, but I mean, if you would say to Hitler on the 30th
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:15.040]   of April, you know, as he's sort of taking out the pistol from his holster on his sofa in the,
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:21.380]   in the Führer bunk and going, you know, so out of 1st of September, 1939, still backing yourself on
[01:36:21.380 --> 01:36:27.280]   that one. I mean, he might have a different view. The guy's insane and full of blunder. So he probably
[01:36:27.280 --> 01:36:28.960]   would have said, yeah, do it all over again.
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:30.220]   Yeah. I'm sure he would have done it as well.
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:35.480]   Conquest. Poland was not a mistake. So the union was not a mistake.
[01:36:35.480 --> 01:36:35.780]   No.
[01:36:35.780 --> 01:36:36.920]   It's just some of the tactics.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:39.260]   Other people I was let down by, by people not being strong enough.
[01:36:39.260 --> 01:36:41.120]   Yeah. The Prussian generals are all.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:44.660]   Yeah. Yeah. Of course. That's exactly what he'd say. It wasn't my fault.
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:52.100]   He might have quietly done some different decisions about Barbarossa. Maybe the timing would be
[01:36:52.100 --> 01:36:52.420]   different.
[01:36:52.960 --> 01:36:55.820]   Maybe that all out central for us rather than kind of splitting it through.
[01:36:55.820 --> 01:36:56.260]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:36:56.260 --> 01:37:02.480]   But he was very sure. It seems like maybe you can correct me that Britain and France would still
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.800]   carry on with appeasement even after he invaded Poland.
[01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:12.580]   Absolutely. He, he was completely convinced by it. There was clearly a kind of sort of 10 to 15%
[01:37:12.580 --> 01:37:20.240]   level of doubt, but what the heck I'm going to do it anyway. He was just, he ratcheted himself up
[01:37:20.240 --> 01:37:26.380]   into such a laver of, of kind of, this is the moment I have to do it now. This is fate. I'm 50.
[01:37:26.380 --> 01:37:31.180]   And, and, you know, I could be taken out by an assassin's bullet. I've got this important life
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:35.200]   work that I've got to do. We've got to get on with it now. There could be no more delay. This is
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:39.560]   my mission. You know, this is our mission of the German people and either the German people have got
[01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:45.120]   the will and the, and the spirit to be able to pull it off. Or, you know, I was wrong. And, and
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:49.480]   therefore, you know, we don't deserve to be a thousand year, right? We don't deserve to be the
[01:37:49.480 --> 01:37:54.600]   master race. Black or white. I saw them either or that's same all the time.
[01:37:54.600 --> 01:38:00.840]   So can you tell the story of the Molotov ribbon trope packed in 1939? So they make an agreement,
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:07.220]   Nazi Germany, the Soviet union. And that leads us just like you mentioned in a matter of days,
[01:38:07.220 --> 01:38:11.580]   how compact everything is. It's just really, really fascinating.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:17.380]   It's a beautiful summer in Europe, summer of 1939, you know, it's one of these glorious summers that
[01:38:17.380 --> 01:38:23.700]   sort of never rains. It's just sunshine, sunny day after sunny day. It's kind of, you know,
[01:38:23.700 --> 01:38:30.700]   it's like that sort of golden summer of 1914 as well, you know, where sky always seems to be blue,
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:36.240]   fluffy white clouds, everyone's sort of, you know, but this sort of the storm clouds of war to use that
[01:38:36.240 --> 01:38:42.800]   cliche are kind of brewing. The Russians have, have reached out to Britain and France and said,
[01:38:42.800 --> 01:38:48.160]   come on, come on over, let's negotiate, you know, let's see what we can do. Um, and there is just
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:55.980]   no stomach for that at all. I mean, if ever there is a, I think a mistake that's Britain and France
[01:38:55.980 --> 01:39:03.640]   should have been a bit more into real politics and than they were that it's such an opportunity
[01:39:03.640 --> 01:39:10.840]   to, to, to ensure that you, to snooker the third Reich and, and they don't take it. Um, because,
[01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:16.820]   you know, in many ways they see the westward spread of communism in exactly the same way that the Nazis
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:22.280]   see the threat of the westward spread of communism as something that's every bit as repellent as
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:29.760]   Nazism and, and they don't want to be getting into bed with these guys. Um, of course they kind of have
[01:39:29.760 --> 01:39:37.240]   to kind of change tack on that one in summer of 1941 and, you know, in very quick order. Um, and that's
[01:39:37.240 --> 01:39:40.660]   the whole point about Churchill appeasing Stalin. I mean, you know, it's all very well people saying,
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:44.580]   well, you know, Churchill wouldn't have appeased Hitler in 1930s, but he does appease, he appeases all
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:51.840]   the time. Um, and they miss that opportunity and the, and the, the French and British delegation is
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:58.360]   third tier commanders generals going over. It's, it's a, it's a, yeah, it's a shit show. I mean,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:03.420]   yeah, excuse my French, but I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's a nonsense that they're not ready for it.
[01:40:03.420 --> 01:40:10.320]   They're not prepared. The British guy, um, Admiral Drax doesn't have any authority. Um, the whole thing's
[01:40:10.320 --> 01:40:13.880]   a complete joke. It's not, it's never going to get anywhere. You tell the story of this quite
[01:40:13.880 --> 01:40:20.960]   beautifully, actually. Uh, again, it's such a human story. I mean, the, it seems like the Stalin and
[01:40:20.960 --> 01:40:27.100]   Soviet, they've already made up their mind, but I don't think they have. I think what they, I mean,
[01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:33.560]   you described quite well that they value in-person meeting. Yes. So like Chamberlain should have just
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:42.000]   gone to Moscow. Yeah. Get on a plane. Like it, I, it's such a, uh, maybe it's a simplistic notion,
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:46.860]   but that could have changed the trajectory of human history right there. I really think it could have
[01:40:46.860 --> 01:40:51.420]   done. I think that was, I think that's, I think that's much more grievous mistake than, than the
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:41:00.240]   Munich. Why are leaders so hesitant to meet? I, I I'm told now by a bunch of diplomats that no,
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:05.360]   no, no, no, no, no. There's a process, you know, at first you have to have these diplomats meet and
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:12.580]   they have to draft a bunch of stuff. And I sometimes have the simplistic notion, like why not, why not
[01:41:12.580 --> 01:41:20.400]   meet? Why not meet? Like, I think there is a human element there. Um, of course, especially when there's
[01:41:20.400 --> 01:41:29.260]   this force that is Hitler. Well, yes. And because we humans, we like to interact and, and you like to
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:35.660]   see people in three dimensions and, you know, I'm sure it's why you always quite rightly insist on
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:40.000]   doing your podcast face-to-face because you want to get the cut of someone's jib and you want to be
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:45.540]   able to see them and you want to see the intonation in their expression and the whites of their eyes and
[01:41:45.540 --> 01:41:49.140]   all that kind of stuff. And that just does, does make a difference of course, because you know,
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:53.800]   we're fundamentally animals and we kind of, we, we want to be sizing people up and it's much easier
[01:41:53.800 --> 01:42:00.420]   to do that when you're a few feet away from each other than it is on a video screen or through the
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:06.540]   prism of someone else. Yeah. But there's also just, you see the, the humanity in, in others. It's so
[01:42:06.540 --> 01:42:11.100]   much easier. You see this in social media. It's so much easier to talk shit about others
[01:42:11.100 --> 01:42:17.720]   when you're not with them. Yes. And like military conflict is the extreme version of that. Yeah.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:23.020]   You can construct these narratives that they're not human, that they're evil, that they're, you can
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:29.680]   construct a communist ideology, all of these, you can project onto them the worst possible
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.580]   version of what, uh, of a human. But when you meet them, you're like, Oh,
[01:42:35.580 --> 01:42:39.900]   they are just a person. They're just a person. Well, it's the world's great tragedy that, that,
[01:42:39.900 --> 01:42:43.060]   that it's only a few people that want to go to war and the vast majority want to live happily,
[01:42:43.060 --> 01:42:47.900]   contented lives, getting on with their neighbors. I mean, it has been ever thus. It's just,
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:53.880]   it is those few that kind of ruin it for everybody else. But, but, but anyway, to go back to Leningrad,
[01:42:53.880 --> 01:43:02.180]   um, back in August, 1939, they go half cock. They're disrespectful to Soviet Union as a result of
[01:43:02.180 --> 01:43:07.980]   that. Um, it gets nowhere. Had they been able to put on a really, really firm offer there and then
[01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:14.620]   to the Soviet Union, Soviet Union would have, would have probably come in. I mean, the big thing is,
[01:43:14.620 --> 01:43:19.820]   is that the Soviet Union said, this is a big stumbling block. The Soviet Union said, yeah,
[01:43:19.820 --> 01:43:24.540]   but we want to be able to march through Poland if we get threatened by Germany.
[01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.820]   Both the British and the French just smell a massive rat there. They're basically saying,
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:34.220]   you know, if they agree to that, what they're, what they fear is that Soviet Union will just march
[01:43:34.220 --> 01:43:38.860]   into Poland and go, yeah, but you said we could and take it, which they unquestionably would have
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:43.740]   done, but it would have stopped the world war properly. They're willing to appease Hitler.
[01:43:43.740 --> 01:43:47.280]   They're not willing to appease Stalin in that situation. Well, they're not willing to appease
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.640]   anybody by that stage. That's the point. Well, they appeased Hitler.
[01:43:51.360 --> 01:43:56.200]   There's a now, there's a bottom line, you know, which is, which is Poland, you know,
[01:43:56.200 --> 01:44:00.440]   so it's changed. That's right. Right. But anyway, the bottom line is they don't,
[01:44:00.440 --> 01:44:05.560]   you know, there is a, there is a, a reluctance on the part of French and British to negotiate
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:11.160]   with the Soviet Union because they're communists. Don't like them. Don't trust them. Worry about
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.580]   what they're going to do with Poland and they're going to be, you know, jumping out of the fire into
[01:44:15.580 --> 01:44:20.660]   the kind of water and it doesn't come off. And as a consequence of that, Soviet Union
[01:44:20.660 --> 01:44:28.620]   continued to pursue more hardly, you know, um, more, more vociferously the opportunities that the, um,
[01:44:28.620 --> 01:44:37.340]   that the Germans are offering, which is the split of Poland because Soviet Union wants that part of
[01:44:37.340 --> 01:44:41.960]   Poland back in its own sphere of influence and it doesn't want to go to war just yet.
[01:44:42.500 --> 01:44:47.540]   And the agreement that they won't attack each other, essentially. Yeah. Do you think Stalin
[01:44:47.540 --> 01:44:48.740]   actually believed that?
[01:44:48.740 --> 01:44:52.400]   No, he believed it in the same way that Hitler believed it, that it was a cynical kind of,
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:58.820]   you know, convenient bit of real politic for now. I mean, I think, I think Soviet Union was as
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:02.560]   determined to get rid of the Nazis as the Nazis were determined to get rid of the Soviet Union. I think
[01:45:02.560 --> 01:45:08.740]   whoever fired first was not, not decided at that point, but I do think that from the moment that
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:12.520]   Hitler takes power in 1933, a conflict between Soviet Union and Nazi Germany is inevitable.
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:17.140]   Yeah. So you, either direction you think it's inevitable. Yeah. I think, I think there's,
[01:45:17.140 --> 01:45:22.540]   yeah, there's a huge amount of evidence for that. Stalin probably wanted it, what, like in 42, 43?
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:23.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.280]   Something like that.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:27.480]   Yeah. And, you know, they're doing exercises and stuff and building out. He's not ready yet
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:31.300]   because he knows he's done the purges and he's got to get his, his army, you know, he's got to get his
[01:45:31.300 --> 01:45:35.540]   armed forces back into shape and all the rest of it. But, you know, so they have this incredibly
[01:45:35.540 --> 01:45:40.780]   cynical agreement, but at that point, you know, Hitler's hands are untied. You know, he no longer
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:46.700]   has to worry about, about the threat from Soviet Union. Um, he's got carte blanche to go into Poland and
[01:45:46.700 --> 01:45:50.220]   he doesn't believe that France and Britain are going to go to war over Poland. He's wrong about that,
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:54.260]   obviously, but, but, but France and Britain, despite going to war with him, still do nothing.
[01:45:54.260 --> 01:45:56.560]   So, you know, he's got a way of it.
[01:45:56.560 --> 01:46:01.940]   Who was Churchill and how did Churchill come to power at this moment?
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:07.700]   Well, Churchill is this absolutely towering figure in British politics. You know, he's been,
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:12.800]   you know, he's first a minister in the kind of noughties of the 20th century and the first years
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:18.520]   of, of the 20th century. Um, first of the liberals, then of the conservatives. He's a former chancellor,
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:27.740]   um, um, of this checker. Um, he's a towering figure, but he's been in the wilderness because
[01:46:27.740 --> 01:46:33.540]   he's out of favor with the Stanley Baldwin government. Um, he's out of favor with, with,
[01:46:33.540 --> 01:46:39.300]   with Chamberlain, but he is this towering figure and he has been very outspoken as a backbencher,
[01:46:39.300 --> 01:46:42.100]   which basically means, you know, you're not a minister. You're not in the cabinet. You're just
[01:46:42.100 --> 01:46:46.200]   an ordinary member of parliament, but obviously you're an ordinary member of parliament, but you're
[01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:50.940]   also an ordinary member of parliament who has had ministries of state, uh, and who is this
[01:46:50.940 --> 01:46:55.400]   towering figure. So he's listened to in a way that other backbenchers aren't. Um, and he has been
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:59.660]   saying, you know, we need to stand up to the dictators. We need to do this. Um, we need to
[01:46:59.660 --> 01:47:05.260]   rearm more, more heavily, uh, and blah, blah, blah. So when war is declared, he's brought back into
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:12.640]   the Admiralty, um, and charge of the Navy, which is Britain's senior service. And, um, suddenly he's
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:18.740]   there. And what happens is Britain doesn't really do anything. It's very difficult working with France
[01:47:18.740 --> 01:47:22.580]   because France is so politically fractured that they can't make any decisions when you can't make
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:28.380]   any decisions. You're just impotent. Um, and so Churchill first mentions going into Norway,
[01:47:28.380 --> 01:47:32.860]   mining the leads. So, um, the idea is that you're making life very difficult for the Germans to get
[01:47:32.860 --> 01:47:37.340]   iron ore out of Sweden. Their main, their main source of iron ore is up in the Northern part of Sweden
[01:47:37.340 --> 01:47:42.400]   in the Arctic circle and then goes on a railway through Northern tip of Norway and then gets
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:50.480]   shipped down the, um, West coast of Norway into Germany, into the Baltic. So, uh, Churchill suggests
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:56.340]   in September, 1939, why don't we mine the leads, which are the leads are these passageways, um, out of
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:01.940]   the fjords and the, in the North into the, uh, into the North sea. Why don't we mine those and stop the
[01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:06.280]   Germans from, from, from, um, um, taking this? Everyone goes, well, yeah, that's quite a good idea, but they
[01:48:06.280 --> 01:48:11.020]   can't decide. And French are nervous that if they do that, the Germans will retaliate and bomb France and
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:17.700]   all this kind of stuff. So no decision is made until kind of April, 19, 1940. They go up to start mining the
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:23.060]   leads on exactly the same day that the Germans invade Denmark and Norway. And so they're, they're
[01:48:23.060 --> 01:48:28.660]   caught off guards. And at that moment, really, it's seen as a failure of Chamberlain's government. And there is a
[01:48:28.660 --> 01:48:34.040]   kind of, uh, a mounting realization that no matter how good he was or competent he was as a peacetime
[01:48:34.040 --> 01:48:37.640]   prime minister, he's not a wartime prime minister. You know, he's not served in the armed forces
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:43.140]   himself. He doesn't really understand it. It needs a different set of hands. And, um, his government
[01:48:43.140 --> 01:48:49.360]   falls on the 9th of May. It becomes inevitable that he's going to have to resign. And the obvious
[01:48:49.360 --> 01:48:53.480]   person to take his place is Lord Halifax, who is in the house of Lords, but you can still be a prime
[01:48:53.480 --> 01:48:59.700]   minister. And, um, he is without question, the most respected politician in the country. He's,
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:08.040]   um, uh, former Viceroy of India. He's seen as incredibly safe pair of hands, man of resolute
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:15.300]   sound judgment, et cetera, et cetera. Um, but he doesn't want to take it. He feels physically ill at
[01:49:15.300 --> 01:49:19.940]   the prospect. Doesn't want this responsibility. He's also not really a military man. He's got a slightly
[01:49:19.940 --> 01:49:25.540]   sort of withered hand, which has prevented him from doing military service. And he just blanches
[01:49:25.540 --> 01:49:30.320]   at this moment. And that really leaves only one other figure that could possibly take on this
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:37.800]   position and that's Churchill. So when Chamberlain resigns on the 9th of May and Halifax says,
[01:49:37.800 --> 01:49:42.620]   it's, it's not for me. Um, the only person who's going to slip into that position is Churchill and he
[01:49:42.620 --> 01:49:48.360]   becomes prime minister and he accepts it gladly. He feels like it is his mission in life. This is his
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.180]   moment. Come of the outcome of the man, but he comes with a huge amount of baggage. I mean,
[01:49:52.180 --> 01:49:56.500]   you know, he's known as a man who drinks too much, who's whose judgment hasn't always been great. You
[01:49:56.500 --> 01:50:01.780]   know, he was chancellor during the time of the general strike 1926, you know, he backed Edward
[01:50:01.780 --> 01:50:06.960]   the eighth over the, uh, monarchy crisis when the King wanted to marry Wallace Simpson, the divorcee
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.160]   Catholic divorcee, et cetera, et cetera. So, you know, his judgment has been brought into question.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.900]   You know, he is the man who was, he came up with the idea of the Gallipoli campaign, which was,
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:20.340]   you know, an ignominious failure, blah, blah, blah. So there are issues over him. You know,
[01:50:20.340 --> 01:50:26.340]   he is seen as a hothead and a man who doesn't have the kind of sound judgment of Halifax. So the jury is,
[01:50:26.340 --> 01:50:31.000]   is very much out. And I think it's, again, it's one of those things where you have to put yourself
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:36.820]   in, you have to look at this through the prism of what people were thinking in May, 1940. Yes,
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:44.940]   he, he was considered a towering politician, but he is seen also as a loose cannon and by no means the
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:52.700]   right person in this hour of darkness. And it is coincidental that the 10th of May, 1940, when he
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:57.940]   takes over as prime minister, becomes prime minister, not for an election, but by default of a new
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:03.600]   nationalist government. So no longer a conservative company government, but a nationalist cross-party
[01:51:03.600 --> 01:51:10.560]   coalition government for the duration of the war, which includes, you know, members of the Liberal
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:17.920]   Party and also the Labour Party, as well as conservatives, that it is by no means certain
[01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:23.320]   that he's going to be able to deliver the goods. And it is also coincidentally the same day that the
[01:51:23.320 --> 01:51:28.720]   Germans launched Case Yellow, Operation Yellow, the invasion of the low countries in France.
[01:51:28.720 --> 01:51:36.560]   Democrats. So these are tumultuous events to put it mildly. And it is also the case that,
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:43.280]   you know, only a couple of weeks before, um, Paul Reynaud has taken over as prime minister of yet
[01:51:43.280 --> 01:51:51.680]   another coalition government in France from, from Deladier. So political turmoil is very much the watchword
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:57.280]   at this time for the, uh, for the Western democracies, just at the moment that the Germans are making their
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:52:02.080]   kind of, you know, their hammer strike into the West, this might be a good moment to bring up
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:11.600]   this idea that has been circulating recently brought up by Daryl Cooper, who hyperbolically
[01:52:11.600 --> 01:52:18.480]   stated that Churchill was the quote, chief villain of, uh, the second world war to give a good faith
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:23.200]   interpretation of that. I believe he meant that Churchill forced Hitler to escalate the expansion
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:28.720]   of Nazi Germany beyond Poland into a global war. So Churchill is the one that turned
[01:52:28.720 --> 01:52:38.160]   this narrow war, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Poland into a global one. Um,
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:44.000]   is that accurate? No, I don't think it is. I mean, not least because the decisions over
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.240]   Poland were made by Chamberlain's government, not when Churchill was out of government. So, you know,
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:53.120]   Churchill wasn't even involved in that decision making process at the time. No, I don't think so.
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.640]   I mean, again, I go back to kind of Britain's position in the world in 1939.
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:04.560]   If you say we are going to defend the sovereignty of Poland and then you don't,
[01:53:04.560 --> 01:53:10.640]   that is, that looks really bad globally. You know, Britain's prestige would plummet,
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:16.640]   would lead to all sorts of problems. Um, you are saying that you're giving carte blanche to dictators to
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:22.400]   just run amok and take whatever territory they want. You are risking the future upheaval of the global
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:30.480]   order, um, away from democracies into the hands of dictators. You know, in the West, people believe
[01:53:30.480 --> 01:53:37.040]   in democracy and believe in advancement of, of, um, freedoms of people. It's just, you know, to, uh,
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:42.560]   to echo the words of Roosevelt in August, 1941, you know, that they're aspiring to world, um,
[01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:52.880]   free of want and fear. Now, obviously there's still some issues with the form that, uh, democracy takes
[01:53:52.880 --> 01:53:57.040]   in the night, 1930s. It's not democratic for everyone. You know, try saying that if you're in
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:54:03.760]   Nigeria or, uh, or, or India or whatever. Um, or if you're, uh, you know, in the black Southern states
[01:54:03.760 --> 01:54:09.440]   of United States, but the aspirations are there. And I think that's, that's, that's an important
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.320]   distinction. And I think by saying that, that Churchill is the chief warmonger of the second
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:18.640]   world war, I think is, is ludicrous. You know, it's the same thing about, about the bombing,
[01:54:18.640 --> 01:54:22.720]   you know, the, the, the detractors of strategic air campaign always go, yeah, but you know,
[01:54:22.720 --> 01:54:27.360]   Germans had the Holocaust, but, but weren't the, weren't the allies just as bad to killing all
[01:54:27.360 --> 01:54:31.760]   those civilians? It's like, no, because the moment Hitler stopped the war, the bombing would stop.
[01:54:31.760 --> 01:54:36.640]   You know, the moment the war stopped in Hitler's favor, the killing would continue and be accelerated.
[01:54:36.640 --> 01:54:42.160]   So the, the thing you mentioned initially is this sort of the idealist perspective of,
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:52.960]   well, Britain can't allow sort of, uh, this warmonger to break all these pacts and be undemocratic,
[01:54:52.960 --> 01:55:00.000]   you know, um, murder a large number of people and do
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:07.680]   conquest of territory. Okay. That's idealistic. But if we look at the realist perspective,
[01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:16.160]   what decisions would minimize the amount of suffering on the continent in the next 50 years?
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:25.360]   So one of the arguments that he's making, I happen to disagree with it, to put it mildly, is that
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:33.600]   Churchill increased the amount of suffering. So Churchill, Churchill's presence and decisions.
[01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:38.800]   So we're not talking about idealistic perspective. We're talking about realists, like the reality of
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:45.280]   the war, of Stalin, of, of Hitler, of Churchill, of, uh, of France and FDR.
[01:55:48.240 --> 01:55:57.280]   Did Churchill drag Hitler into a world war? Did he force Hitler to invade Soviet Union? Did he force
[01:55:57.280 --> 01:56:02.960]   Hitler to then invade, uh, attack Britain?
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.840]   Well, no, because, because Hitler was always going to invade the Soviet Union if, unless, unless the
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:15.200]   Soviet Union invaded Germany first. So that was always going to happen. Um, no one asked Hitler to
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:20.640]   invade the low countries and Norway and Denmark and attack Britain. Um,
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:30.080]   he does that of course, because he's not given a free hand in Poland, but there's no question that
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:35.920]   Hitler would have also wanted to subdue France or certainly turn France from a democracy into a
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:39.200]   totalitarian state as well. I'm absolutely certain about that.
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.600]   So I think there's pretty definitive evidence. I mean, it's obvious from everything he said,
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:48.400]   from everything he's written, from everything, everywhere that he was going to invade the Soviet
[01:56:48.400 --> 01:56:56.480]   Union, uh, no matter what. Yeah. And France, most likely. Yes. Also, he would have done a deal with
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:05.200]   Britain. Britain could have existed. So actually there is a, is there, there is a possible reality.
[01:57:05.200 --> 01:57:10.080]   I don't know. Maybe you can correct me on this where Hitler basically takes all of Europe except
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:13.600]   Britain. Yes. But then he would have got so strong that he would have then turned on Britain as well,
[01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:18.400]   you know, because he would, you know, the fear is that if you let him do this and then,
[01:57:18.400 --> 01:57:22.240]   then he gets greedy. He wants the next one. Then he wants the next one. Then he wants the next one.
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.880]   And you know, then he wants to take over the whole world. And you know, that is, that is the fear of
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:31.920]   the British. That is the fear of the Americans. That's the fear of President Roosevelt. He's got a
[01:57:31.920 --> 01:57:37.920]   very, we haven't even touched on this yet, but he has a very difficult, uh, um, case on his hands because
[01:57:39.200 --> 01:57:47.760]   he's come into power also in January, 1933, um, as president of the United States on an isolationist
[01:57:47.760 --> 01:57:52.800]   ticket with a retrenching, with a kind of sort of, you know, step away from the European old order.
[01:57:52.800 --> 01:57:58.080]   It's time for the Europeans sat on their own. Um, it all sounds very familiar right now. Um, and,
[01:57:58.080 --> 01:58:05.440]   and suddenly he's got to do this gargantuan political vault fast, um, and prepare the nation for
[01:58:05.440 --> 01:58:09.840]   war because he also fears like Churchill fears like most like Chamberlain feared as well.
[01:58:09.840 --> 01:58:17.600]   Um, the, that Hitler's designs are not purely on Eastern Europe and the Liebens from there,
[01:58:17.600 --> 01:58:22.960]   but would get ever bigger. And I don't, I don't doubt that they're right. I think if he'd prevailed
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:28.080]   in the Soviet Union, you know, he'd always wanted more, you know, because his whole concept is the
[01:58:28.080 --> 01:58:33.840]   master race, you know? Yeah. I think, I think it should be said if we measure human suffering,
[01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.280]   if there was not Britain on the other side, if it was not a two front war,
[01:58:39.280 --> 01:58:45.040]   that the chances of Hitler succeeding in the Soviet Union is much higher or at least a more
[01:58:45.040 --> 01:58:52.320]   prolonged war and there would be more dead and more enslaved and more tortured and all of this.
[01:58:52.320 --> 01:58:56.480]   Yes. And, and ditto if you, you know, if the, if the allies hadn't gone involved against Imperial
[01:58:56.480 --> 01:59:03.440]   Japan, you know, it would have been, would have been catastrophic. I mean, 20 to 30 million Chinese dead
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:09.200]   anyway, you know, with American and British intervention and it wasn't going to be in China
[01:59:09.200 --> 01:59:15.360]   without that. I mean, and elsewhere, you know, because, because the reason why Japan invades
[01:59:15.360 --> 01:59:25.920]   French Indochina now Vietnam, um, and Hong Kong and, um, and Malaya and Singapore and, uh, and so on
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:32.720]   and Burma is because it's not winning in China and it needs more resources because it's resource poor
[01:59:32.720 --> 01:59:40.240]   and America has cut off the tap. So it's going into these countries to, to get what it needs.
[01:59:40.240 --> 01:59:45.360]   It's rubber and oil and natural resources and oils, precious oils and all the rest of it.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:50.320]   And if it had been unchecked, it would have done so. And then it would have absolutely
[01:59:50.320 --> 01:59:55.600]   built up its strength and overrun the whole of China with even more deaths. So,
[01:59:55.600 --> 02:00:00.640]   you know, I, I, I think there is, I think the, one of the interesting things about the second world war
[02:00:00.640 --> 02:00:06.480]   is, is lots of wars and why people get involved in them are extremely questionable. But I think there is
[02:00:06.480 --> 02:00:14.000]   a moral crusade to, to the allies and what they're doing that I think is entirely justified.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:18.240]   What I think is interesting also is that as the war progresses,
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:23.600]   you know, if the allies are supposed to be on the force of the good, how come they're doing so much bad?
[02:00:23.600 --> 02:00:29.520]   And at what point is doing bad stopping you from doing good? And at what point are you doing good,
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:35.680]   but also doing bad at the same time, such as destruction of cities, um, destruction of
[02:00:35.680 --> 02:00:42.480]   monasteries on outcrops in Southern Italy, you know, destruction of killing of lots of civilians,
[02:00:42.480 --> 02:00:49.840]   et cetera, et cetera. You know, these are, these are difficult questions to, to answer sometimes.
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:56.320]   They're also incredibly interesting. And I think that moral component starts to blur a little bit by
[02:00:56.320 --> 02:01:01.840]   kind of middle of the war by 1943. You know, it's, it's kind of easy to have a, a fairly, uh,
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:06.720]   cut and dry, um, war in North Africa, in the deserts of North Africa, where, you know,
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.400]   the only people getting in the way are, are a few sort of Bedouin tribesmen or something.
[02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:15.280]   But, but once you start getting into Europe or getting into the kind of the, the meat of highly
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:20.560]   populated countries in the far East, um, for example, that's a different kettle of fish
[02:01:20.560 --> 02:01:26.800]   because the scale of destruction is absolutely immense, but it is also the job of, of political
[02:01:26.800 --> 02:01:33.520]   leaders, um, to look after and defend their own peoples first and foremost. And so what you're
[02:01:33.520 --> 02:01:37.600]   doing is you're trying to protect your own sovereignty, your own people before you're
[02:01:37.600 --> 02:01:45.680]   protecting other people. And so that's what leads to, you know, the whole way in which the allies are,
[02:01:45.680 --> 02:01:51.040]   the Western allies are protracting war is to try and minimize the number of deaths of their own young
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:57.520]   men as much as they possibly can whilst at the same time winning the war. And that means bringing lots
[02:01:57.520 --> 02:02:01.760]   of destruction to your enemies, but also trying to minimize it. And the way you bring lots of destruction
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:06.560]   by to your enemies is by using immense firepower and this concept of steel, not our flesh, which I
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:13.040]   mentioned earlier on and technology, um, so that you don't have to bring to bear too many of your
[02:02:13.040 --> 02:02:18.160]   young men's eyes. You don't have a repeat of the slaughter of the first world war. So, you know,
[02:02:18.160 --> 02:02:22.640]   it is really interesting that, that in, in our mind's eye, when we're thinking of, you know,
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:28.080]   the Western allies and the second world war, probably the first thing that comes into mind is Americans
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:33.600]   jumping out of landing craft on Omaha beach on D day, for example, those are infantrymen. They're the
[02:02:33.600 --> 02:02:38.160]   front line. They are the coal face of that. They're the first people going into the, into the fire of
[02:02:38.160 --> 02:02:44.960]   the enemy. And we tend to think about guys in tanks, um, infantrymen with their Garand rifles or,
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.200]   you know, machine guns or whatever. That's, that's what springs to mind. Yet actually they're a
[02:02:49.200 --> 02:02:56.000]   comparatively small proportion of the army. So no more than 14 to 15% of any army allied army is
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:03:02.560]   infantry. 45% are service corps, service troops, driving trucks and cooks and bottle washers and
[02:03:02.560 --> 02:03:06.800]   people lugging great big boxes of stuff, you know, and that's because by that stage, you know,
[02:03:06.800 --> 02:03:11.520]   the allies have worked out of the way of war, which is, is to, is to use is what I call big war,
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:17.680]   this concept of, of a very long tail logistics, the operational art, making sure that people have
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:23.200]   the absolute best you possibly can. Great medical care, huge advances in, in, in first aid and a
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:29.360]   medical care of troops, getting them back onto the battlefield and you're using firepower and
[02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:35.520]   technology and mechanization to do a lot of your hard yards. So, you know, that's the principle
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:39.520]   behind strategic bombing. You know, if you can, if you go over and bomb and you can destroy
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:46.080]   infrastructure and civilians and households, that makes it much harder for, for Krupp to make those
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:52.080]   panther tanks and tiger tanks or whatever it might be and guns. Uh, and you know, you're disrupting the
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:57.280]   transportation system in Germany, you know, you're making life difficult for them to do what they need
[02:03:57.280 --> 02:04:02.240]   to do. Then that means it's going to be easier for those 15, 14, 15% of infantry. And you've got to
[02:04:02.240 --> 02:04:07.040]   jump out of landing craft to do their job. And you're trying to keep that to a minimum. And you'd have to
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:12.000]   say, broadly speaking, that's a very sensible policy that makes an awful lot of sense. Um,
[02:04:13.360 --> 02:04:19.440]   consequence of that is a huge amount of destruction. And maybe that's what Daryl Cooper's driving at,
[02:04:19.440 --> 02:04:26.480]   but no one asked Hitler to invade Poland. I mean, you know, that is the bottom line. No one asked Germany
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:32.240]   to go to war. No one asked Hitler to come up with these ludicrous ideology. Yeah. There's complex ethical
[02:04:32.240 --> 02:04:38.400]   discussions here about, uh, uh, uh, just like, as you described, which are fascinating, which are
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:48.640]   fascinating and, uh, war is hell. And there's many ways in which it is hell. Uh, just for a little bit,
[02:04:48.640 --> 02:04:55.360]   the steel man, what, uh, Daryl is where he might be coming from is since world war II,
[02:04:56.720 --> 02:05:07.040]   the simplistic veneration of Churchill. So saying Churchill, good Hitler, bad has been used as a
[02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:16.720]   template to project under other conflicts to justify military, uh, intervention. And so his general,
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:24.720]   his and other people like libertarians, for example, resistance to that overly simplistic veneration of
[02:05:24.720 --> 02:05:31.360]   somebody like Churchill has to do with the fact that that seems to be by neocons and warmongers
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:37.760]   in the military industrial complex in the United States and elsewhere using Hitler way too much using
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:45.040]   Churchill way too much to justify invading everywhere and anywhere. Well, I do agree with that. I think
[02:05:45.040 --> 02:05:52.640]   oversimplification of anything is a mistake. You know, life is nuanced. The past is nuanced. It's okay to be
[02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:56.400]   proud about certain things and it's okay to be disgusted by other things. That's absolutely fine.
[02:05:56.400 --> 02:06:00.480]   You know, we have a complicated relationship with our past. It doesn't need to be black and white.
[02:06:00.480 --> 02:06:05.040]   And, um, you know, life is not a straight line. And of course there's the, you know,
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:10.240]   the allies make plenty of mistakes in, in, in world war II. Overall, I think they made the right calls.
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:14.880]   And I think one of the things that's really interesting is I think that the allies for the most part
[02:06:15.840 --> 02:06:26.240]   use their resources much more judiciously and sensibly than the axis powers do and, you know, good, um,
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:31.280]   because that means they prevail. I think, you know, there are so many lessons, um, from
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:36.480]   world war II that could have been brought into the last history of the last 30 years, which weren't,
[02:06:37.040 --> 02:06:43.760]   you know, such as, you know, if you have, if you, if you decapitate an incredibly strong leader,
[02:06:43.760 --> 02:06:47.280]   you get a power vacuum. And if you don't have a solution for that power vacuum,
[02:06:47.280 --> 02:06:50.720]   lots of bad elements are going to sweep into that in very quick order, which of course is exactly what
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:56.640]   happens in, in, in Iraq. So, you know, don't run. So I'm going, we don't do reconstruction where you
[02:06:57.200 --> 02:07:02.000]   freaking well should do, you know, this, this, if you're going to, if you're going to take on this,
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:06.400]   this particular challenge, you've got to see it through, you know, that's, that's simply not good
[02:07:06.400 --> 02:07:10.240]   enough. You know, it's not good enough to go into Afghanistan and go, okay, we're going to change
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:13.840]   things around. It's going to be great. You know, all the women are going to have education. They won't
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:21.520]   have to wear kind of, you know, uh, um, won't have to cover up their bodies anymore. Um, anything goes,
[02:07:21.520 --> 02:07:27.040]   we love liberalism. It's great. Um, let's make Kabul into a thriving city once more and then suddenly bug out.
[02:07:27.760 --> 02:07:31.600]   you know, cause what, what, what's going to happen? You're going to undo everything.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:36.160]   And, uh, and I remember being in, you know, this is a bit of a segue legs, but I remember being in,
[02:07:36.160 --> 02:07:42.720]   in Northern Helmand province back in, you know, when it was January, 2008 and, uh, British troops had
[02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:50.080]   just taken over an absolute dump of a town called, um, Musakala. And I remember talking to this Afghan
[02:07:50.080 --> 02:07:55.120]   guy. He just had all his willow trees chopped down to make room for a helipad that the allies wanted,
[02:07:55.120 --> 02:08:01.200]   which said, you know, put that kind of surround, you know, those cages with kind of rubble in the
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:06.160]   protective wall. It's called Hescombe. I think it was called. Anyway, I said to him, what do you,
[02:08:06.160 --> 02:08:09.680]   what do you think about, about the British being there? And he just went, he shrugged at me and
[02:08:09.680 --> 02:08:16.320]   lifted up his hands and said, well, you know, if they stay great, but they won't. And, and he said,
[02:08:16.320 --> 02:08:20.000]   said, you know, if they stay, then brilliant. But he said, I'll tell you what, he said,
[02:08:23.840 --> 02:08:27.120]   leave my purse on a wall and no one would touch it. I could leave it on a wall for a week. No one
[02:08:27.120 --> 02:08:32.480]   would touch it. He said, said, will they bring that kind of order? You know, will, will we have,
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:37.520]   will we have peace here? You know, they've just chopped down my, my willow trees. You know,
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:46.640]   thanks a lot. And you, you know, you, you, you're seeing a total lack of understanding of the culture,
[02:08:48.640 --> 02:08:54.480]   ethnic differences. You're trying to impose a kind of Western centric view onto something,
[02:08:54.480 --> 02:08:58.560]   which is just some, you know, onto, onto, onto a, onto a nation, which isn't, isn't ready for that.
[02:08:58.560 --> 02:09:04.640]   Now, there are ways in which, you know, it looked like Afghanistan was starting to kind of emerge and
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:11.440]   there was a path. And then just at the critical moment, the West moves out with catastrophic
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:21.200]   consequences. What you have to say though, is that in the West post 1945, the rehabilitation of Italy,
[02:09:21.200 --> 02:09:28.240]   of Japan, of Western Germany was really good. You know, the consequence of, of all that destruction,
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:38.160]   all that turmoil was thriving, high producing democracies, which burst forth into the kind
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:43.920]   of second half of the 20, 20th century and into the 21st century in pretty good order. Um,
[02:09:43.920 --> 02:09:50.400]   so the lessons of the previous generation for the first world war had, had been, had been learned,
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:56.080]   even though the scale of destruction, the displacement of people is unprecedented in 1945.
[02:09:56.080 --> 02:10:02.480]   In 1939, what was the state of the militaries? What were the most powerful militaries on the
[02:10:02.480 --> 02:10:07.920]   world stage at that time? Well, um, in terms of naval power, it's Britain, as we've already
[02:10:07.920 --> 02:10:13.120]   discussed and, and, and the United States, uh, France has a pretty large Navy. Uh, Japan has a pretty large
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:18.480]   Navy. Italy has a pretty large Navy, but Italy's Navy is by far and away, it's most modern aspect of
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:23.440]   its three services, air, land and sea. Um, but it doesn't have any aircraft carriers and it doesn't have any
[02:10:23.440 --> 02:10:29.200]   radar. So, you know, it's, it's, it's, they've got modern battleships and battle cruisers, but without
[02:10:29.200 --> 02:10:35.600]   key modern bits of technology. So Italy is really not ready for. Oh, it's so not.
[02:10:35.600 --> 02:10:43.120]   It's so not. It's just, again, both Hitler and Mussolini, they, they lack geopolitical understanding.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:48.640]   You know, that's because they're so kind of focused on their narrow worldview and they view everything
[02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:51.520]   through that prism, but they can't see that bigger picture.
[02:10:51.520 --> 02:10:56.400]   And we should say that Mussolini, maybe you can correct me, but I don't think at any point he wants
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:00.640]   a war. He doesn't want a war. What he does want is he wants his own new kind of Roman empire,
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:06.080]   which extends over the Mediterranean, the kind of certainly the Eastern part of the matter of half
[02:11:06.080 --> 02:11:10.800]   of the Mediterranean, North Africa, all the way down to kind of East Africa controlling the Suez
[02:11:10.800 --> 02:11:15.600]   Canal. That that's, that's what he wants. And I think you made clear that he was, I mean,
[02:11:15.600 --> 02:11:19.520]   there's always like this little brother jealous of Hitler kind of situation because
[02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:25.520]   he, he wanted absolute power the way Hitler did, but doesn't have it, doesn't have it.
[02:11:25.520 --> 02:11:31.680]   It's described. Yeah. There's a monarchy often forgotten. It's amazing.
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:39.920]   So there's always this limit and Hitler quite brilliantly. Once he gets some power, he takes it all
[02:11:40.960 --> 02:11:48.000]   complete. He completely emasculates Mussolini and yeah, he likes him though. It's really weird. Even
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:55.760]   when Mussolini is about to fall in July, 1943, he has a meeting at Feltre, um, just literally a few
[02:11:55.760 --> 02:12:02.240]   days before Mussolini tumbles. And he does that because he likes Mussolini. He likes him as a man and
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:06.720]   thinks he's been his friend. And, you know, he respects him to a certain extent, even though he's,
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:12.800]   he, he definitely views himself as top dog. Hitler does that is. Um, so it's kind of curious
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:17.200]   because I don't think Hitler particularly likes anyone really, but, but, but he does seem to like
[02:12:17.200 --> 02:12:22.400]   Mussolini. But anyway, the problem with Mussolini is Mussolini, Mussolini's Italy is, is very impoverished
[02:12:22.400 --> 02:12:27.440]   from the first world war, you know, and that of course leads to the rise of fascism and the overthrow of
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:33.760]   parliamentary democracy and, and why Mussolini takes place in the first place. You know, again,
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:37.280]   it's that kind of, there's been this terrible disruption. There's been financial crisis
[02:12:37.280 --> 02:12:43.600]   that leads to kind of people looking at an alternative, you know, what's the alternative?
[02:12:43.600 --> 02:12:47.920]   Well, Mussolini is going, you know, we can be proud Italians again, lots of chest thumping,
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:51.120]   you know, wearing great uniforms, all the rest of it. And people kind of think, well, you know,
[02:12:51.120 --> 02:12:56.000]   I'll have a piece of that and it kind of works and, you know, proverbially the trains work on time
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:13:00.320]   under him and, and so on and so forth, but he just gets ahead of himself, you know, and, and actually
[02:13:00.320 --> 02:13:04.560]   the writings on the war in 1935, when he goes into Abyssinia and, and, you know, again, sort of what
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:12.400]   effectively are kind of by first world European standards, privative tribesmen in, in, in Abyssinia,
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.880]   you know, they, they have quite a tough fight there. You know, they, they do prevail, but, but it's not
[02:13:16.880 --> 02:13:22.880]   a complete walkover and they get a bit of a bloody nose at times and they shouldn't have done. And
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:27.360]   they're just not ready. They don't have the industry. You know, they're, they're tied up into
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:31.200]   the Mediterranean. They don't have access to the world's oceans. They do have some merchant shipping,
[02:13:31.200 --> 02:13:36.000]   but not a huge amount. Um, you know, they just don't have what is required. They don't,
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:41.040]   they're dependent on Britain for coal. Britain is the leading coal exporter in the world in the 1930s.
[02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:49.360]   So Britain's approach to fascist Spain and approach to fascist Italy has been very much
[02:13:49.360 --> 02:13:53.840]   sort of stick and carrot. It's like, you know, we'll let you do what you do as long as you kind of
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:59.680]   stay in your box and, and, and, you know, we'll continue to provide you with supplies and coal and
[02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:02.240]   whatever it is you need, as long as you don't
[02:14:04.320 --> 02:14:11.760]   kind of go too far. And so that's why Mussolini is very anxious in 1938. And again, in 1939,
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:16.160]   to kind of be the power broker and kind of not let Germany go to war. But Germany's just, you know,
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:21.760]   they, they, they signed the, the axis pact of steel in May, 1939, where they become formal allies.
[02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:26.960]   This is Hitler and Mussolini, Italy and Germany, but it's always a very, very unequal partnership,
[02:14:26.960 --> 02:14:32.320]   right from the word go. And one of the reasons Mussolini signs it is because he fears that Germany has
[02:14:32.320 --> 02:14:34.800]   designs on Italy. Yeah.
[02:14:34.800 --> 02:14:39.360]   It's not because he thinks, oh, these guys are great. We, you know, there are natural bedfellows.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:46.320]   It's so that he can, what, what it's a mutually convenient pact whereby Germany gets on with whatever
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:50.960]   it wants to do up in Northern Europe and Eastern Europe. Italy is given a free hand to do whatever
[02:14:50.960 --> 02:14:54.960]   it wants to do. They'll just kind of watch each other's backs. They have borders, you know,
[02:14:54.960 --> 02:15:00.000]   Austria and Italy border one another, um, and they'll just do their own thing and they'll kind of help
[02:15:00.000 --> 02:15:04.480]   each other out with supplies and stuff. Um, but, but basically they won't, they'll, they'll,
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:10.160]   they'll be their own. It's, it's a kind of marriage of convenience. You know, they're never expected to
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:15.360]   be fighting alongside each other on the battlefield. Not really. There is a kind of obligation to do so,
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:19.520]   but, but it's, it's, it's an obligation with no expectation of ever actually happening.
[02:15:19.520 --> 02:15:23.520]   And so from Miss Mussolini's point of view, the pact of steel is, is kind of, you know,
[02:15:23.520 --> 02:15:28.640]   it's just sailing your flag to one particular mass and kind of trying to cover your, cover your back.
[02:15:28.640 --> 02:15:34.240]   And so long as he plays his cards, right, you know, he can, he can still get his coal supplies from
[02:15:34.240 --> 02:15:37.840]   Britain. He doesn't have to worry about that. You know, the pact of steel doesn't make any difference to
[02:15:37.840 --> 02:15:45.840]   that. The problem for him is, is that in June, 1940, he thinks that France is about to be defeated
[02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:50.560]   and the Britain will surely follow. And so he thinks, ah, I've got some rich pickings. I can take Malta,
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:56.160]   or I can take British possessions. I can overrun Egypt. And, you know, now is my time, but I, I also
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:16:00.240]   need to kind of join the fight before France is completely out of the fight. Otherwise it looks like
[02:16:00.240 --> 02:16:03.920]   I'm a Johnny come lately. And I won't, I won't get those spoils because the Germans will go, yeah,
[02:16:03.920 --> 02:16:07.840]   you can't have all this stuff. You've turned up too late. You need to be in the fight. So he does it.
[02:16:07.840 --> 02:16:11.760]   What he thinks is the perfect timing. And it turns out to be a catastrophic timing because of course,
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:17.440]   Britain doesn't exit the fight. You know, Britain is still there. And, you know, by February, 1941,
[02:16:17.440 --> 02:16:24.400]   a very, very tiny British army in Egypt has overrun, you know, two entire Italian armies and taken 133,000
[02:16:24.400 --> 02:16:31.120]   prisoners in North Africa. - So you mentioned in the sea, uh, who were the dominant armies who were,
[02:16:31.120 --> 02:16:36.320]   who was dominant in the air? - Well, in the air, it has to be the Luftwaffe. Uh, and it is also the
[02:16:36.320 --> 02:16:41.760]   Imperial Japanese, both in the Imperial Japanese Navy and the Imperial Japanese army that they both have
[02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:47.600]   air forces. And one of the reasons that is because the quality of the pilots in Japan is extremely high
[02:16:47.600 --> 02:16:53.680]   because it's so difficult to get, to get to the top position. You know, you are going to your frontline
[02:16:53.680 --> 02:16:58.640]   squadrons with at least 500 hours in your logbook. To put that into some perspective, you know,
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:04.960]   a British RAF or Luftwaffe pilot would be joining their frontline squadrons with 150 to 170 hours in
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:13.520]   the logbook. So it is that these guys are disciplined within an inch of their lives. Um, they are, you know,
[02:17:13.520 --> 02:17:19.360]   there are academic tests as well as physical endurance tests. You know, they are the elite of the elite and
[02:17:19.360 --> 02:17:24.080]   they are extremely good. The problem they have is that there is a good number of them,
[02:17:24.080 --> 02:17:31.360]   but there's not that many. The Luftwaffe is, is the largest air force in the world in 1939,
[02:17:31.360 --> 02:17:37.280]   but it is already at a parity when in, in aircraft production with Britain. Um, and
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:42.320]   the French have a kind of similar size army, but they're very, very badly organized. So they're also,
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:46.960]   they're organized into different regions and they, one region doesn't re is not really talking to
[02:17:46.960 --> 02:17:51.200]   another. And one of the problems that when case yellow, the invasion of German invasion of the
[02:17:51.200 --> 02:17:56.320]   West starts, France's army of the air is spread throughout France and has its own little area.
[02:17:56.320 --> 02:18:01.600]   So you have one bunch of, you know, fighters and bombers in that block in, you know, in the Marseille
[02:18:01.600 --> 02:18:06.080]   area, you have another block in kind of, you know, on the Brittany coast, and you have another block in
[02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:10.160]   around Sudan and you have another that. So, so consequently, they're never be there. They're
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:14.640]   never able to kind of bring their full strength to bear. So it's, although, although they've both got
[02:18:14.640 --> 02:18:20.240]   about three and a half thousand aircraft on paper and about two and a half thousand that are fit to
[02:18:20.240 --> 02:18:27.520]   fly on any one given day, the Luftwaffe, because they're the aggressor can choose how they mass their
[02:18:27.520 --> 02:18:32.560]   aircraft and where they attack and at when. So in other words, you can send, the Luftwaffe can send
[02:18:32.560 --> 02:18:38.080]   over overwhelming amounts of bombers and fighter planes and pulverize a French airfield and catch
[02:18:38.080 --> 02:18:42.720]   them napping. And because the French don't have a defense system, they can't see whether they're
[02:18:42.720 --> 02:18:46.880]   coming. So their only hope is to kind of take off and just hope they stooge around the sky and hope
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:51.520]   they bump into some Luftwaffe. And of course that's inherently inefficient and they get, you know,
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:57.360]   they get destroyed and they get destroyed in, in penny packets rather than on mass difference with
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:04.800]   the RAF is, is the RAF is not done on an air force basis where you have each air corps or air fleet
[02:19:04.800 --> 02:19:11.600]   has a handful of bombers, a handful of fighters, a handful of reconnaissance planes. They have different
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:15.760]   commands. So they have bomber command, fighter command, training command, cursor command, and they
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:19.920]   all have very specific roles. So they're, they're structured in a completely different way.
[02:19:19.920 --> 02:19:25.360]   And the other different, and that's because they're an island nation and because they see
[02:19:25.360 --> 02:19:30.400]   their role militarily in a, in a, in a different way. And because the rearming that Britain has done
[02:19:30.400 --> 02:19:36.080]   in the 1930s is all about defense. It is not about aggression at this point, not about taking it to
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:41.200]   the enemy. It is, it is showing you're tough, but also first and foremost, getting your ducks in a row
[02:19:41.200 --> 02:19:46.080]   and making sure that you don't get defeated. So this is the principle behind the, the first,
[02:19:46.080 --> 02:19:50.400]   the world's first fully coordinated air defense system, which is the radar chain. It is the observer
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:56.560]   core. It is control rooms. It is interesting technology, such as identification friend or foe,
[02:19:56.560 --> 02:20:02.240]   IFF, which is where you have a little pulse, which, so you have these control rooms and you have a map
[02:20:02.240 --> 02:20:06.720]   table and you have a tote board in front of you where you can see what squadrons are airborne,
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:10.560]   what state of readiness they're at, you know, whether they're engaging the enemy, little lights come on
[02:20:10.560 --> 02:20:15.200]   and show you can see weather maps. You can see, see the cloud ceiling. You see all that at glance,
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:19.840]   then you're on a dais. And then down in front of you is a massive, great map of Southern England.
[02:20:19.840 --> 02:20:25.040]   You've got croupiers, got a moving plots. So you can, through a combination of radar,
[02:20:25.040 --> 02:20:31.280]   which picks up a kind of a rough idea of what's coming towards you, combined with the observer core,
[02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:36.560]   you have overlapping observer core stations all over Britain, covering every single inch of air space
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:42.880]   over Britain, looking up into the air and seeing how many aircraft there are and at what height they
[02:20:42.880 --> 02:20:47.360]   are. And you have a little thing called a pantograph, which is a piece of equipment which helps you judge
[02:20:47.360 --> 02:20:54.880]   altitude. You then ring through that. That all comes into the control room, along with the information
[02:20:54.880 --> 02:20:59.840]   from the radar stations, which is going into a single filter room at Fighter Command headquarters,
[02:20:59.840 --> 02:21:05.040]   which is then being pushed straight back out to the sector stations. So this information is being
[02:21:05.040 --> 02:21:08.640]   updated all the time. So you have a plot and it looks like it might be, you know,
[02:21:08.640 --> 02:21:16.240]   enemy bombers, 30 plus, for example. That's constantly being adapted. So as more information
[02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:20.880]   comes in, you will change that. And then you can see that actually it's only 20 aircraft or 22 aircraft
[02:21:20.880 --> 02:21:25.840]   or whatever. So you're updating that and that little figure is put on the, on your little plot and moved
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:31.840]   across. And so you can see, and then because you can identify your own aircraft, you can then see where
[02:21:31.840 --> 02:21:38.560]   they are moving. And you're also on, um, the guys in the air are on the radio to ground controllers who
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:43.360]   were in these control rooms and they're saying, okay, well, if you proceed at, you know, angels,
[02:21:43.360 --> 02:21:51.440]   18, 18,000 feet, you know, on a vector of, you know, 150 degrees, you should be seeing your enemy bombing
[02:21:51.440 --> 02:21:57.440]   formation any moment now. And what that means is that you're not on the ground when the enemy are coming
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:01.600]   towards you with their bombers to hit your airfield, which means you're in the air so that all they're
[02:22:01.600 --> 02:22:08.000]   doing is hitting a grass airfield, which you've already got bulldozers and diggers and graders
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:13.360]   and lots of scalpings and earth ready to fill in the potholes. And it means you're good to go.
[02:22:13.360 --> 02:22:18.880]   And it means as a consequence of all that, when the Germans do, um, launch their all out assault on
[02:22:18.880 --> 02:22:24.480]   Adler tag Eagle day on the 13th of August, 1940, the British are ready. You know, they're,
[02:22:24.480 --> 02:22:28.800]   they can see them coming. They know what to expect and they can anticipate. And it means
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:33.600]   that they're not being caught with their trousers down on the ground. And as a consequence of that,
[02:22:33.600 --> 02:22:39.040]   of the 138 airfields that are in, um, RAF airfields that are in Britain, only one of them is knocked
[02:22:39.040 --> 02:22:45.680]   out for more than 48 hours in the entire summer of 1940. And that's Manston on the tip of the Kent coast,
[02:22:45.680 --> 02:22:48.080]   uh, which is abandoned for the duration.
[02:22:48.080 --> 02:22:50.800]   So these are the two biggest air forces.
[02:22:50.800 --> 02:22:52.160]   So those are the two biggest efforts.
[02:22:52.160 --> 02:23:00.240]   So Luftwaffe, we should say German. I mean, they're like the, uh, the legendary, the terrifying
[02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.600]   air force.
[02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:07.920]   They are maybe, maybe they're slightly believing their own hype. There's no question about it.
[02:23:07.920 --> 02:23:09.520]   Well, the rest of the world is also right.
[02:23:09.520 --> 02:23:12.800]   They've just had it too easy. So they don't have, they don't have ground controllers. They don't have
[02:23:12.800 --> 02:23:16.960]   an air defense system in, in, in Germany, because why would you need an air defense system? We're
[02:23:16.960 --> 02:23:21.280]   going to be the aggressor. You know, there's, there's no scenario where we'll have to defend
[02:23:21.280 --> 02:23:27.200]   the airspace of the third Reich because we're on the offensive. So they just haven't prepared it.
[02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:30.880]   So there's that clash, the battle of Britain, the clash of air forces.
[02:23:30.880 --> 02:23:35.760]   What explains the success of Britain in defending?
[02:23:35.760 --> 02:23:39.920]   Well, it's, I mean, you know, and everyone always says, you know, the, the few were the last,
[02:23:39.920 --> 02:23:43.840]   you know, the last line of defense against the Nazi hordes and all this kind of stuff. And it's just,
[02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:49.520]   it's all rubbish. Uh, they're the first line of defense. Second line of defense is the Royal Navy,
[02:23:49.520 --> 02:23:54.880]   which is the world's largest. And there is absolutely no chance on earth that a German
[02:23:54.880 --> 02:24:01.440]   invasion force made up of Rhine river barges. One of, out of every three is motorized and the
[02:24:01.440 --> 02:24:06.480]   other two aren't is ever going to get successfully across the English channel. And even if they did,
[02:24:06.480 --> 02:24:12.240]   they will be repulsed. I mean, they just, it's just no chance. And it is often forgotten that while the
[02:24:12.240 --> 02:24:16.560]   the Luftwaffe is coming over and bombing Britain every single day, so is the RAF going over and
[02:24:16.560 --> 02:24:22.240]   bombing Germany. And one of the problems that the Germans have is, is that these bombers need
[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:27.760]   fighter protection. You know, fighter planes are there to protect the bombers and they don't have
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:34.160]   much fuel. And the Messerschmitt 109E, the MEL as a model is of 1940 is the mainstay of the German
[02:24:34.160 --> 02:24:41.840]   fighter force in the summer of 1940. And they don't have much fuel. So they need to conserve their fuel,
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:45.520]   which means they need to be as close to Britain as they possibly can, which is why the majority of
[02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:49.600]   them are all in airfields, which are hastily created in July, 1940, following the fall of
[02:24:49.600 --> 02:24:53.520]   France in the Pas de Calais, which is the closest point. You know, that's where the channel is,
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:58.400]   it's narrowest and all the rest of it. And also in the Northern Normandy. And that's where they're
[02:24:58.400 --> 02:25:03.680]   flying from. But what that means is that even if you're completely rubbish at bombing, which the British
[02:25:03.680 --> 02:25:10.240]   are in 1940, they haven't developed those navigational aids that create untold accuracy by the end of the
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:15.840]   war. In 1940, they don't, they don't have that luxury. It's a target rich environment. I mean, you know,
[02:25:15.840 --> 02:25:19.760]   you can barely miss if you go over to the, you know, over to the, over to the Palakala. I mean,
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:24.400]   it's literally, it's just like one huge, great kind of hub of, of fighter airfields. And consequently,
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:29.920]   that means that every single German squadron, which only is 12 airplanes strong on, on establishment,
[02:25:29.920 --> 02:25:35.040]   and very often even fewer than that, always has to leave two airplanes behind to defend their own
[02:25:35.040 --> 02:25:38.480]   airfields. And it's really interesting when you look at kind of prisoner of war statements from,
[02:25:38.480 --> 02:25:42.960]   from Luftwaffe crown crew that have been downed, they're all bugs at a holding place called Trent
[02:25:42.960 --> 02:25:46.000]   Park. You can see the transcripts of these conversations. They're all going about how
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:50.240]   annoying it was that the ROF were over every night and they can't sleep. And you know, when they,
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:54.400]   if only they just shut up and leave them alone and not bomb them. And you know, this is just part of
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:25:58.400]   the narrative of the Battle of Breton that's completely left out. It's always the stocky,
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:02.480]   you know, the plucky few against the kind of the, you know, the Nazi hordes and all the rest of it.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:06.880]   And it's just, it's a complete misnomer. And by that time, aircraft production in Britain is
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:15.440]   massively outpacing the Germans. And the best ratio that the Germans achieve in 1940 is July 1940,
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:23.120]   when the British produced 496 new Hurricanes and Spitfires single engine fighters, and the Germans only
[02:26:23.120 --> 02:26:27.040]   produced 240 single engine fighters. That's the best ratio. And of course, you know,
[02:26:27.040 --> 02:26:33.360]   that is the British outproducing the Germans two to one. And what that means is by the end of October,
[02:26:33.360 --> 02:26:37.680]   1940, when the Battle of Britain is sort of, you know, officially designated as being over,
[02:26:39.360 --> 02:26:45.040]   the single engine fighter force of the Luftwaffe is less than 200 from 750 or whatever it was in
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:51.280]   the beginning of July. Whereas the British fighter force had been 650 or whatever at the beginning of
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:53.120]   July is now well over 750.
[02:26:53.120 --> 02:26:54.960]   And Britain is outproducing.
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:27:02.960]   Yeah, to a massive degree. And that continues. And you know, that is a ratio that just increases as the
[02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:12.320]   war progresses. I mean, Britain produces 132,500 aircraft in the Second World War. America produces 315,000.
[02:27:12.320 --> 02:27:15.920]   So why is there this legend of the Luftwaffe?
[02:27:15.920 --> 02:27:18.880]   Well, because it's the spearhead of the Blitzkrieg.
[02:27:18.880 --> 02:27:20.320]   So it has to do with the Blitzkrieg.
[02:27:20.320 --> 02:27:25.200]   It's all to do with the Blitzkrieg. The Luftwaffe becomes the kind of the bogeyman
[02:27:25.200 --> 02:27:29.440]   of the Third Reich. You know, they're blamed for everything, but that's because they're completely abused.
[02:27:29.440 --> 02:27:34.160]   They're the only part of the Third Reich's armed services, the only part of the Wehrmacht,
[02:27:34.160 --> 02:27:43.200]   the Wehrmacht being the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, that is in constant use the whole time,
[02:27:43.200 --> 02:27:49.520]   or constant abuse, I should say. In Britain and America, they rotate their pilots really,
[02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:55.200]   really carefully. By the time that, you know, you've got the Eight Fighter Command, for example,
[02:27:55.200 --> 02:28:00.080]   part of the Mighty Eighth, the Eighth Air Force operating in Britain. By the end of 1943,
[02:28:00.080 --> 02:28:04.640]   you would have in a squadron that would have 16, you would never have more than 16 airborne from
[02:28:04.640 --> 02:28:12.080]   a squadron at any one time. You would have 40 to 45 pilots to service 16 in the air and similar
[02:28:12.080 --> 02:28:17.120]   number of aircraft, which means you're not overusing these guys. And what would happen is by that stage
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:22.640]   of the war, by 1943, you know, a young fighter pilot coming to a Thunderbolt squadron or a Mustang
[02:28:22.640 --> 02:28:29.920]   squadron, for example, at the end of 1943, beginning of 1944, he'd have 350 hours of consecutive
[02:28:29.920 --> 02:28:36.480]   flying. And because you can train in America, in Florida, or California, or Texas, or wherever,
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:41.680]   you can process many, many more people because the training is much more intense, because you've got
[02:28:41.680 --> 02:28:47.040]   clear skies. So, you know, it's not a question of, oh, we'd like to take you out, Fritz, this morning,
[02:28:47.040 --> 02:28:52.000]   but, you know, it's a bit cloudy, and oh, the RAF are over, or, you know, the Air Force are over,
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:58.240]   so we can't fly today. So, in Germany, pilot training is constant, air crew training is constantly being
[02:28:58.240 --> 02:29:03.920]   interrupted by the war, by shortage of fuel, by inclement weather, et cetera, et cetera.
[02:29:03.920 --> 02:29:08.320]   In America, you have none of those problems. And Britain, because of its global reach, also has
[02:29:08.320 --> 02:29:14.880]   training bases in what was Rhodesia and Zimbabwe and South Africa, in Canada as well. And so you're
[02:29:14.880 --> 02:29:19.360]   able to process these guys much better. You're able to give them more training. So that when they come,
[02:29:19.360 --> 02:29:23.360]   they're absolutely the finished article as pilots. What they're not the finished article as is, say,
[02:29:23.360 --> 02:29:29.680]   a bomber pilot or as a fighter pilot. But that's okay, because you join your squadron of 40 other guys,
[02:29:30.400 --> 02:29:35.680]   for 16 airborne. And the old hands kind of take you up a few times. So you arrive at,
[02:29:35.680 --> 02:29:42.320]   I don't know, let's say, some airfield in Suffolk, in East Anglia, in England. And, you know,
[02:29:42.320 --> 02:29:47.040]   you'll have 10 days to two weeks acclimatizing, getting used to it. You know, the old hands will
[02:29:47.040 --> 02:29:52.080]   put you through your paces, give you some tips. You can pick their brains during kind of while you're
[02:29:52.080 --> 02:29:58.000]   having some chow and listening on some briefings. Then the first mission you do will be a milk run over
[02:29:58.000 --> 02:30:02.480]   to France, where the danger is kind of pretty minimal, you know, and you can build up your
[02:30:02.480 --> 02:30:08.400]   experience. So by the time you're actually sent over on a mission to Berlin or Bremen or, you know,
[02:30:08.400 --> 02:30:14.080]   the Ruhr or whatever, you're absolutely the business. So qualitatively and quantitatively,
[02:30:14.080 --> 02:30:19.920]   you are just vastly superior to anything the Luftwaffe's got. The Luftwaffe, by that stage, in contrast,
[02:30:20.960 --> 02:30:28.640]   1940, new pilots coming to frontline squadrons with 150, 170 hours in their log books. Less than 100,
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:34.320]   100, 90, 92 hours, something like that. It's not enough. And they're just being flung straight into
[02:30:34.320 --> 02:30:38.800]   battle and they're getting absolutely slaughtered. And they're also, because their machines are quite
[02:30:38.800 --> 02:30:44.720]   complicated. There's no two-seaters really. So no two-seater trainers. So the first time you're flying
[02:30:44.720 --> 02:30:52.000]   in your Focke-Wulf 190 or your Messerschmitt 109, it's this horrendous leap of faith for which you as a
[02:30:52.000 --> 02:30:58.560]   young, bright Luftwaffe fighter pilot know that you're not ready for this. And it can bite you. And
[02:30:58.560 --> 02:31:05.280]   something like a Messerschmitt 109 has a very high wing loading. So it's very maneuverable in the air,
[02:31:05.280 --> 02:31:10.400]   but it's got this tiny wings. It's got this incredible torque, this Daebler-Benz DB605 engine
[02:31:10.400 --> 02:31:14.640]   with its huge amount of torque. And it just wants to flip you over. So if you're not used to it,
[02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:19.120]   and it's got a narrow undercarriage as well, if you're not used to it, you could just crash. So
[02:31:19.120 --> 02:31:26.880]   in the first couple of months of 1944, they lose something like 2,400 aircraft in the air and pilots,
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:32.000]   and about 3,400 accidents. So it has to do with training, really?
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:33.680]   Yeah. Not training enough.
[02:31:33.680 --> 02:31:41.600]   It's training and resources and supply. And the Second World War, more than any other conflict,
[02:31:41.600 --> 02:31:48.240]   is a war of numbers. There are differences, the decisions that generals can make. There are
[02:31:48.240 --> 02:31:55.520]   moments where particular brilliance and bravery can seize the day, take the bridge,
[02:31:56.880 --> 02:32:03.040]   hold the enemy at bay or whatever. But ultimately, you're talking about differences which might make
[02:32:03.040 --> 02:32:08.000]   a month's difference, six months difference, maybe even several years difference. But ultimately,
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:12.720]   there's a certain point in the Second World War where the outcome is absolutely inevitable because
[02:32:14.480 --> 02:32:18.720]   the guys that lose can't compete with the numbers that the guys are going to win at half.
[02:32:18.720 --> 02:32:24.800]   So in that sense, you could think of World War II as a battle of factories.
[02:32:24.800 --> 02:32:34.000]   What does it take to win in the battle of factories and out-manufacturing military equipment
[02:32:34.000 --> 02:32:36.080]   against the Allies?
[02:32:36.080 --> 02:32:41.120]   It's efficiency, really. So I was kind of, you know, I was thinking, let's take the example of
[02:32:41.120 --> 02:32:46.400]   the Sherman tank, for example, the mainstay of the Western Allied forces and a fair number of them sent
[02:32:46.400 --> 02:32:48.320]   to the Soviet Union as well, for that matter.
[02:32:48.320 --> 02:32:52.160]   I think you've said it doesn't get the respect it deserves, maybe.
[02:32:52.160 --> 02:32:56.880]   It doesn't get the respect it deserves. So the Sherman tank, the 75-millimeter main battle gun,
[02:32:56.880 --> 02:33:01.280]   which is a sort of medium velocity, can fire a shell around kind of 2,000 feet per second,
[02:33:01.280 --> 02:33:06.720]   compared to the notorious, infamous German 88-millimeter, which can fire at kind of third
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:14.560]   fast again, like 3,000 feet per second. But on paper, a Tiger tank coming around the corner
[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:21.920]   and a Sherman tank coming around the corner, it should be no match at all. Tiger tank is 58 tons,
[02:33:21.920 --> 02:33:27.040]   looks scary, is scary. It's got a massive gun, got really thick armor. Sherman tank doesn't have
[02:33:27.040 --> 02:33:32.400]   as thick armor. It doesn't have a gun that's as big. It should be an absolute walkover. And yet,
[02:33:32.400 --> 02:33:39.280]   at about 5:30 PM on Monday, the 26th of June, 1944, a Sherman tank came around the corner of a road
[02:33:39.280 --> 02:33:44.000]   called a Rue Monsieur, a little village called Fontenay-la-Pesnel in Normandy, came face-to-face
[02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:50.240]   with a Tiger tank and won. How does this happen? Well, I'll tell you how it happened, because the
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:55.040]   commander of the Sherman tank was experienced, had one up the spout. So what I mean by that is he had
[02:33:55.040 --> 02:33:59.760]   an armor-piercing round already in the breach. As soon as he saw the Tiger tank, he just said fire.
[02:33:59.760 --> 02:34:04.800]   That armor-piercing round did not penetrate the Tiger tank. It was never going to. But what it did do
[02:34:04.800 --> 02:34:10.160]   was it hit the gun mantlet, which is a bit of reinforced steel that you have just as the barrel
[02:34:10.160 --> 02:34:15.680]   is entering the turret. And that caused spalling, which is the little shards of little bits of molten
[02:34:15.680 --> 02:34:21.040]   metal, which then hit the driver of the Tiger tank in the head. And he was screaming, you know,
[02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:27.440]   "Gotton Himmel" or whatever, and couldn't really see. The moment they got hit, the commander of the Tiger
[02:34:27.440 --> 02:34:33.520]   tank retreated into the turret of the Tiger. The moment you retreat into a turret, you can't see.
[02:34:33.520 --> 02:34:38.400]   You can see because you've got periscopes, but your visibility is nothing like as good as it is
[02:34:38.400 --> 02:34:44.400]   when you've got your head above the turret. Immediately after that, the armor-piercing round
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:49.840]   from the Sherman tank was repeated by a number of high explosive rounds, which are rounds which kind
[02:34:49.840 --> 02:34:53.760]   of, you know, detonate, have a little minor charge. Then there's a second charge, which creates lots of
[02:34:53.760 --> 02:34:59.920]   smoke. And in moments, in the first 30 seconds, 10 rounds from that Sherman tank had hit the Tiger tank
[02:34:59.920 --> 02:35:08.160]   before the Tiger tank had unleashed a single round itself. And the crew then surrendered.
[02:35:08.160 --> 02:35:11.680]   So you didn't need to destroy the Tiger tank, you just need to stop it operating. If it hasn't got a
[02:35:11.680 --> 02:35:18.800]   crew, it's just a chunk of metal that's inoperable. So that's all you need to do. And what that tells
[02:35:18.800 --> 02:35:26.000]   you is that experience counts, training counts. The agility of the Sherman tank also counts.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.720]   It's a smaller shelf, therefore it's easier to manhandle, which means you can put more in a breach quicker.
[02:35:30.720 --> 02:35:35.440]   There's features on a Sherman tank, like it's the first tank to have a gun stabilizing gyro,
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:39.200]   which means it's more effective on the move. There's also an override switch on the underside
[02:35:39.200 --> 02:35:42.080]   of the turret so that the commander, if he just sees something out of the corner of his eye,
[02:35:42.080 --> 02:35:46.240]   can immediately start moving the turret before the gunner, who is down in the belly of the turret,
[02:35:46.240 --> 02:35:54.480]   can react. There's many different facts of it. But the main fact of all is of 1,347 Tigers built,
[02:35:54.480 --> 02:35:58.720]   there were 49,000 Shermans. So that means there's 36 Shermans to every single Tiger.
[02:35:58.720 --> 02:36:04.800]   Marc Thiessen: So you actually have an incredible video, you talk about this a lot from different angles,
[02:36:04.800 --> 02:36:10.720]   about the top five tanks and the bottom five tanks of World War II. I think,
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:13.600]   was it the Tiger that made both the top five and the bottom five?
[02:36:13.600 --> 02:36:15.360]   Marc Thiessen: The problem with the Tiger tanks is it's really huge.
[02:36:15.360 --> 02:36:20.240]   Marc Thiessen: We should say that you keep saying the problem, but one of the pros of the Tiger tank
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:20.960]   Marc Thiessen: It's very huge.
[02:36:20.960 --> 02:36:25.120]   Marc Thiessen: It's, I mean, the psychological warfare aspect of it is terrifying.
[02:36:25.120 --> 02:36:25.520]   Marc Thiessen: Yes.
[02:36:25.520 --> 02:36:30.720]   Marc Thiessen: So I don't know what the other pros, I mean, I guess, yeah, the 88 millimeter.
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:34.480]   Marc Thiessen: 5 plus D and all the rest of it. You know, it's pretty fearsome, but there are,
[02:36:34.480 --> 02:36:40.400]   there are pragmatic problems. The big problem is that the Germans are incapable of mass production
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:44.960]   on a scale that Americans can do. Frankly, even the British can do. I mean, they're just not in that
[02:36:44.960 --> 02:36:48.560]   league. The reason they're not in that league is because they're in the middle of Europe. They
[02:36:48.560 --> 02:36:52.320]   don't have access to the world's oceans. They don't have a merchant fleet. They can't get this stuff.
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:56.320]   Marc Thiessen: It hasn't gone terribly well in the Soviet Union. They can't process it and they're
[02:36:56.320 --> 02:37:02.480]   being bombed 24 hours a day. And so all their factories are having to split them all up. And
[02:37:02.480 --> 02:37:07.680]   that is inherently inefficient because then having to kind of move different parts around and then
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:12.080]   having the whole process of having to travel from one place to another to get stuff. You haven't got
[02:37:12.080 --> 02:37:17.440]   much fuel. So the consequence of that is that what you do is you think, okay, we can't mass produce,
[02:37:17.440 --> 02:37:23.760]   so let's make really brilliant tanks. But they've lost sight of what really brilliant is. You know,
[02:37:23.760 --> 02:37:32.560]   really brilliant to their eyes is big, scary, big gun, lots of armor. But actually, what conflict
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:38.560]   in World War Two shows you is that you need more than that. You need ease of maintenance. You need
[02:37:38.560 --> 02:37:45.520]   reliability. And the problem with having it, the bigger the tank, the more complex the maintenance
[02:37:45.520 --> 02:37:49.200]   equipment is. You know, you need a bigger hoist, which then means you need a bigger truck, which then
[02:37:49.200 --> 02:37:54.720]   needs more fuel. So for example, the Tiger tank is so big that it doesn't fit on the loading gauge of
[02:37:54.720 --> 02:38:01.200]   the European railway system. So they have to have different tracks to roll onto the wagons that will
[02:38:01.200 --> 02:38:06.560]   then transport them from A to B, you know, take them from West Germany to Normandy. Then they have to take
[02:38:06.560 --> 02:38:11.200]   them off. Then they have to take off the tracks, put on combat tracks, then move them into battle and
[02:38:11.200 --> 02:38:16.880]   hope that they don't break down. The problem is when you have, you start the war, it's not very
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:21.840]   automotive and you've only got 47 people for every motorized vehicle in Germany compared to three in
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:26.720]   the United States or eight in France, is that you've got lots of people who don't know how to drive. You
[02:38:26.720 --> 02:38:35.440]   also means you haven't got lots of garages and mechanics and gas stations and so on. And so you're
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:40.560]   then creating an incredibly complex beast, but you want that complex thing to be as simple as you possibly
[02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:45.200]   can be. And that's the beauty of the Sherman tank. You know, all those guys in America, they're used to
[02:38:45.200 --> 02:38:50.000]   driving stick cars, you know, one of three people for every automobile, you know, and that includes,
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:54.400]   you know, the old and children. So almost, you know, every young man knows how to drive.
[02:38:54.400 --> 02:38:58.320]   And when you get into a Sherman tank, it's got a clutch, it's got a throttle, the brakes are the
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:03.920]   steering mechanism. The clutch is where you would expect the clutch to be. It's got a manual shift.
[02:39:03.920 --> 02:39:08.240]   You put your foot on the clutch and you shove it into second gear and off you go or reverse or
[02:39:08.240 --> 02:39:12.160]   whatever. And it literally can be easier. Anyone who could drive a stick car could drive a Sherman tank.
[02:39:12.160 --> 02:39:19.120]   Seriously. Not everyone can drive a Tiger tank. It's incredibly complex. Really, really is. That comes
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:26.400]   with a whole host of problems. And of course, you don't have the numbers. You don't have the numbers.
[02:39:26.400 --> 02:39:33.120]   You know, you've got 1,347 of them. You've got 492 King Tigers, which are even bigger. And, you know,
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:37.360]   at a time where you are really short of fuel, you're really short of absolutely everything.
[02:39:37.360 --> 02:39:42.240]   And those shells are huge and they're harder to manhandle. And weird little things that the Germans
[02:39:42.240 --> 02:39:46.720]   do, you know, for all their design genius, the loader is always on the right-hand side. Now,
[02:39:46.720 --> 02:39:53.440]   in the 1920s and 19-teens and 30s, children were taught to be right-handed. You weren't allowed to be
[02:39:53.440 --> 02:39:59.040]   left-handed. So you were right-handed. So you want to be on the right-hand, left-hand side of the gun.
[02:39:59.040 --> 02:40:04.320]   So you can take the shell from your right and swivel it into the breech from your right side.
[02:40:05.040 --> 02:40:10.720]   But the loader in a yak pamphlet or pamphlet or tiger is always on the right-hand side of the
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:16.080]   breech, which is ergonomically makes no sense whatsoever. Why do they do this? I've never found
[02:40:16.080 --> 02:40:21.280]   an answer to this. But, you know, so there's all these little things. And as a soldier coming up
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.800]   against, you know, you're an American GI and you're coming up against a tiger tank. You don't care about
[02:40:26.800 --> 02:40:31.120]   the fact that it's difficult to maintain or the problems involved of trying to get it to the
[02:40:31.120 --> 02:40:34.720]   battlefield. All you care about is this monster coming in front of you.
[02:40:34.720 --> 02:40:39.120]   It's squeaking and clanking away and it's incredibly scary and it's about to blow you to bits.
[02:40:39.120 --> 02:40:44.480]   That's all you care about and quite understandably so. But those who are protracting the war at a higher
[02:40:44.480 --> 02:40:49.840]   level and historians that come subsequently and look at all this stuff, they do need to worry about all
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:54.800]   these things. And I remember the same Georg Thomas, the architect of the hunger plan.
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:41:00.880]   I found this minutes of this meeting, which I think was either on the 4th of December or the 5th of
[02:41:00.880 --> 02:41:07.680]   December 1941. So it's just before the Red Army counterattacks outside Moscow in the winter of 1941.
[02:41:07.680 --> 02:41:15.520]   And it's a meeting about weaponry. And this is a verbatim quote. He says, "We have to stop making
[02:41:15.520 --> 02:41:23.680]   such complete and ascetic weapons." In other words, we've consciously be building over-engineered and
[02:41:23.680 --> 02:41:29.520]   aesthetically pleasing weapons up until this point. And they sort of half manage it, but don't quite.
[02:41:30.880 --> 02:41:37.680]   We could probably talk for many hours about each of these topics. We could talk for 10 hours about tanks.
[02:41:37.680 --> 02:41:47.360]   I encourage people to listen to your podcast, World War II Pod. We have ways of making you talk. It's great.
[02:41:47.360 --> 02:41:53.360]   Yeah, we also do. We've got a new YouTube channel and website called World War II Headquarters.
[02:41:53.360 --> 02:42:01.440]   There are lots of walking the ground and videos of that and all sorts of stuff and little explainers of
[02:42:01.440 --> 02:42:08.000]   going around tanks and stuff and the weaponry and documents and photographic archives.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:13.120]   So the idea is to sort of turn it into a kind of real hub of anyone who's interested in this subject.
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:16.880]   It's a place where they can go and find out just a whole load more.
[02:42:16.880 --> 02:42:20.880]   I love it. So like I said, we could probably talk for many hours on each of these topics,
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:27.040]   but let's look at some of the battles and maybe you can tell me which jumps out at you. I want to talk to you about
[02:42:27.040 --> 02:42:31.600]   the Western Front and definitely talk about Normandy.
[02:42:32.880 --> 02:42:40.400]   So there's the Battle of Midway in 1942, which is a naval battle. There's Eastern Front, Stalingrad,
[02:42:40.400 --> 02:42:48.320]   probably the deadliest battle in human history. Then there's the Battle of Kursk, which is a tank
[02:42:48.320 --> 02:42:56.720]   battle, the largest tank battle in history, probably the largest battle period in history. 6,000 tanks,
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:02.400]   2 million troops, 4,000 aircraft. And then that takes us also to the Battle of the Bulge,
[02:43:02.400 --> 02:43:07.680]   and Normandy, the Italian campaign that you talk a lot about. So what do you think is interesting to
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:17.840]   try to extract some wisdom from? Before we get to Normandy, do you find as a historian the Battle of
[02:43:17.840 --> 02:43:23.120]   Kursk or the Battle of Stalingrad more interesting? Stalingrad is often seen as the turner.
[02:43:23.120 --> 02:43:32.000]   Well, yeah, I think so. I mean, it's really interesting. So they get through 1941. Barbarossa
[02:43:32.000 --> 02:43:37.280]   doesn't happen as the Germans hope it will. The whole point is to completely destroy the Red Army
[02:43:37.280 --> 02:43:42.720]   in three months, and that just doesn't happen. And I think you can argue and argue convincingly that by,
[02:43:42.720 --> 02:43:51.200]   let's say, the beginning of December 1941, Germany is just not going to win. It just can't.
[02:43:51.200 --> 02:43:56.240]   And let me tell you what I mean by that. So if you take an arbitrary date, let's say the 15th of June,
[02:43:56.240 --> 02:44:02.800]   1941, Germany at that moment has one enemy, which is Great Britain, albeit Great Britain plus Dominion
[02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:10.480]   Empire. Fast forward six months to, let's say, the 16th of December. It's got three enemies. It's got
[02:44:10.480 --> 02:44:19.360]   Great Britain, Dominion Empire, USSR, and the USA. It is just not going to win. For all the talks of
[02:44:19.360 --> 02:44:25.040]   wonder weapons and all the rest of it, it's just not going to. It has lost that battle. Having said that,
[02:44:25.040 --> 02:44:34.000]   the Soviet Union is still in a really, really bad situation. It is being helped out a huge amount by
[02:44:35.600 --> 02:44:40.480]   supplies from the United States and from Britain. You know, just unprecedented amounts of material
[02:44:40.480 --> 02:44:47.840]   being sent through the Arctic or across Alaska into the Soviet Union at that time. It is absolutely
[02:44:47.840 --> 02:44:56.160]   staggering how much it's committed by Roosevelt and Churchill to try and stem the flow in the Soviet
[02:44:56.160 --> 02:45:02.720]   Union. Because for all the announcements and the pride that the Soviet Union has about moving factories to
[02:45:02.720 --> 02:45:09.520]   the other side of the Urals and stuff, which they do in 1941, huge amounts are overrun intact by the
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:15.280]   Germans in the opening stages of Barbarossa. I mean, really, you know, colossal losses. Huge amounts.
[02:45:15.280 --> 02:45:20.880]   So, you know, the grain has gone, coal has gone, entire factories have gone, steel production goes
[02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:27.840]   down by kind of, you know, 80% in the Soviet Union in 1941 and into 1942. So in 1942, despite the vast
[02:45:27.840 --> 02:45:33.200]   amount of numbers of men that they have at their hands, I mean, they create 80 new divisions in the
[02:45:33.200 --> 02:45:38.560]   second half of 1941, for example. I mean, Britain never has 80 divisions in the entire Second World War,
[02:45:38.560 --> 02:45:45.680]   division being about rule of thumb, 15,000 men. So, you know, despite that, and that is because
[02:45:45.680 --> 02:45:52.240]   Stalin's meddling, the woeful state of the Red Army in 1941, et cetera, et cetera, which we've already sort
[02:45:52.240 --> 02:45:57.840]   of touched upon. So 1942, it's still in a really bad way, but Germany's in a really bad way too.
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:05.440]   It's the attrition it's suffered in 1941. It's winning itself to death in 1941. So it's having
[02:46:05.440 --> 02:46:10.560]   these huge great encirclements like the encirclement of Kyiv in September 1941, you know, capturing the
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:16.000]   further kind of best part of 700,000 Red Army troops, et cetera, et cetera. But in the process of doing that,
[02:46:16.000 --> 02:46:21.520]   it is constantly being attrited, you know, both in battle casualties, but in also mechanical casualties
[02:46:21.520 --> 02:46:31.440]   too. Just can't cope. The scale is just too big. And what happens is, with every moment that the
[02:46:31.440 --> 02:46:39.920]   German forces, that ultimate victory slips away, so Hitler's personal handling of the battle increases.
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:46.320]   And, you know, you can say what you like about him, but he just hasn't had the military training to do
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:50.880]   that. He might have amazing attention to detail. He might be able to understand, you know, have an
[02:46:50.880 --> 02:46:57.680]   enormous capacity to remember units and where they are on a map, but he was only a half corporal in the
[02:46:57.680 --> 02:47:02.400]   First World War. He's never been to staff college. You know, he might have read lots about Frederick
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:05.760]   the Great. I mean, I've read lots of history, but that doesn't mean to say I'd be a competent
[02:47:05.760 --> 02:47:12.240]   field marshal. So he is not the right person for the job at all. And he micromanages and he looks at
[02:47:12.240 --> 02:47:16.560]   diggers and figures and doesn't understand what it's like at the actual front, the coal face.
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:23.440]   So he's stifling the very thing that made the German army effective, which is the ability to give
[02:47:23.440 --> 02:47:28.080]   commanders at the front the freedom on their leash to be able to make decisions and battle command
[02:47:28.080 --> 02:47:32.320]   decisions. And he's taken that away from them. So he's basically making them go into battle
[02:47:32.320 --> 02:47:39.920]   with decreasing amounts of supplies and firepower and with one hand behind their back in terms of
[02:47:39.920 --> 02:47:44.080]   decision-making process. And that is not a good combination. The other problem is that he decides,
[02:47:44.080 --> 02:47:48.000]   rather than going for Moscow in 1942, because basically there's a kind of cooling off period
[02:47:48.000 --> 02:47:52.240]   in the, in the winter because of the conditions, but everyone knows the Soviet Union. No, the Red
[02:47:52.240 --> 02:47:56.560]   Army knows that the moment springs come, there's going to be another offensive, but another major
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:02.160]   offensive in the summer. That is absolutely as certain as, you know, day following night, et cetera.
[02:48:02.160 --> 02:48:06.960]   The problem that the Germans have is they just don't have enough. They have less than they had
[02:48:06.960 --> 02:48:13.040]   when they launched Barbarossa the previous year. The Soviet Union has more. It is better prepared. It
[02:48:13.040 --> 02:48:17.840]   knows what's coming now. It's kind of learning some of the lessons, starting to absorb the lessons.
[02:48:17.840 --> 02:48:24.160]   Stalin, coincidentally, is pulling back from his very tight leash and the way that Hitler is doing the
[02:48:24.160 --> 02:48:30.720]   the opposite and increasing his micromanagement and control for recovery. And what Hitler decides is
[02:48:30.720 --> 02:48:35.760]   rather than going for Moscow, he's going to go for the oil fields. And this is absolutely insane because
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:41.360]   what's going to happen when they get to the oil fields? I mean, does he think really that the Soviet
[02:48:41.360 --> 02:48:47.600]   Union are going to let those oil fields come into German hands intact? Even if he does let them get in
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:53.760]   intact, what are they going to do with that oil? I mean, oil needs to be refined. Where are you going
[02:48:53.760 --> 02:48:58.480]   to refine it? You know, they don't have any oil. They don't have many oil refineries. How are you going
[02:48:58.480 --> 02:49:04.480]   to ship that oil to where you need it to be in the factories and the Third Reich and into your, you know,
[02:49:04.480 --> 02:49:10.960]   process it into gasoline and then get it and diesel and get it to your U-boats, get it to your tanks,
[02:49:10.960 --> 02:49:14.160]   get it to your armored units? How are you going to do that? How do you transport it from the
[02:49:14.800 --> 02:49:20.160]   from the Caucasus, which is a long, long way away from, from Berlin? How are you going to do that?
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:24.720]   There's no pipelines. There's only some pipelines. They've been built by American money and American
[02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:29.520]   engineering, and they're going backwards towards the Urals, not forwards. They have no more rail
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:36.400]   capacity whatsoever. They just don't have the oil tankers. So it's just, it's, it is absolute la la
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:42.480]   land. It is incredible that when you look at the detailed literature that the Germans have, no one is
[02:49:42.480 --> 02:49:46.320]   asking this question in the, in the spring and early summer of 1942.
[02:49:46.320 --> 02:49:47.840]   The logistics question in part.
[02:49:47.840 --> 02:49:51.760]   No one is saying, okay, it's great that we're going to go to the Caucasus and get all this oil,
[02:49:51.760 --> 02:49:54.800]   but then what? No one is asking that question.
[02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:59.120]   Nor how do you provide resources and feed and the soldiers and all that kind of stuff.
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:49:59.840]   Right. I mean, it's...
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:04.080]   So, so the case blew, first of all, they get distracted by going into the Crimea and they go,
[02:50:04.080 --> 02:50:09.360]   well, we've got to do that first. So they have to get Sevastopol and the Crimea, which they do.
[02:50:09.920 --> 02:50:16.400]   And then they have to push on. And at this point, suddenly looming in front of them is Stalingrad,
[02:50:16.400 --> 02:50:22.320]   on the banks of the Volga, this, this city, this industrial city, which has Stalin's name.
[02:50:22.320 --> 02:50:27.520]   And Hitler goes, okay, what I'm going to do now is I'm going to split my forces. So half of you can
[02:50:27.520 --> 02:50:30.560]   go south towards the Caucasus and the rest of you can confront Stalingrad.
[02:50:30.560 --> 02:50:36.800]   And on box, just to see who's the commando just goes, that's nuts. That makes no sense whatsoever.
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:43.440]   You know, you're, you're, you're splitting the mission. So he fires him. So suddenly they get,
[02:50:43.440 --> 02:50:49.920]   get into this assault for Stalingrad and it becomes this sort of street fight. Street fighting is the
[02:50:49.920 --> 02:50:53.920]   worst kind of fighting. I mean, the reason why the Israelis have just blown everything up in,
[02:50:53.920 --> 02:50:58.720]   in Gaza is because otherwise you can't see, you know, you need a field of fire. This is a fighting up in a,
[02:50:58.720 --> 02:51:02.960]   fighting in a buildup area is, is horrendous. Yeah. To clarify, we're talking about urban
[02:51:02.960 --> 02:51:07.680]   warfare, door to door, building to building. It's incredibly difficult. And home advantage
[02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:12.960]   is colossal in this, this instance. And of course it's piping hot when they attack in kind of August
[02:51:12.960 --> 02:51:18.000]   into early September, and then it suddenly gets very, very cold. And at the same time, American
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:25.600]   mechanization and slightly a British mechanization, but primarily American trucks are enabling Zoukov to
[02:51:25.600 --> 02:51:31.280]   to plan this great pincer movement. So it is, you know, and, and Russians will hate me for saying
[02:51:31.280 --> 02:51:36.720]   this. Um, and I probably will get a whole load of bots on the back of it, but, but, but the truth is,
[02:51:36.720 --> 02:51:44.640]   is it is not the street fighting that destroys sixth army. It is the encirclement, the subsequent
[02:51:44.640 --> 02:51:49.520]   encirclement. So they've, the Germans have been sucked into this street battle in Stalingrad.
[02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:53.520]   We cannot give up. We cannot give up. We cannot give up. We cannot back down. We cannot pull out.
[02:51:53.520 --> 02:51:58.080]   We've got to, we've got to destroy this city. Meanwhile, while their backs are turned and while
[02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:03.600]   most of their forces are going off to the Caucasus on a wild goose chase for absolutely zero oil,
[02:52:03.600 --> 02:52:10.080]   instantly, um, and they never get remotely close to Baku, this huge great pincer movement is, is,
[02:52:10.080 --> 02:52:16.160]   is being planned and it is only possible through mechanization from the United States.
[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:23.760]   And that is the big turning point because from that moment onwards, the Germans are on the back foot.
[02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:28.560]   They're basically going backwards. There are little small counterattacks. There is obviously the curse
[02:52:28.560 --> 02:52:35.280]   salient, for example. Um, but it's, it's, it's game over. You know, the, the catastrophe of the
[02:52:35.280 --> 02:52:40.320]   surrender of the final. So I mean, the writings on the wall at the end of 1942, but by November 1942,
[02:52:40.320 --> 02:52:45.840]   when the, when the, when the, uh, the two, um, Soviet fronts meet up, then, then, you know,
[02:52:45.840 --> 02:52:52.480]   there is no possible chance of escape for sixth army. They are consigned. They are toast.
[02:52:52.480 --> 02:52:56.080]   And their final surrender obviously happens at the very beginning of February, 1943,
[02:52:56.080 --> 02:53:01.520]   but that's all over. And then at the same time that that is happening, disaster is unfolding in North
[02:53:01.520 --> 02:53:08.880]   Africa because Hitler has insisted on massively resupplying the Mediterranean theater. And the
[02:53:08.880 --> 02:53:13.520]   problem there is the amount of equipment that is lost in North Africa is greater than it is at
[02:53:13.520 --> 02:53:20.640]   Stalingrad. I don't think you could argue that psychologically Tunisia is a greater loss than
[02:53:20.640 --> 02:53:25.760]   Stalingrad. It absolutely isn't, but you have to see them in tandem as this is two fronts. This is
[02:53:25.760 --> 02:53:31.440]   Eastern front, Southern Western front. And this is the first time that the Americans have been on the
[02:53:31.440 --> 02:53:37.360]   ground against access forces and they lose big time. The allies become masters of the North African
[02:53:37.360 --> 02:53:43.440]   shores on the 13th of May, 1943. And it is a catastrophe. And in that time, 2,700 aircraft have
[02:53:43.440 --> 02:53:50.640]   been Luftwaffe aircraft have been destroyed over North Africa between November, 1942 and May, 1943.
[02:53:50.640 --> 02:53:56.080]   And overall, there's subsequent that summer as well. It's really interesting. The Luftwaffe loses between
[02:53:56.080 --> 02:54:03.040]   June and October, 1943. So this is including the Kursk battle, which takes place in July, 1943.
[02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:12.000]   In that period, the Luftwaffe loses 702 aircraft over the Eastern front, but 3,704 aircraft over the
[02:54:12.000 --> 02:54:17.120]   Mediterranean. So I think one has to also, one of the lessons about studying the Second World War is
[02:54:17.120 --> 02:54:23.600]   one has to be careful not to assign strategic importance to boots on the ground. It can be of
[02:54:23.600 --> 02:54:28.480]   great strategic importance, but not necessarily. You know, no one would argue, for example, that the
[02:54:28.480 --> 02:54:34.880]   Guadalcanal is not an absolutely game-changing battle in the Pacific War. And yet the number of
[02:54:34.880 --> 02:54:37.840]   troops compared to, you know, what's going on in the Eastern front or even, you know,
[02:54:37.840 --> 02:54:46.080]   the Western front is tiny in comparison. So it is absolutely true that the most German blood is lost
[02:54:46.080 --> 02:54:50.560]   on the Eastern front, but that doesn't mean to say that it's more strategically important than the
[02:54:50.560 --> 02:54:55.440]   Western front. And it's not saying that the Western front is more strategic either. It's just,
[02:54:55.440 --> 02:55:00.320]   you have to kind of be balanced about this. The psychological blovo of Stalingrad is immense
[02:55:00.320 --> 02:55:02.160]   and you, you cannot belittle that.
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:06.800]   I mean, there's the, we went over it really fast, but there is a human drama element.
[02:55:06.800 --> 02:55:08.240]   Yes.
[02:55:08.240 --> 02:55:14.880]   But yes, when we're talking about the operational side, the material loss of a battle is also
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:20.160]   extremely important to the big picture of the war. And we often don't talk about that
[02:55:20.800 --> 02:55:25.360]   because of course with war, the thing to focus on is the human drama of it.
[02:55:25.360 --> 02:55:33.040]   And I also think that what's interesting is the, is the Nazi high command's response to Stalingrad,
[02:55:33.040 --> 02:55:39.040]   which is not to go, we're screwed. It's to double down. It's, you know, then, so, so Goebbels,
[02:55:39.040 --> 02:55:44.800]   for example, gives his infamous speech in the sports palace and third week of February, 1943, where he
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:50.960]   goes, are you ready for this? You know, this is now total war. The war is coming. This is a fight for
[02:55:50.960 --> 02:55:56.640]   survival. We're all in it together. You are in this as well. You know, every single one, every single
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:56:05.040]   German is now, this is a fight for survival. And we are now in total war. And, and everyone is just so
[02:56:05.040 --> 02:56:11.440]   depressed by this. I mean, they realize that there is, that they have, they, they will, are going to
[02:56:11.440 --> 02:56:15.760]   reap what they have sown, you know, because everyone knows what's been going on in the Eastern front,
[02:56:15.760 --> 02:56:20.320]   because first part of the war, Germans have loads and loads of cameras. They're really into photographing
[02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:24.640]   everything, taking Sydney footage of everything. So part of recording the greatness of the Reich and the
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:28.480]   triumphs of the Reich, they want it recorded. So all this stuff is a bit like the radios is made very,
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:33.280]   very cheap. So lots of having, and people are sending it all back. And, you know, the people that are
[02:56:33.280 --> 02:56:36.480]   developing this stuff are all seeing it and people are talking about it. And then it's been sent to
[02:56:36.480 --> 02:56:42.560]   families and they're all seeing it and they're seeing pictures of Jews being rounded up and beaten.
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:50.240]   And they're seeing, um, Ukrainian partisans being executed and they're seeing villages being torched.
[02:56:50.240 --> 02:56:57.280]   And everyone knows they all know. Yeah. This whole idea is, you know, do they really know what was going
[02:56:57.280 --> 02:57:03.120]   on? Yeah, they do. They do know what's going on, you know, to lesser or greater detail.
[02:57:03.120 --> 02:57:07.680]   Well, of course, you know, there's some people who don't. And, you know, and a bit like people know about the news today.
[02:57:07.680 --> 02:57:10.880]   Some people do, some people don't. Oh, I never read the newspaper. I never listen to the news.
[02:57:10.880 --> 02:57:17.760]   You know, so you, you have that of course, but, but, but it is widely understood and widely known that
[02:57:17.760 --> 02:57:25.120]   really brutal things have been going on in the Eastern and troops coming back utterly traumatized by what they have
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:32.320]   taken part in, what they have witnessed, the kind of unspeakable brutality. This is war on a completely different level to anything
[02:57:32.320 --> 02:57:36.480]   that's been kind of seen in recent years. Yeah. We should, we should mention that,
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:40.560]   you know, the Western front and the Eastern front are very different in this regard.
[02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:44.880]   Yes. So a lot of the Holocaust by bullets, the Holocaust with the concentration camps and
[02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:52.960]   extermination camps is not in Germany. It's not in the Western front. It's in Poland. It's in the Soviet
[02:57:52.960 --> 02:57:58.640]   Union. Yeah. But don't forget that even Auschwitz, for example, is part of the new Reich. It is part of,
[02:57:59.760 --> 02:58:03.920]   you know, it is part of an area which has been absorbed into Germany. So as far as they're
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:08.000]   concerned, this has now got, you know, it's now no longer got the Polish name. It's now called
[02:58:08.000 --> 02:58:12.480]   Auschwitz, which is a German name. It is part of Germany. And there are German people moving there
[02:58:12.480 --> 02:58:17.520]   into this, you know, air comma model town and they all know exactly what's going on.
[02:58:18.480 --> 02:58:24.080]   Yeah. You, by the way, have a nice podcast series of four episodes on Auschwitz,
[02:58:24.080 --> 02:58:33.840]   um, the evolution of the dream world town that becomes a camp, a work camp,
[02:58:33.840 --> 02:58:40.240]   then becomes an extermination camp and a big Boona factory for IG Farben, which never produces a single
[02:58:40.240 --> 02:58:48.480]   bit of rubber. So this for sure is, uh, something I would have to dive deep in. There's a book you
[02:58:48.480 --> 02:58:55.200]   recommended KL. Yes. It's just called KL. It's about the, the whole concentration camp system. Um,
[02:58:55.200 --> 02:59:03.360]   cause K is concentration, um, in German Lager is a, is a camp. Um, it's a, it's an exhaustive book and
[02:59:03.360 --> 02:59:09.360]   I'm, I'm full of admiration for him for, for writing it just because jeepers, it must have been sort of,
[02:59:09.360 --> 02:59:14.320]   I mean, I, I was very depressed doing that work on Auschwitz, that deep dive. I just found the whole
[02:59:14.320 --> 02:59:20.080]   thing utterly dispiriting. Um, and I've been there a few times and it's ghastly. Um, so how he wrote a whole
[02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:26.560]   book on it. I don't know. I think in the details, there's a, there's two ways, I think, to look at
[02:59:26.560 --> 02:59:34.000]   the Holocaust. One is, uh, man's search for meaning, but Viktor Frankl sort of this philosophical thing
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:39.680]   about how a human being can confront that and find meaning and what it means. What,
[02:59:39.680 --> 02:59:47.040]   what does the human condition look like in the context of such, uh, evil? And then there is the
[02:59:47.040 --> 02:59:54.560]   the more sort of detailed, okay, well, how, how do you actually implement something like the final
[02:59:54.560 --> 03:00:03.280]   solution? So you have this ideology of evil implemented. Yes. And at the fine detail of what,
[03:00:03.280 --> 03:00:09.600]   what are the different technologies used? What are the different humans and the hierarchy of humans in
[03:00:09.600 --> 03:00:15.520]   a camp? How do they, what's the actual experience of the individual person who shows up at a camp?
[03:00:15.520 --> 03:00:20.240]   Yeah. Just get in the details. And in those details, I think there's some deep,
[03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:27.920]   profound human truth that can emerge that the, the mundane, um, one step at a time is how you can
[03:00:27.920 --> 03:00:35.920]   achieve evil. Yep. So you can get lost in the mundane. It's yes. The banality of evil. It's, um,
[03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:39.520]   it's incredible. I, I think, I think what, what is so,
[03:00:40.320 --> 03:00:45.680]   so completely horrific is, is that, you know, you know, half the 6 million were killed by kind
[03:00:45.680 --> 03:00:50.400]   of bullets to the back of the head. And the reason they stopped doing that and they wanted to stop
[03:00:50.400 --> 03:00:55.760]   doing that was because the guys, the perpetrators were finding it so traumatic, you know, Himmler goes
[03:00:55.760 --> 03:01:00.880]   and visits, uh, um, uh, an execution in Ukraine and, or maybe he's in the Baltic States. I can't
[03:01:00.880 --> 03:01:04.400]   remember where he goes, but he, but he, we witnessed some in the, you know, in the summer of 1941, he
[03:01:04.400 --> 03:01:07.680]   thinks, oh, that's horrible. You know, they don't have to do that. I don't want my men having to do
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:11.120]   that. I've got to find a more humane way of doing it. When he's talking about more humane way of doing
[03:01:11.120 --> 03:01:16.640]   it, humane for the, for the executors, executioners, not, not for the victims because
[03:01:17.920 --> 03:01:22.720]   trust me, cyclone B is not a nice way to go. You know, it basically, basically it's bursting all
[03:01:22.720 --> 03:01:27.360]   the capillaries in your lungs. It's extremely painful and, and you, you can no longer breathe
[03:01:27.360 --> 03:01:31.920]   and it can take up to 20, 25 minutes. You know, some people that can take a couple of minutes,
[03:01:31.920 --> 03:01:37.520]   but all of those who are standing naked in that gas chamber, first of all, extremely humiliated by
[03:01:37.520 --> 03:01:42.560]   this process in the first place. Then there's a sudden realization of the, that they're not having
[03:01:42.560 --> 03:01:47.440]   a shower. They're actually being gas and they're all going to die. Imagine what you're thinking.
[03:01:47.440 --> 03:01:51.040]   as that processes you, because you might be the first, but you're still going to,
[03:01:51.040 --> 03:01:55.360]   even the first person is going to know that I can't breathe and I'm, I'm dying. Everyone else
[03:01:55.360 --> 03:01:59.600]   is going to see the first few dying and then going to realize that is what's going to happen to them.
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:05.840]   And you've got those minutes, sometimes many minutes where you've got to contemplate that,
[03:02:05.840 --> 03:02:13.440]   that, and that's, that's in extreme pain and panic. And just think about how cruel that is.
[03:02:13.440 --> 03:02:17.040]   : While being humiliated all the way through.
[03:02:17.040 --> 03:02:24.320]   : While being humiliated all the way through. And so the inverted commas, humanity of, of,
[03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:31.280]   of the gas chambers is anything, but it's disgusting. And the fact that people could do this is just
[03:02:31.280 --> 03:02:38.160]   beyond horrific. And then the fact that you are taking your Jewish prisoners and getting them to cut off all
[03:02:38.160 --> 03:02:45.920]   the hair, pull out the teeth of the dead before you put them on a lift and incinerate them. If you go to
[03:02:45.920 --> 03:02:50.080]   Auschwitz now and you go to the collapse of the blown up gas chambers, which the Germans destroyed before
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:56.480]   the Russians overran them in January 45, you can still see some of the ash ponds and there are bits
[03:02:56.480 --> 03:03:04.800]   of bone there, but still there from the ash. It's just, it is utterly repulsive. And imagine arriving
[03:03:04.800 --> 03:03:08.240]   from that train on that incredibly long journey where you've had no comforts whatsoever. You've had,
[03:03:08.240 --> 03:03:12.400]   again, you've had humiliations and privations that, you know, the privations you've had to suffer
[03:03:12.400 --> 03:03:16.640]   as a result of that, you know, having to kind of defecate in a bucket in the corner in front of other
[03:03:16.640 --> 03:03:21.360]   people. It's just horrendous. And then you get there bewildered and immediately your kids are
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:24.800]   taken away from you or your, you know, husband and wife who've been married 20 years. They're
[03:03:24.800 --> 03:03:29.200]   separated just like that, sent off into different groups, straight to the gas chambers. I mean,
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:36.400]   you know, it is, the scale of cruelty is so immense. It's hard to fathom. And the thing that I find really
[03:03:36.400 --> 03:03:41.840]   difficult to reconcile, and this is where I think that, you know, the warning from history is important,
[03:03:42.400 --> 03:03:47.920]   is that Germany is such an amazing nation. You know, it's, it's, it's the, it's the country of
[03:03:47.920 --> 03:03:58.160]   Beethoven and Strauss and, and of Goethe and incredible art and culture and, and, and some of the greatest
[03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:05.120]   engineers and scientists have ever lived. And look how quickly it flipped into the descent of
[03:04:05.680 --> 03:04:14.000]   unspeakable inhumanity, which manifests itself in the Holocaust and the gas chambers and the executions
[03:04:14.000 --> 03:04:23.840]   into pits and tiny places and creeks in Lithuania or Ukraine or whatever. I mean, it's, it's, it's just
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:28.720]   horrendous. And, you know, this is from a nation, which a decade earlier had been a democracy.
[03:04:29.440 --> 03:04:33.920]   It seems like as a human civilization, we walked that soldier in instant line between good and evil.
[03:04:33.920 --> 03:04:34.320]   Yeah.
[03:04:34.320 --> 03:04:39.360]   Uh, it's, it's a thin line and we have to walk it carefully.
[03:04:39.360 --> 03:04:39.760]   Yes.
[03:04:39.760 --> 03:04:50.240]   So I, one of the great battles in, uh, in World War II on the Western front is Normandy.
[03:04:50.240 --> 03:04:57.680]   I have to talk to you about Normandy, uh, D-Day, the Normandy landings, the famous on June 6th,
[03:04:57.680 --> 03:05:05.360]   1944. This was a allied invasion of Nazi occupied Western Europe. What was the planning and those
[03:05:05.360 --> 03:05:09.360]   lengthy planning? What was the planning? What was the execution of the Normandy landings?
[03:05:09.360 --> 03:05:15.280]   Well, the decision to finally go into the, when the Americans joined the war in December 1941,
[03:05:15.280 --> 03:05:20.160]   there's the Arcadia conference a few days later, a week later between the British chiefs of staff
[03:05:20.160 --> 03:05:25.680]   and political leaders in Churchill and Roosevelt and his own chiefs of staff about what the policy
[03:05:25.680 --> 03:05:29.680]   should be. And the policy is to get American troops over to Europe as quickly as possible,
[03:05:29.680 --> 03:05:33.520]   get them over to Britain, get them training, um, and get them across the channel ASAP
[03:05:34.320 --> 03:05:40.640]   and, and start the liberation of Europe. But the reality is that, that, that in 1942,
[03:05:40.640 --> 03:05:43.680]   the Americans just aren't ready. You know, they've gone from this incredibly tiny army. They're still
[03:05:43.680 --> 03:05:48.320]   growing. They've got no battlefield experience. The British are still recovering the, you know,
[03:05:48.320 --> 03:05:53.040]   they're, they're good on the naval power. They're kind of increasingly good on air power. Um, but, but,
[03:05:53.040 --> 03:05:59.360]   but land power, they've had to kind of make up from the loss of their ally France and, and expand as
[03:05:59.360 --> 03:06:04.240]   well. So kind of ground zero for both America and Britain has been kind of June 1942.
[03:06:04.240 --> 03:06:09.840]   1940 when France is out and suddenly that's the strategic earthquake. And that's the,
[03:06:09.840 --> 03:06:14.400]   the issue that needs settling. And they need to just completely realign everything that they'd,
[03:06:14.400 --> 03:06:18.800]   they'd fought in 1939. They've got to start again, but it's also becomes clear that it's,
[03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:24.560]   they're not really ready in 1943 either. And one of the problems is, is that Molotov, who is the
[03:06:24.560 --> 03:06:28.880]   Soviet foreign minister has come over to Britain in May, 1942 and said, you know, we need you to kind
[03:06:28.880 --> 03:06:33.440]   of do your bit and get on the, get on the, on the campaign trail against the Germans and fight on the
[03:06:33.440 --> 03:06:36.480]   ground. And the British sort of go, well, yeah, but you know, cross-trail elevation is not really
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:40.240]   going to happen. We know we're doing that in North Africa at the moment. And then he goes over to
[03:06:40.240 --> 03:06:44.880]   Washington and, and, um, and the Americans go, you know, we are definitely going to go and take on the
[03:06:44.880 --> 03:06:49.600]   attack to the, uh, the Germans in 1942. They've made this promise. So the summer of 1942, it becomes
[03:06:49.600 --> 03:06:53.600]   clear that they can't keep that. So Churchill says, well, look, I've got, here's an idea. You know,
[03:06:53.600 --> 03:06:57.360]   we're in, we've got already got an army in, in Egypt. Why don't we land another one in
[03:06:57.360 --> 03:07:02.000]   Northwest Europe? We can Northwest Africa. We can, that's run by Vichy France, which is pro
[03:07:02.000 --> 03:07:08.560]   Axis French, um, colonies. Um, why don't we take that and we can do that. And then we can meet in
[03:07:08.560 --> 03:07:12.240]   the middle. We can pincer out and we can conquer the whole of North Africa. You can kill with two
[03:07:12.240 --> 03:07:16.240]   birds with one stone because you can get some experience fighting against Axis troops, you know,
[03:07:16.240 --> 03:07:21.120]   test some of your, your, your, your equipment and commanders, you know, what's not to like, and then
[03:07:21.120 --> 03:07:25.760]   we can sort of see how it goes. So this is a kind of opportunistic strategy. Whereas Americans are very much
[03:07:25.760 --> 03:07:29.280]   sort of, you know, we, we want to draw a straight line to Berlin and that's the quickest way. And
[03:07:29.280 --> 03:07:34.480]   let's do, do it that way. So it's kind of a different viewpoint and, but Roosevelt kind of
[03:07:34.480 --> 03:07:39.680]   gets that and agrees to that. So that's where the whole North Africa Mediterranean campaign comes from.
[03:07:39.680 --> 03:07:44.400]   And as a consequence of the huge commitment to Tunisia, you know, three and a half thousand aircraft,
[03:07:44.400 --> 03:07:50.800]   huge navies, you know, two army allied armies, um, in North Africa, by the time Tunisia is one in
[03:07:50.800 --> 03:07:54.560]   mid May, 1943, they think, well, we've got all this here. We might as well kind of really try
[03:07:54.560 --> 03:07:57.920]   and get put the nail into the coffin of Italy's war, get them out of the battle.
[03:07:57.920 --> 03:08:00.960]   You know, Sicily is an obvious one. Let's go in there and then we can take a view.
[03:08:00.960 --> 03:08:06.960]   But between Sicily happening and the fall of North Africa is the Trident conference in Washington. And
[03:08:06.960 --> 03:08:11.440]   that is where the decision is made. The Americans go, okay, enough of this opportunistic stuff.
[03:08:12.080 --> 03:08:19.360]   let's just, okay, we get it. We buy it, but no more faffing around, you know, May, 1944,
[03:08:19.360 --> 03:08:24.320]   one year hence, we are going to cross the Atlantic and the British go, okay, fair cop, we'll do that.
[03:08:24.320 --> 03:08:29.600]   So, so that is where Operation Overlord, as it becomes, gets given its code name,
[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:34.320]   its operational name. That's when the planning starts. Serious planning starts at the beginning
[03:08:34.320 --> 03:08:41.680]   of 1944. And one of the lessons from Sicily to Normandy is that you can't have commanders fighting
[03:08:41.680 --> 03:08:46.880]   one battle whilst preparing for the next one. So you have to have a separate, um, uh, command structure.
[03:08:46.880 --> 03:08:51.040]   And that's okay because by this time we've got enough people that have got experience of battlefield
[03:08:51.040 --> 03:08:54.960]   command that you can actually split it. There are very good reasons for going into Italy,
[03:08:54.960 --> 03:09:00.560]   not least getting the Foggia airfields so that you can further tighten the noose around Nazi Germany.
[03:09:00.560 --> 03:09:05.680]   And one of the great prerequisites for the Normandy invasion is total control of air power of the air,
[03:09:05.680 --> 03:09:10.960]   of the airspace, not just over Normandy, but over a large swathe of Northwest Europe.
[03:09:10.960 --> 03:09:15.440]   Why is that? Because the moment you land in Normandy, the cat is out of the bag
[03:09:16.160 --> 03:09:20.560]   and it's then a race between which side can build up men and material quickest.
[03:09:20.560 --> 03:09:24.560]   Is it going to be the allies who've got to come from Southern England, which is a distance of
[03:09:24.560 --> 03:09:30.560]   a slow journey across seas and the distance between kind of 80 and 130 miles away?
[03:09:30.560 --> 03:09:33.520]   Or is it going to be the Germans that are already on the continent?
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:37.600]   Well, clearly on paper, it's the Germans. So you have to slow up the Germans. Well, how do you do that?
[03:09:37.600 --> 03:09:43.680]   We do that by destroying their means of getting there. So bridges, destroy the bridges over the Seine,
[03:09:43.680 --> 03:09:48.080]   destroy all the bridges over the Lavoie, hit the marshaling yards. The German, the glue that keeps
[03:09:48.080 --> 03:09:53.440]   the German war machine together is the Reichsbahn, the German railway network. So destroy the railway as
[03:09:53.440 --> 03:09:58.480]   much as you possibly can and make it difficult for the Germans to reinforce the Normandy British head
[03:09:58.480 --> 03:10:03.360]   as and when it comes. But the way you do that in turn is by very low level precision bombing,
[03:10:03.360 --> 03:10:09.200]   and that has to be done by twin engine, faster, smaller bombers going in low. But the problem is,
[03:10:09.200 --> 03:10:14.160]   is you can't go low and destroy those bridges if you've got Fockelwolves and Messerschmitts hovering
[03:10:14.160 --> 03:10:19.200]   above you. So you've got to destroy those, which is why you need to have air superiority over this large
[03:10:19.200 --> 03:10:25.840]   wave of Northwest Europe to do that. The problem is that while the industrial heartland of Nazi Germany is
[03:10:25.840 --> 03:10:30.880]   in the West is in the Ruhr era, which is very convenient for bombers coming out of Lincolnshire
[03:10:30.880 --> 03:10:37.760]   or East Anglia on the east flat, east side of, of Great Britain, the aircraft industry is much deeper
[03:10:37.760 --> 03:10:43.840]   into the Reich and it is beyond the range of fighter escorts for the bombers. And the American daylight
[03:10:43.840 --> 03:10:49.200]   bombers who are going over are discovering that despite being called flying fortresses, they're not fortresses,
[03:10:49.200 --> 03:10:55.120]   they're actually getting decimated. And whenever their bombers go in strength over to try and hit the
[03:10:55.120 --> 03:11:01.040]   aircraft industry in Germany, beyond fighter range, they get decimated. First, infamously on the Schweinfurt
[03:11:01.040 --> 03:11:06.800]   Regenburg's raid on the 17th of August 1943, coincidentally the same day that Sicily falls to the Allies,
[03:11:06.800 --> 03:11:12.640]   and also coincidentally the same day that face-to-face negotiations begin with the Italians for an armistice in
[03:11:12.640 --> 03:11:19.040]   Lisbon. But on that day of the 324 heavy bombers that the Americans send over to hit Schweinfurt and Regensburg,
[03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:24.880]   whether a Messerschmitt plant and also a ball bearing plant, which is essential for aircraft manufacturing,
[03:11:24.880 --> 03:11:31.200]   they lose 60 shot down and a further 130-odd, really, really badly damaged. And even for the vast
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:38.880]   numbers of manpower and bombers that are coming out of America, this is too much. So they can't sustain
[03:11:38.880 --> 03:11:42.880]   it. So they've got to find a fighter escort that's going to be able to escort them all the way into the
[03:11:42.880 --> 03:11:48.560]   into the Reich, and the race is on. Because basically, if they haven't got one airspace by April 1944,
[03:11:48.560 --> 03:11:53.440]   it's game over. You can't do a cross-channel invasion. You have to have that control of the
[03:11:53.440 --> 03:11:58.640]   airspace beforehand. So the race is on. Unfortunately, they come up with a solution, which is the P-51 Mustang,
[03:11:58.640 --> 03:12:04.160]   which has originally been commissioned in May 1940 by the British, developed from sketches to reality in
[03:12:04.160 --> 03:12:09.040]   117 days. It's a work of absolute genius. But start off its harness with a really bad engine.
[03:12:09.040 --> 03:12:14.480]   The Allison engine is just not right for that aircraft. And it's not until a Rolls-Royce Merlin,
[03:12:14.480 --> 03:12:19.040]   which is the same one that powers the Lancaster, the Mosquito and Spitfire and Hurricane, is put into the
[03:12:19.040 --> 03:12:24.720]   P-51 Mustang that suddenly you've got your solution. Because that means it can now fly with extra drop
[03:12:24.720 --> 03:12:30.880]   tanks and fuel tanks. It's so aerodynamic and it's so good, the higher it goes with this engine,
[03:12:30.880 --> 03:12:35.520]   the more fuel efficient it becomes. It can actually fly over 1,400 miles, which gets you not just to
[03:12:35.520 --> 03:12:41.280]   Berlin and back, but to Warsaw and back. So suddenly, you've got that solution. And actually, by April 1944,
[03:12:41.280 --> 03:12:45.600]   they have cleared airspace. And by the end of May 1944, just on the eve of the invasion,
[03:12:45.600 --> 03:12:54.560]   Operation Overlord, the closest German aircraft that is seen fighting allied aircraft is 500 miles.
[03:12:54.560 --> 03:13:00.720]   from the beachhead. So it is absolutely job done. Meanwhile, new fighter, comparatively new
[03:13:00.720 --> 03:13:08.720]   ground attack fighter planes like Typhoons and Tempests and adapted P-47 Thunderbolts are attacking
[03:13:08.720 --> 03:13:13.280]   the German radar stations all along the coastline, because they now do have an air defense system.
[03:13:13.280 --> 03:13:20.160]   They're destroying kind of 90% of their effectiveness. And in the intelligence game,
[03:13:20.160 --> 03:13:24.400]   they're winning that one as well. They're just much better because in Germany, intelligence is
[03:13:24.400 --> 03:13:29.680]   power. So Hitler always has this kind of divide and rule thing going on. So you have parallel command
[03:13:29.680 --> 03:13:34.240]   structures, which is not conducive to bringing together of intelligence. And while much play
[03:13:34.240 --> 03:13:38.720]   has been made about the successes of Bletchley and code-breaking and all the rest of it, actually,
[03:13:38.720 --> 03:13:43.440]   what you have to do is you have to see the kind of the decrypts that the Bletchley cryptanalysts do
[03:13:43.440 --> 03:13:50.640]   as just a cog. And those various cogs together from listening services to photo reconnaissance to agents
[03:13:50.640 --> 03:13:55.440]   on the ground, the cogs collectively add up to more than some of their individual parts.
[03:13:55.440 --> 03:14:00.720]   And so the intelligence picture is a broad picture rather than just code-breaking. But anyway, they win
[03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:06.240]   that particular battle as well. And what you see really with D-Day is, I think, is the zenith of
[03:14:06.240 --> 03:14:12.720]   coalition warfare. What you've got is you've got multiple nations who have different overall aims,
[03:14:12.720 --> 03:14:19.600]   different cultures, different attitudes, different start points, but they have all coalesced into one
[03:14:19.600 --> 03:14:24.800]   common goal. And until they've achieved that common goal, they're going to put differences to one side.
[03:14:25.440 --> 03:14:30.800]   You know, much play has been made about kind of anglophobia amongst American commanders and
[03:14:30.800 --> 03:14:35.840]   Americophobia amongst British commanders, but actually it's nothing. It's a marriage made in
[03:14:35.840 --> 03:14:42.000]   heaven compared to the way Germany looks after its own allies, for example. And what is remarkable
[03:14:42.000 --> 03:14:47.520]   about the allies is they're not actually allies, they're coalition partners. So there's no formal
[03:14:47.520 --> 03:14:53.360]   alliance at all. And there is a subtle difference there. But what you see them is that you see them
[03:14:54.960 --> 03:15:00.960]   really, really pulling together. And you see that manifest itself on D-Day, I think, where you've got,
[03:15:00.960 --> 03:15:12.080]   you know, 6,939 vessels, of which there are 1,213 warships, 4,127 assault craft, 12,500 aircraft,
[03:15:12.080 --> 03:15:21.040]   you know, 155,000 men landed and dropped from the air in a 24-hour period. It is phenomenal. It is
[03:15:21.040 --> 03:15:26.640]   absolutely phenomenal. And while it is still seen as a predominantly American show, all three service
[03:15:26.640 --> 03:15:33.840]   commanders are British. It is most of the aircraft, two-thirds of the aircraft are British. Two-thirds
[03:15:33.840 --> 03:15:38.640]   of the men landed are British in Dominion. You'll never forget the Canadians who consistently punch
[03:15:38.640 --> 03:15:43.280]   massively above their weight in the Second World War. In all aspects, it has to be said, air, land,
[03:15:43.280 --> 03:15:49.200]   sea. They're key in the Battle of the Atlantic. They're key in air power. They're key at D-Day,
[03:15:49.200 --> 03:15:53.200]   and indeed in the Battle for Italy as well. So the Canadians should never be forgotten.
[03:15:53.200 --> 03:16:02.080]   But one of the reasons it is the British Navy that dominates in D-Day is because, of course,
[03:16:02.080 --> 03:16:08.160]   the incredibly enormous strength of the Royal Navy in the first place, but partly because most of the
[03:16:08.160 --> 03:16:12.880]   US Navy is by this stage in the Pacific fighting its own fight. So it's not slacking by any stretch
[03:16:12.880 --> 03:16:18.480]   of the imagination. It is because it's elsewhere doing its bit for the kind of overall ally cause.
[03:16:18.480 --> 03:16:22.640]   But D-Day is just extraordinary, you know, and despite the terrible weather,
[03:16:22.640 --> 03:16:28.160]   which is such a debilitating factor in the whole thing. I mean, it puts people off course. It means
[03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:32.240]   many more people get killed on Omaha Beach than they might have done and on other beaches besides,
[03:16:32.240 --> 03:16:36.560]   incidentally. And actually, in terms of lives lost, proportionally, it is the Canadians that
[03:16:36.560 --> 03:16:41.520]   suffer the worst, more so than the Americans. It's just there's fewer of them overall.
[03:16:41.520 --> 03:16:47.920]   D-Day has to be seen as an unqualified success. I mean, it is absolutely extraordinary what they
[03:16:47.920 --> 03:16:53.360]   achieve. And while they don't 100% achieve their overall D-Day objectives, you know, the objectives
[03:16:53.360 --> 03:16:58.720]   are always going to be the outer reach of what is, is, can be, can be achieved. And you'd need
[03:16:58.720 --> 03:17:03.760]   absolutely perfect conditions for that to happen. And they don't get perfect conditions, but they're
[03:17:03.760 --> 03:17:09.280]   so balanced. They're so thought of absolutely everything and their logistics supply. And I mean,
[03:17:09.280 --> 03:17:13.200]   even things like the minesweeping operation is the biggest single minesweeping operation of the entire
[03:17:13.200 --> 03:17:18.560]   war, because there's huge minefields off the Normandy coast and ahead of the invasion force,
[03:17:18.560 --> 03:17:24.240]   the minesweepers, which amount to I think something like 242 different minesweepers in five different
[03:17:24.240 --> 03:17:29.680]   operations opposite every single beach, creating lanes through these minefields through which the
[03:17:29.680 --> 03:17:35.840]   invasion force can go. Not a single ship is lost to a mine in the actual invasion. That is phenomenal
[03:17:35.840 --> 03:17:41.600]   and can only be done with the greatest of skill and planning. And all in a period where, you know,
[03:17:41.600 --> 03:17:46.320]   there are no computers, there's no GPS, there's nothing. I mean, it is, it is absolutely astonishing.
[03:17:46.320 --> 03:17:49.600]   And the scale of it is just frankly, mind boggling.
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:57.680]   Yeah. And that was really the, the nail in the coffin, the beginning of the end for, for Hitler,
[03:17:57.680 --> 03:18:00.240]   for the European theater.
[03:18:00.240 --> 03:18:05.360]   Yeah. Once you get the, the only cause for doubt is will they be able to secure that bridgehead?
[03:18:05.360 --> 03:18:10.720]   The moment they get that bridgehead, it is game over. There's only, you know, there is,
[03:18:10.720 --> 03:18:15.520]   there is no other way it's going to be because of the overwhelming amount of men and material that
[03:18:15.520 --> 03:18:19.280]   the allies have compared to the Germans at this stage of the war. And of course, you know,
[03:18:19.280 --> 03:18:22.960]   you're being attacked on three fronts because there's the Italian front to the south. And of course,
[03:18:22.960 --> 03:18:26.960]   in a very major way, you've also got the Eastern front and operation for Gratian,
[03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:32.080]   which has launched that, that summer as well is enormous.
[03:18:32.080 --> 03:18:40.480]   So let's go to the very end. Uh, the battle of Berlin. Yeah. Uh, Hitler sitting in his bunker,
[03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:48.400]   his suicide, Germany surrender. You actually said that downfall, the movie was a very accurate
[03:18:48.400 --> 03:18:52.320]   representation. I think it is really, except the Goebbels took sign. I didn't shoot himself.
[03:18:52.320 --> 03:19:00.560]   I don't know details, but I think it's probably, it might be my favorite, uh, World War II movie,
[03:19:00.560 --> 03:19:05.920]   which is strange to say, cause it's not really about World War II. It's about Hitler in a bunker,
[03:19:05.920 --> 03:19:12.160]   but I think, uh, it was in a Bruno Gantz, wasn't it? I think, I think he, he nailed him. Yeah.
[03:19:12.160 --> 03:19:18.880]   That's there's so many accounts of that. There's so much written about Hitler. There's so many of,
[03:19:18.880 --> 03:19:22.800]   of, there's millions and millions of Hitler's words that you can read. You know, there's,
[03:19:22.800 --> 03:19:28.720]   there are translations of many of his conferences. You can see what he's saying. You can get inside
[03:19:28.720 --> 03:19:34.000]   his head in a very clear way and much more clearly than you can Stalin or just about any other leader,
[03:19:34.000 --> 03:19:43.520]   really. And so one has a very, very strong impression of what Hitler was like in the bunker in those last,
[03:19:43.520 --> 03:19:52.480]   last days that just, there's so many accounts of it and it just feels like they nailed it. It just feels
[03:19:52.480 --> 03:20:00.400]   like they've got it spot on. I mean, it's a fascinating story of, uh, evil maniac and then,
[03:20:00.400 --> 03:20:09.360]   and this, this certainty, you know, crumbling, right? Like realizing that this vision of the
[03:20:09.360 --> 03:20:14.320]   thousand year Reich is, uh, and Hitler says, says, you know, my reputation won't be good to start off
[03:20:14.320 --> 03:20:17.440]   with, but I hope in a few years time that people will start to realize that kind of all the good I was
[03:20:17.440 --> 03:20:22.800]   trying to bring. Yeah. And that sort of, they're all the same, aren't they? You always believe
[03:20:22.800 --> 03:20:30.640]   you're doing good and there's so many deep lessons there. So now you have written so much, you have
[03:20:30.640 --> 03:20:38.800]   said so much, you have studied this so much. What do you look in at World War II is, uh, the lessons we
[03:20:38.800 --> 03:20:46.480]   should take away? Well, I suppose it's, it's, it's what happens when you allow these individuals
[03:20:47.040 --> 03:20:51.280]   to take hold of great power and great authority and make these terrible decisions. If you allow
[03:20:51.280 --> 03:20:56.720]   that to happen, you know, there are consequences and you have to be, you have to recognize the moments
[03:20:56.720 --> 03:21:03.280]   of, of trouble when they arise. So when there are financial crisis, you know, that political unrest
[03:21:03.280 --> 03:21:08.640]   is going to come and you need to be prepared for that. You know, you need to be able to see the writing
[03:21:08.640 --> 03:21:16.640]   on the wall. You can't, you can't be complacent. You know, complacency is such a dirty word, isn't
[03:21:16.640 --> 03:21:21.840]   it? You know, you've got, you've got to keep your wits and you can't take things for granted.
[03:21:21.840 --> 03:21:29.360]   You've got to recognize, I think, um, that the freedoms we enjoy in the West are, you know,
[03:21:29.360 --> 03:21:36.560]   they're not necessarily permanent and you need to make the most of them while you've got them and
[03:21:36.560 --> 03:21:44.640]   cherish them and consider what happens if the milk turns sour and what the consequences of that are.
[03:21:44.640 --> 03:21:49.280]   I mean, that's the overriding thing, because although I don't think there'll ever be a war
[03:21:49.280 --> 03:21:54.080]   on the scale of the second world war, you've only got to look up pictures of those opening days of the
[03:21:54.080 --> 03:22:00.080]   war in Ukraine and see sort of knocked out Russian tanks and dead bodies, bloated bodies all over the
[03:22:00.080 --> 03:22:06.240]   place, put that into black and white. And, you know, it could be the road out of fallets in 1944.
[03:22:06.240 --> 03:22:12.480]   It could be, you know, any number of German battlefields and in the, in World War II and,
[03:22:12.480 --> 03:22:17.440]   and the similarities and the trenches and the kind of people hiding in foxholes. And, you know, that,
[03:22:17.440 --> 03:22:22.400]   that's, that's horribly reminiscent as are the huge casualties that they're suffering on both sides,
[03:22:22.400 --> 03:22:26.880]   whether they'd be Russian or Ukrainian. And, you know, it's a shock. It's a shock to see that.
[03:22:26.880 --> 03:22:34.000]   And it reminds you of just how quickly I think things can descend. I mean, that's, that's,
[03:22:34.000 --> 03:22:38.160]   that's the other thing, you know, at that point I was making about how quickly Germany descended from
[03:22:38.160 --> 03:22:45.280]   this amazing nation of arts and culture and science and development and engineering into one of the
[03:22:45.280 --> 03:22:53.440]   Holocaust. I mean, life is fragile and, and peace is fragile. And, you know, it's,
[03:22:55.200 --> 03:23:02.160]   you take it for granted at your peril and you take for granted at our peril that nobody will use nuclear
[03:23:02.160 --> 03:23:07.440]   weapons ever again. And that's not a thing we should take for granted.
[03:23:07.440 --> 03:23:14.240]   No, sir. What gives you hope about the future of human civilization? We've been talking about all of
[03:23:14.240 --> 03:23:19.920]   this darkness in the 20th century. What's the source of light?
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:27.360]   The source of light is that I think the vast majority of people are good people who want to live peacefully
[03:23:27.360 --> 03:23:33.920]   and want to live happily and are not filled with hate. And there are some brilliant minds out there.
[03:23:33.920 --> 03:23:42.080]   And I think the capacity for the human brain to come up with new developments and new answers to problems
[03:23:42.080 --> 03:23:48.320]   and challenges is infinite. And I think that's what gives me hope.
[03:23:48.320 --> 03:23:57.840]   James, this is a, I'm a big fan. This was an honor to talk to you and please keep putting incredible history out there.
[03:23:57.840 --> 03:24:02.320]   Um, I can't wait to see what you do next. Thank you so much for talking today.

[03:24:22.320 --> 03:24:27.840]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
[03:24:27.840 --> 03:24:29.840]   Bye.
