[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.640]   All right, what do we have here?
[00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:02.480]   Ooh, 120.
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.640]   Let's do one more quick question, Jesse,
[00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.880]   and then we'll call it quits.
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.580]   This last one comes from Oscar.
[00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.800]   Oscar asks, "How should I organize my circle of friends
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.020]   "and acquaintances in order to make them stop texting me
[00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.600]   "via WhatsApp?"
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.400]   I'm gonna give you three suggestions, Oscar.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.920]   All of these suggestions are gonna be built
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.400]   on this foundational observation
[00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.160]   that I make in my book, "Digital Minimalism,"
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.760]   which is that this is actually the area
[00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.820]   in your personal technology life
[00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.560]   that is the hardest to change.
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.760]   By hardest, I mean the area
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.760]   where you're gonna get the most pushback.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.440]   People worry about social media.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.840]   Oh, if as part of becoming a digital minimalist,
[00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.600]   I stop using social media as much,
[00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.860]   all of these bad things might happen.
[00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.880]   I'm not gonna be able to grow my business.
[00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.440]   People are gonna miss me and worry, "Where are you?"
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.400]   I'm gonna disappear from the public discourse,
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.220]   et cetera, et cetera.
[00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.080]   But in reality, when people embrace minimalism,
[00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.160]   it's text messaging, instant messaging.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.860]   Back and forth conversations with people they know on apps,
[00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.320]   that's the hardest place to change their behavior.
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.680]   They leave Twitter, no one notices.
[00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.400]   They leave WhatsApp,
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.140]   and a private investigator is knocking at their door
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.900]   with a corpse-sniffing dog.
[00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.240]   So let me just make that the foundation.
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.400]   I feel your pain, Oscar.
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.440]   But I'm gonna give you three ways
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:18.680]   to make this transition away
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.860]   from constant WhatsApp accessibility.
[00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:23.600]   Three suggestions to give you.
[00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.980]   One, I would say apologize
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.720]   instead of instructing.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.320]   So instead of trying to instruct people,
[00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.860]   "Okay, everyone in my family, okay, all my friends,
[00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.400]   here's how I'm using WhatsApp now.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.540]   Here's the right way to get in touch with me."
[00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.220]   Everyone will get defensive.
[00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.040]   It's the guy with his one-day AA chip
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.840]   going to the bar and lecturing about alcohol.
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.440]   People are gonna get defensive.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.520]   So I would say instead,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.280]   just switch to your new rules for using instant messengers,
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.160]   whatever those rules are,
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.100]   and apologize when people complain.
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.800]   You just simply get ready to say a bunch at first.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.520]   "Oh, sorry, yeah, I don't keep WhatsApp open
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.800]   when I'm working on work,
[00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.640]   or I don't keep WhatsApp open when I'm exercising."
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.480]   Whatever it is, just keep apologizing, right?
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.960]   And people will eventually get it.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.520]   Like, "Oh, I guess Oscar doesn't keep WhatsApp open,
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.880]   so I cannot expect that if I send him something,
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.400]   he's gonna get back to me right away."
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.240]   They're not defensive
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.960]   because you're not telling them that's better.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.800]   They're not defensive
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.440]   because you're not telling them, "Don't bother me."
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.640]   You're apologizing.
[00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.340]   But the apology is sneaky effective
[00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.220]   because even if it annoys them that they can't reach you
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.700]   because you don't keep WhatsApp open at work,
[00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.500]   it's a hard argument for them to make,
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.260]   "Hey, Oscar, no, no, that's unacceptable.
[00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.940]   You need to be monitoring WhatsApp at work."
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.260]   When they actually put in the words what they're doing
[00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.380]   and what in the moment they're hoping you would be doing,
[00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.780]   it seems somewhat absurd, and so they don't.
[00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.560]   Two, provide a higher friction emergency option.
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.980]   This was actually an idea that came up.
[00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.260]   We called it escape valves.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.640]   In my book, "A World Without Email," by the way,
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.440]   I don't know why I use this royal we.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.480]   Have you noticed this, Jessie?
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   I've noticed this more and more podcast and videos.
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.680]   There's this real temptation to use we,
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.640]   even when it's not we.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.800]   I guess it makes it seem like everyone has big teams
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.720]   or seems more important,
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.120]   but I don't think it actually works.
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.400]   I think it just sounds weird, but look, I just did it there.
[00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.900]   I said, "Oh, in "A World Without Email," we."
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.740]   There's no we.
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.580]   It's a book I wrote.
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.520]   There's not a team of crack scientists
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.400]   that got together to put together this book,
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.980]   so I'm trying to be better about that.
[00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.080]   Or if I'm talking about this show,
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:33.760]   I'll just say like Jessie and I,
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.200]   'cause I don't, I don't, I don't know.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.520]   There's a lot of that goes on now.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.720]   Podcasters, YouTubers,
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.860]   they all wanna emphasize their teams,
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.640]   like there's some large office building
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.700]   that all their workers are in.
[00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.520]   Anyways, in my book, "A World Without Email,"
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.200]   when I was talking about,
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.680]   it's a slightly different context,
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.020]   but people reworking professional communication protocols
[00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.500]   so there's less ad hoc messaging,
[00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.680]   I talked a lot about the importance of an escape valve.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.180]   So you give people a way that they can contact you
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.500]   and get an immediate answer in the case of an emergency,
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.580]   but it's a higher friction solution.
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.540]   So like you have to call me, right?
[00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:20.620]   Something that's higher friction,
[00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.060]   not impossible, but higher friction.
[00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.220]   No one really is gonna use it,
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:28.220]   but it provides people a psychological piece
[00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.560]   knowing if I did need to use it, I could, right?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.160]   So people might be worried in your family
[00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.000]   or your circle of friends,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.740]   if they're thinking, "Oh, you know, Oscar's not on this,
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.200]   but what if there's an emergency?
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:39.100]   What if we really need him?
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:40.920]   My goodness, like maybe this is better that you're on it."
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.420]   But if they have an escape valve,
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.360]   "Oh, this is how you get me if it's really urgent
[00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:45.580]   and I'm not on WhatsApp,"
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.100]   then that issue, that concern goes away.
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.720]   You're not worried about that anymore.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.700]   It also, again, I don't mean to keep coming back to this,
[00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:55.740]   I don't mean to be villainizing
[00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:56.700]   your family and friends, Oscar,
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:59.820]   but it diffuses potential defensive responses.
[00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:00.840]   'Cause there's a response that's like,
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.340]   "Hey, look, I need you.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:07.620]   I need you to be on WhatsApp because I'm swinging by."
[00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.060]   You know, your mother-in-law is like,
[00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:11.140]   "I have to swing by to drop something off
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.740]   and I need to know if you're there."
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:14.180]   If they have the escape valves,
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.140]   like, "Yeah, but you know what you can do?
[00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:15.980]   You can call me."
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.060]   It's a bit more of a pain,
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.500]   but it's there and you can do that.
[00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.840]   No one will actually use it.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.300]   Escape valves are all about the peace.
[00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:28.300]   Finally, consider personal communication office hours.
[00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:31.940]   So I was reminded of this idea.
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.220]   I mean, I first heard this idea
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.100]   from an entrepreneur I know named Chris Yeh.
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.060]   And then I talked to Chris the other day.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.460]   So it reminded me of this concept
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.900]   that he had innovated years ago.
[00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.480]   But Chris had office hours every day
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.620]   during roughly the same time
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.220]   when he was commuting from his office back to his house.
[00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.060]   He's in San Francisco.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.020]   Maybe he was on the 101 and there's traffic.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.500]   So he knew there was a 45 minute period
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.220]   where I'd always be in my car.
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.720]   And so he had personal communication office hours
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.180]   for people who knew him, friends, family members.
[00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.420]   You can always call me during that time.
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.900]   And so it's a way that he could stay in touch with people
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.500]   and have serendipitous conversations
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.660]   and see what's going on
[00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:14.820]   without have to constantly be monitoring
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.140]   some other type of asynchronous communication medium.
[00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.540]   So personal communication office hours
[00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:21.100]   are a great way of maintaining connection
[00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.940]   when people are used to being able to just outsource that
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:26.440]   to doing quick messages back and forth.
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.460]   Now you're like, "Hey, call me, man.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.300]   Call me.
[00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.160]   This is my time I'm available.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.260]   When are you gonna call me?"
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.220]   Or if they're texting you
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.580]   and you don't see it till three hours later,
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:35.860]   you're like, "Just call me at my next, call me.
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.020]   You can always call me at these hours.
[00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:38.740]   Call me next time you can, let's talk about it."
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.380]   So it's a way to have connection with people
[00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.460]   with again, not having to monitor that screen all the time.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.980]   All right, Oscar, so that's what I'd recommend.
[00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.660]   I think you're thinking about the right thing.
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:48.900]   I do not think the constant monitoring
[00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.540]   of instant messenger type channels
[00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.580]   is compatible with a deep life by almost any definition.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.660]   It is an issue, but it's also really hard to get past.
[00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.220]   Those are the three things I would keep in mind.
[00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:59.280]   People will still complain,
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:00.380]   but they'll complain a lot less
[00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.780]   if you do those three things.
[00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.040]   It is worth it.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.540]   You just can't live a focused life
[00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.180]   if every four minutes you have to check and jump in
