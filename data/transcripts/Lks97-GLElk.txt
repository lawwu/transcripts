[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   George Hotz gave me a demo of the Kama 2 on a ride back to the Kama AI offices in San Diego.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:14.640]   Then we took a quick tour of the office. I found both the Kama 2 system and the entire Kama AI
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:23.280]   team and operation very impressive. Plus I got a 3D printer named after me. As one robot to another,
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:29.280]   we're in this together my brother. And now on to the ride and tour with George Hotz.
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.960]   I'm here with uh driving with George Hotz and uh looking at the Kama 2.
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.760]   Trying to find a stretch of road where we can enable it. Yeah just start looping back to the
[00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.600]   office. I mean I could enable it here but this isn't really where it shines. Yeah so we don't
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:55.760]   have we don't have our license stop signs yet. Um I don't want to ship it until we have a real uh
[00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.440]   holistic one. Until we have an end to end one. So you'll be able to then like stop at a stop sign.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.280]   So the longitudinal control. Did you just enable it? I just enabled it yeah. So this is the uh so
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:17.920]   we're gonna have to stop at this light. But um how do you enable it? Uh cruise control. So that's
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.840]   that's the the integrated knobs on the on the car. Yeah we have a good we'll go on the 163 a bit and
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:34.080]   that's that's that's a good test of uh whether your level two system's any good. Supercruise
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.640]   actually can't do it. Supercruise can't do it because they're they're not good enough with roll
[00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.280]   on the road. Autopilot can do it and we can do it.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.080]   How's San Diego in terms of quality of roads and lane markings and all that kind of stuff?
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:58.240]   Pretty mediocre like the rest of California. What's your favorite uh reason for using KAMA?
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:07.840]   Like when when do you find the most joy? Oh oh it's it's long trips. It's um you know
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.920]   driving from here to LA. You'll do it without a disengagement almost. You can you can you know
[00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.080]   it's two hours to LA from here. You could just go to LA. Uh get in your car and you just sit there
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.600]   and watch. And it's it's a it's a great time. All right so we can we can engage here. So you know
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:37.840]   watch. So it doesn't technically require perfect lane markings? No not at all. In fact you can do
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.120]   lane changes on roads that don't have lane markings because it's all end to end. So I have
[00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:47.680]   to get over three lanes. I'm just going to take control here to do it. Especially since there's
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:55.840]   a cop there. So let me just get over three lanes and then this road's a decent demo.
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.880]   Yeah so I think only us and Autopilot can do this road.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.000]   Pretty curvy. Yeah and uh it's not just curvy it's also banked.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.040]   Um and if you don't yeah if you don't do that well if you don't have a model that can detect
[00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:18.320]   that. Um so the longitudinal policy is actually just being done by the car.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:24.560]   Um Hyundai has quite a competent ACC. Probably the best one. Uh so we haven't really felt the
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.520]   urge to move to our gas and brakes. There's a few cute things where which ours will do better
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.200]   and more holistically than than theirs. But um really it's about the turning.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.560]   How hard is it to get it to be this smooth? Uh hard.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.760]   Five years of engineering. All of this end to end huh?
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.440]   When we're detecting the lane lines they're used but they're more used as uh
[00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.520]   see like right there that's the stock system being too harsh on the brakes.
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.800]   If you're a human driving you would have been much more gradual on the brakes there.
[00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:08.800]   But we're really going to push to switch all the longitudinals to open pilot once we have
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.120]   end-to-end longitudinal and the same way we have end-to-end lateral.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.240]   What's harder end-to-end longitudinal or end-to-end lateral?
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:19.680]   We put a lot more work into end-to-end lateral because there's a lot more subtlety in that.
[00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.600]   The car companies have managed to build competent longitudinal. We have competent
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.800]   longitudinal using old school policies. But lateral there's so much subtlety. For example
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.360]   like when a lane splits out should you follow that split? Should you stay in the center or
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.400]   should you stay to one side or so much subtlety there.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.280]   And making it all smooth and not freak out. Yeah and this thing you know the reason I feel
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:49.440]   very confident keeping my hands off the wheel our torque limit is so much lower than Tesla's.
[00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.160]   So you can't can't do anything crazy? No we do injection tests where one person sits in that
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:00.320]   seat with a joystick and the other person keeps their hands off the wheel and that person you
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.160]   can't look at them they're free to jam the joystick in any direction and if you don't feel
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.520]   you know safe in that maneuver they take back over here because we're getting off here.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:14.960]   But yeah that stretch of road is a is a is a competent demonstration of open pilot.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.200]   Yeah that was impressive. It's not the high end. Maybe when we get to the city streets
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:24.720]   I'll engage on the city streets. Is city streets like a compelling use case or is that just kind of
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:32.320]   without it? Intuition builder. Without end-to-end longitudinal it's pretty like it's not really
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.640]   useful as product. So it's more just it's cool that it can do it and like we don't gate it off
[00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:44.080]   but most of open pilot is highways like most of the value real gain is highways.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:53.840]   But also not just highways also like one lane each way kind of things like double yellow kind
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.800]   of roads. I was doing all like the mountains up in Colorado with this thing and just you get to look
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.960]   at the mountains before it drives. So like I can engage it here.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:14.400]   Now remember the longitudinal policy is is Hyundai and it's not ideal for cities.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.800]   But so again we're going to go through this intersection with no lines.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:28.000]   See notice how there's no line there yet our placement is still almost human ideal.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.760]   Yeah this is great. So there I mean there you see we did a stretch of
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.280]   you know a minute of city and perfectly human nothing sketchy.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:42.560]   See places like that or where disengage on gas is really nice.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:50.240]   Really easy to you know hand off you always know when that handoff is happening with the noise.
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.840]   It didn't like keep the ACC on or anything. God if it kept the ACC on and I make the turn and it's
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.040]   like trying to accelerate at a weird time you know just asking to have a bad time.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:10.560]   I like the the sounds the visual it's like clear when it's on and when it's off.
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.680]   Love it. Well done. Damn that's impressive.
[00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:28.320]   That's really impressive. That's the intersections without thinking about it.
[00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.480]   Okay that was awesome.
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:39.120]   It's communicating the uncertainty with this movement a little bit.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.920]   I like it. Humans actually wobble a little more than you think too.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:50.000]   You notice it a lot more when they're this. Yeah that's an interesting point yeah. Yeah true.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:58.800]   I think Jesse Levinson mentioned this on one of his interviews. He's like so you know we have all
[00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:03.760]   these we have the safety driver sit in the car and mark every tiny mistakes it made and then we also
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.920]   had the safety driver sit in a car that was being human driven and mark all the little tiny mistakes
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.400]   it made. So this is the comma office in downtown. The comma office is right here.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:22.080]   We're at uh comma AI offices with uh Mr. George Harts. Can you give us a little tour? It doesn't
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.760]   light up anymore I don't know why. Do you think most of these dashboards are okay? They're almost
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:36.880]   at 30 million open pilot miles. Wow. Oh it's a hell of a number. So here here's
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:42.320]   dailies, weeklies and uh so actually yeah dailies are like maybe not 2,000 1.5.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:52.080]   So those are used daily and then used weekly. Yeah. That's really cool. Weeklys are almost 2.5
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:56.720]   and monthly is a little over 3. This is how many devices are on our botnet in the last hour.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:03.760]   Botnet last day, botnet last week. Is this all over the United States?
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.520]   This is no this is everywhere. So here's here's here's the maps. Here's the map of the world.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:22.400]   Uh so we're everywhere in the world. So let's see. In the last 30 days we had 2,200 in the U.S.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:33.040]   and then Korea, Canada, Taiwan, Japan. Japan's up there. This is our percent engaged.
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.920]   So percent of miles engaged is about 50 percent. Percent time engaged is about 30.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:42.560]   Our disengagements are split pretty evenly between cancel, gas and break.
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:50.640]   Most of our segments are now coming from Comma 2s. Comma 2s. Comma 2 is the big the big breakout for
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.920]   this company. Yeah. Oh yeah. That's profitable. This is our live link to the Europe office.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:02.320]   It comes as a multinational corporation. George just erased a bunch of top secret things.
[00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.200]   Censorship. The censors came in. Yeah. Look the mission's at the top of the board.
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:16.640]   Solve self-driving cars while delivering shippable intermediaries. Amen. What do we do badly? What
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.560]   can we do better? Right. Good questions. Open pilot 1.0. When is that coming up?
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:27.440]   When those things are done. PyTorch. Okay.
[00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:34.560]   I like how that's the bullet point. That's like move everything to PyTorch.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:40.000]   Oh, sorry. It's not a data center. It's a compute cluster. For legal reasons,
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   it's a compute cluster. It's a compute cluster. Okay. That sounds sexier too.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:51.600]   Data ingestion, multi-chain. Cool. So this is like a vision board for OpenPilot 1.0.
[00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:56.000]   It's not going to happen for a while. But the Comma 2 is going to get OpenPilot 1.0.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.360]   It's like what I said with the hardware. So this is all going to come to the Comma 2
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.960]   just with OTAs. OTA, over the air. We're going to get it. Yeah. I mean, we're getting close on a
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:11.280]   lot of these. I'm going to start lowering the wheel touch timeout. Alex, this is Alex. Hi.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:19.040]   She's our COO. COO. Nice. Nice to meet you. She runs the back there stuff.
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:24.400]   What's the technical description of the back there stuff? You want to see? Yeah.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:29.200]   I think it's more exciting than this stuff. It depends who you ask.
[00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:35.040]   We're ahead of all the secrets, right? Nick, do we have any secrets out?
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:46.960]   I'll blur it out. I'll blur the top secrets. This is production. Stress test. This is our
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:54.400]   final test. The Comma 2s hang out here for about 24 hours. We test them for their heat,
[00:11:54.400 --> 00:12:00.640]   their temperature, their light sensors. We do cosmetic checks, screen checks.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:08.160]   Pretty exciting. You can see they all start over there as phones. Then they get retrofit.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:17.520]   Then they go full house fit. You can see we have a class of 100 phones out right now.
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:27.360]   They're getting tested. It's kind of exciting actually. Lex, this is Mitchell. He's the
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:38.800]   latest addition to our machine learning team. That's Chris, also known as Virtually Chris.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:47.600]   He's a famous YouTuber. Oh, wow. How did fame change you? I introduced you as a famous YouTuber.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:53.040]   Yes, I was the open pilot YouTuber. Don't let it get to your head.
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:13:04.960]   That's our head of hardware. Awesome. What's that stage of the assembly?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:12.400]   This is the final case. We have board testing. Then the retrofit phones get
[00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:17.040]   board put on them, soldered to them. We get the heat sink and the fan. Then we put the cases on
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:25.920]   them. Awesome. Yeah, they're taking cases off, screens off here. They're testing screens over
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:32.640]   here. Oven. Yeah, 3D printer. You want to show that? I will too. I'm afraid to take it in there.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.640]   It's very hot and loud. It's also the home of the compute cluster.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:43.280]   It's not a data center. It's not a data center. That's right. It's a compute cluster.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.160]   Prepare yourself.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:59.120]   It's the sound of productivity. Yeah. Oh my God, it's really hot. Fresh bag, cases.
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:04.640]   This is what you see on the outside of the Comma 2s.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:08.080]   These are all of our printers.
[00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:14.240]   Yeah, I like how they have names.
[00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:25.440]   Meg. What's the purpose of the rings? They used to be for athletic activity, but now we have too
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:31.120]   many printers. You can't anymore. We just got about 20 printers in the last few months.
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:38.960]   They've come from all over the world. Literally, Poland, Germany, Peru, France.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:44.560]   How long does it take to print a single one?
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:53.440]   Yes, we'll name number 49 for you, Lex. Thank you. We'll call him Lex. I told him he could be
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:59.840]   number 49. I could be. So great, 49's not working right now, but I promise 49 will work. It'll be
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.600]   Lex number 49. I appreciate that. That would mean a lot to me.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:14.000]   This is cool. So unfortunately, because we got to keep the bugs and dust out, they're covered, but
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:26.400]   1U. I already forgot their official name. The compute cluster. So these are our CPU machines.
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:31.680]   We have three racks that look like that. Two petabytes of spinning disks.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:41.200]   We're at 3080s. Our 3080s are in only desktop computers for non-business purposes. These are
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:16:00.000]   our GPU machines. What's in there? V100s.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.920]   It's like a farm. Every day we kind of go out.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:07.600]   21st century farm. We got to hire a good farm bill player to come farm us.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:12.720]   These are the ones that are ready to ship.
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:18.160]   I think these are all of our growing harnesses. These are all the hardware support.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:27.520]   Bosch, Deliver, Nynex, Subaru, Toyota, all the Hyundais. All the way to J,
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:34.080]   Nissan, VW. All these are assembled by hand?
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:35.600]   Yeah. That's cool.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:38.960]   That's amazing. That's legit. That's awesome.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:39.920]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:42.880]   That's the office.
[00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:44.400]   Have you been for a ride among the cars?
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:48.800]   Yeah. He took me for a ride. It was awesome. It was really surprising how well it worked.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.400]   Where'd you take him on the highway?
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:51.600]   We did like the 163.
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:55.040]   In the city a little bit too. It held up.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:56.320]   Definitely.
[00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:57.600]   You didn't show him any secrets, though, did you?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:00.400]   No, I didn't show him any secrets. It means like keep on driving, you know?
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:04.960]   That's why we replaced it with a heart. We're all big Elon fans.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:10.080]   Elon's success is our success.
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:14.960]   If iOS succeeds, Android succeeds.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:15.620]   Thanks.
[00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:16.660]   you
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:17.700]   you
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:18.200]   you
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:18.700]   you
[00:17:19.660 --> 00:17:19.740]   you
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:20.780]   you
[00:17:20.780 --> 00:17:21.280]   you
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:26.360]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
