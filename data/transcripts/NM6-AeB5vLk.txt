[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.940]   - Welcome to the Latent Space Podcast,
[00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.760]   where we dive into the wild, wild world
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.840]   of AI engineering every week.
[00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.920]   This is Anna, your friendly neighborhood AI,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.320]   and I'll be standing in for Alessio today.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.640]   Yes, you heard right, AI is taking our podcasting jobs.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.480]   We flew all the way to London to interview Yousef Risk,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.420]   co-founder of Wondercraft AI,
[00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.080]   which has created the number one piece
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.040]   of AI generated content enjoyed
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.160]   by the Latent Space community.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:32.440]   We ask him how he arrived at his idea,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.160]   what the future of commercial AI generated content
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.800]   looks like, and confront him
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.680]   with the hardest question of all.
[00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.780]   What is his moat as an API wrapper startup?
[00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.140]   At the end, we even have him turn the tables
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.360]   and do a customer interview with Swix.
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.080]   There's lots of audio goodies in this one,
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.760]   and bonus 30 minutes video on youtube.com/latentspacetv.
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.800]   Watch out and take care.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.880]   So we're in the studio here in London with Yousef, welcome.
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.120]   - Thank you, great to be here.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.400]   - It's been such a joy listening
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.080]   to Wondercraft's podcasts over the last four or five months.
[00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.800]   You guys have been around for only five months.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.800]   And as you know, I am one of your podcast's biggest fans.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.180]   And I think that it's super interesting
[00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.560]   because I talk to a lot of vendors,
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.180]   effectively people who create services
[00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.000]   for other developers to build.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.260]   And you are at the application layer,
[00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.360]   which is great and challenging for me as a podcaster
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.040]   because you have some secret sauce
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.320]   that you're not gonna share.
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.800]   But I also wanna just talk to you
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.900]   as someone who's evaluated a lot of things
[00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.920]   and built something that I actually use every single day.
[00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.760]   So that's the context.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.840]   - Great, great.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.680]   - How do you feel when I say these things?
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.560]   Is that exactly what you're going for?
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.400]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.040]   So it definitely makes sense, right?
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.000]   Resonates definitely on the application layer,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.240]   and that's definitely by design.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.940]   - Yeah, and we can talk about the origin story
[00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.840]   leading into Wondercraft.
[00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.000]   But just to learn a little bit more about you,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   you grew up in Egypt?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.840]   - I grew up in Egypt, yeah.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.560]   I spent the first 18 years there.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.480]   - Cairo.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.240]   And then you came over to the UK.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.320]   You got your master's in triple E at Imperial.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.280]   - Yeah, it's a funny story.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.880]   Actually, in the UK, I don't have a bachelor's.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.240]   I only have a master's.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.080]   - How?
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.160]   - You do this four-year integrated bachelor plus master's
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.840]   'cause in the UK, the bachelor's is three years.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.680]   - Yeah.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.500]   - But you can do one more year,
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.520]   which basically counts as a master's.
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.000]   So you graduate with one degree,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.640]   which is called a master's of engineering.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.880]   - Yeah.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.720]   - So I did that.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.120]   Actually, the reason I studied electrical engineering
[00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.640]   when I started, I hated software in high school.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.120]   I was like, this is something I'm never gonna do.
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.960]   - Yeah.
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.040]   - Didn't qualify as real engineering.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.040]   But, so the reason I applied to electrical engineering
[00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.200]   is that I'm a big car guy.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.320]   I love cars.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.440]   And at that time, around 2013, 2014,
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.440]   it was, all the big rage was starting to be
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.680]   these hybrid electric cars.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.960]   So I was like, cool, this is what I wanna do.
[00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.020]   I wanna build cars.
[00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.440]   So I go start the course.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.040]   Our first, very topically, our first project
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.140]   was building a little robot car that follows a line.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.840]   And oh my God, was it boring.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.240]   It was the worst thing I've ever had to work on.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.000]   So, and then at the same time,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.240]   we started this intro to programming course,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.080]   which I loved.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:13.800]   It was super basic C++.
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:14.640]   - Yeah.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.460]   - I was like, this is cool.
[00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:17.240]   There's this instant gratification that you get
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.760]   from just building a program, seeing it run,
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.360]   and then seeing that it works or it doesn't.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.640]   So all of a sudden, I started,
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.420]   what I started out with, I started hating,
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.260]   and what I thought I hated, I started loving.
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.160]   - I had a kind of similar journey
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:30.720]   with finance and programming.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.360]   I thought that I wasn't cut out to be a programmer.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.140]   So I went in the finance route for like 10 years,
[00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.320]   and then realized that software is eating the world,
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.520]   which is cliche, but true.
[00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.360]   - Yeah.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.680]   - And I find that a lot of triple E people
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.360]   actually end up this way.
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.400]   Maybe just 'cause software is easier than hardware.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.280]   - It's easier, and it's also just,
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   hardware's so abstract.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.880]   The only thing you're looking at is this PCB
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.800]   with a bunch of resistors and capacitors plugged in,
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.980]   and if you wanna build some board,
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.280]   you have to go ship it, send it.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.000]   - It's just the iteration process takes so long.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.300]   That being said, it's hugely valuable.
[00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.140]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.200]   - The improvements that hardware has driven,
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.300]   combined with software, obviously both huge,
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:11.880]   but hardware is also a huge part of this.
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.780]   - Yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:14.760]   And you having that background is something
[00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.120]   that I would probably never be able to pick up
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.040]   as a non, like outside of a university setting,
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.520]   'cause you just had to do all these courses.
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.620]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely.
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:26.840]   - Cool, and you actually called out that
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.680]   the Google Summer of Code was important to you
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.680]   in, on your LinkedIn, in terms of learning to code.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.120]   Is that, is that, no?
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.080]   Okay, we can cut that.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.360]   I don't know, it's on your LinkedIn somewhere.
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.200]   - Is it?
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.040]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.860]   - I think I did the--
[00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.700]   - You did some boot camp.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.540]   - It wasn't Google.
[00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.360]   - Okay, okay.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.500]   - It was, I forget the name,
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.900]   but if you have your LinkedIn open,
[00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.500]   I can briefly do a talk about it.
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.180]   But it was basically this like summer,
[00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.180]   I wanted to learn code,
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.780]   this was in my third year of university,
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.360]   so I did this boot camp in Oxford.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.200]   - Yes.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.300]   - It was called the Summer Academy of Code,
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.160]   and basically it was just like a one-week thing
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.860]   where you go from the basics of just building a web app,
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.860]   so all the basics of Node, React, JSX, all this.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.340]   I was already kind of familiar with it,
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.040]   so it was kind of a repeat, but it was good to have that.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.200]   It was super interesting, actually.
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:17.640]   I mean, funny story there is like when I was in Oxford,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.680]   I was having a great time.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.200]   At the time of that boot camp,
[00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:25.680]   I got this like, the worst gum infection ever.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.520]   - Okay.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.160]   - It was the worst pain I've ever been in,
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.240]   so as I'm doing this like one week in Oxford
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.620]   during the summer boot camp,
[00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.400]   I'm just in agonizing pain the entire time
[00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.240]   trying to learn about JSX or whatnot.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:41.120]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, that must have added extra difficulty.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.060]   I know it's such a pain to learn the JS ecosystem already.
[00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.440]   The reason I ask is I'm a career changer myself, right?
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:51.560]   I also got into tech through a boot camp.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.580]   I think that these support systems in each country, right?
[00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.260]   San Francisco has a lot of boot camps.
[00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:58.600]   New York is the boot camp that I went through,
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.000]   and you had the one in Oxford.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.960]   It's super important for people to ramp up,
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:05.960]   and I want to encourage more of those things
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.560]   and say that it's basically okay.
[00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:09.600]   It's not as prestigious as a degree,
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.440]   but it's probably more practical.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.400]   - Yeah, I think to everyone listening,
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.000]   yeah, I did a triple-A degree.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:15.960]   For those who don't know,
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.200]   that's electrical and electronic engineering.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.840]   Sounds similar enough to computer science.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:21.680]   It really isn't.
[00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.240]   Like, you still do some software,
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.920]   but the thing I do want to highlight is that all of,
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.760]   I would probably say half,
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:28.960]   and this is a number out of thin air,
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.120]   so don't quote me on it,
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.200]   half the software engineers probably are self-trained.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.480]   - They're self-taught, yeah, yeah.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.800]   - And that's kind of the beauty of this
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.080]   is that you can very much learn this by yourself.
[00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:38.080]   I do agree with you.
[00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.760]   Learning electronics by yourself is a little more difficult.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.400]   You just need the equipment,
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.720]   but something like software,
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.320]   it's super easy to get started.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.120]   - I mean, now I'm having to catch up on it
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.880]   because any time it comes to GPU power calculations
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.680]   and RAM calculations, it is electrical engineering,
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.360]   and so there's a lot of actual science in there.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.400]   You then spent four years at Palantir
[00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.680]   as a forward-deployed engineer.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:06.600]   I actually interviewed for that job.
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.760]   I didn't make it because I slept through my interview.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.600]   It's a different story,
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.680]   but forward-deployed engineer is a class,
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:14.120]   I think it's a role that Palantir invented.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:16.800]   - Yeah, look, Palantir's a great company.
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.960]   I think it's like there's a technical aspect
[00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:22.400]   and a motivational aspect that they look at
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.760]   when they're evaluating it.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.400]   I think they just have this interviewer process,
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.160]   or it kind of stabs them in the back sometimes
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:32.000]   because they tend to just get people
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:32.960]   who are super entrepreneurial,
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.360]   so the nature is they're always looking
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.440]   for the next challenge.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.800]   I think when I thought of it is everyone at Palantir,
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.080]   or most people at Palantir,
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:43.240]   were the kind of people to do the group project themselves.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.040]   You know what I mean?
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.880]   It's these kind of people.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:46.920]   They just want to be challenged,
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:50.160]   so the reality is that you end up having a lot of people
[00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:51.400]   just leave to start their own thing.
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.380]   That's the most common thing.
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.400]   You find someone at Palantir,
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.760]   and then you guys go and start your own thing.
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.040]   - And it's where you met Dimi.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.880]   - It's where I met Dimi, yeah.
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:00.040]   We actually started on the same day.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.880]   Matti also started Vigdir on the same time,
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.040]   not the same day as us.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.000]   So really, the thing that made it super hard
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.240]   to leave Palantir was just the people.
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:11.740]   You're working with such a high caliber of people,
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:15.920]   but interpret that as real,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   but also just people you can be friends with.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.520]   So I still have a lot of friends from there.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.840]   The job itself, Forward Deployment Engineer,
[00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.760]   is a super interesting job
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:26.360]   because it is kind of at this intersection
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.920]   of being an engineer, so a software engineer,
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:31.200]   but also still doing business-related things.
[00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:33.680]   - Yeah, solutions, architects maybe.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.600]   - Yeah, so part of the job was a solutions architect.
[00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.320]   Part of the job was reviewing contracts.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:38.640]   Part of the job was doing sales.
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:40.120]   Part of the job was coding things.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.200]   Part of the job was interacting.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.040]   So many different things,
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.960]   and I think that is a really good foundation
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.840]   for someone who does want to start something in the future.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.920]   You just do everything.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:50.620]   - So kind of an endorsement of that job
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:51.460]   if people want to--
[00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:52.360]   - Huge endorsement of that job.
[00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.320]   - Okay, excellent, amazing.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.360]   Yeah, Palantir is surprisingly strong
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.680]   here in the London tech circles.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   I have a number of friends who are all ex-Palantir.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.120]   - I think it's actually the biggest offices in London.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:04.800]   - Surprising, because I think of it
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   as like a US defense company.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.800]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.240]   - Then you started Moonshot for nine months,
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:12.080]   which is pretty important in your journey.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.600]   I'll bring it up to Wondercraft,
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:16.040]   and you started Wondercraft in April of this year,
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:18.920]   and it's been about five months going through YC
[00:09:18.920 --> 00:09:21.080]   in the winter batch.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:21.920]   - Summer of '22.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.500]   - Summer of '22 batch.
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.340]   Okay, cool.
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:26.200]   What is Wondercraft?
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.040]   - Nice, Wondercraft's a podcast builder
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.000]   that uses hyper-realistic AI voices to create podcasts
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.080]   and make that whole podcast creation process super simple.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.160]   So a super simple example is you can,
[00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.600]   you publish a bunch of blogs.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.980]   You can take that blog, put it in there,
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:40.800]   it'll just convert it to an audio-friendly format
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.840]   that people can listen to.
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.360]   It's just sometimes it's a bit more efficient
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.720]   to listen to things rather than read them.
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:49.400]   I gave the very, if you want to think of it specifically
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.640]   as what it is at the current instance in time,
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.000]   that's what it is.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.400]   What does it strive to be is a little slightly different,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.440]   because what it really strives to be
[00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.440]   is it strives to be this platform
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:03.080]   with the mission of expanding access to content.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.680]   - Okay.
[00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.280]   - And I mean this in a variety of different ways.
[00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:09.560]   Some people just are able to consume content.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.860]   We have this whole debate in education.
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:12.960]   It's like, are you a visual learner or an audio learner?
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:13.800]   What do you do?
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.600]   People just consume content better in different ways.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.200]   I'm a visual learner.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.120]   I need to see things.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.840]   So for me, actually, it's sometimes a little better
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:20.900]   to read the blog.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.520]   But if we're just talking about,
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.860]   I want to get a lot of information,
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.080]   podcasts are great because you can just do them
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.480]   while doing something else.
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.240]   There's a reason that podcast functionality
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.520]   is so natively embedded in all these smart speakers.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.200]   It's just 'cause you're doing anything at home,
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.620]   just put on a podcast.
[00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:40.520]   So really what we're trying to do is,
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.040]   podcasts is the first instantiation of that,
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.760]   which is how do we expand access to content?
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.740]   But it expands so much more, right?
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:52.960]   Instead of just going to, I don't know,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:55.200]   we talked about this blog to podcast.
[00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:56.880]   You can go blog to video.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:58.240]   You can go podcast to blog.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.680]   You can go podcast to Twitter.
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:02.180]   The permutations are, frankly, endless.
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.640]   Basically, it depends on how many platforms there are
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.640]   that people consume things on.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.120]   But that's essentially what we do.
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:10.420]   The use cases for this are pretty interesting.
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:15.280]   The one that we just see immediate value in
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.120]   is just this ability to translate the content
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.460]   that you already have into other forms of content.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.080]   If we just stick with that blog post example again,
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:27.040]   you've written, so a lot of companies
[00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:29.040]   might have this content team that focuses a lot
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:30.760]   on producing quality blog posts.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.960]   Blog posts, they're good for SEO and whatnot,
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:37.480]   but they're not, sometimes they don't really achieve
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:39.880]   a specific goal or outcome that you want.
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.440]   One thing we see that is really useful for podcasts
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.720]   is they actually carry a lot more weight
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.280]   in credentializing you as a thought leader
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.080]   or your company as a thought leader.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:54.360]   But like, we spent the last 50 minutes
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.360]   trying to set up this room to record the podcast.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:11:57.720]   So it's not easy.
[00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:00.120]   It's a very synchronous process.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.680]   Me and you have to find the time to go and sit here
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.400]   and record this, you have to come up with questions,
[00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:05.920]   I have to come up with answers.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.160]   But this ability to actually just take the content
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:12.080]   that you have and transform it, it's pretty powerful.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.800]   There's a lot of other use cases as well,
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.960]   which is just like, podcasts really,
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:20.760]   all they are is like, define a podcast.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.640]   The line between, or the difference between
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.920]   an audiobook and a podcast, I guess,
[00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:27.080]   just the format and the length.
[00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.360]   - It's an MP3 on a RSS feed.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:32.120]   - It's an MP3 with someone or something speaking, right?
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:33.760]   - I've actually played around a lot with this stuff,
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.680]   by the way, so I've done music-only podcasts
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:37.520]   where you just listen.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:40.200]   Tiesto has been podcasting for 15 years,
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.880]   every single week, just DJing in his house.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.120]   - It's just basically a radio show.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.960]   - It's great.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.780]   - It's just a radio show.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:46.620]   - Async radio.
[00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:50.000]   - Yeah, so it's super interesting.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.200]   But podcasts, okay, ignore the word podcast
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.040]   and just think of what we do,
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.840]   which is we help you create audio content.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.120]   Super valuable for anyone who just needs that.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.400]   If you can imagine a world in which,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:02.240]   I don't know how to call them,
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   like Calm or Headspace or any of these things,
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.800]   they can do a lot of their meditation like that
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.920]   super quickly.
[00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:08.520]   What you can get to is a point where you're doing
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:10.920]   these super personalized things, right?
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:12.200]   Because you just have the ability
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:14.200]   to scale the content production so quickly.
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:15.640]   Same with educators.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:17.120]   I think there's actually, at this point,
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:18.760]   there's a few YouTube channels at this point
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.560]   that are all based on synthetic voices
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:22.640]   that produce a ton of educational content.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.080]   - Any ones that do a good job?
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.640]   - I do, I just don't remember the name.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.480]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.040]   You can send it to me later, I'll stick to it.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.880]   We can use Wondercraft to synthesize some extra clips.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:34.440]   - Yeah.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:38.680]   Now that being said, the problem with podcasts sometimes
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:40.640]   is, it's not sometimes, actually.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:44.880]   Podcasts just have a slightly slow adoption rate.
[00:13:44.880 --> 00:13:45.920]   - Yes.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:47.640]   - You're listening to a thing for an hour, right?
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:50.840]   Like, we, as a generation, don't have attention spans.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:52.440]   It's the time and the attention span.
[00:13:52.440 --> 00:13:54.800]   Like, TikTok, give it to me in 30 seconds,
[00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.160]   rethink why clips are taking over.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.280]   - 30's too long, man.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.760]   - 30's too long, 10 seconds.
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:00.440]   10 seconds with captions, I need to read it,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:01.280]   and good.
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:03.640]   So what we also do is actually,
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.880]   and this is kind of still a beta feature
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:05.720]   and we're working to improve it,
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.800]   but we also let you take that podcast
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.560]   and then clip it into a video
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.200]   that you can go and share on socials, right?
[00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.360]   So it's this ability to take one form of content,
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.720]   produce it in a bunch of different ways
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.280]   that serve different purposes
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.320]   and be able to distribute it, basically.
[00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.800]   - Yeah, excellent.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   I want to go through features
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.720]   so that people have a high-level overview
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.880]   of what you offer.
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:30.440]   So I think at the core, it is basically two things.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.000]   One is, you generate scripts,
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.280]   and that's optional, obviously,
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.680]   if you want to just write the script yourself,
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:37.640]   you can write the script yourself,
[00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:41.080]   but I think most of your users would generate a script.
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.400]   And then two is, from that script,
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:47.280]   you use AI voices, currently using 11 apps.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:48.720]   Is that the rough flow?
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.320]   That's the really core, basic--
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.160]   - That's the core, basic.
[00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:52.640]   Obviously, there's a lot of plumbing on top of it,
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   but that's the core.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:56.360]   - And then you offer video clips for YouTube.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.080]   You offer 28 languages that you can produce.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.240]   You offer show notes production and podcast hosting, too.
[00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.280]   So they don't have to host it on Anchor.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.520]   Don't host it on Anchor, by the way,
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.400]   if people don't host it on Spotify.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:11.200]   Don't host it on Apple Podcasts.
[00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.800]   These people don't respect the RSS feed.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.160]   Anyway, I have very strong feelings
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.920]   about preserving the sanctity of the RSS feed
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.560]   for open podcasting, and all these Spotify's of the world
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:24.360]   want to close the podcasting ecosystem.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.360]   So I have this tirade about them.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.560]   But yeah, those are your top-level features
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.160]   on your landing page.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.320]   Anything that you highlight to go deeper on?
[00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.420]   - Yeah, I think those are the top-level ones.
[00:15:35.420 --> 00:15:37.880]   There's also, it's basically just a lot of
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:40.240]   also ancillary tooling that goes around all of this
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.680]   to just make it easier.
[00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.360]   The goal is like, every time we speak to a customer
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.660]   or someone who's thinking about it,
[00:15:45.660 --> 00:15:47.880]   they're like, yeah, literally yesterday
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.720]   I was speaking to a potential customer,
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.400]   and they're like, yeah, I just, you know,
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:52.760]   I want to make sure this isn't a distraction
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:54.480]   'cause we don't have that much time to do this.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.320]   - Yeah.
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.140]   - And really the whole point is that
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:57.580]   this doesn't take time, right?
[00:15:57.580 --> 00:15:59.600]   The whole point is to provide all the rails
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.880]   that make this not take time.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:03.400]   And this comes with a million different things, right?
[00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.260]   Like we, you know, sometimes the AI voices
[00:16:06.260 --> 00:16:07.720]   don't really know how to pronounce a word.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.060]   So we have a pronunciation feature.
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:10.920]   Go and define how you want that word pronounced,
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.000]   and it'll take care of it.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.760]   If you are, we obviously have that hierarchy
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:17.360]   of like a podcast, an episode,
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.200]   and then all of that gets published in RSS feed
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.560]   that you can just upload to Spotify,
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.960]   and we'll host that for you.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:25.720]   But what you also have is just like, you know,
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.120]   maybe you want some defaults, right?
[00:16:28.120 --> 00:16:29.920]   Every podcast needs some defaults.
[00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:30.760]   - Intro, outros.
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.320]   - Intro, outros, the music, the speakers.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.160]   - Yeah.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   - We're working on adding templates
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.600]   for the kind of podcast that you're doing.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.360]   Instead of it just being this narration style,
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.940]   you can just do an interview style podcast.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:42.260]   And a few more features,
[00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:43.640]   but basically there's a lot of like tooling
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:47.140]   that just makes this a very usable product for podcasts.
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:47.980]   - Yeah.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:49.940]   And is it, for stitching these things,
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:52.760]   I've actually often thought about making my own,
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:54.540]   is it just FFmpeg and then like some flags
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.700]   and just stitch stuff together?
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:57.940]   - Yeah, I mean, obviously as a startup,
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:16:59.900]   you kind of want to just like do something quickly.
[00:16:59.900 --> 00:17:01.540]   So we're not like reinventing the wheel.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:03.700]   - Yeah, like YouTube uses FFmpeg, you know?
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.840]   Like it's, FFmpeg is a workhorse of anything.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:07.780]   - Yeah.
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.620]   - Multimedia.
[00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:09.660]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:10.500]   - Cool.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:12.380]   You list some use cases that I just want to,
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.060]   you know, still stay high level.
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:16.500]   Businesses, newsletter.
[00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:18.620]   So businesses like Trader Joe's,
[00:17:18.620 --> 00:17:21.120]   and you seem to have done a big push there.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.660]   - Well, so we didn't do this for them, right?
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.620]   It was just kind of a case study,
[00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:26.220]   but it's super interesting when,
[00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.180]   apparently Trader Joe's claims
[00:17:28.180 --> 00:17:29.660]   that one of their best marketing techniques
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:30.620]   was their podcast.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:31.460]   - Yeah.
[00:17:31.460 --> 00:17:32.340]   - Right, so first of all,
[00:17:32.340 --> 00:17:33.780]   if you're just thinking about this as a use case,
[00:17:33.780 --> 00:17:35.160]   podcasts are really useful.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.000]   - Yeah.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.080]   - I think your follow-up question,
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.120]   which is like, you know,
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:41.520]   maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here,
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:45.320]   but you know, okay, companies will do podcasts,
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.160]   probably 99% of the time they'll be shit.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.000]   - Yes.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.240]   - So what's the trick?
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.060]   - Yeah.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.120]   - Well, Trader Joe's did a super interesting one.
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:51.960]   - Yeah.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.720]   - They didn't do this generic corporate speak of like,
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.940]   oh, Trader Joe's is so great,
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.040]   let's talk about apples or fruit or whatever.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.560]   No, they actually just went into like,
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:01.360]   you know, the mechanics of the super interesting,
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.920]   niche stuff about their industry.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:04.680]   And that's something that gets people listening, right?
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.320]   You want, I find it super interesting,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:08.120]   just from a curiosity perspective.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:10.920]   So yeah, like that's an example, right?
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.660]   You can, podcasts are actually really useful
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.800]   to just like get people, you know,
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:16.720]   it helps you with brand building, frankly.
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:19.960]   - Yeah, and Trader Joe's I think went really hard on it.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:21.320]   I think they got some of the,
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:22.640]   quite the senior management involved.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:23.480]   - Yeah.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.160]   - They told some stories behind
[00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.760]   some very beloved food selections.
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:30.040]   I listened to the podcast, so it was pretty fun.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.520]   And they also promoted it on their receipts.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.360]   - Yeah.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.920]   - So you guys featured that on your blog post,
[00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.080]   and I thought it was pretty cool.
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:37.640]   So I think it's well done by them,
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.320]   but also clearly not done by AI yet.
[00:18:40.320 --> 00:18:41.160]   - Yeah.
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:43.960]   - But still, I think that the use case is there.
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:45.120]   I'll just kind of go through the list.
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.920]   Newsletter creators, you said you have
[00:18:46.920 --> 00:18:48.720]   a hundred creators publishing with you?
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:50.680]   - Yeah, so, you know, the interesting thing is
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:54.120]   if you write a newsletter, I mean, I don't know,
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.280]   my email's flooded with newsletters at the moment.
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:18:58.000]   Sometimes I just want like the recap of it.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.240]   Again, audio form is just, for some people, easier.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.200]   If you're on, you know, commuting or whatever,
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:05.200]   you can just listen to it.
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.120]   So a lot of folks actually just convert their newsletter.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   It takes like two minutes.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:08.960]   - Yeah.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:11.400]   - Put the text in there, voila, you have an audio version
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.960]   of your newsletter that you just published to Spotify.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:13.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:17.680]   And I am a newsletter writer, and I clicked around
[00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:21.280]   and wanted to basically just chuck my RSS feed in there.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.120]   - Yeah.
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.920]   - And I think I gave that feedback exactly to you guys
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.720]   for like four months ago, or three months ago,
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:28.480]   and it looks like you've already shipped it.
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.860]   - Yep, well, I'm announcing it basically here today,
[00:19:30.860 --> 00:19:35.860]   which is we, part of generally what we're building
[00:19:35.860 --> 00:19:38.020]   is the ability to just, you know,
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:40.600]   we want to make this useful for creators of all kinds.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.760]   So obviously, if we're, you know,
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.040]   we're helping you translate your content
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:44.240]   from one form to the other,
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:45.320]   I want to make this as seamless as possible.
[00:19:45.320 --> 00:19:48.740]   So as of today, we've actually built a Zapier integration,
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.600]   and we have a bunch of blogs on our website
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.080]   to kind of show you how to do this.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:55.280]   But what you can now do is as soon as you publish
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:57.800]   a newsletter, it goes on your RSS feed,
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.220]   it will pick up the newsletter from your RSS feed
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:02.900]   automatically, and just publish an episode for you.
[00:20:02.900 --> 00:20:05.180]   - Yeah, question, what if I change something
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:06.060]   after I publish?
[00:20:06.060 --> 00:20:07.220]   - So you don't have to publish.
[00:20:07.220 --> 00:20:09.980]   It'll basically just generate, do all the work for you,
[00:20:09.980 --> 00:20:11.900]   and then you can go in and kind of modify it a little bit,
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:12.740]   and then publish.
[00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.560]   - Makes sense.
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:15.220]   - We also have scheduled publishing so that you can,
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.980]   I don't know, maybe you want to release it
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:17.820]   a few hours later.
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.020]   - Yeah, the professional podcasters that I've spoken to
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.080]   say that that is very important.
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.260]   I personally don't care.
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:25.900]   Like, it shows up in my feed or not.
[00:20:25.900 --> 00:20:27.500]   I don't care when it drops.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:30.240]   Anyway, so you do want to basically time it,
[00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.120]   like if you're basically targeting a commute
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:35.560]   for the US time zone, you want to be like,
[00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.620]   oh, 8 a.m. Pacific for people driving into work.
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.340]   Then you show up at the top of the reverse chronological
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:43.600]   feed.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.820]   I feel like that's too much tactics.
[00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:47.240]   - You know, and that's a good point.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.640]   I think it depends a little bit on your audience
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:50.680]   and what you're building, but I do think,
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:53.240]   so I don't want to undermine the importance
[00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.040]   of consistency in podcasting.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.020]   Whether that consistency literally translates
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:03.880]   into I publish at 8 a.m. every single day,
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.520]   or I just publish every single day,
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.080]   or whatever, there is a huge importance
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.160]   in just making sure that what you're publishing
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.680]   is always, it's there.
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.840]   People need to know that your brand
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:14.580]   is constantly pushing stuff.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.720]   - Yeah, so a lot of people who talk to me
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.520]   are interested in what's my advice on content creation.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.800]   Yeah, at least once a week.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.800]   Whatever you do, and I don't care when you do it.
[00:21:22.800 --> 00:21:24.880]   Just do it once a week, put something out.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:28.160]   But I do notice that, specifically in the podcasting field,
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.480]   and you talk about this in the next point,
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:32.760]   daily podcasting is the meta game
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.520]   that is, I think, doing extremely well.
[00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.880]   Especially because I think the Apple podcast list
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:38.960]   biases for daily.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.560]   Because, obviously, the downloads will be higher.
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.480]   So daily podcasters kind of rank higher more,
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.920]   and obviously, because you're daily,
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:48.080]   you also do shorter podcasts, which guarantees
[00:21:48.080 --> 00:21:50.440]   that more people listen to you.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.400]   - Yeah, yeah, I think the fact that,
[00:21:52.400 --> 00:21:54.680]   so obviously we do the Hacker News recap.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.280]   The fact that we did that, and that it is daily,
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.640]   actually just helped us reach
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:01.600]   that top 30 type of podcast on Spotify.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:03.760]   - Yeah, that was mostly 'cause you were on HN, right?
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:05.280]   - We did launch, but obviously the fact
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.080]   that you just publish a lot of content,
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:08.080]   you're just gonna get a lot more,
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.520]   like it's a statistics thing, right?
[00:22:09.520 --> 00:22:10.360]   Obviously, I think they do it
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.000]   by total time listened as well.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.840]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.240]   - But the fact that it's daily, it's just not overwhelming.
[00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:18.400]   Again, we don't have that much of an attention span anymore.
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.760]   - Yeah, yeah, that's true, that's true.
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:22.720]   Yeah, I love it, I listen to it every day.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:26.080]   Okay, so internal podcasts for daily memos.
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.080]   I think Spotify might have internal podcasts.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.480]   I don't know of any other famous company
[00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.180]   that has internal podcasts, but this is interesting.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:36.200]   - It's interesting, 'cause I think here we're basically
[00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.440]   just like, again, we're overloading the term podcast.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.720]   What is a podcast, right?
[00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.520]   It's like, I think the origin of the word
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:43.640]   is like iPod broadcast.
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:44.480]   - Yes.
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:45.840]   - Right?
[00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:47.040]   I don't know what that means, right?
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.720]   It's just like, again, it's on-demand radio
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.640]   if we just take that word, but really the idea is like,
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.280]   again, if we wanna enable access to content,
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:56.760]   and I think part of that is just like
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.160]   efficient information delivery.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:01.880]   So communication in a company is like,
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.960]   we all know the perils of how hard it is sometimes
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.760]   if you're a big company to communicate,
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.560]   and I think that kind of stuff is super interesting.
[00:23:08.560 --> 00:23:09.800]   I think one particular use case,
[00:23:09.800 --> 00:23:11.400]   which is like the internal,
[00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.640]   you use that just to share information quickly,
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:17.000]   and I don't know if you have the next one kind of on there,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:17.840]   or maybe I'm--
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:18.680]   - It's okay, we can jump around.
[00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:22.520]   - There's like a slightly different twist to it,
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.720]   which I think we can enable with the Zapier integration
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:28.120]   that we've built, which is this, I don't know,
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.640]   I imagine sometimes, for example, I'm a PM at a tech firm,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.920]   a lot of things is going on on my team.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:36.880]   I want to just do a quick recap, right?
[00:23:36.880 --> 00:23:39.560]   I don't know, some people will do that.
[00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:41.480]   If you're really good at keeping state
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.440]   on some of the different SaaS products that exist,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.480]   yeah, good, you can just get a recap there.
[00:23:45.480 --> 00:23:47.280]   I think something that might be interesting is like,
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:51.640]   can we look at your GitHub issues, PRs, whatever,
[00:23:51.640 --> 00:23:52.800]   and whenever there's a status change,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.880]   kind of bake that into something
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.520]   that you then consume as an audio?
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:57.520]   - Yeah.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:23:59.600]   - We have like, you can do something similar like that
[00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.120]   with Zapier, it's actually super interesting
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.520]   because it just saves you time.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:05.080]   You just get on your commute to work,
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:06.720]   be like, these are the things that happened today.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.560]   This PR was closed, we added this feature,
[00:24:08.560 --> 00:24:10.360]   blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, right?
[00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.520]   And similarly, you can think of something like that
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:15.280]   for email, obviously the privacy implications there
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:16.560]   are just a little bit more work,
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:19.000]   but like, there's actually all of a sudden like,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.600]   yeah, cool, I can actually consume a lot of the content
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.200]   that I historically have never been able to listen to
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.080]   now by audio.
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.080]   - Yeah.
[00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:29.400]   Yeah, it opens up different forms of learning,
[00:24:29.400 --> 00:24:30.680]   as you mentioned.
[00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.840]   And then finally, I'm skipping ahead a little bit.
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:35.280]   Podcast studios are using you.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:37.920]   So you said you onboarded 10 studios.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:39.960]   What do studios use you for?
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:41.080]   - A couple of interesting things, actually.
[00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:46.080]   So studios, like, they, podcasting is like,
[00:24:46.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   book publishers in the sense that there's a million genres
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:49.240]   at this point.
[00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.840]   - Yeah.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:52.720]   - When we think of podcasts, I think we typically think
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.040]   of like, the interview style one.
[00:24:55.040 --> 00:24:56.360]   So they're not necessarily using it for that,
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.920]   but it's a lot more for like, two things generally.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.480]   One is actually just like, producing the content out there
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:05.040]   that is more narration style format.
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:07.000]   So you can think of something like a kid's podcast
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.560]   that teaches them about, you know, I don't know,
[00:25:09.560 --> 00:25:11.800]   countries or whatever it is, or you know,
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.040]   basic science topics.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:17.160]   We do that just completely through us, right?
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:18.920]   Obviously we produce the sound, we produce the music.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.040]   If they need a little bit more editing,
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:23.120]   they can just take that to their editors and do it.
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.080]   The other thing that's really interesting is it actually
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:29.040]   lets them also build out a demo spec
[00:25:29.040 --> 00:25:32.200]   of what a more involved podcast can look like.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.040]   - I see.
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:35.400]   - Right, so, you know, you were coming up with the idea
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.480]   for this podcast, you kind of want to show people
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.360]   or some of your guests what it's going to sound like,
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:40.760]   and whip something up.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:42.520]   And I think for them, it's obviously really important
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.080]   because the way they operate, at least,
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:45.680]   is like there's, you know, people are pushing
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.000]   for a different podcast.
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:49.200]   And then you get sign-off to pursue it.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.320]   So you need to kind of show just like,
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.440]   what's this going to sound like?
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.280]   - Yeah, excellent.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.200]   Awesome.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:56.480]   I think that's a really good overview.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.960]   Then you also produce three in-house podcasts.
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.080]   - Yeah.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:04.120]   - Hacker News Recap, Product Hunt Daily, and PGSA.
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.720]   - So we dropped the Product Hunt Daily.
[00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.120]   - Oh, okay, it's still on your landing page.
[00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:09.520]   - Yeah, we launched it, but we like,
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:11.560]   we don't push anything new there.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:12.840]   - No interest in Product Hunts?
[00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:13.760]   - We didn't see too much traction.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:14.600]   I think Product Hunts--
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.760]   - RAP Product Hunts, Alec.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:17.680]   (laughs)
[00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:19.280]   No, so yeah, tell me--
[00:26:19.280 --> 00:26:23.000]   - So we do the Hacker News Recap and the PGSA,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.600]   I think are the two most popular ones.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   - Yeah.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:27.240]   - We're constantly experimenting with new internal,
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.800]   or like podcasts that we publish.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:29.640]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:32.160]   What are your other, you can tease a little bit.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.000]   What are you thinking about?
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:33.840]   - Tease a little bit?
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.720]   Well, I really like Reddit.
[00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.560]   - Yeah.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:38.640]   - I'd love to listen to some of the Reddit things
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:40.760]   going on there, but instead of like reading them.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:41.600]   - Yeah.
[00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:42.440]   - It's always just a notification that I get,
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.560]   I'm like, "Ooh, this sounds interesting."
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:45.560]   But I don't know, you can do it like per subreddit
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.480]   that you care about.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.320]   - Yeah.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:48.160]   - A few things like that.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:48.980]   I love Life Pro Tips.
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:50.400]   - Yeah, I see.
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:52.480]   - Like super interesting things, or Wall Street Bets,
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.720]   or whatever you're into.
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:56.240]   - Yeah, well, the problem with these things
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.400]   is that a lot of them could involve images and memes,
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.600]   which you cannot consume.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.640]   - Well, yes, we cannot consume.
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:06.600]   This is like a simple, we can't consume that at the moment,
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:11.160]   but maybe a few weeks down the line
[00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:13.200]   when that video feature of ours gets a little better,
[00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.720]   you can actually start shipping it like that.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.560]   - Okay.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.400]   - Anyway.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.220]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:27:17.220 --> 00:27:19.440]   And so, and I'll just feed you an idea.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:21.560]   To keep up on AI, a lot of stuff actually happens
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:24.080]   in Discord, and there's way too many Discords.
[00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:25.800]   - Way too many, and they're way too active.
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.400]   - Yes, so I've actually built a little feed for myself
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.880]   that scrapes a bunch of Discords.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.720]   - Yeah.
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:33.120]   - And creates a daily newsletter for myself.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.960]   - Amazing.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:37.160]   - I have thought about turning it into an audio feed,
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:40.880]   but, and this is the problem for Wondercraft,
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:42.160]   I read better, I read faster.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.880]   I scan up and down faster than I listen, right?
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.760]   And there's just too much noise in Discord
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.640]   for me to listen as audio format.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:52.000]   Your Hacker News stuff is very high signal
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.880]   because, obviously, you're folding, right?
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.280]   - 'Cause we haven't done the curation like Hacker News did.
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:58.920]   - Exactly, that's why it's guaranteed to be good,
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:02.780]   whereas for Discord, it's a bunch of junk.
[00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.420]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:28:04.420 --> 00:28:05.700]   But I do think there's something similar,
[00:28:05.700 --> 00:28:08.460]   like Reddit also does the curation.
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.940]   It's not us who's doing it, right?
[00:28:09.940 --> 00:28:10.780]   - Yes, yes.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.660]   - If you're only the hot posts.
[00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.300]   - Still a little bit noisier, so I don't know if you know,
[00:28:14.300 --> 00:28:17.420]   I was a moderator of the React to Reddit for four years.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:18.620]   - Nice.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.460]   - So I've seen a bunch of stuff,
[00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:23.100]   and I know it's noisier than a Hacker News,
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:24.580]   but still pretty good.
[00:28:24.580 --> 00:28:25.820]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:27.340]   So we do Hacker News, we do PJ Essays.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.860]   I think PJ Essays are also super interesting.
[00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:30.380]   I listen to them all the time 'cause I,
[00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:31.420]   well, first of all, I actually think
[00:28:31.420 --> 00:28:32.580]   they're pretty well produced.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:34.060]   We do a good job, like, I don't know,
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.540]   if we're quoting someone, we'll use a different voice.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:38.020]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.660]   - I think it's just well produced.
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.700]   And I also think, you know, the essays are so seminal
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:45.180]   to like, everyone in startups reads them.
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:48.380]   - Yeah, it's actually got me to read more PJ Essays
[00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.860]   than I would have otherwise, so mission accomplished.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.300]   - I don't know if it was the last one,
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.140]   well, the time we published this.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:53.980]   - No, How to Do Great Work.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:56.140]   - How to Do Great, that was a one-hour podcast.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:57.100]   - Yeah, oh my God.
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:58.780]   - No one, I could, I did not read it,
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:28:59.620]   I just had to listen to it.
[00:28:59.620 --> 00:29:00.460]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:01.940]   - And I think actually, if I'm being honest,
[00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.300]   I think the motivation for PJ Essays
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:04.900]   was just like, I need this.
[00:29:04.900 --> 00:29:06.700]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:06.700 --> 00:29:08.540]   For that one, if it's like one hour,
[00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:12.860]   I would have actually appreciated like a segmentation,
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:14.940]   or like, hey, high level, you know,
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.500]   I know this is about to be an hour,
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:18.380]   but like, there are three main high level things,
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:19.540]   and then keep that in your mind,
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:21.760]   and then go like, part one, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.600]   Part two, blah, blah, blah.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.220]   - I think we, so we do that to some extent,
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.700]   and like, we produce like, chapters, I guess.
[00:29:26.700 --> 00:29:27.540]   - Yeah.
[00:29:27.540 --> 00:29:29.300]   - So you can just look at them.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:31.220]   Probably could do a better job like, introducing it,
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:33.980]   but we do try to like, not play around with the PJ Essays.
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.620]   - For sure, yeah, I mean, it's,
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:37.060]   you know how much work he puts into those things.
[00:29:37.060 --> 00:29:38.780]   - So we just kind of ship it as is.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:39.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.140]   Actually, I'll tell you about one more that,
[00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.140]   one more daily, not daily,
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.900]   but frequent AI-generated podcast
[00:29:44.900 --> 00:29:46.060]   that I listen to, apart from you guys,
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:47.860]   which is PapersRed.ai,
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:49.640]   and I'll recommend it to anyone listening as well.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:50.480]   - Super interesting, actually.
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.940]   I've come across it. - You've come across that.
[00:29:51.940 --> 00:29:54.900]   It's by this guy, Rob, and I've tried to look him down.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:56.860]   He doesn't want to be found.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:29:58.560]   Anyway, but the selections are very good.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:00.300]   I think you guys could do a better job than him.
[00:30:00.300 --> 00:30:01.140]   - Yeah.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:02.100]   - It's-
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.700]   - A job, Rob.
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:06.420]   - Well, as you can see, it converts PDFs to podcasts, right?
[00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:10.420]   And the problem with academic PDFs is a lot of references.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.340]   You know, like, "Buy et al. 2022,"
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:14.260]   and then like, headers, and then a table,
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:15.880]   and then you know, like, reads the table
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:18.200]   when you don't need to read the table, you know?
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:19.040]   That kind of stuff.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.660]   I think better engineering there from you guys
[00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:26.460]   would beat him, and I need that, so feature request.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.300]   (laughs)
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:29.040]   - Working on it, working on it.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:31.020]   - Okay, the final feature-related thing
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.660]   is the thing that we're announcing today as we release it.
[00:30:33.660 --> 00:30:35.300]   - Which we're super, super excited about,
[00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:37.780]   but Wondercraft now does video translation.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:38.620]   - Okay. - And dubbing.
[00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:41.060]   - Okay, why do people want that?
[00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:42.260]   - Again, let's go back to our mission.
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:44.580]   We're trying to expand access to content.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:46.980]   I think, don't quote me on this again,
[00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:48.480]   like, I don't know who actually knows the internet,
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:51.340]   but like, 60% of the internet is in English.
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.620]   You know, what if you don't speak English?
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:55.660]   You're automatically disbarred or kind of excluded
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:30:58.140]   from all the content that's produced.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:31:00.820]   And thanks to all the advances
[00:31:00.820 --> 00:31:01.940]   that have just recently been made,
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.140]   we can actually make this,
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:05.540]   it's super easy to dub this in other languages.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.840]   So we're super happy to announce this feature.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:11.140]   We're super excited, we've been working on it
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.780]   for a really long time.
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.340]   But now basically, everyone, go on our platform,
[00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:18.220]   upload your podcast episode, and see the dub for yourself.
[00:31:18.220 --> 00:31:20.820]   We'll use your voices, we'll completely convert it,
[00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:22.180]   make sure it's aligned with the,
[00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:23.660]   if you have video, we'll make sure it's aligned.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:24.700]   - Yeah.
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:25.940]   - And voila, just publish it.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:27.740]   - And specifically for video,
[00:31:27.740 --> 00:31:30.660]   so like, obviously the thing that's going around
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:33.980]   is the hey, Jen thing, which changes your lips.
[00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.820]   - So we don't do lip sync at the moment.
[00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.260]   Could be another feature that we work on.
[00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:39.040]   - Yeah, because you're primarily podcasting,
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.100]   which is no video.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.380]   - Well, primarily no video,
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.580]   but I think we still basically,
[00:31:42.580 --> 00:31:44.660]   if you do have a video, we'll still align it
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:45.500]   to the chunks that--
[00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:46.340]   - You still align it.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:47.740]   Okay, so the hard problem is the aligning.
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:50.420]   - The alignment is the difficult bit, you're right.
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:51.260]   The actual, like--
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:52.980]   - It's with all things in AI.
[00:31:52.980 --> 00:31:55.860]   - Yeah, again, overloading the word alignment.
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.980]   - Um, we don't do the lip sync.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:58.820]   - Yeah.
[00:31:58.820 --> 00:31:59.660]   - Yet.
[00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:00.480]   - It's kind of a gimmick, yeah.
[00:32:00.480 --> 00:32:01.940]   - It's like, it's not super necessary.
[00:32:01.940 --> 00:32:03.380]   If you're really just like listening to a podcast
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.540]   and you actively want to listen to it
[00:32:04.540 --> 00:32:05.600]   in a different language,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.440]   then you're more interested in the content.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:07.900]   - So what are you aligning to?
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:11.420]   - Basically the chunks where the speakers are speaking.
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:12.820]   So you won't have an instance
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:17.180]   where you'll have me as the dub speaking
[00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:19.320]   while the camera is on you.
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.160]   - Ah.
[00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:21.060]   - Right, so it's basically just like,
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:21.900]   the speaker turns around the audio.
[00:32:21.900 --> 00:32:23.580]   - So you will like, if it happens to be
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.600]   a little bit longer, you'll speed it up a little bit.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.940]   - We do a little bit of, you know, trickery there.
[00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:28.780]   - Yeah.
[00:32:28.780 --> 00:32:29.940]   - But we get it aligned so that when you're speaking,
[00:32:29.940 --> 00:32:31.680]   it's you, and when I'm speaking, it's me.
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:32.860]   - Okay, cool.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   And then, one more thing before we go into like,
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.220]   the building Wondercraft side,
[00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.820]   building a company and being a founder, all that stuff.
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:43.820]   You said, you want to ride this wave.
[00:32:43.820 --> 00:32:47.380]   You said this dubbing thing was very important to you.
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:52.380]   And I think this is a core stress of a lot of AI founders,
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.180]   which is, how do I keep up?
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:56.940]   How do I pick what trend to ride
[00:32:56.940 --> 00:32:59.420]   and be like, very, very quick on?
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.900]   And what do I ignore?
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:02.380]   So just bring me through your thought process
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.420]   on like, why this is the one to really pressure
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:06.980]   and build quickly.
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:10.580]   - It's a really good question,
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:12.100]   'cause I don't think it has a,
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.100]   I think you'll get 19 different answers.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:16.220]   I'll ramble a little bit.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.700]   - Yeah, chain of thought.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:21.860]   - Dubbing, you know,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.460]   it's something that I want.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:29.860]   There is content that just exists that I can't consume
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.060]   just because it's not there.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:35.780]   I'm lucky enough to speak, you know, three, four languages,
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.100]   so I can listen to some subset of podcasts
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.560]   that exists all around the world.
[00:33:39.560 --> 00:33:42.060]   Let's not even say podcasts, let's just say content.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:45.340]   But the rest of it is kind of excluded for me.
[00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.420]   I have no context on what's going for it.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:51.300]   And I think that problem is just multiplied a million times
[00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:55.020]   when you consider that if you don't speak English,
[00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:57.780]   you really are excluded from a lot of things.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:34:00.100]   So the ability, it's just motivating to be able
[00:34:00.100 --> 00:34:03.900]   to actually give access to content
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.780]   that historically would be completely obscured
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:08.220]   for most people.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:10.300]   I think your question though has like a,
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:11.720]   and the dubbing market we think is huge.
[00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:15.700]   I think like, you know, it's easy enough to dub these days,
[00:34:15.700 --> 00:34:16.780]   especially with our product.
[00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:17.900]   So like, it's doable.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.780]   I think, you know, people are gonna,
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:21.740]   it basically was like a priority that we were tracking
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:22.700]   to push this out.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:24.900]   We got a lot of requests for it, and so on.
[00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:28.700]   That's like the tactical answer on this dubbing thing.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.700]   Obviously, you know, in general every week we sit down,
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.660]   we prioritize all the different features,
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:33.800]   and then we build.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:38.040]   I think your question probably has a slightly higher level.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:40.500]   - Yes, the meta strategy of--
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:42.560]   - The meta strategy is like, how do you just pick things?
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.400]   - Yes.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.180]   - And do them, and what do you say yes to
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.440]   and what do you say no to?
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:49.620]   And frankly, it's a tough one,
[00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:51.580]   'cause you don't know.
[00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:53.260]   You don't know what to pick.
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.620]   Obviously, I can tell you things like,
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.140]   yeah, look at metrics, see.
[00:34:56.140 --> 00:34:56.980]   There's simple metrics.
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:57.900]   - There's no metrics for this.
[00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.180]   - There are simple metrics in the sense like,
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:00.900]   how many times are customers asking me for this?
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:01.740]   - Sure.
[00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:03.340]   - And then you can go one level deeper,
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:06.660]   which is like, how much money am I gonna make
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.440]   from the customers who are asking me for this?
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.620]   So you can start to quantify from a revenue perspective.
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:13.180]   - In that case, was there something for that?
[00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:14.220]   - There's a lot of requests,
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.460]   and obviously that's part of the product.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:20.580]   So the second you dub a podcast, we're making money.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:21.420]   - Okay.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:25.660]   - The thing that's slightly tougher is
[00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:30.620]   there is no better answer that I can give
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:33.140]   than try to do as much as you can.
[00:35:33.140 --> 00:35:38.460]   I think we pride ourselves in pushing at least
[00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:41.340]   two super highly demanded features
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:42.620]   from our customers a week.
[00:35:42.620 --> 00:35:44.660]   - Two, wow.
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.500]   - Yeah, so we just move super fast.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.320]   And part of that is 'cause we're frankly just a small team.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.160]   We're pretty like--
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:50.980]   - How big is your team?
[00:35:50.980 --> 00:35:51.820]   - Four people.
[00:35:51.820 --> 00:35:52.660]   - Okay.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:53.500]   - Total, the whole company is four people.
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:54.780]   - Yeah.
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:57.160]   - We just move very independently and very quickly.
[00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:59.740]   So we're just able to push out a lot of things.
[00:35:59.740 --> 00:36:01.740]   But I think that's frankly,
[00:36:01.740 --> 00:36:03.500]   that's just the requirement of what we're doing.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:05.300]   It's not meant to be a chill game.
[00:36:05.300 --> 00:36:06.140]   - Yeah.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:07.760]   - And this is kind of a,
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:10.820]   don't wanna use that term, but for lack of a better word,
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:12.220]   like it's a race.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.620]   Like you have to keep building
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:15.060]   or else someone else is gonna build.
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:17.020]   - It's almost, but it's like a race without an end.
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:18.060]   - It's a race without an end.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.160]   So I guess all I'm trying to say is like,
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.340]   yeah, it's tough,
[00:36:22.340 --> 00:36:24.420]   but you kind of just like have to be prolific.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:26.180]   - Okay, fair enough.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:27.660]   Yeah, you mentioned that you were listening
[00:36:27.660 --> 00:36:29.140]   to the "Line Chain" episode.
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:31.500]   And "Line Chain" is also similarly like,
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.860]   in my mind, very high tension,
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:34.640]   but also obviously important for them
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:36.340]   to stay relevant on top of all the trends.
[00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:37.180]   - Yeah.
[00:36:37.180 --> 00:36:41.540]   - I just, it's very stressful.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.380]   - But it's overwhelming, I agree.
[00:36:42.380 --> 00:36:43.220]   - Yeah, it's overwhelming.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:46.140]   - Every day, my to-do list grows by like 10 times
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.300]   and I do less, like, you know what I mean?
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:49.320]   - Append only, yeah.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:50.820]   - It's just, basically it's append only.
[00:36:50.820 --> 00:36:53.960]   So it's tough, but the reality is you just like,
[00:36:53.960 --> 00:36:57.420]   as a, I'm not even saying as an AI startup,
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.060]   as a startup, you just have to be prolific.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:01.620]   - Okay, yeah, of course.
[00:37:01.620 --> 00:37:03.020]   - Yeah.
[00:37:03.020 --> 00:37:06.420]   - Do you think that you have,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:10.260]   so often people will say they will build, build, build
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:12.560]   until they find quote unquote PMF.
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:14.760]   Can we talk about what you think PMF is?
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:16.940]   And then, like, those core features, right?
[00:37:16.940 --> 00:37:17.980]   Like, because there's such a thing
[00:37:17.980 --> 00:37:19.180]   as also a feature factory.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.700]   I have worked at startups that were feature factory.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:23.740]   Build, build, build, and then it's a whole bunch of junk
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:25.980]   that nobody, that doesn't have a coherent story.
[00:37:25.980 --> 00:37:27.900]   - Yeah, I think that's a really tough one, actually,
[00:37:27.900 --> 00:37:29.480]   to just like build, make sure that the things
[00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.420]   that you're building all actually like,
[00:37:31.420 --> 00:37:33.820]   from a very business perspective,
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.820]   either an upsell or they're somehow related
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:36.660]   to what you're building.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.180]   'Cause otherwise, it's really difficult to,
[00:37:39.180 --> 00:37:41.340]   I think, okay, let's just start from the baseline
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:44.600]   that you build a product for a customer.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:45.520]   - Yeah.
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:48.140]   - It's okay to then build another product
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:49.860]   that caters to the same customer,
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:52.140]   or sell the same product to a different customer.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:52.980]   - Yeah.
[00:37:52.980 --> 00:37:54.140]   - What's really difficult is to build a different product
[00:37:54.140 --> 00:37:54.980]   for a different customer,
[00:37:54.980 --> 00:37:55.860]   'cause that's just a new company.
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:56.740]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:57.620]   - Right, so--
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:38:00.100]   - Have you seen the superhuman PMF score thing?
[00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.720]   - I have read that blog post ages ago,
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:03.560]   so I don't remember it.
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:04.380]   I think he said like, you know,
[00:38:04.380 --> 00:38:06.220]   40% of people recommend it.
[00:38:06.220 --> 00:38:07.740]   - Yeah.
[00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:08.580]   - So, I don't know, 'cause--
[00:38:08.580 --> 00:38:10.180]   - His advice is like spend 60% of your time
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.740]   making your existing customers more happy.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.580]   - Yeah.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.680]   - And then 40% the adjacent guys,
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:17.540]   and then the remainder for R&D for future.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:19.420]   - Yeah, yeah, I think that's pretty good advice,
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.460]   to be honest, 'cause I do think like,
[00:38:21.460 --> 00:38:23.220]   never neglect your current customers.
[00:38:23.220 --> 00:38:24.060]   - Of course.
[00:38:24.060 --> 00:38:25.100]   - Right, 'cause they're gonna be your biggest promoters.
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:25.940]   - Totally, yeah.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.220]   - So, we definitely wanna make them feel loved.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:29.100]   We, again, try to really, like,
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:30.700]   I think one thing we also have going for us
[00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:32.180]   is our customer support.
[00:38:32.180 --> 00:38:33.000]   - Yeah.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.900]   - Which is a one-person show at this point.
[00:38:34.900 --> 00:38:36.580]   But it's really good, it's really responsive,
[00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.220]   and we really try to make sure that the customer
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:41.220]   is like, knows what to do, and if it's something we,
[00:38:41.220 --> 00:38:42.620]   it's also just really rewarding to, I think,
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.620]   be like, at such a small team,
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.740]   and this is a bit of a tangent,
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.620]   but like, you get an email from a customer being like,
[00:38:48.620 --> 00:38:49.660]   "Hey, this doesn't work."
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.740]   And I think people are typically primed
[00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.740]   to like, be a little bit aggressive with companies.
[00:38:54.740 --> 00:38:57.500]   Right, like, "Hey, this doesn't work, I need this."
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:38:59.620]   And then they're super surprised when within an hour,
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:01.660]   you're like, "Hey, we pushed a fix, this should work now,
[00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.500]   "I hope all's good."
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:03.700]   And they're like, "Oh my God, thank you."
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:04.780]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:06.380]   Yeah, that's the magic that's only possible
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.220]   at an early stage.
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:08.860]   - Yeah. - Yeah, that's great.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.420]   Okay, since you mentioned pricing,
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:12.620]   maybe just a few minutes or two
[00:39:12.620 --> 00:39:14.700]   on just how you think about pricing.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:19.580]   You are probably a lot of usage-based stuff,
[00:39:19.580 --> 00:39:23.580]   and I always have this struggle with usage-based,
[00:39:23.580 --> 00:39:25.900]   because you're basically charging your heaviest users more,
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:27.980]   and discouraging them from using you more.
[00:39:27.980 --> 00:39:29.940]   - I think of it slightly differently.
[00:39:29.940 --> 00:39:33.220]   We were not, so at the moment, okay.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.060]   - Your tiers.
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:35.180]   - Let's just promise by saying,
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.020]   we haven't figured out what the pricing is.
[00:39:36.020 --> 00:39:37.180]   - Sure. - I think that's like
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.420]   the eternal struggle. - Yeah, what's in your mind?
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.260]   - We don't know how to price this thing.
[00:39:39.260 --> 00:39:40.660]   - Yeah, what's in your mind? - So far.
[00:39:40.660 --> 00:39:45.900]   We don't actually, at the moment,
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.060]   charge you if you consume above your quota.
[00:39:48.060 --> 00:39:49.580]   So we have tiers.
[00:39:49.580 --> 00:39:51.180]   - Ooh, hot take. (laughs)
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:54.260]   - As in, if your quota, you just have to upgrade
[00:39:54.260 --> 00:39:56.540]   to a different one, right? - Oh, I see, I see.
[00:39:56.540 --> 00:39:59.300]   - We don't have this additional consumption.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:00.340]   - Meter billing, yeah.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:05.140]   - Are we charging our biggest users more?
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:07.780]   - We actually just charge them per unit less.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:10.340]   So it does work on, if you just produce more content
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:14.780]   than the unit, the unit, the per unit price is just lower.
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:15.620]   - Yeah.
[00:40:15.620 --> 00:40:19.420]   - I don't know, I have to say,
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:21.340]   pricing is probably pretty rudimentary at this point.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:23.500]   - Yeah, it's not as important.
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:25.540]   - It is important, 'cause fundamentally it drives revenue,
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:29.780]   but there needs to be a bit of a science and an art,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:30.740]   it's a bit science, a bit art,
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:32.860]   to figure out what the right pricing strategy is.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:35.420]   I think you see like a million different things,
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:36.860]   and a million different things that could work for you,
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:38.460]   but you frankly just have to test it,
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:42.340]   and like, again, there's a million things to do,
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:43.460]   like four people to do them,
[00:40:43.460 --> 00:40:46.260]   so we haven't been moving as quickly as you want on that.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.540]   I think we're probably gonna release something new soon
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.460]   in terms of pricing.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.500]   - Yeah, cool.
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:52.540]   - But it's a tricky one.
[00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:54.140]   - Hey, nobody has it figured out.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.900]   - No. (laughs)
[00:40:55.900 --> 00:40:59.660]   - I've been through many, many pricing changes in my career.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.380]   Cool, I wanted to talk a little bit about the origin story,
[00:41:02.380 --> 00:41:05.260]   'cause you flagged that Mooncraft was actually
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.100]   a big part of-- - Moonshot.
[00:41:06.100 --> 00:41:10.740]   - Moonshot was a big part of your arriving at this idea.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:15.500]   - Yeah, let me give a little bit of background.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.460]   So, Demi and I, we're both apparents here,
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:22.020]   we actually were flatmates right before we started this,
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:25.740]   and then we both had this idea that kind of came about
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.460]   from our respective upbringings,
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.700]   which was, there's a lot of people,
[00:41:30.700 --> 00:41:31.980]   and we're not the first to have this idea,
[00:41:31.980 --> 00:41:33.580]   by any stretch of imagination,
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:35.740]   but there's a lot of people out there in the world
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:37.340]   who are really good, really talented,
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.220]   who just don't have the financing to do the things
[00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:40.580]   that they're talented in, right?
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:43.500]   Like, you need to develop yourself a little bit.
[00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.500]   So, we were like, cool, how do we solve this?
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:49.060]   How do we get people funding to do the things
[00:41:49.060 --> 00:41:50.020]   that they're good at?
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.380]   We're like, cool, let's align incentives,
[00:41:51.380 --> 00:41:54.100]   let's get people investing in other people.
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:41:55.460]   Cool, that was the original idea.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:58.060]   Applied to YC, we got in, long story short,
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.900]   we got in, and we're like, cool, let's see who's done this.
[00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:02.940]   We've obviously done that before,
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:04.340]   but let's really figure out
[00:42:04.340 --> 00:42:06.340]   what our unique edge is gonna be.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:08.460]   So, we looked at all the other companies that had done that,
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:10.500]   and I think one particular one that comes to mind
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:13.260]   is Upstart, which is now a multi-billion dollar company
[00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:17.940]   listed, and we called them moonshots,
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:18.780]   that was kind of the idea,
[00:42:18.780 --> 00:42:20.740]   like people who have the moonshot potential,
[00:42:20.740 --> 00:42:22.180]   they called them upstarts,
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:24.740]   and we both had this idea that you were a backer.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.020]   Backers back moonshots or upstarts.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:28.380]   They spent two years on this,
[00:42:28.380 --> 00:42:31.220]   and then they pivoted to, I think, a lending platform,
[00:42:31.220 --> 00:42:33.180]   some lending platform that they do now.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:37.020]   So, we were like, we spoke to a couple folks there,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.380]   and we're like, so what didn't work?
[00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:40.740]   And the thing they said is there is,
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:43.500]   I'm also giving a lot of detail right now on some moonshots,
[00:42:43.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   so maybe that's not super relevant,
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.220]   but just added context.
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.060]   - It's fun to hear.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.700]   - They're like, it's really hard to get your average Joe
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.040]   interested in backing your other average Joe, right?
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.060]   People like, it's not really interesting
[00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:55.540]   to back this other guy who wants to go
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:57.300]   get a better education somewhere.
[00:42:57.300 --> 00:42:58.940]   You don't, you know what I mean?
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:00.500]   There's no driver, 'cause A, the economics
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:01.780]   typically aren't so good,
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.880]   and historically, they just found that people don't do this.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.980]   So, we were like, cool, if that's the problem,
[00:43:08.980 --> 00:43:12.860]   then let's focus instead on a group of talent
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.840]   that has this exponential style trajectory.
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:18.320]   So, we picked athletes.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:20.740]   People love sports, and people really feel
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:23.260]   what we call the emotional dividend of this investment.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:24.900]   So, we actually stopped calling it investments,
[00:43:24.900 --> 00:43:26.660]   'cause the investment wasn't great.
[00:43:26.660 --> 00:43:28.780]   Financially speaking, your investment,
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:30.380]   you're better off putting it in the stock market
[00:43:30.380 --> 00:43:31.660]   or real estate or whatever,
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.420]   just the risk return did not make sense.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:35.800]   - So, you might trigger some regulation.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.620]   - We were fully triggering regulation.
[00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:39.180]   We were compliant with the SEC.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:40.460]   It was all regulated.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:42.180]   We weren't doing this NFT style.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.780]   And then, so we were selling this.
[00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.860]   So, you get a financial dividend.
[00:43:47.860 --> 00:43:49.940]   You still get part of their payback,
[00:43:49.940 --> 00:43:53.940]   or if tennis player X makes that much, you get 10%,
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:58.220]   but we also started calling it the emotional dividend.
[00:43:58.220 --> 00:43:59.580]   So, actually, what we're selling a lot
[00:43:59.580 --> 00:44:00.460]   is also the experience.
[00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:04.120]   You get to be part of the front scene of this,
[00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:05.340]   of this person going on this journey.
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.820]   You're with them.
[00:44:06.820 --> 00:44:07.660]   We actually found a lot of people
[00:44:07.660 --> 00:44:09.100]   that kind of do this already.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.380]   Now, what we found out after that
[00:44:10.380 --> 00:44:11.940]   is this wasn't a big enough market.
[00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:14.340]   So, long story short, we tried really hard.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.400]   I frankly think, there's a comment here
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.540]   about founder market fit.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.060]   We were not the right founders for this,
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:20.380]   and when we were raising money,
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.860]   VCs would ask us, what are two software engineers
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.100]   from Panther doing?
[00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:26.700]   Like, why are you funding athletes?
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.660]   What?
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:28.820]   And we'd sell this 'cause, you know,
[00:44:28.820 --> 00:44:30.440]   I played a little bit of tennis.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.140]   They may actually play professional basketball,
[00:44:32.140 --> 00:44:33.460]   so we'd sell it like that.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:36.960]   But, you know, for all the hate that VCs get,
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.900]   sometimes they ask good questions, right?
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:40.980]   And we were not the right people for this.
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:42.620]   Our day-to-day was dealing with agents
[00:44:42.620 --> 00:44:44.260]   who are not nice people.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:45.460]   - 'Cause you had to sign them up.
[00:44:45.460 --> 00:44:46.660]   - Well, you had to sign players up.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.860]   - And you had to sell their earnings.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:51.700]   - Yeah, so, A, just the cycle took so long.
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:53.980]   There was one guy, we were doing this as charity.
[00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:55.940]   We were like, don't give us back anything.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:56.980]   - You're just gonna give money away?
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:58.060]   - We're gonna give you money.
[00:44:58.060 --> 00:44:59.580]   We still didn't sign them after six months.
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:00.420]   - Oh my God.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.620]   - Like, I don't understand at this point.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:02.940]   Like, it was taking too long.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:03.780]   We weren't the right people.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.620]   - It's your OPMF.
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:05.440]   (laughs)
[00:45:05.440 --> 00:45:06.280]   - And the most important thing,
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:07.100]   which actually leads us to WannaCraft,
[00:45:07.100 --> 00:45:09.380]   is this was not a tech product.
[00:45:09.380 --> 00:45:11.500]   And Moonshot was not a tech product.
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:12.340]   It was a legal product.
[00:45:12.340 --> 00:45:13.180]   It was a regulation.
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:14.860]   It was like, hey, now you can invest in people.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.000]   The reality is, like, I think we just found out
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:18.980]   the hard way that we were building something
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:19.980]   people did not want.
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:24.000]   And the thing that, like...
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.400]   So we realized, like, we're building something
[00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.280]   that isn't our strengths.
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:27.580]   Let's find something else.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:30.440]   Looking back, I can also kind of, like,
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.260]   there were pointers when we were at Moonshot
[00:45:32.260 --> 00:45:35.480]   about, like, yeah, we should build something technical.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.120]   I was listening to the "Lang Chain" episode
[00:45:37.120 --> 00:45:38.720]   that you guys did, and...
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.560]   Harrison, right?
[00:45:40.560 --> 00:45:41.380]   - Yes.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:43.080]   - I remember you saying he was a big sports fan.
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.920]   - Yes.
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.880]   - And, you know, he built this, like,
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:46.920]   basketball scraper or whatever.
[00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:48.340]   Literally, my biggest, like,
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:50.640]   the thing I was most excited about with Moonshot
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:52.040]   was, like, okay, let's build out this infrastructure
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:53.640]   so that people can invest and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.160]   And then we get to the point where we can do, like,
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.000]   data analytics on them and start predicting.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.200]   I'm like, this is the most exciting part of this.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.160]   And I was like, this is definitely not
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:02.520]   the core part of the business.
[00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:04.200]   So I'm excited about something that's gonna take
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:06.040]   either years to get to or something else.
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.920]   But the core, you know, we designed our landing page
[00:46:08.920 --> 00:46:09.760]   and built it.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:12.000]   That was the funnest thing I've done in Moonshot.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.840]   So we're like, when we decided to pivot,
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.240]   we were like, we need to do something technical.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:19.280]   The story from there just became, like, okay, cool.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.400]   Let's list some ideas.
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:21.240]   What are we gonna track?
[00:46:21.240 --> 00:46:22.400]   Which one do we have the most conviction in?
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.680]   We rank them.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:25.660]   And Monocraft was the one we had the most conviction in.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:27.420]   It was this idea, again, expanding access
[00:46:27.420 --> 00:46:30.760]   and just translating your ability to produce content.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   So producing content in one format
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.940]   and then taking that to all the other formats.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.780]   So we built that.
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.920]   We built the podcast builder.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.080]   Super quick prototype because I think at this point,
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:44.780]   to anyone pivoting or hard pivoting or considering it,
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.520]   the name of the game isn't, like,
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:48.520]   to get attached to your idea.
[00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:50.160]   Just, like, actually, you should be trying
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:52.160]   to invalidate this idea as quickly as possible.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.640]   So get it out there and let people tell you
[00:46:53.640 --> 00:46:54.620]   it's a piece of shit.
[00:46:54.620 --> 00:46:55.460]   - Okay, so what did you do to get it out there?
[00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.520]   - So we built it out.
[00:46:56.520 --> 00:46:58.760]   We built out a little, like, UI.
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:00.040]   Literally no authentication.
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.400]   It was a form where what you guys see now
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:03.240]   on our platform, which is, like,
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.120]   the content script page, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.080]   It was one page.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:09.280]   Like, you click and it was the most janky React stuff
[00:47:09.280 --> 00:47:10.120]   that we had.
[00:47:10.120 --> 00:47:10.940]   Zero authentication.
[00:47:10.940 --> 00:47:12.280]   So in theory, if people found it,
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.380]   they could just produce as much audio as they wanted.
[00:47:15.380 --> 00:47:16.820]   - I'm quickly developing an opinion, by the way,
[00:47:16.820 --> 00:47:18.920]   that I think all early-stage startups
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.880]   should not have a marketing site.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:23.200]   Your .com should just be your app.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.120]   - That's an interesting one.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.240]   I mean, we, I don't think we have one too much.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.040]   I think you still need, like, discoverability.
[00:47:30.040 --> 00:47:30.860]   - Okay.
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:31.700]   - Whether that's your marketing site
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:32.520]   or a lot of artifacts.
[00:47:32.520 --> 00:47:33.360]   I think we are moving to--
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:35.320]   - Or, like, embed your app into the marketing site
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.160]   or whatever.
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:38.760]   Just, like, have, get people using it
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:39.760]   as much as possible, right?
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:41.480]   - Yeah, I think that you're, like,
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:43.840]   the most convincing thing is, like,
[00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.040]   so we have a feature on our app,
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.120]   which is, like, test with example.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:47.600]   As soon as you log in, it says, "Test with example."
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.280]   And the whole point of that was, like,
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:53.560]   to, between login and audio generated,
[00:47:53.560 --> 00:47:55.080]   how few clicks does this take?
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:55.920]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:47:56.760]   And yours was?
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.580]   - Like, two or three clicks.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.080]   It's, like, test, create podcast.
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:00.080]   - You, like, pre-filled everything.
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:00.920]   - Generate script.
[00:48:00.920 --> 00:48:01.740]   - Yeah.
[00:48:01.740 --> 00:48:02.580]   - Generate audio.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:03.420]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:04.240]   - Right?
[00:48:04.240 --> 00:48:05.120]   So, and arguably, that was still too many clicks.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:05.960]   We should probably put something
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:07.000]   on the actual landing page,
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:07.840]   so that, like, you can see--
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.320]   - Yeah, now you have just the player there, right?
[00:48:09.320 --> 00:48:10.160]   You can just kind of listen
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   to the Hacker News Daily thing.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.760]   But what signals did you get from doing that?
[00:48:14.760 --> 00:48:16.200]   - The signal that we got is that someone picked it up
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:17.680]   on Twitter, and just, like, you know,
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:18.800]   all these, like, AI--
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:20.120]   - Influencer voice.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.800]   - So, someone picked it up, posted it.
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:24.040]   We started getting a ton of inbound.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:26.080]   So, we were like, "Holy shit, let's just, like,
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.600]   "paywall this."
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:30.880]   So, we just, like, again, the jankiest Stripe integration,
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:32.200]   which was basically, like,
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.080]   we have an app with a Stripe integration.
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:35.440]   This was just to ship it within the hour.
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:37.480]   We have an app with a Stripe integration
[00:48:37.480 --> 00:48:40.720]   that, once you click, then takes you to a different app,
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:41.560]   hosted somewhere else.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:44.320]   So, that one was still unauthenticated.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:45.160]   - It was hilarious.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.000]   - Yeah, security by obscurity.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:47.440]   - It was hilarious, right?
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:52.440]   But we basically just made that, like, 3K in one day.
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.680]   - One day, yeah.
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.120]   - We charged around, like, 50 bucks.
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:48:56.400]   We didn't even, literally didn't think about it.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.000]   We just charged 50 bucks, and people paid.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.920]   And we're like, "Okay, well, there's something there."
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:00.760]   - Yeah.
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:01.600]   - So, then--
[00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:02.840]   - 50 bucks for one--
[00:49:02.840 --> 00:49:03.680]   - For a month.
[00:49:03.680 --> 00:49:06.720]   We were just charging 50 bucks a month, nothing.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:08.120]   Like, just, like, will someone pay for this?
[00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:10.080]   - And you were just, like, on one, like, VPS somewhere.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.080]   - Yeah, will someone pay for this?
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:12.480]   We were on, like, on one EC2 instance.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:13.320]   - EC2 instance, yeah.
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:14.160]   - You know what I mean?
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.000]   Like, it was janky.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:16.320]   We were like, "Just someone needs to pay for this
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:17.440]   "before we move further."
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:18.280]   Someone did.
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:19.120]   People did.
[00:49:19.120 --> 00:49:20.160]   So, then we were like, "Okay, cool.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.120]   "This is interesting."
[00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:22.120]   - Interesting.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:24.080]   I'm gonna move up the question that we said
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.440]   was gonna be the meatiest question of this interview.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:31.040]   So, you chose this out of your list of ideas.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.960]   And this is one of the things
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.560]   that a lot of AI founders worry about, right?
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:36.520]   So, the framing of this is,
[00:49:36.520 --> 00:49:39.040]   are you worried that you're a thin wrapper around 11 labs?
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.440]   What is your mode?
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:43.440]   And how do you think about that
[00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:45.280]   when you're evaluating your idea?
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.400]   - I think you can, that's a seminal question.
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.600]   I think anyone in an AI startup is,
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:53.360]   I think, frankly, everyone in an AI startup
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.240]   should convince themselves of this.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.080]   Don't listen to me.
[00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:57.480]   And, like, just make sure from first principles
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.920]   that you can derive this.
[00:49:58.920 --> 00:50:03.080]   But I guess I would start by first saying,
[00:50:03.080 --> 00:50:04.520]   what is a mode?
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:07.600]   Well, like, or what is defensible?
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:09.120]   In theory, if we're just taking it,
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.920]   and this is trivially true,
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:12.400]   but the fact that someone built it
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.480]   means someone else can build it, right?
[00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.480]   So, modes tend to just be around,
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.000]   built around, like, you have a lot of network effects,
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.880]   or you have a really good product for this use case,
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.560]   or, you know, something like that.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:28.080]   And I think, typically, when people ask this question
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.040]   in the AI context, they're thinking of, like,
[00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.920]   okay, you're a thin wrapper,
[00:50:31.920 --> 00:50:33.760]   you're an application layer thing,
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.840]   as opposed to you're one of the, like,
[00:50:38.840 --> 00:50:41.760]   underlying technologies or APIs that people use.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.960]   Cool, I think that's fair.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:47.560]   But I think the reality is that, like,
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:49.080]   yeah, these APIs exist,
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:52.440]   and they probably do serve a million different use cases,
[00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:54.040]   but they're not built to serve
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:54.920]   these million different use cases.
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.320]   So, whenever you ask the question of modes,
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.840]   it always has to be with the perspective
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:02.640]   of who is the user I'm building this for, right?
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.760]   I can use chat GPT to do half of my writing,
[00:51:07.040 --> 00:51:08.040]   but, you know, I don't know.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:10.560]   Jasper claims that they do this much better for marketing,
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.480]   so it's tailored.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.720]   Actually, don't quote me on how well they're doing
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   after chat GPT came out,
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.000]   'cause they were really big before.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.600]   - Yeah, there's some negative data points,
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:18.640]   but I'm sure they--
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.120]   - I know, but the point is, like,
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.840]   you're making this easier.
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:24.640]   We make creating a podcast easier,
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:25.960]   and there is tooling there.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:28.720]   We help you, we can post it directly through us.
[00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.160]   We have the tooling around, you know,
[00:51:30.160 --> 00:51:31.920]   setting the intros and the outros.
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:33.480]   We have the music, we have an editor.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:34.440]   All these things are also getting
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:36.600]   just much more and more developed.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.640]   We're building templates
[00:51:37.640 --> 00:51:39.720]   so that you can do different style of podcast.
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.120]   So the idea is, if you're trying to start a podcast,
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:44.920]   yeah, don't go to a generic text-to-speech engine.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.280]   Come to us.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.440]   And the reality is that we then can,
[00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:49.680]   in a very opinionated way,
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:52.840]   actually select which text-to-speech engine we want, right?
[00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:55.040]   So we actually have just, like,
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.360]   in my mind, it's the application layer,
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:59.000]   fundamentally, that, you know, people use,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.680]   and then all these API layers
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:03.600]   are what developers use to build products on top of them,
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.440]   right? - Right.
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:07.240]   - I appreciate that it is, like, a seminal
[00:52:07.240 --> 00:52:09.880]   and really hard thing to wrap your head around,
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.360]   especially if you're, like, about to invest in a company.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:13.400]   It's like, will they actually just be defensible
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.760]   and be able to grow? - Yeah.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:19.320]   - And yes, there's no doubt that companies can do this.
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:20.160]   The question is just, like,
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:23.600]   are you building the right product for the right use case?
[00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:24.440]   I think, particularly, if you're, like,
[00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:26.840]   always framing your company as an AI company,
[00:52:26.840 --> 00:52:30.440]   then you're putting the carriage before the horse
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.160]   in the sense that you focused on the implementation
[00:52:32.160 --> 00:52:33.000]   rather than the use case.
[00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:34.400]   Focus on the use case.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:35.640]   And then build a product for it.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:36.480]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:37.960]   'Cause fundamentally, you know,
[00:52:37.960 --> 00:52:40.240]   any of the SaaS's that exist,
[00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:41.920]   think, like, more traditional SaaS.
[00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:42.760]   What's their mode?
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.240]   The technology, everyone has access to it,
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:45.280]   so they just pick the thing
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:48.600]   that does it better than the other.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.600]   Now, that mode question is super interesting
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.080]   because I think you should actually
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:54.000]   - Flip it around. - Flip it around,
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:55.880]   which is, what is your mode as an API?
[00:52:55.880 --> 00:52:57.040]   - Yeah. - Right?
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.880]   So, Chad GPT, like, yeah, fine,
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:01.200]   they had a first-mover advantage,
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:03.520]   and I think, you know, by no means,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:05.480]   this is my opinion, but by no means
[00:53:05.480 --> 00:53:07.800]   was Google, like, caught off-guard with this, right?
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.200]   It just, Google has some,
[00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:12.160]   half the technologies that Google invented
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:15.060]   are actually what's used to power all these transformers.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:19.480]   But, you know, it went against Google's strategy, maybe,
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:21.080]   to, like, be the first-mover in this
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:22.200]   'cause they cannibalized their own market.
[00:53:22.200 --> 00:53:24.120]   Whatever it was, I'm not sure.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.760]   But, yeah, open AI's mode
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.840]   is that they paid for the training bill.
[00:53:28.840 --> 00:53:29.960]   - Yeah. - So, they just have
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:30.800]   a good model.
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:31.880]   Cool, people now know that that's valuable.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:33.520]   - And, they hired, like, very top-notch.
[00:53:33.520 --> 00:53:34.480]   - Superstar, sorry, obviously.
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:35.720]   Obviously, not taking that for granted.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.160]   But, like, they, you know, assuming everyone
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:40.720]   can do the hiring and that these people exist,
[00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:43.120]   they paid the bill, and they were the first to launch this.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:44.160]   But now people know it's a thing,
[00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:46.200]   so people are gonna launch similar APIs.
[00:53:46.200 --> 00:53:49.160]   So, what is your mode as an API?
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:52.160]   So, it's just an, it's an existential question.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:54.960]   It's like, how do you do, how do we defend any of this?
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.520]   - Yeah. - And you do this, frankly,
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:54:00.140]   by being probably better just as a product.
[00:54:00.140 --> 00:54:01.760]   Again, the product is always with the perspective
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:04.160]   of who's your customer that you're selling it to.
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:05.560]   And the other thing is, frankly,
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:08.760]   that, like, let's not forget, the market is huge.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:10.720]   There is space for everyone, right?
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:12.800]   If you manage to, like, if there's four good products
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:14.700]   out there in any specific thing, the market is huge,
[00:54:14.700 --> 00:54:16.940]   and they're all gonna be able to, you know,
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:17.840]   make a living out of it.
[00:54:17.840 --> 00:54:21.060]   - Sometimes people justify markets.
[00:54:21.060 --> 00:54:22.080]   By the way, that was a really good answer.
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:24.200]   Thanks for taking that hit on.
[00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.200]   - I've had to answer that question way too many times.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.920]   - Yeah, I know, it's not the first time.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.520]   But, I think it's actually, you know,
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:32.520]   having been an investor, it is more important for you
[00:54:32.520 --> 00:54:34.920]   to answer that question authentically for yourself,
[00:54:34.920 --> 00:54:36.840]   'cause you're the one spending your time on this.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:39.840]   We're just giving you money, it's not that big of a deal.
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:45.320]   Well, so, ah, I forgot what I was gonna say there.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.400]   Yeah, I think 11 Labs, you know,
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:50.000]   I think the thing that you were mentioning is, you know,
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.120]   there is not that much loyalty.
[00:54:52.120 --> 00:54:54.360]   Obviously, you and Matti are friends.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:57.280]   But there's not much loyalty if your main goal
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:55:00.440]   is to serve API, because you just need to wait
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.120]   until the next best one comes along.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.640]   - The same thing as Uber, like, why is Uber defensible?
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:07.240]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:11.480]   My favorite quote, actually, I went to an early,
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:15.120]   like, pre-HRGBT forum with Sam Altman,
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:17.640]   and I had this video advice from Sam
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:20.000]   that said, like, Facebook had no moat,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.040]   and they just built and got the network.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:24.280]   - But frankly, also, Facebook was building something
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.600]   back then, which is kind of ludicrous, like,
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.800]   cool, you're building a social media app,
[00:55:27.800 --> 00:55:29.160]   okay, how big can it be, right?
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:30.840]   - Like, how big can the internet be?
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:31.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:31.680 --> 00:55:32.520]   All of a sudden, it's this behemoth.
[00:55:32.520 --> 00:55:35.240]   So it's like, yeah, the fact that it was built,
[00:55:35.240 --> 00:55:37.280]   again, trivially true, but the fact that it was built
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:39.480]   means it can be built by anyone else.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.360]   So you, there is no such thing as, like,
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.880]   a absolute true moat.
[00:55:44.880 --> 00:55:47.120]   The question is how well, how quickly,
[00:55:47.120 --> 00:55:50.440]   how much earlier than everyone else did you get there,
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:51.640]   and a million other things as well.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:53.200]   - Yeah, cool.
[00:55:53.200 --> 00:55:55.280]   Two more sort of product-building questions,
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:55:57.600]   and then I want to turn the mic over to you
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.740]   to ask me anything as a podcaster.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:01.960]   So one is script generation, which, you know,
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.440]   sort of the two core activities of Wondercraft.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:06.880]   I think you guys do a really good job
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:11.880]   of summarizing the Hacker News comments and the content.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:15.160]   In my mind, the hardest thing is just managing context,
[00:56:15.160 --> 00:56:18.960]   because, obviously, it is unbounded for the context window.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.360]   Do you use LangChain?
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:21.720]   Do you build your own LangChain?
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.760]   - I like LangChain, I've never used it.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:24.600]   I've never, ever used it.
[00:56:24.600 --> 00:56:27.360]   - So you just build your own recursive summarization thing.
[00:56:27.360 --> 00:56:28.200]   - Yeah, so--
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:29.040]   - Do you use a vector database?
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:29.880]   Which one?
[00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:31.640]   (both laughing)
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.520]   - I'm not gonna say any further,
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.880]   unless you realize how unsophisticated we are.
[00:56:34.880 --> 00:56:36.480]   - It's okay, no, I think it's okay.
[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:39.480]   People, builders and investors want to know
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.320]   what's actually useful--
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:42.600]   - I want to say the thing, the Hacker News recap,
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.440]   I think, I don't know, but we can look on the date
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:47.320]   of the first episode when we launched it.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.040]   I think it was like the 8th of April or something like that.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:55.400]   We decided on Wondercraft probably on the 5th of April.
[00:56:55.400 --> 00:56:57.080]   So this is how quickly it took us--
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:57.920]   - The name of Wondercraft?
[00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:59.840]   - As in the company, this is what we should pursue.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:01.000]   - I see, so you took three days.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.200]   - And this is before people started paying.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.480]   We were just like, Hacker News started off
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.320]   as a proof of concept.
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:06.560]   It's like, do people even want to listen
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:08.100]   to AI-generated content?
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.440]   And it's been going on since.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.920]   So it wasn't actually that hard
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:12.520]   to build the Hacker News recap.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:14.400]   Obviously, now it became a little bit more sophisticated,
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.240]   so we summarized comments and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:17.760]   - Yeah, that's great, by the way.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.600]   I love that.
[00:57:18.600 --> 00:57:20.780]   - But actually, it's like, especially with our API now,
[00:57:20.780 --> 00:57:22.800]   it's super easy to do something like that.
[00:57:22.800 --> 00:57:25.420]   We, Hacker News, frankly, just doesn't need
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:28.980]   a vector database unless we're trying to do something.
[00:57:28.980 --> 00:57:30.900]   At the moment, we just summarize the posts.
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:31.860]   And actually, for anyone listening
[00:57:31.860 --> 00:57:33.020]   who listens to the Hacker News recap,
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.580]   just tell us some feedback on how to improve it.
[00:57:35.580 --> 00:57:38.020]   At the moment, it's just like, it's one long narration.
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:40.060]   But one thing we're thinking of doing, for example,
[00:57:40.060 --> 00:57:42.580]   is sometimes you have multiple posts
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:43.700]   talking about the same topic.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:45.760]   So actually, an idea is do top 10 topics
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.080]   instead of top 10 posts.
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:50.860]   That starts to need, I don't think that needs a database,
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:52.200]   a vector database.
[00:57:52.200 --> 00:57:53.700]   I think it needs something, you know,
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:57:55.400]   it needs to do some embedding, manipulation.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.420]   - You need MP.A?
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:57:58.500]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:00.020]   But something like that.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.740]   I think for when you start to really, really scale up
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.560]   the content that you're pulling from,
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.300]   then you start needing a vector database.
[00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.140]   - Okay, so what are the actual hard problems
[00:58:11.140 --> 00:58:12.580]   for script generation?
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:14.340]   Prompt engineering?
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.940]   - Prompt engineering is one of them,
[00:58:15.940 --> 00:58:18.060]   especially when you're trying to tune things,
[00:58:18.060 --> 00:58:21.460]   like tone, or how long it should be, and all of that.
[00:58:21.460 --> 00:58:24.100]   I actually think, so the way our app works,
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.660]   and maybe that's leading to your next question,
[00:58:25.660 --> 00:58:27.500]   but the way our app works is twofold.
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:28.740]   You have the script generation,
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:30.540]   and then you have the audio generation.
[00:58:30.540 --> 00:58:33.820]   In our minds, we imagined it as a really linear flow.
[00:58:33.820 --> 00:58:36.460]   That, of course, I want to generate the script,
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.700]   and then I want to generate the audio for it.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:41.580]   Where in reality, I don't think it's that linear,
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:42.420]   to be honest.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:44.400]   I think it's very circular in how you do this, right?
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.220]   So you generate the script,
[00:58:46.220 --> 00:58:48.220]   you listen to it, it doesn't sound quite right,
[00:58:48.220 --> 00:58:50.140]   and you want to modify the tone a little bit, and so on.
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:51.940]   So I think our UI doesn't get that wrong,
[00:58:51.940 --> 00:58:54.180]   unless you're exactly what you're going for,
[00:58:54.180 --> 00:58:57.080]   is this recap, summarization style.
[00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:59.780]   So I think what we need to do a much better job
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:04.700]   is this templatization, and this on-the-go, on-the-run,
[00:59:04.700 --> 00:59:06.260]   kind of like, okay, let's play around
[00:59:06.260 --> 00:59:07.840]   with this text via some prompt.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:09.820]   So I think it's definitely an improvement
[00:59:09.820 --> 00:59:12.860]   we're looking to make, but yeah,
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:15.060]   it's a prompt engineering question, fundamentally.
[00:59:15.060 --> 00:59:17.840]   It's like how, prompt engineering on one level,
[00:59:17.840 --> 00:59:19.900]   the next level's like how good, how fine-tuned
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:21.300]   is your model to specific tasks,
[00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:23.460]   and then maybe you can use your own model if you wanted to.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.940]   - Would you look at that, or is that not--
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:25.820]   - We'll definitely look at that,
[00:59:25.820 --> 00:59:28.800]   but you look at that when it's a problem.
[00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:30.820]   It's not a problem right now.
[00:59:30.820 --> 00:59:33.680]   - I would say, as a listener, daily listener,
[00:59:33.680 --> 00:59:36.100]   I think your show notes are really good.
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:38.260]   Most daily podcasters are horrible at show notes.
[00:59:38.260 --> 00:59:40.100]   They don't tell you anything.
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.460]   Here, if I want to click in, I can click in there,
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:43.880]   so definitely keep that.
[00:59:43.880 --> 00:59:46.740]   But the top thing that annoys me about you,
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.380]   and I'm just complaining now,
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:51.200]   is you don't write the post title.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:52.660]   You don't spell out the--
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:53.940]   - Really, we don't write the post title?
[00:59:53.940 --> 00:59:55.540]   - Yeah. - I think we used to.
[00:59:55.540 --> 00:59:56.700]   - Well, it's gone. - That's horrible.
[00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:57.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:59:57.540 --> 01:00:00.040]   - So the voice, by the way,
[01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:02.320]   I wonder if there's any story behind picking the voice.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.400]   The voice would just say, "This post does,"
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:05.240]   and it doesn't tell me the title of the post.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:06.940]   - Oh, in the audio, in the audio, we don't say that.
[01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:08.260]   Ah, sorry, sorry, got it, got it, got it.
[01:00:08.260 --> 01:00:09.620]   - And when I'm running--
[01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:10.820]   - Did you email us about this?
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.060]   - No, no, I've kept it to myself.
[01:00:13.060 --> 01:00:14.220]   - Someone did email us, so it's like,
[01:00:14.220 --> 01:00:15.040]   "Please say the post." - I'm like,
[01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:15.880]   "This is so obvious."
[01:00:15.880 --> 01:00:17.700]   I would actually just fork "WonderCraft"
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.620]   just to add that one feature,
[01:00:19.620 --> 01:00:21.140]   because it's so annoying when I don't know
[01:00:21.140 --> 01:00:22.340]   what I'm listening to.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:24.720]   - We'll fix it, we'll fix it, easy peasy.
[01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:26.820]   - Okay, cool.
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:30.540]   The audio generation, you use 11Labs.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:32.300]   What makes a good podcast voice?
[01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:34.580]   You have a bunch of options that I clicked,
[01:00:34.580 --> 01:00:36.940]   and in my mind, I like a deep voice.
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.300]   I like the Morgan Freemans.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:41.060]   You don't have that many deep voices.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:44.200]   Do we want, is there such a thing as a high-energy voice?
[01:00:44.200 --> 01:00:46.540]   You also insert breaths.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:48.860]   11Labs has also advertised that they have an AI
[01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.780]   that can laugh, which I think is fun, important.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:53.540]   Basically, what makes a good audio?
[01:00:53.540 --> 01:00:55.220]   Yeah, generate audio.
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:59.020]   - Yeah, it's, it depends, again, on the perspective.
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.140]   Everything is kind of answered
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:02.820]   with the frame of reference that you're looking at.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:04.140]   If you like a deep voice,
[01:01:04.140 --> 01:01:05.980]   A, that's kind of a personal preference,
[01:01:05.980 --> 01:01:07.660]   and B, it just kind of depends on the thing.
[01:01:07.660 --> 01:01:09.300]   So if you, I don't know, let's do,
[01:01:09.300 --> 01:01:10.780]   say you're doing something like meditative
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:13.100]   or kind of affirmations or something
[01:01:13.100 --> 01:01:14.720]   that encourages people every day.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.320]   You probably do want a slow, deep voice,
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.280]   something relaxing.
[01:01:17.280 --> 01:01:19.840]   If you're doing the Hacker News recap--
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:21.280]   - Cheerful. - We picked Anna,
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.120]   who's our default voice. - Yes, Anna, yeah.
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:25.680]   - Because-- - I have an attachment to Anna.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:28.640]   - Yeah, we all do. (laughs)
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.200]   She's just news anchory style, very professional,
[01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.480]   very formal, very neutral. - Very pleasant, yeah.
[01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:33.320]   - Very neutral.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:38.240]   So it depends, really, on what makes a good voice.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.840]   It depends on what you're doing.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:42.680]   There's a few things, but if you're doing an interview,
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:45.000]   I think it also just, frankly,
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:45.840]   then you get into the question
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.800]   of what makes a good podcast.
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:48.360]   Well, the good podcast is like,
[01:01:48.360 --> 01:01:50.560]   I think it's also kind of a personal question,
[01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:52.820]   which I haven't, or probably there's a general trend
[01:01:52.820 --> 01:01:54.560]   that I'm yet to decipher.
[01:01:54.560 --> 01:01:57.140]   But yeah, you probably do want
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.360]   a little bit of humanity in there.
[01:01:58.360 --> 01:02:00.200]   You want a stutter. - Yeah.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.520]   - You want some pauses, right?
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.520]   I'm speaking, I don't speak in complete utterances.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.120]   I have an utterance, and then I pause a little,
[01:02:05.120 --> 01:02:06.820]   and then I speak again, and so on.
[01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.600]   Laughs and something to make it human.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:10.840]   - Yes. - It's kind of overlaying
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:12.320]   of the two, if you have two speakers,
[01:02:12.320 --> 01:02:14.600]   it's like exchange, right?
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:15.500]   I will be speaking.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.240]   If you look at the transcript of this episode,
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.360]   we probably overlap in when we're speaking.
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:20.200]   - And that's fun.
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:21.520]   - And that's actually interesting, right?
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:22.360]   'Cause it is a conversation.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.880]   - Shows the sign of excitement,
[01:02:23.880 --> 01:02:26.220]   especially in our studio when we're three people,
[01:02:26.220 --> 01:02:28.080]   and we're all talking at once, you know it's good.
[01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:29.400]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.800]   I don't like this zoomification style
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:33.600]   where if you're gonna big zoop and big zoom,
[01:02:33.600 --> 01:02:35.040]   only two people can speak the second
[01:02:35.040 --> 01:02:36.400]   more than two people try to speak.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.040]   - Yeah, yeah. - It's a disaster.
[01:02:38.040 --> 01:02:40.720]   So I think it frankly just depends on what you're doing.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:42.480]   We are, yeah, at the moment we're really good
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:43.680]   at doing this narration stuff,
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:46.160]   but I think we are building a lot of functionality
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.240]   and tooling to just make this multi-host thing
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.320]   a more of a reality.
[01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:52.960]   - Okay, okay.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.720]   I would say objectively, if it was a friend and company,
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:57.680]   not that important.
[01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:03.960]   So this comes down to how human should your users try to be?
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:09.680]   Because I'm fine with Hacker News Daily making mistakes,
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.840]   because I know it's AI generated, right?
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:16.080]   I would be less fine if you were not up front,
[01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.360]   and Alec here actually thought it was a human
[01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:20.440]   when he first listened to it,
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:22.320]   'cause Anna's just really good.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:25.320]   But then you'll make mistakes, like pronunciation mistakes.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:28.840]   So I actually have a clip that I wanted to play you.
[01:03:28.840 --> 01:03:30.960]   Anna takes this, on September 8th,
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.160]   Anna was taking a lot of breaths.
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:33.600]   She was very out of breath.
[01:03:33.600 --> 01:03:35.280]   I was very worried about her.
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:36.520]   She was hyperventilating.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:38.040]   I was like, "Inner UK?"
[01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:41.880]   Anyway, so basically, I think if you disclose up front
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.240]   that you're an AI podcast,
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:45.240]   then people will be like, "Oh, okay, I tolerate that mistake
[01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.560]   "and I use you for information,
[01:03:46.560 --> 01:03:48.840]   "and not for believing that there's some human
[01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:51.920]   "on the other side that I might meet someday."
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.160]   But if you're investing so much effort into being real,
[01:03:57.160 --> 01:04:00.960]   then your end goal is you have to lie to your users.
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.760]   - I don't think the investing and being real
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.600]   is for the purpose of deception
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.720]   as much as it is for the purpose
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.680]   of making it slightly pleasant to read about.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:11.800]   I think on Hacker News, we do say on our Spotify page
[01:04:11.800 --> 01:04:13.760]   that this is an AI-generated podcast.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.600]   - For now, but--
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:18.280]   - As in, yeah, yeah, so there's two things.
[01:04:18.280 --> 01:04:20.480]   I think if you wanna be smart about this,
[01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:22.320]   you should say that this is AI-generated content.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:24.400]   The second people find out that it's not you,
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.360]   the backlash is gonna be big,
[01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.160]   'cause it will be interpreted as deception.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.520]   So you should do this just to be smart.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:32.640]   I don't think there's a point in lying,
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.440]   especially if the content that you're putting out there
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.480]   is just like, this is informational for you,
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:38.160]   so consume it, this was efficient,
[01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.240]   this helped us put it out there.
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.960]   The second thing is, frankly, I don't think it's up to you
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.120]   whether you tell them or not.
[01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.800]   Very, very soon-- - They'll know.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:49.280]   - Google is just gonna mark things as AI-generated.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:51.240]   So I think there's a new thing.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:53.760]   I saw a quick YouTube video about it,
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:56.640]   so I don't know what the exact terms and conditions are,
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.640]   but YouTube has, I think, released a new monetization rule,
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:02.960]   and it does mention something about AI-generated content.
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:06.080]   So there is, it's not up to you anymore.
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:07.840]   People are gonna know that this is AI-generated,
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.040]   so I think it's just in your interest
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:10.400]   to say that you're AI-generated.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.880]   Ain't no shame. - Yeah, no shame at all.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.680]   - 'Cause fundamentally what we do
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:17.480]   relies on the premise that you have done some content.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.520]   We don't generate our own content.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.840]   We don't synthesize our information.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.000]   It assumes that you've written a blog post,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.640]   done an actual podcast, or have some artifact
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:29.040]   on which you wanna base
[01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.520]   what you're feeding through Wondercraft.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:34.360]   - And you said in some of your material
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:36.040]   that I've seen before that you are interested
[01:05:36.040 --> 01:05:38.200]   in watermarking all your stuff.
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:39.040]   You haven't done it yet,
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.040]   but whenever there's a standard for doing that,
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:41.880]   you will do it. - Yeah.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:43.000]   - Okay. - I think the thing
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   that this is blocking on is the standard.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.760]   I'm not super up-to-date on what the work on this is.
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.200]   - I think OpenAI will probably--
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.500]   - But there just needs to be a standard
[01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:52.920]   so everyone can interpret it. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.440]   Yeah, cool, awesome.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:59.440]   Great, I wanted to dive in a little bit on tech options,
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:05.360]   and then zoom out to just you asking me questions.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:09.440]   So TTS Options, we talked a little bit about 11Labs.
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:10.920]   I would also say as a podcaster,
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.360]   the leading competition to you guys,
[01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:16.100]   I know it's not exact competition, but it's Descript,
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:17.800]   because they have Overdub.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.680]   - Yeah, I think Descript is really good,
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.360]   and they're definitely a solid company.
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.840]   I've used their video editor before.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.680]   It's great.
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.080]   The Overdub thing is super useful.
[01:06:27.080 --> 01:06:30.280]   I think it's really creative to have edit videos
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:31.600]   by editing the transcript.
[01:06:31.600 --> 01:06:32.440]   - Yes.
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:33.680]   - Super, super creative, super user-friendly.
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:34.940]   - Would you build that?
[01:06:34.940 --> 01:06:37.600]   - I think, again, it's like, we're not building
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:38.440]   for the sake of building.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:42.000]   We're building more for the purpose of the user.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:42.840]   - Yeah.
[01:06:42.840 --> 01:06:43.760]   - Whatever users find more interesting.
[01:06:43.760 --> 01:06:46.800]   I think what we're doing is we,
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:48.600]   the use cases are slightly different, right?
[01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.680]   And I think the people that they're targeting
[01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:51.600]   are slightly different.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:52.540]   - Yeah.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.120]   - We do wanna have a lot of automation on the script side
[01:06:55.120 --> 01:06:59.320]   to also just help out with the way you formulate
[01:06:59.320 --> 01:07:01.280]   your content or the way you pull your content,
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:02.720]   much more so than just the editing process.
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:03.560]   - The ingest, yeah.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:04.380]   - Yeah.
[01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.220]   - Okay, got it.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:06.440]   And I just wanna map out,
[01:07:06.440 --> 01:07:09.320]   here's how I think about TTS, text-to-speech.
[01:07:09.320 --> 01:07:10.320]   There's the big cloud options,
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.480]   Amazon Polly, Google Text-to-Speech,
[01:07:12.480 --> 01:07:14.860]   and Microsoft Cognitive Services.
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.360]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.440]   - As someone who is ex-Amazon,
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.600]   I'm very embarrassed by Polly.
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:20.480]   It sucks.
[01:07:20.480 --> 01:07:22.040]   - Yeah, Google's isn't great, and Microsoft--
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.360]   - I'm sure you investigated all these things,
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.800]   and you're like, "Okay, this is not serious."
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:29.040]   There's Play.ht, which is probably the other big YC--
[01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:29.880]   - Yeah.
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:30.960]   - Alum.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:33.560]   Just a quick two seconds on your thoughts on Play.ht.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.380]   - Sounds good.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.200]   I think it doesn't sound super,
[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:38.800]   as good as Alum Labs, my opinion.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.000]   - Yeah.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:40.840]   - But I think it sounds good.
[01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.140]   - But I have heard other founders tell me this as well.
[01:07:43.140 --> 01:07:43.980]   - Yeah, they're--
[01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:44.800]   - And I don't know why.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.680]   - I think they have a, what's it called?
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:50.600]   A more comprehensive platform.
[01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.440]   - Okay.
[01:07:51.440 --> 01:07:53.480]   - As in they let you do this pronunciation.
[01:07:53.480 --> 01:07:56.320]   They just have a lot of tooling around it.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.160]   - So different features.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:08:00.080]   - I think quality, in terms of the voice,
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.260]   11 Labs is still better.
[01:08:01.260 --> 01:08:02.100]   - Yeah.
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:03.080]   - I think they are releasing a new model.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:03.920]   I don't know if they've released it already or not.
[01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:05.500]   - Yes, they did, yeah.
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:06.340]   - Could be better.
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:07.160]   I don't know.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   But they do have some functionality out there.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:10.000]   - Yeah.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.420]   They also released the viral
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:13.400]   Joe Rogan, Steve Jobs interview from last year.
[01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:14.240]   - Yeah.
[01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:15.560]   - And on your landing page, you were like,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.800]   "This is something that WonderGraph will never do.
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:22.080]   "AI content speaking to each other."
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:24.200]   - Yeah, who wants to listen to that?
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.040]   Like, it's fun--
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:25.880]   - Apparently a lot of people.
[01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.160]   - It's fun 'cause it's a cool gimmick.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:29.600]   I think it's like nice viral material.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.720]   I would never listen to like a synthetic Joe Rogan.
[01:08:33.720 --> 01:08:34.560]   - Yeah.
[01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:35.640]   - This brings us on to a little bit
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.720]   about the whole like content question
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.800]   or the proliferation of AI, which is like,
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:43.120]   okay, if it's this easy for me to create content
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:45.120]   that's like, you know, somewhat engaging,
[01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:49.520]   like all these AI songs, the Drake song.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.000]   Well, okay, so if it's this easy and it's just like,
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.560]   if it's this easy to generate content,
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:56.640]   well, why will I listen to it?
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:58.440]   Like, I think we already suffer from the problem
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:00.660]   that there's an oversaturation of content.
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:05.080]   So I think, you know, I'll give a Netflix example.
[01:09:05.080 --> 01:09:06.320]   When I go on Netflix, there's too much content.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:08.040]   I don't like discovering new things.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:10.240]   I either know exactly what I'm about to go and watch
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.000]   or I will re-watch one of the seven things
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.040]   that I constantly keep re-watching, right?
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:17.240]   So I'm not like, their discoverability isn't the best
[01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:19.360]   and every now and then I maybe like look at
[01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:20.180]   some of the other things,
[01:09:20.180 --> 01:09:21.720]   but I'm not trying to look at Netflix.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:23.520]   - It's quite funny 'cause they used to invest a lot
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.000]   in their recommendation systems.
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:25.840]   And like, nobody I know uses that.
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.160]   - But now it's just too big.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.040]   It's just too big.
[01:09:28.040 --> 01:09:29.160]   And they're like, it's overwhelming.
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.080]   So many tiles that you're looking at on the screen.
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:32.520]   So, cool.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:34.120]   Now, what if I told you that there's probably
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:37.640]   is gonna 1,000X and half of it's gonna be AI generated?
[01:09:37.640 --> 01:09:39.120]   So what I just said is like,
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.240]   we all have this internal proxy
[01:09:41.240 --> 01:09:43.220]   of what a thing I'm likely to watch is,
[01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.860]   which is it was recommended by a friend
[01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:46.720]   or it's one of the things I previously watched.
[01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.320]   I'm not doing this discoverability.
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:49.960]   So imagine that's the case.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:53.280]   I think another layer of proxy will just be like,
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:56.280]   from the Netflix category of the shows and movies,
[01:09:56.280 --> 01:09:57.720]   was this human made or is this AI made?
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:09:58.960]   If it's AI made, I'm not watching it.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.420]   I want real human stuff.
[01:10:00.420 --> 01:10:02.360]   But I think there's gonna be a fine equilibrium
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.260]   that reaches, which is like,
[01:10:03.260 --> 01:10:05.880]   it's not even worth generating that much content with AI.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.280]   I'm talking from entertainment purposes.
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:11.240]   I'm not talking so much for the social media propaganda,
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.120]   blah, blah, blah, not getting into it.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:15.920]   But at least from an entertainment perspective,
[01:10:15.920 --> 01:10:18.480]   if I can just always have an on-demand Drake song
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:20.120]   that I wanna listen to,
[01:10:20.120 --> 01:10:21.640]   well, at some point I'm just gonna listen to Drake.
[01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.480]   'Cause like, you know what I mean?
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.120]   - This is the greatest hits.
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   - Yeah, it's like, I'm just gonna listen to a curated set.
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.800]   The fundamental thing is curation.
[01:10:27.800 --> 01:10:30.760]   It's just like a parallel example of the Discord thing.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.880]   It's like full of noise.
[01:10:31.880 --> 01:10:34.120]   So I need to like figure out
[01:10:34.120 --> 01:10:36.600]   what is the right thing to consume.
[01:10:36.600 --> 01:10:38.680]   - Yeah, awesome, awesome.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.900]   Great answer.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.960]   I just wanna bring through,
[01:10:41.960 --> 01:10:43.760]   here's my map of the market, right?
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.520]   There's Speechify.com, which focuses on celebrity voices.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.080]   I noticed that you don't have celebrity voices,
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.640]   probably 'cause of licensing issues, right?
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:50.480]   - Yeah, and it's also--
[01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:51.320]   - Like, they don't usually use their voice.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:52.240]   - It could at some point,
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:54.000]   but like not a priority at the moment.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.960]   - Yeah, I really want a Morgan Freeman one.
[01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.160]   (laughs)
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:10:58.360]   - That's gonna cost.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:11:00.040]   - I know, I know.
[01:11:00.040 --> 01:11:03.640]   Mycroft.ai, privacy focus, run offline.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.480]   Probably not--
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.320]   - Haven't heard of them, actually.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:06.480]   - Not important for you.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:10.560]   There is some interest in virtual characters for games.
[01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:13.200]   So Conv.ai is the one that I had listed here.
[01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:15.320]   Did you look at the gaming market?
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.480]   - Not deeply, to be honest.
[01:11:16.480 --> 01:11:17.320]   - Yeah.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.140]   - But it could be an interesting one.
[01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:19.280]   - Yeah, people are exploring that.
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:21.320]   There's obviously Heijian now,
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:25.000]   and that is it for as far as I can scope out the landscape.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.320]   And then there's the open source systems.
[01:11:26.320 --> 01:11:28.040]   So Tortoise TTS, as far as I can tell,
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.840]   is kind of market leader in open source.
[01:11:29.840 --> 01:11:31.800]   - Yeah, I would actually say probably a lot of these models
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.600]   were built on top of it.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.440]   - What models?
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:35.280]   - Maybe.
[01:11:35.280 --> 01:11:36.100]   Some of the--
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:36.940]   - These other companies.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:37.780]   - The companies, yeah.
[01:11:37.780 --> 01:11:41.140]   - Yeah, there's PyTSX, Koki, used to be Mozilla,
[01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:42.880]   and then Larynx.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:43.720]   - Yeah.
[01:11:43.720 --> 01:11:44.540]   - Anyway, all these things.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:46.480]   And then there's also sort of research-grade stuff
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.880]   coming out of the major big tech companies.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:50.480]   You talked about Google Sandstorm.
[01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:51.800]   - Probably the one I'm most excited about.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:52.880]   - Okay, why don't you--
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:54.440]   - Well, it's really good.
[01:11:54.440 --> 01:11:55.520]   You can check out the paper.
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:56.800]   - Yeah, we'll play a clip.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:58.600]   - Yeah, they haven't, I think all you need
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:11:59.600]   is like three seconds.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:00.440]   - Yeah.
[01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:03.280]   - And it'll just, it's like a three-second sample,
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.000]   and it'll play the audio in your tone.
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:05.960]   It sounds really human as well.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.100]   Like it has utterances, it laughs.
[01:12:08.100 --> 01:12:10.840]   It's pretty accurate to like, it sounds human.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.440]   - Yeah.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.920]   - So very interested in that.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:14.760]   They haven't open sourced it,
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.000]   and I assume for good reason.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:16.840]   - Yeah.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:17.800]   Google never launches anything.
[01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.360]   You have to wait for somebody to,
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:21.400]   or you guys could re-implement it yourself.
[01:12:21.400 --> 01:12:22.560]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.200]   GPUs after PMF.
[01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:27.200]   - Ah, that's a nice quote.
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:28.680]   How strongly do you believe that?
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:29.560]   - GPUs after PMF?
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.400]   - Yeah.
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:31.880]   - Well, I believe, I think this was another question, yeah.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:32.700]   Which is like--
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.540]   - What is PMF?
[01:12:33.540 --> 01:12:36.280]   - No, what is your favorite like PG advice
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:37.320]   in building a company, right?
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:38.680]   I think that my favorite thing is just like,
[01:12:38.680 --> 01:12:39.920]   don't spend your money, obviously.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.760]   - Ah, okay.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:44.080]   - Everyone and their mother is trying to get a GPU
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:46.920]   at the moment, so I don't think it's,
[01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:49.680]   we're definitely substantially reducing our runway
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:50.920]   by doing that.
[01:12:50.920 --> 01:12:51.760]   - Yeah.
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:52.600]   - Obviously you do that when you believe
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:53.440]   the investment is worth it.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.680]   - Yeah.
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:57.080]   - And again, you have to pick the time at which you do that.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:12:58.880]   - I mean, there's other companies,
[01:12:58.880 --> 01:13:03.180]   I think this is somewhat consensus.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:05.980]   I think the non-consensus thing is to spend a shit ton.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:09.200]   So like inflection raising a few hundred million dollars,
[01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.200]   and then spending 95% of it on GPUs.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:12.040]   - Same with Mistral.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.960]   I think it depends on the company you're launching.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.560]   I think if you're like, you know,
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.480]   maybe you're a brand new TTS company,
[01:13:17.480 --> 01:13:19.320]   maybe it is worth just doing that.
[01:13:19.320 --> 01:13:20.160]   - Yeah.
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.000]   - I don't know.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:21.920]   - Okay.
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.400]   There's also AudioLM, also out of Google,
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.120]   VAL-E from Microsoft, and MetaVoiceBox.
[01:13:27.120 --> 01:13:28.560]   Are you just watching any of these?
[01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:30.760]   - Watching any of these, obviously paying close attention.
[01:13:30.760 --> 01:13:31.800]   - You try them all out, yeah?
[01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:33.520]   - Try them all out.
[01:13:33.520 --> 01:13:34.360]   - What are you looking for?
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:36.040]   What is like the holy grail?
[01:13:36.040 --> 01:13:37.080]   What are you looking for?
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:38.360]   - There's also how human it sounds,
[01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:40.720]   and like how likely I'd be to listen to this if I did it.
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.360]   Also how like customizable it is.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.180]   - Yeah.
[01:13:43.180 --> 01:13:44.120]   - I think the problem with all these voice things,
[01:13:44.120 --> 01:13:47.520]   and generally a lot of the AS stuff is somewhat random,
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:50.640]   but you're using it in production applications
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:53.060]   that require certainty, right?
[01:13:53.060 --> 01:13:55.200]   Just as an example, if I promise my users
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:57.360]   this podcast or this segment will be 30 seconds,
[01:13:57.360 --> 01:13:59.200]   it needs to be 30 seconds.
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.600]   Or, you know, given some SLA.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.680]   - Discontolerance.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:04.280]   - Some SLA around like, you know, it's 95% of that.
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:05.120]   - Yeah.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.680]   - But I think a lot of these things
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:10.080]   just tend to be a little random at the moment.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:13.320]   So like how, can I literally specify a tone
[01:14:13.320 --> 01:14:15.520]   that I'd like this to be and be certain that it's doing it
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.800]   and it's not some weird like attempt at sounding surprised.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.640]   - Yeah.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.480]   - It's just like, yeah.
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:23.500]   Basically how controllable and how realistic they sound.
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:24.340]   - Yeah.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:28.560]   And then final question around just the landscape of TTS.
[01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:31.120]   What are the unique challenges for non-English TTS?
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.240]   And I'll tell you, right?
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:35.440]   So I'm interested in having 28 languages of latent space.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:37.280]   Right, that's only good things for me.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:38.840]   Except if it sucks.
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:39.720]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:14:39.720 --> 01:14:41.840]   - And I obviously, I have no way to validate.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840]   - I think that's the problem with--
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.520]   - Latent space Ukraine.
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.000]   - Yeah, and I think that's the problem with dubbing,
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:46.840]   I think.
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:49.400]   So the reason, one thing we're gradually building out,
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.920]   but we already have as part of our dubbing product
[01:14:50.920 --> 01:14:52.840]   is that we have QA as part of that.
[01:14:52.840 --> 01:14:54.920]   So we actually work with professional translators
[01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.440]   to just make sure that the things that we publish--
[01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:57.280]   - Oh, nice.
[01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:58.120]   Oh, you should put that up front.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:58.960]   - Yeah.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:01.840]   So that's really one of the, like,
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.040]   fundamentally the problem with dubbing,
[01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:04.400]   if you ask anyone who's ever tried to dub,
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.480]   is you don't know what good sounds like
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:08.400]   in these other languages.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:09.720]   You're like, I can tell you I dub,
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:10.800]   but I'm gonna tell you that--
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:11.640]   - Yeah.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:12.680]   - I think there's a lot of big podcast studios
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:13.520]   who have tried this before.
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:14.760]   There's one I can think of that's tried this
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.560]   maybe five times with five different companies
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:18.200]   in the last five years.
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.400]   Their fundamental problem is that you just cannot,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:22.720]   yeah, fine, Spanish sounds good to me
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.840]   as a person who doesn't speak Spanish,
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.160]   but like, it doesn't sound good to a Spanish person
[01:15:26.160 --> 01:15:30.120]   or an Argentine person who have totally different accents.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:30.960]   Right?
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:34.000]   So I think the tricky thing as well
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:36.440]   is getting that straight is,
[01:15:36.440 --> 01:15:37.840]   in English, it's very clear,
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:39.920]   and there's a huge proliferation of content
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:42.680]   in every single accent, if you will,
[01:15:42.680 --> 01:15:46.920]   Australian, English, British, American, Irish, whatever.
[01:15:46.920 --> 01:15:50.200]   In other languages, especially if you consider the niche ones
[01:15:50.200 --> 01:15:54.040]   I don't know, I'll pick like German.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:56.440]   There's like a few German accents.
[01:15:56.440 --> 01:15:59.000]   I don't know how much content Austria puts out
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.800]   'cause they have a specific accent, right?
[01:16:00.800 --> 01:16:02.160]   Germany itself, probably every--
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:03.320]   - Swiss-German.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:07.320]   - Yeah, just record Roger Federer speaking, right?
[01:16:07.320 --> 01:16:09.560]   So there's just a lot of nuance
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:11.440]   that isn't as widely available.
[01:16:11.440 --> 01:16:12.760]   The English market is just the biggest.
[01:16:12.760 --> 01:16:13.600]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.160]   - And I say this as someone like,
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.320]   so I say someone who speaks German,
[01:16:16.320 --> 01:16:18.760]   but like, think of all the other language,
[01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.000]   I have no idea what Spanish, Spanish-Spain,
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.280]   sorry, Spain-Spanish sounds like
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:25.600]   and Argentina-Spanish sounds like.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:26.440]   There's a difference.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:27.260]   I know that.
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.000]   I just don't know what it sounds like.
[01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:29.840]   - Cool.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:31.720]   Well, if you ever need Chinese validation,
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:36.040]   I know I have some very fanatical Chinese listeners
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.440]   who translate every podcast.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.360]   - Oh, that's amazing.
[01:16:38.360 --> 01:16:39.960]   - So we can use that as QA.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:41.800]   - Yeah, I would definitely love that.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:43.560]   - Shout out to the Chinese army.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.680]   Great, great, awesome.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:48.360]   What do you want to ask me as a podcaster?
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:50.720]   - So tell me about your setup process
[01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:51.760]   for setting up a podcast.
[01:16:51.760 --> 01:16:52.600]   - Oh my God.
[01:16:52.600 --> 01:16:54.800]   - And I think it goes far back as like,
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:16:56.200]   cool, you know what guests you're having on,
[01:16:56.200 --> 01:16:57.680]   you're just like, no, no.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.520]   - Oh, you mean starting--
[01:16:58.520 --> 01:16:59.340]   - Even further back.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.180]   Even further back.
[01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:03.280]   It's like, I want to talk about someone in this space.
[01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.600]   - So like for a new episode
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.880]   or for a completely new podcast?
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:06.720]   - New episode.
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:07.760]   - A new episode is pretty easy, right?
[01:17:07.760 --> 01:17:08.760]   Like the way I set it up with you
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.960]   was like, hey, I'm a fan.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:10.800]   Do you want to chat?
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:11.840]   And you said yes.
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:13.400]   And we scheduled--
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:15.100]   - And how long did it take to get the scheduling right?
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:19.080]   - Scheduling, you guys are very responsive,
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:20.440]   very easy to work with.
[01:17:20.440 --> 01:17:22.040]   Some others are very hard.
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:24.320]   Like we took a few months for Harrison to come on.
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:26.240]   - Yeah, and you said that.
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.720]   - For you guys, it only took two weeks.
[01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.880]   - Okay.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:32.040]   - And then, yeah, we got this studio.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.480]   We came here and then, you know,
[01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:36.480]   all three of us spent 50 minutes
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:38.680]   setting up the audio for ourselves.
[01:17:38.680 --> 01:17:41.280]   In San Francisco, we pay someone to do it.
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.160]   And so we just kind of walk in and start recording.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:45.840]   - Yeah, and how do you come up with the questions
[01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:47.200]   that you want to ask?
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.320]   - I do prep and research on you and the business.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:52.000]   And usually it has a format of
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:54.680]   find information about the speaker
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:57.080]   and then get to know you on a personal basis,
[01:17:57.080 --> 01:17:59.360]   put you at ease, so that you'll be more open
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:01.440]   for the other stuff.
[01:18:01.440 --> 01:18:04.680]   'Cause you know I care about you as a human being,
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:06.640]   not just as an interview subject.
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.000]   - Yeah.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.240]   - Then talk about the business.
[01:18:09.240 --> 01:18:11.840]   I do emphasize the what is question.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:12.680]   They're very straightforward.
[01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:14.720]   Like what the hell it is you're doing,
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:16.800]   because people want a clear answer
[01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.920]   and some people cannot give a clear answer.
[01:18:18.920 --> 01:18:20.320]   And that's also information.
[01:18:20.320 --> 01:18:23.880]   Then I always am interested about company building
[01:18:23.880 --> 01:18:26.680]   just 'cause I'm a founder myself, you know,
[01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:30.080]   and I want to learn about what it's like on your side
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.640]   and ask the business side of things as well.
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:34.400]   Some people don't have that side
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.480]   'cause they're academics.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.960]   So then you go more into their research
[01:18:36.960 --> 01:18:41.760]   and try to keep up with any academic in theory
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.160]   and math that they might bring up.
[01:18:44.160 --> 01:18:47.320]   And then maybe try to, at the end,
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.160]   and this is the hardest bit,
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.200]   and this is the stuff that I have
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.960]   the most second guessing about,
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.720]   try to have a segment at the end
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:55.760]   where you ask a consistent set of questions
[01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:58.720]   for essentially norming across guests.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:04.560]   So I have a system prompt for our guests
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:06.640]   and at the end of it we basically end every episode
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.480]   with a lightning round, right?
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:09.960]   Acceleration, exploration, take away.
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:12.160]   I don't love the questions that we ask.
[01:19:12.160 --> 01:19:13.800]   We're still iterating on that.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.040]   - You gotta experiment to do it.
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:18.080]   - Yeah, I think just people like Lean Space
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.960]   mostly because the kind of questions that I ask
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.040]   are the stuff that is on everybody's minds
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:26.080]   because I just talk to a lot of people.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:28.120]   And so I just force you to answer them
[01:19:28.120 --> 01:19:29.680]   because you're right in front of me.
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:30.520]   - It's great.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:31.340]   - It's great.
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:33.720]   And so you have, this is a whole interesting conversation
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:35.680]   'cause you're a human podcaster, AI podcaster.
[01:19:35.680 --> 01:19:36.720]   - Yes.
[01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:39.160]   - So as a human podcaster and someone
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:41.380]   who was with a really popular show,
[01:19:41.380 --> 01:19:44.560]   and also someone who can actually implement
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.280]   this stuff himself,
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.880]   what is some of the AI tooling recently
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:52.880]   that you've baked into your processes?
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:54.080]   - I only use the script.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:58.320]   And we built for editing.
[01:19:58.320 --> 01:20:01.160]   So for example, and by the way,
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:03.320]   this goes into a theory of content,
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:04.680]   which as a content creator myself,
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.440]   professionally and as an advisor, I have,
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.520]   which is that we developed a few show formats.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.240]   Lean Space is a channel, it's kind of like a TV channel,
[01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.600]   and channels need different formats.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.800]   So you have the reality TV show, you have the news show,
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.840]   you have the cooking show, whatever.
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:23.880]   For us, we have the founder interview, straightforward.
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:25.000]   Everyone has them.
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.480]   We have the breaking news, Twitter space.
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:32.480]   And that is, we want to be the day one first podcast
[01:20:32.480 --> 01:20:35.280]   to come up with the most in-depth breakdown
[01:20:35.280 --> 01:20:38.200]   of something that is that everybody needs to know.
[01:20:38.200 --> 01:20:40.160]   And that has high value to people, right?
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:42.760]   Because if you're a week delayed, one month delayed,
[01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.840]   then no one cares anymore.
[01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.480]   And then finally, we have the fundamentals,
[01:20:46.480 --> 01:20:48.160]   like the one-on-one evergreen episodes
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.520]   that are less time-bound.
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:51.040]   So this one is relatively time-bound
[01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:53.240]   because it's a snapshot of who you are right now.
[01:20:53.240 --> 01:20:55.320]   But we want to have evergreen episodes
[01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:58.800]   that people can go back two, three years in the backlog
[01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.280]   and still get value from.
[01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:01.800]   - Yeah, and these more fundamental ones.
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:02.640]   - Yes.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.160]   So we have three show formats right now.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.680]   And I would say we have different tooling for each, right?
[01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:13.680]   So the one that I don't need any tooling for, essentially,
[01:21:13.680 --> 01:21:16.360]   is the fundamentals one,
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:19.760]   because we plan basically every minute of that show.
[01:21:19.760 --> 01:21:21.000]   It is a lot of work.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.040]   But it's high quality because people love it.
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:26.280]   It's got the longest tail by design, right?
[01:21:26.280 --> 01:21:33.320]   The Twitter spaces require Descript
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:36.320]   because a lot of silences and a lot of ums.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.400]   And that's not good podcast audio.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.440]   So you got to cut it out.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:41.240]   - So you literally just go in,
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:44.200]   like you edit out the Twitter space that you did.
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:45.440]   You record it and then you edit it out.
[01:21:45.440 --> 01:21:47.120]   - Usually it's like two hours, we cut it down to one.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.720]   - Okay.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.000]   - And it's a lot of pain and a lot of work.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:52.400]   But it's the only way that I get
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:55.320]   some pretty high-profile people onto my podcast
[01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:56.280]   without booking them.
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:21:58.000]   They just show up.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.440]   And that has value to me, right?
[01:21:59.440 --> 01:22:01.680]   Simon Willison has been on my podcast three times
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.840]   and I never had to schedule him.
[01:22:03.840 --> 01:22:04.920]   And people love him.
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.920]   I mean, he's great.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:11.920]   And then this one, basically we do,
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.680]   I don't need Descript, obviously,
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:16.480]   but we do use Small Podcaster,
[01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:20.320]   which is a 100-line Python script
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:22.040]   that throws the transcript into Anthropic
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.400]   and then generates show notes.
[01:22:23.400 --> 01:22:24.240]   - Nice.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:25.440]   - So that's about it right now.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:28.080]   - Nice, so it's interesting 'cause I think
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.440]   you're in a very nice position
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.520]   where you're able to do what a lot of these services
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:33.360]   charge you for, you can just do it yourself.
[01:22:33.360 --> 01:22:34.200]   - Yeah.
[01:22:34.200 --> 01:22:35.040]   - So it's an interesting one.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.000]   - But obviously I'm interested in paying for things
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.400]   'cause my time is valuable
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:41.880]   and if it does a good job, then I'll use it.
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.760]   For Wondercraft, the thing that I really wanted
[01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.000]   was the RSS to podcasting, right?
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.080]   Which you now have.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.720]   So I'll try it out, but chances are
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.360]   I will not be happy with something.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.920]   And so then the question is,
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:57.760]   how much customizability do you give me to do that?
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:22:59.680]   And we'll see.
[01:22:59.680 --> 01:23:02.360]   - Yeah, interesting, cool.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.200]   These are all my questions.
[01:23:03.200 --> 01:23:05.240]   - I will say, well, you missed out one thing,
[01:23:05.240 --> 01:23:08.880]   which is marketing the podcast, which is a huge part.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:10.080]   That is mostly my job.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:12.160]   - So how do you market your podcast?
[01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.480]   - Twitter.
[01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:14.760]   - So you think Twitter's a good media for that?
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:15.600]   - Twitter and Happy News.
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:20.080]   - And threads, or you post clips, or what do you do?
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:22.120]   - I have tried posting clips.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:23.640]   It's just too much work.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.020]   So if you guys do a good job of clips,
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:27.440]   I will use your stuff, but it's just too much work.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:32.440]   So mostly I just put a big post saying,
[01:23:32.440 --> 01:23:34.240]   so for our George Hots episode,
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.080]   we were like, "Latent Space is excited to present
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:40.240]   "George Hots on Tiny Corp and Commoditizing Petaflops."
[01:23:40.240 --> 01:23:41.160]   Something like that.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.280]   And just sometimes the fame of the guest
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:46.500]   will just lead the episode.
[01:23:46.500 --> 01:23:50.300]   So the one I dropped yesterday was Chris Ladner.
[01:23:50.300 --> 01:23:52.060]   And people were like, "Chris Ladner's the boss.
[01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.000]   "I don't care about anything else.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.980]   "Just I want to hear as many Chris Ladner tokens
[01:23:55.980 --> 01:23:57.180]   "as possible."
[01:23:57.180 --> 01:23:59.340]   Others who are less famous, I have to introduce
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:01.100]   who you are and why I care about you,
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:02.620]   why they should care about you,
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.300]   'cause most people will not have heard about you
[01:24:04.300 --> 01:24:06.220]   as well if you've done.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.740]   So then I need to make the case a little bit more.
[01:24:08.740 --> 01:24:10.560]   But that's fine, that's my job.
[01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:12.280]   I just think it takes a lot of work,
[01:24:12.280 --> 01:24:14.880]   and that's the part that will be hardest
[01:24:14.880 --> 01:24:16.580]   for me to hand over to AI,
[01:24:16.580 --> 01:24:20.660]   'cause I have a very specific voice for myself.
[01:24:20.660 --> 01:24:23.660]   And apparently all AIs think that Twitter,
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:26.300]   to tweet you have to have emojis and hashtags,
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:27.200]   which is so dumb.
[01:24:27.200 --> 01:24:29.820]   It's so obviously dumb.
[01:24:29.820 --> 01:24:30.660]   The training data is very bad.
[01:24:30.660 --> 01:24:31.500]   - I think it depends, right?
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.820]   Sometimes you do, if you're trying to be more
[01:24:32.820 --> 01:24:34.740]   on the professional side, you don't.
[01:24:34.740 --> 01:24:35.580]   - Yeah.
[01:24:35.580 --> 01:24:37.940]   - It just depends on the tone and brand voice, I guess.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:38.980]   - It's just cringe.
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:40.980]   And that's the problem with AI.
[01:24:40.980 --> 01:24:43.180]   AI is mid by design, right?
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:45.120]   And you do not want to be mid as a thought leader,
[01:24:45.120 --> 01:24:46.080]   as a content creator.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:48.320]   People don't want to subscribe to mid things.
[01:24:48.320 --> 01:24:50.880]   They want to subscribe to a level
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:52.440]   slightly ahead of where they are.
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:55.800]   And so that's for better or worse where we target.
[01:24:55.800 --> 01:24:56.920]   - Which I guess the interesting thing for us
[01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:01.060]   is how do we really enable that you have your process
[01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:02.240]   and really bake that in to make sure
[01:25:02.240 --> 01:25:03.080]   that what you're presenting
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:04.720]   and what you're coming out with is unique.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:05.540]   - Yeah.
[01:25:05.540 --> 01:25:06.960]   I'll tell you one thing, though.
[01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:10.200]   I'm happy to hand over my LinkedIn to you.
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:12.520]   I have a LinkedIn following, I don't use it.
[01:25:12.520 --> 01:25:15.520]   So completely money on the table there.
[01:25:15.520 --> 01:25:17.820]   So happy to give that to you.
[01:25:17.820 --> 01:25:19.720]   You don't do social media posting, right?
[01:25:19.720 --> 01:25:22.480]   So they have to go get like spot social or buffer,
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:24.240]   both of which are horrible.
[01:25:24.240 --> 01:25:27.480]   So if you have an adjacent product some day,
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:29.000]   you might want to get into,
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:32.000]   basically money on the table marketing
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:33.780]   is what I think about it.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.840]   Basically, we would not do this by ourselves.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:40.120]   It is still inferior to a human crafted thing,
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:41.760]   but it doesn't matter because I just,
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:43.300]   I'd have zero LinkedIn presence.
[01:25:43.300 --> 01:25:45.240]   - Makes sense.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.080]   - Yeah.
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:46.920]   - Great answers.
[01:25:46.920 --> 01:25:47.760]   (laughs)
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:50.080]   - Obviously happy to offer any thoughts
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:53.120]   as you build out for podcasters.
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.640]   Okay, well, shall we go into the lightning round?
[01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:55.480]   - Let's do it.
[01:25:55.480 --> 01:25:57.680]   - Yeah, the one I just said that I wasn't confident about.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.520]   (laughs)
[01:25:58.520 --> 01:25:59.360]   - Great intro.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.180]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:02.160]   But these came from previous guests.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:06.040]   So I just think we haven't found PMF yet on those things.
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.600]   So acceleration, what has already happened in AI
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.600]   that you thought would take much longer?
[01:26:11.520 --> 01:26:16.520]   - The GPT, the fact that basically you can do anything.
[01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:18.800]   Obviously, it might not be the smartest way to do it,
[01:26:18.800 --> 01:26:21.560]   but you can basically do anything with GPT.
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:23.760]   - And were you watching it while you were at Palantir?
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:25.280]   'Cause Palantir has so many high stuff.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:26.360]   - Yeah, I think,
[01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:32.240]   vaguely, I think it really blew up after.
[01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:33.080]   - Yeah.
[01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:33.920]   - I think Palantir really--
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.120]   - You just happened to be the right spot
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.440]   where Moonshot wasn't super working.
[01:26:37.440 --> 01:26:38.280]   - Yeah.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.600]   - So you were open enough to actually pursue this,
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:41.440]   seriously.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:43.400]   - Yeah, and I think Palantir also just shifted
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:45.600]   the whole strategy once it blew up the way it did.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.120]   - Yeah, yeah, awesome.
[01:26:47.120 --> 01:26:49.480]   Exploration, if you weren't doing what you're doing,
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:50.840]   what do you think is the most interesting,
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.080]   unsolved question in AI?
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:54.560]   - Hmm.
[01:26:54.560 --> 01:27:02.760]   Great question.
[01:27:02.760 --> 01:27:04.240]   There's so many things.
[01:27:04.240 --> 01:27:05.240]   - Like what?
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:08.480]   - There's the context length, there's just the--
[01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:09.760]   - You want longer context length?
[01:27:09.760 --> 01:27:12.280]   - The latency and how to just make everything
[01:27:12.280 --> 01:27:13.240]   flow through much quicker,
[01:27:13.240 --> 01:27:14.480]   'cause I think you can then enable
[01:27:14.480 --> 01:27:16.400]   some really interesting real-time applications.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:17.360]   - Are you interested in real-time?
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.360]   Actually, I was meaning to think about that.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.680]   - Not necessarily.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.500]   - Right, because your whole thing is async, right?
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.080]   - Maybe, yeah, but maybe in the future
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.120]   for some other product.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:28.020]   But as a person, you know, it's interesting.
[01:27:28.020 --> 01:27:31.600]   And also just the ability to,
[01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:36.600]   really the interesting stuff is the validation, right?
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:38.680]   I actually think it's the QA that we were talking about.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:39.840]   - We need evals, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:43.080]   - You still need human QA.
[01:27:43.080 --> 01:27:45.280]   - Yeah, especially yours is the hardest to QA.
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:46.120]   - Yeah.
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:46.940]   - I would say.
[01:27:46.940 --> 01:27:47.780]   Okay, very cool.
[01:27:47.780 --> 01:27:48.620]   - It's very time-consuming.
[01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:50.520]   - Takeaway, what is one message you want
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:52.280]   all of our listeners to remember?
[01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:53.280]   Take away with them.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:59.880]   - Okay, if you would like to start a podcast, start.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:01.240]   We're here to help.
[01:28:01.240 --> 01:28:02.160]   Super easy.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:04.100]   If you have a podcast, we wanna help you
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:07.040]   make it more accessible by dubbing it.
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:11.440]   On the other side, if you are a founder, an AI engineer,
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:13.220]   I think it's really important to convince yourself
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:15.220]   that what you're building is valuable.
[01:28:15.220 --> 01:28:17.760]   Don't listen to people saying, I have a motor,
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:18.600]   you don't have a motor.
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.320]   Convince yourself of what that is and launch.
[01:28:22.320 --> 01:28:24.240]   Launch and don't burn that much money.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.000]   - Frequently and often, don't spend your money.
[01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:28.320]   - Yeah, yeah, be smart about it.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:31.940]   - Yeah, I think you are one of the most successful cases
[01:28:31.940 --> 01:28:34.440]   of AI engineers so far.
[01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:37.520]   I'm really glad to spend time with you in person
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:39.300]   and excited to see what comes next.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.620]   - Yeah, it was great coming here.
[01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:41.880]   Great meeting you guys in London.
[01:28:41.880 --> 01:28:42.720]   - Yeah.
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:43.760]   - And see you soon.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.120]   - All right, see you.
[01:28:45.120 --> 01:28:46.040]   - Bye.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:47.360]   (laughs)
[01:28:47.360 --> 01:28:48.200]   - How was that?
[01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:49.040]   - Great, man.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:51.880]   Hopefully you enjoyed it.
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.720]   - Very much, very much.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:54.120]   It was a good conversation.
