[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   I mean, there's almost no self-awareness.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   There's almost nobody that sits down and says,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   I wonder if there's a connection between cause and effect.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   I wonder if I might be a broke...
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   What did she say she was?
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   I wonder if I might be a temporarily disabled digital media hustler who needs to frequently buy my time back at best.

[00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:56.620]   I wonder if the fact that I have no time might be due to the fact that I'm trying to work all the time and maybe I could take a break and cook something instead of spending all my money having other servants cook for me. I mean that's what it is. But even you know, Miss Alexandra originally personal grooming you get fired if you skip that you're telling me that somebody needs to spend $94 a month on personal grooming now what's funny to me is it's a very legitimate question I

[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:52.780]   Unger, you better carefully look at what you're doing and try to figure out why it's not working for you. Because it's hard to see how things get better from here. You've got right now cheap money everywhere. You've got low unemployment everywhere. You've got stock market through the roof. How do those things continue? Consistently in the next decade?
[00:21:52.780 --> 00:22:20.680]  ,
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   You probably don't either,
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   but you can at least feel that.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   You probably don't either,

[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   But you can at least feel that.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   But you can at least feel that.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   But you can at least feel that.

[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.680]   But you can at least feel that.
[00:22:20.680 --> 00:22:20.720]   But you can at least feel that.

[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.660]   So take a moment of introspection
[00:22:24.660 --> 00:22:26.260]   when you read something like this.
[00:22:26.260 --> 00:22:28.160]   Don't blame it and say,
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:30.720]   "Okay, #BernieBro.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.300]   Gotta vote in a solution."
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:36.660]   How are you gonna vote in anything better than today?
[00:22:36.660 --> 00:22:38.100]   Look at your own life and say,
[00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:41.120]   "Is there anything I can be doing differently now?"
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.420]   Because if I can't be doing,
[00:22:42.420 --> 00:22:45.700]   if I'm not doing well when things are going well,
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.360]   how do I expect to be doing well
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:49.800]   when things aren't going well?
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:49.820]   How do I expect to be doing well when things aren't going well?
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:49.900]   How do I expect to be doing well when things aren't going well?

[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.020]   How do I expect to be doing well when things aren't going well?
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:51.020]   How do I expect to be doing well when things aren't going well?
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:23:13.220]  , This is time for introspection.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.220]   Don't do what these 6,000 commenters are doing.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.220]   Think a little bit.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.220]   If you and I can't get rich in America,
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:13.260]   It's hard to see how it works anywhere.
[00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:13.300]   I mean, just simply, especially on expenses.
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.300]   We can all face challenges with income,
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:13.360]   And there are some structural expenses that are high in the United States, like taxes.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:21.020]   But when you get to expenses like $3,000,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   and you get to expenses like $3,000,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   and you get to expenses like $3,000,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   and you get to expenses like $3,000,
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   and you get to expenses like $3,000, and you get to expenses like $3,000, and you get to expenses like $3, and you get to expenses like $3, and you get to expenses like $3, and you get to expenses like $3, and you get to expenses like taxes.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.980]   This last weekend, I bought some plastic boxes for the children's toys,
[00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:29.180]   because they were cardboard boxes, and they were just making a mess,
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.260]   and I got tired of it, and said,
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:30.640]   That's it.
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:32.700]   I went and paid retail for plastic boxes.
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.140]   My wife's comment was,
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.540]   I don't know if I can get used to not having this stuff on the side of the road.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:41.240]   In America, it just sits there, on the side of the road,
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:43.460]   free, free for you, free food,
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.720]   free boxes, free everything,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:46.760]   just sitting there.
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:50.060]   If you can't do that and figure out how to lower your income,
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:51.020]   or your expenses,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.020]   I don't know how to lower your expenses,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.020]   If you can't do that and figure out how to lower your income,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.020]   or your expenses,
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:51.020]   If you can't do that and figure out of expenses like $3,

[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   If you can't do that and figure out of expenses like $3,
