[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.880]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.440]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now,
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.480]   while building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less. Today on the show, I want to
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:37.200]   talk with you about mindset. It's kind of an important topic, and I don't like that word. I
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.880]   just want to very rarely talk about it. But today I can think of no other word to use other than to
[00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:51.600]   talk about your mindset. And my impetus for today is a just a short, fluffy little article that USA
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:00.160]   Today published that is being mercilessly ratioed on Twitter for allegedly it's out of touchness.
[00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.120]   Here's the headline of the article, or sorry, the headline of the tweet, which is being ratioed.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.720]   The average adult in the USA spends $1,497 a month on non-essential items, all told that's
[00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.520]   roughly $18,000 a year on things we can all do without. And then it goes on and it breaks down
[00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.080]   some of the things that the typical American spends on non-essentials, that's what they're
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:33.440]   calling non-essentials. $209 a month on restaurant meals, $189 a month on drinks, $178 a month on
[00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:41.200]   takeouts and delivery, $174 a month on buying lunch, $109 a month on impulse purchases,
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.440]   $96 a month on ride shares, $94 a month on personal grooming, $94 a month on subscription boxes,
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:55.840]   $91 a month on cable, and $84 a month on online shopping. They go to the smaller numbers in the
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.520]   actual article, but that's what's included in the little graphic. Now, here's the thing,
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.880]   the tweet is being again, mercilessly ratioed. Currently, as I record this, almost 20 hours
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:13.440]   after it was published, they have 939 retweets and 6,200 replies, which is a pretty normal,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.680]   or a pretty good ratio. Ratioing of course, in the Twitter world for the uninitiated is
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.200]   when a comment is usually considered to be astoundingly bad and everybody just beats up
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.040]   on the original poster instead of wanting to share it with their friends. You know that
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.280]   something is spectacularly bad, evidently. Now, maybe I'm the dense one, maybe I'm the
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.040]   dunderhead here, but I don't think it's spectacularly bad. Certainly it's not worth
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.880]   ratioing. I would usually just ignore fluffy stuff like this, but when you read the comments,
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.120]   man, if this is an indication of our future, I'll tell you two things. Number one, the future is not
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:57.760]   bright. And number two, the future can be bright for you. Because it is stunning to me of how
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.680]   incredibly disempowered the average person is. First of all, why waste any of your time posting
[00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:12.880]   stuff on Twitter in response to a mainstream news article like this? And especially, what about
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:18.240]   making fun of it and complaining? Now, I get that some people enjoy it, but the comments on here are
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.880]   absolutely stunning. You read so many of them and it's stunning. Now, I don't know how to figure out
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.600]   what my sample set selection bias is of a ratioed Twitter comment, but if this is in any way
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:43.600]   reflective of any major portion of the US population, collectively we're in for a rough ride
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.080]   and you can have a bright future. Just, I'll pick and choose a few of these. One writer says this,
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.200]   "Absolutely censored hilarious about how millennials are both to blame for ruining the
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.840]   economy, for not buying as many luxuries, but are also to blame for their financial woes due to
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:06.400]   buying too many non-essential items such as," checks notes, "haircuts and socializing." Now,
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.120]   this is the kind of comment that I thought was funny because I thought, "Man, I read the article,
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.760]   I didn't think it talked about millennials. I went and checked." The word millennial appears nowhere
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:24.160]   in the article. Nowhere, nor in the headline. It doesn't appear. But this poor dude is reviving a
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.440]   debate about how millennials, when millennials aren't even being talked about. Or listen to
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:35.840]   this exchange from a girl named Alexandra. "Personal grooming, you get fired if you skip that.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:42.880]   Ride shares, people got to get places. If you saved that $96 a month until you could afford a car,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.280]   and in many places, a place to park it, you'd be missing out on so many opportunities in the
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:52.720]   meantime. At least four different items on this list add up to food, which is something human
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.320]   beings need to survive. Online shopping, you're not specifying what people are shopping for.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.400]   You can buy essentials online. People without, again, cars or places to park them often have to.
[00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.280]   These breakdowns are so biased in favor of a very narrow and specific vision of life.
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.600]   If someone's spending hundreds of dollars a month on car payments, plus gas, plus maintenance,
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.480]   plus auto insurance, plus parking, you're not going to call that non-essential. But let someone
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.920]   spend $100 a month using the cheapest version of a taxi available, and that's frivolous. Okay."
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.800]   And then fellow commenter replies, "And even if you cooked nearly every meal,
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.680]   that's not super cost-effective if you live alone and travel a lot. I need to eat on the road. I
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:40.160]   also like getting out of the house so I don't go crazy and dining alone and with people because
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.640]   I'm an adult with a career and a life." Another commenter responds to her, "People usually get
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.960]   takeout because they don't have time to cook. They're working late. They have to feed the kids.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:55.200]   They are honestly considering haircuts non-essential. The economy would collapse if
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.960]   people followed their advice. So this is clearly just manipulation." Previous commenter responds,
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.520]   "A lot of disabled people get takeout and delivery. When I was recovering from surgery,
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.680]   something I got again in a few months, I'm sorry, I would have starved to death without delivery
[00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.520]   apps. Life is complicated and most of us are just getting by, if we're lucky. However, USA Today
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.440]   needs us to know that it's our fault for eating lunch. We could all be millionaires like those
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:24.560]   guys whose parents leave them money. I'm a temporarily disabled digital media hustler
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:29.280]   who needs to frequently buy my time back at best, has no spoons left to do anything at worst.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:35.040]   But according to these brain geniuses, I'm just wasteful. We could all be perfect, but we could
[00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:40.080]   have no desires or needs, work all day and night and save our money. But even then, the AI will
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.600]   beat us eventually." I can't read the tweet with a straight face. "Still, they can dream of..."
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.240]   "Still, they can dream of a subjugated population..."
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:55.120]   I'm going to do this. I'm going to do this.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:59.520]   "Still, they can dream..."
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:17.520]   Okay. "Still, they can dream of a subjugated population riddled with guilt over their own
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:19.120]   struggles until that day comes."
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   Other comment...
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:41.760]   Okay, I'm a professional. I can do this.
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:52.080]   [Laughter]
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.920]   These are people. These are real people. Or maybe they're Russian bots. I don't know.
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.840]   "It's so darkly hilarious because these are the same numbnuts who fill their diapers over why
[00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:07.680]   millennials aren't buying diamonds or buying fabric softener, but then whine about how the
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.280]   average adult is spending so much on other things. Give it a rest!" I've censored some
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:22.560]   profanity there. I apologize. I can't even do it. This is again and again. And then someone else
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   responds to those two people going back and forth. Bert responds with this. He says,
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.440]   "I'm following you both because this thread was 100."
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.000]   Okay. Friends, this is the world we live in. I don't know who these people are,
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:50.320]   but this is the world that we live in where nobody looks down. And even if you want to
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:54.480]   have a debate about, I don't know, ride sharing and should that be a non-essential,
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:09:00.960]   probably not. But probably a mixture, right? Most of us drive our cars more than we need to. Most
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:06.240]   of us probably have more cars than is essential. Lots of people have a car payment that's not
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:11.200]   essential. All of us could drive $500 cars. It's not essential. So of course, the whole word
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:15.600]   essential, the whole thing is put in scare quotes, even in the tweet of non-essentials,
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:22.640]   and identifying things. But trying to find one comment out of 6,200 comments where somebody says,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:26.880]   "Hey, you know what? I sat down and looked at my budget and figured out that I didn't have to spend
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:34.000]   $174 a month buying lunch." It doesn't exist in this thread. You've got thousands of people who
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:38.640]   are doing nothing but complaining about how this person is shaming poor people for their spending
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:44.960]   decisions. And don't they recognize that we need to eat? After all, I need to eat. I mean,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:54.000]   your heart goes out. Just think about how sad this poor woman's life is. I need to eat on the road.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.240]   I also like getting out of the house so I don't go crazy and dining alone and with people,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:03.920]   because I'm an adult with a career in life. I mean, you feel sad about it, obviously, but I mean,
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:09.680]   this is not an uncommon thing. But does nobody sit down and actually think, "Huh, wait a second.
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:16.640]   Do I need to spend that much money on meals and on drinks and on takeouts and delivery and on
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.360]   buying lunch?" I mean, there's a reason why those four things are the top, because that's where most
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:27.680]   of us waste a ton of money. But if you add that up, I mean, let's just ignore the validity of the
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.880]   data, all that stuff. Does nobody sit down and actually think, "Wow, if it were true, just pretend
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.880]   for a moment if it were true, there might be a more efficient way to live than spending $750
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:44.800]   per month on restaurant meals, drinks, takeouts, delivery, buying lunch." I mean,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.520]   there's almost no self-awareness. There's almost nobody that sits down and says,
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:58.960]   "I wonder if there's a connection between cause and effect. I wonder if I might be a
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:08.400]   broke..." What did she say she was? "I wonder if I might be a temporarily disabled digital media
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:14.000]   hustler who needs to frequently buy my time back at best. I wonder if the fact that I have no time
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.560]   might be due to the fact that I'm trying to work all the time and maybe I could take a break and
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:25.360]   cook something instead of spending all my money having other servants cook for me." I mean,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:32.240]   that's what it is. But even Ms. Alexandra originally, personal grooming, you get fired
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.520]   if you skip that. You're telling me that somebody needs to spend $94 a month on personal grooming?
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:42.960]   Now, what's funny to me is it's a very legitimate question to ask what's included in that.
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.160]   But again and again and again, you find people writing and talking about how, "Well, I'm not
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.000]   going to wear deodorant and I'm not going to cut my hair because I got to get my personal grooming
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.440]   and how ridiculous." $94 a month on personal grooming is ridiculous if you're trying to save
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:09.280]   money. It's absurd. My wife and I spend between the two of us, what? It can't be more than $100 a
[00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:17.680]   year between the two of us on grooming. It's absurd. Now, you don't have to be as weird as we
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:23.440]   are, but $94 a month? Now, if you have the money and you want to do it and that's fun, you like to
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.160]   get your nails did and whatever else, fine, do it. But it's certainly non-essential. At least,
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:33.360]   be honest, it's non-essential. $189 on... Anyway, I'm not going to get into that. The point I just
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:42.960]   wanted to drive at was simply how funny it is that this... Just the minor scandal that this is
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:55.680]   and about... It's crazy. And then what's funny is... There's so many logical fallacies on here.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:11.440]   Mike writes, "Yeah, who the censored needs lunch?" John responds, "Or," Chex notes, "personal
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.800]   grooming." You need lunch, buddy. Well, sometimes. Probably healthier if you skip breakfast, lunch.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:23.040]   That's what all the intermittent fasting people say. But you need lunch. But you don't have to
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:31.120]   buy the most expensive version of it. Anyway, here's what I see. To bring it down to some
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:37.200]   themes. Forgive me for losing control. To bring it down to some themes. First, you have to be able
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:43.680]   to read things like this and recognize it for what it is and then look at your own situation.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:52.480]   Somebody writes here, says, "I don't even make $1,400 a month total right now." Lindsay responds,
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:58.240]   "That was kind of my thought." Paula writes, "Right? It's clear they're trying to 'poor shame'
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:02.880]   with this and say that all our money problems are based on cable TV and eating out (apparently
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.760]   every meal) but for me all this says is that USA Today thinks the average American is pulling in
[00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:16.080]   $150,000 to afford all that." If you don't make $1,400 a month, this advice is not for you. I
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:22.080]   guarantee you're not wasting $1,800 a month or $1,500 a month if you're making $1,400 a month.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.360]   This is just random fluffery. Look at it and ask yourself, "Am I wasting any money out of my $1,400
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:34.960]   a month?" Because I'll tell you what, somebody making $150,000 a year can certainly afford to
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:39.520]   waste $18,000 a year because they like their coffee, they like their drinks, they like their
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:45.280]   lunch out, and they like their $94 a month on haircuts or whatever else personal grooming means.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:51.840]   If you're making $150,000 a year, you can afford that if you want to. But you can't if you're
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.720]   making $1,400 a month. You've got to be able to take information and look at your situation and
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:08.880]   say, "Does this apply to me?" It's funny, this thing about poor shaming, this whole cultural
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:14.480]   thing that somehow shaming is a bad thing and/or shaming is somehow something you're supposed to
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:23.040]   avoid. Pay attention to your own results. There's a big difference between things that are your fault
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:28.960]   because of your decisions versus things that have happened in your life that are out of your control.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:39.360]   Poor shaming nonsense. Here's the point. Friends, we are living in a society where again and again
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:46.000]   when people talk about a non-essential thing and say, "Oh, the average American is wasting $1,500
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.520]   a month," you can't believe the number of times where someone talks about, "Oh, but what about
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:55.840]   the billionaires? What is their wasting payment? How much money are they wasting?" A billionaire
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:16:00.800]   can afford to waste as much money as they want. But what's implied in that is, "Why don't we take
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:06.000]   some more money from the billionaires?" Here's the other thing. When you live in a society of
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:16.480]   people who are so weak and so incompetent, I mean, here's Ames, "I'm no big city lawyer,
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:20.800]   but poor shaming the middle class doesn't seem like a winning social media strategy USA Today."
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:26.160]   And then Stephen writes, "The economy would implode without the average adult spending on these
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:38.640]   leisurely items." I don't know what to say. I guess repeat those two themes.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:45.760]   If this is at all reflective of even a modest segment of society, we got big trouble ahead.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   But you can deal in this mess if you're just halfway intelligent and you look around and save
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:59.520]   a little bit of money, you can become fabulously rich. Because here's the reality. The average
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   American does waste $1,500 a month. I don't know if it's this stuff that they wrote about or
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:08.400]   whatever, but the average American does. The United States economy is swimming in money.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:16.720]   It is swimming in money on all sides. And the majority of us need to be made fun of.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:23.040]   The person who is the best at this is Money Mustache. His tone, one of the reasons why he
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:29.760]   has done so well is he had the proper thing. He did the right thing to mock rich people,
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:37.200]   six-figure income earners, upper half, upper quartile income earners that are wasting $1,500
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:42.320]   a month instead of getting rich. Those of us who have been in that situation deserve to be mocked
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.800]   mercilessly as Mr. Money Mustache so effectively does. And hopefully that mocking will wake us up
[00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:56.240]   to look down and say, "I am behaving stupidly. I should change." I'm not going to mock the poor
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:18:01.520]   lady earlier who was struggling to make $1,500 a month or whatever it is. I'm not going to mock
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:09.200]   that person. But this doesn't apply to you. This doesn't apply to you. But it sure does apply to a
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:14.320]   lot of us. So when you read information like this, first be entertained, but recognize
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:20.880]   we live in a world that is swimming in money for the majority of us. Not for all of us. A lot of
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:26.560]   us are struggling. But for the majority of us swimming in money and it's our own stupid decisions
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:34.160]   that are leading to our poverty for the majority of us. No. USA Today, they didn't even say
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:42.480]   majority. They're very politically correct. Many of us, that's their comment. I'm not really sure
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:55.520]   how to wrap this show up other than to say two things. There is a large mob with pitchforks
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:02.000]   assembling in a town square. I mean, just listen to these. John writes, "The media does nothing
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:08.960]   but lie continuously. It's disturbing and sick." Bario responds, "Um, exactly how much do the 1%
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:14.480]   spend? Articles like this are a distraction to the dirty truth." John responds, "I'd like to see a
[00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:18.720]   corresponding article. The 1% could be solving world hunger every month, but instead they choose
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:23.520]   yachts and the Met Gala." Zach writes, "Cool character takedown of the working class. Can
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.000]   you do a similar article on how much money the 1% spends on frivolous things? Fancy clothes,
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:32.160]   yacht maintenance, fourth or fifth homes? I bet we could replace all our bridges with that money."
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:40.960]   It just goes on and on. So be warned. We'll see what happens, but be warned. When you have this
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:46.400]   many thousands of people and you cannot find a single person who says, "Huh, I wonder if I'm
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:55.840]   wasting money." Hard to know what the future holds, but be encouraged because when you have this many
[00:19:55.840 --> 00:20:00.960]   of your fellow members that can't see a distance, your fellow citizens who can't see a little bit
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:09.120]   of a distance between spending $750 a month on restaurants, drinks, eating out, lunches out,
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:16.960]   however these were categorized, versus saving a little bit of that money, right now the US economy
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:23.200]   is a wash in money. Unemployment is at the lowest it's been for decades, which means that if things
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.920]   aren't working for you right now, you've got a problem that needs solving. Now, I don't know
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:34.160]   what that problem is. You might have a personal problem. You might be disabled. You might be,
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:39.440]   I don't know, some major thing that's causing you major problems. You got to get that fixed
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:43.520]   because if things aren't working for you now, it's only going to be harder in the future.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.680]   There's no magic wand that anybody can say is going to solve all financial problems. If you've
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:52.880]   got a serious problem, health issue, disabled, something like that, you got to do your best
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.320]   right now because the US economy is a wash in money right now. If you're a competent person
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:02.800]   and if your life isn't working well right now, if your business is not going well, if your
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:07.920]   job is not going well, if you're not well employed, if you're not saving money hand over fist,
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:15.440]   you better carefully look at what you're doing and try to figure out why it's not working for you
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:24.240]   because it's hard to see how things get better from here. You've got right now cheap money
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:32.240]   everywhere. You've got low unemployment everywhere. You've got stock market through the roof.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:43.200]   How do those things continue consistently in the next decade? This is the time to be cutting back.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:48.480]   This is the time to be saving. This is the time to be stockpiling and getting ready because at
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   some point those trends will turn. At some point, money will be more expensive. At some point,
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:02.800]   and unemployment will go up. At some point, stock market will go down. Who knows when? I don't.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.600]   You probably don't either, but you can at least feel that. So take a moment of introspection
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.560]   when you read something like this. Don't blame it and say, "Okay, #BernieBro,
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.160]   got to vote in a solution." How are you going to vote in anything better than today?
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:25.200]   Look at your own life and say, "Is there anything I can be doing differently now?"
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:30.400]   Because if I can't be doing, if I'm not doing well when things are going well,
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:34.560]   how do I expect to be doing well when things aren't going well?
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:43.920]   This is time for introspection. Don't do what these 6,000 commenters are doing. Think a little bit.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:54.400]   If you and I can't get rich in America, it's hard to see how it works anywhere. I mean,
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:01.040]   just simply, especially on expenses. We can all face challenges with income and there are some
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.600]   structural expenses that are high in the United States like taxes. But when you get to expenses
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:12.080]   like stuff, this last weekend I bought some plastic boxes for the children's toys because
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:15.200]   they were cardboard boxes and they were just making a mess and I got tired of it and said,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.240]   "That's it." I went and paid retail for plastic boxes. My wife's comment was, "I don't know if
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.360]   I can get used to not having this stuff on the side of the road." In America, it just sits there
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:31.440]   on the side of the road, free, free for you, free food, free boxes, free everything, just sitting
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:36.560]   there. If you can't do that and figure out how to lower your income or your expenses, I don't know
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:43.440]   where you do it. Last thing is this. Recognize that there are some people who are just truly
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:50.480]   ignorant and your heart goes out to them because how do they function in a modern world? One
[00:23:50.480 --> 00:23:58.080]   commenter writes here, Bizzabel writes this, "The average US adult, I'm sure, doesn't make $1,500
[00:23:58.080 --> 00:24:05.040]   a month, especially in low-income states like Oklahoma." I repeat, this person says this,
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:12.160]   "The average US adult, I'm sure, doesn't make $1,500 a month, especially in low-income states
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:19.680]   like Oklahoma." Now, what's amazing is that somebody could think that and believe that.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:26.480]   First of all, of course, it's easily most obviously disproven. The median household
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.760]   income in the United States of America is $61,000 and an adult, it's very hard to live.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.160]   How could you not make $1,500 a month and live? It's tough, tough. Possible,
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:45.600]   no few people, disabled, living on $700 a month, it's possible, but it's wildly inaccurate.
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:52.240]   And yet this is what a competent, I guess I shouldn't necessarily use that adjective,
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:58.800]   but an adult woman believes. So the financial literacy that we face is so low,
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:02.720]   it's hard to know what to do with it. Anyway, I'll stop complaining. I just want to point out to you
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:10.560]   this. Pay attention. If this ratioing of just some of a silly little thing is reflective,
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.400]   just pay attention to that. Watch the mob with pitchforks. Number two, this is the time. This
[00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   is the time to cut back. This is the time to save. This is the time to make more. This is the time to
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.400]   change jobs. If you haven't changed jobs in the last couple of years, but you're not making as
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:31.280]   much as you think you need to or something like that, this is the time. If you're not buying the
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.400]   stuff while it's that you need, while it's cheap, this is the time. This is the time right now.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:43.120]   Things are good. If they're not good for you, make sure you understand why.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:52.240]   Because in the future, things will not be good. My hope is if you do the right things today,
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.480]   that even when things aren't good, things can still be good for you.
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:00.240]   I guess today I'll advertise my how to survive and thrive during the coming economic crisis
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:03.760]   course. If you haven't taken it, you really should. I don't know what to say other than that.
