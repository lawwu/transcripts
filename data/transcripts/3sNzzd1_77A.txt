[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.680]   We end week number 500 on the podcast today.
[00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.400]   And we end it with a sharp Bible question
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.800]   from a listener named Derek, who lives in Seattle.
[00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.840]   Pastor John, hello.
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.840]   I have a Bible question for you about the new birth.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:20.200]   Peter wrote that believers are born again,
[00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.240]   not of perishable seed, but of imperishable
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.920]   through the living and abiding word of God.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.800]   That's 1 Peter 1.23.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.600]   In the gospel of John, Jesus says,
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.480]   "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.040]   he cannot enter the kingdom of God," John 3.5.
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.320]   Can you help me understand the truth
[00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.120]   that these verses are totally compatible?
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.400]   Romans 10.17 and James 1.21 also mention
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.200]   the saving power of the word heard and implanted,
[00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.160]   but surely not in a way that minimizes
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.520]   the work of the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.520]   The question then follows, how do the Holy Spirit
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.760]   and the word of God collaborate in the new birth?
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.880]   Great question. Yeah.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.960]   Well, let's start by reminding ourselves
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.400]   that the reason we must be born again,
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.360]   however it happens, the reason we must be born again
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.880]   in order to see the kingdom of God, like Jesus says,
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.960]   is because by nature, by birth,
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.480]   we are all spiritually dead.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.120]   This is the way Paul describes it in Ephesians 2.4,
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   where he says that even when we were dead in trespasses,
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.520]   God made us alive in Christ Jesus.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   Now, that making alive is the same as the new birth
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.120]   in different language.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:53.760]   Every human being has fallen in Adam and Eve,
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.720]   in Adam and comes into the world
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.280]   without any saving spiritual life at all.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.120]   We are dead.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.000]   We are by nature resistant to God.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.480]   We do not submit to him by nature.
[00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   We value things that he has made more than him by nature.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.680]   And we do not have the spiritual capacities
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.560]   to see Christ as supremely valuable and true
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.320]   and better than anything in the world.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:24.800]   Nothing of that do we have by nature.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.480]   Unless we feel the weight of the lostness and fallenness,
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.480]   deadness of all humans, especially ourselves,
[00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.120]   nothing about the new birth is gonna make sense
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.960]   in the New Testament.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.920]   So all of that means if we're gonna live,
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:41.920]   if we're gonna know God,
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.840]   if we're gonna be happy forever,
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.220]   we must have new life.
[00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.920]   That is new birth, new creation.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.400]   So what Derek is asking now is how
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.640]   the Spirit of God and the Word of God function together
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.240]   to bring us out of this deadness
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.240]   into new eternal life of knowing and enjoying God forever.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.280]   And Derek refers to the words of Jesus in John 3,
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.840]   so let's start there.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.280]   Jesus said to Nicodemus, John 3, verse 3, we'll start there.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.720]   "Truly I say to you, unless one is born again,
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.120]   he cannot see the kingdom of God."
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.000]   Then I'll jump to verse 6.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.840]   "That which is born of the flesh is flesh,
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.560]   that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.640]   Do not marvel that I say to you, you must be born again.
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.840]   The wind blows where it wishes, you hear the sound,
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.240]   but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   So is everyone who is born of the Spirit."
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:54.160]   So to be born of the flesh is the first birth
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.400]   that we've all experienced.
[00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.320]   If you're alive, you were born.
[00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.720]   And he says that to be born first in that way
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.600]   that we've all been born is to be no more
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.040]   than a fallen human being.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.120]   That which is born of the flesh is flesh.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.320]   That's all it is.
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.120]   Something more must happen for us
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.360]   if we are to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.360]   And Jesus describes that more as a birth by the Spirit.
[00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.080]   And then he compares the work of the Spirit
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:30.600]   in the new birth to the blowing of the wind.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.760]   The wind blows where it wishes,
[00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.840]   and you hear the sound of it,
[00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.960]   and you don't know where it comes from or where it goes.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.000]   So it is with everyone born of the Spirit,
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.800]   which means the Spirit is as free
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.880]   in his regenerating new birth work,
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:51.760]   and he's as mysterious in that work as the unseen wind.
[00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.160]   You don't control the wind.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.960]   You don't make the wind come.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.840]   You don't make the wind go.
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.440]   It just comes, it goes, it does what it does,
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.800]   and that's the way it is with God's sovereign Spirit
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.320]   in whom he makes alive and gives new birth.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.400]   We didn't make our first birth.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.240]   We don't make our second birth.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.080]   We don't raise ourselves from the dead.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.280]   We don't create new life in our souls.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.600]   It is a gift.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:20.120]   It's a miracle of God.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.000]   We don't initiate it.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.920]   We don't control it.
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.400]   It's the sovereign, mysterious work
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.200]   of the Holy Spirit of God.
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   Our first conscious, conscious experience
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   of this new birth is the arising in our hearts
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:41.880]   of faith in Christ.
[00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:44.240]   You might say that the first cry
[00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.200]   of the newborn Christian infant is the cry of faith.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.000]   Instead of, "Wah, wah, wah,"
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.800]   the heart feels, "I see him.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:53.760]   "He's beautiful.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.600]   "I love him.
[00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:55.440]   "I want him.
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.280]   "I need him.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.120]   "He's my Savior."
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.320]   That's the cry of the new birth.
[00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.840]   Then Paul says, "Nobody can say Jesus is Lord
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.200]   "except by the Holy Spirit."
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.520]   So that baby cries, "Jesus is my Lord."
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.200]   And he says that the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:18.320]   coming into our lives is that we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.320]   So even though the work of the Holy Spirit is unseen
[00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:27.160]   and outside our control,
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.400]   the evidence of his work is manifest.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.400]   We see the glory of Christ as desirable and believable,
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.640]   and we embrace him as our Savior, our Lord, our treasure.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.320]   That's the evidence of the new birth in our life.
[00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.040]   Christ is now real to us and precious to us
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:53.240]   and trustworthy to us and authoritative for us.
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.440]   We have been made alive, born again.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.920]   That's the work of the Spirit.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.760]   But now you can see right away,
[00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:07.040]   by the very nature of what's happened,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   that this implies something about the Word.
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:16.080]   If we are now believing in Jesus because of our new birth,
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.680]   and that's the first cry of the newborn instant,
[00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.880]   then we're seeing him as true and real and valuable.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.240]   Where?
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.840]   Where do we see him?
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.600]   The Holy Spirit does not whisper the gospel in our ear.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.640]   We have to hear about him in the gospel.
[00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:42.440]   So Paul says in Romans 10 that faith comes by hearing
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.080]   and hearing by the Word of Christ.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.720]   So what we learn then is that faith is a work
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.680]   of the Holy Spirit in new birth,
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.480]   according to Ephesians 2, 8, and 9,
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.480]   and faith is the effect of hearing the Word of God.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.240]   Faith comes from the new birth by the Spirit,
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.040]   and faith comes from the Word.
[00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.920]   And that's where 1 Peter 1, 23 comes in,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:16.160]   to connect Word and Spirit in the new birth.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.600]   Peter says, "You have been born again,
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:25.600]   not of perishable seed, but of imperishable."
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.560]   That's the Spirit of God.
[00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:32.560]   Through, he says, through the living
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.960]   and abiding Word of God.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   So born of the Spirit, born through the Word.
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:46.160]   So what we see is that the sovereign Spirit of God
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:51.880]   binds himself to the Word of God because his work,
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.680]   his primary work, as Jesus said in John 16, 14,
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:59.760]   is to glorify the Son of God who is manifest
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:02.480]   in the preaching of the Word of God.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   The Holy Spirit does not move willy-nilly,
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:12.280]   randomly, through the world, touching random people
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.480]   with the new birth who've never heard the gospel
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.000]   without any reference to the Word of God at all.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.680]   No, he doesn't do that.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   He moves in tandem with the preaching of the gospel
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:29.440]   and the reason he does is that his primary mission,
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:33.840]   according to John 6, 14, is to glorify the Son of God.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.920]   And if he just made people alive who've never heard
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:41.280]   of the Son of God, they wouldn't be glorifying
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.680]   the Son of God with their new life.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.080]   New life is bound to the Word of God
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.560]   because new life is meant to glorify the Son of God
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.320]   and we hear about the Son of God
[00:09:56.320 --> 00:09:59.560]   in the Word of God, the gospel.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:02.160]   We see an example of this in Acts 16, 14,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.960]   where Paul is preaching to Lydia
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:07.520]   and the other women there by the river
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.520]   and it says, "The Lord opened her heart
[00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:19.080]   "to give heed to what was said by Paul."
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:24.080]   So you have the Word spoken, preached by a human being,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.840]   Paul, and you have the divine work of God
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.840]   opening the heart to give heed and to give new life
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.080]   so that she can understand and receive
[00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:40.080]   the preciousness of the gospel.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.080]   So the implication for us is that our essential role
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:51.640]   in salvation is to speak the Word of God
[00:10:51.640 --> 00:10:57.160]   and then trust the Spirit of God to do the work,
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:01.080]   the heart work called the new birth.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.240]   We don't cause the new birth in ourselves
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.160]   or in anybody else and we don't cause it
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:12.960]   in those we're preaching the gospel to.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.960]   The role we have, and it is an absolutely essential role,
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.320]   is to speak faithfully the Word of God.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:26.920]   Paul asks in Romans 10, verse 14,
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:32.960]   "How are they to believe in him whom they've never heard?
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:39.680]   "And how are they to hear without someone preaching?"
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:42.360]   So faith comes from hearing
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.760]   and hearing through the Word of Christ, he says.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.760]   So my prayer for us is, may the Lord give us great boldness
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:57.880]   and faithfulness and confidence
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:02.100]   that when we speak the Word of God,
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:06.940]   the Spirit of God will give life
[00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:11.640]   and glorify the Son of God through the awakening of faith.
