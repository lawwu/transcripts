[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.960]   Back in April, we surveyed readers of DesiringGod.org.
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.400]   8,000 of you responded.
[00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.520]   Thank you for the amazing amount of input you gave us.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:17.700]   And of the total responses we received,
[00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.000]   over 50% of those who have a smartphone
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.200]   admit to checking their phones within minutes
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.360]   of waking up in a typical morning.
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:30.220]   Among readers 18 to 29, that number is over 60%.
[00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.040]   Most of us know a pattern like this,
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.940]   of checking email and texts and social media on our phones
[00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.980]   immediately in the morning is not a healthy pattern,
[00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.480]   but we do it anyways, Pastor John.
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.840]   So why do you think grabbing for our phones in the morning
[00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.640]   is a default reaction for many of us?
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:47.700]   And do you have a better way forward?
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.380]   I think there is a better course,
[00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.480]   but to help everybody understand why I think that
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.280]   and what that better course is,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.400]   it might be helpful to start,
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.840]   and maybe this would be today's podcast,
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.780]   to start by analyzing why we are so prone
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.400]   to click on our phones before we do almost anything else.
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.760]   So I thought of six possible reasons why we do this.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.640]   And I got these reasons out of my head
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.060]   by analyzing John Piper's soul and his temptations.
[00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.780]   I haven't done any surveys,
[00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.780]   so if people think this is narrow,
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:28.860]   they say, "Well, yeah, it is.
[00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.560]   It comes out of me, and if people are like me,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.020]   then they might get help."
[00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.300]   It seems to me that all of these six things,
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.180]   I'm going to say, are rooted in sin
[00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.900]   rather than rooted in the desire to serve others
[00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:44.700]   and savor God.
[00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.460]   And I put it like that because I do think
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.460]   the great commandment does set the agenda for our mornings
[00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.060]   and our midday and our evening.
[00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.100]   We are to love God with all of our heart, soul, mind,
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.680]   strength when we wake up in the morning.
[00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.540]   And we are to prepare ourselves to love our neighbor,
[00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.160]   serve our neighbor as ourselves.
[00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.980]   And given how sinful John Piper is,
[00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.560]   and I presume others are like me,
[00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.560]   very few of us wake up with our whole soul spring-loaded
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.500]   to love God and love people.
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.180]   This takes some refocusing, to put it mildly.
[00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.500]   This takes some focusing of our souls
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.780]   by means of the Word of God and prayer.
[00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.500]   We have to remind ourselves about reality in the morning
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.220]   in order to begin to love God and love people
[00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.080]   the way we ought.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.080]   So here are my six guesses for why so many of us
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.220]   are drawn almost addictively to consult with our phones
[00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.740]   or devices when we wake up in the morning.
[00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.280]   And the first three I call candy motives.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.660]   And the second three I call avoidance motives.
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.580]   So first, I think we love to immediately take a bite
[00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.300]   of candy from our phones for our novelty hunger.
[00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.220]   Call this novelty candy.
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:20.140]   We simply love to hear what's new in the world
[00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.740]   or among our friends.
[00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:23.460]   What has happened since the last time
[00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.300]   we glanced at the world?
[00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:29.140]   Most of us like to be the first one to know something,
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.980]   and then we don't have to assume the humble posture
[00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.500]   of being told something that smart and savvy
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.200]   and on-the-ball people already know,
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.140]   unlike us who didn't know.
[00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.000]   And so we want to be quick and have knowledge
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.780]   of what's new in the world.
[00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.740]   Then maybe we can assume the role of being the informer
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.460]   rather than the poor, benighted people
[00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:53.780]   that need to be informed about what happened.
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.180]   And if they were smart enough,
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.200]   they would have been on their social media earlier.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.300]   So there's a big ego trip, I think, in our novelty hunger.
[00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.340]   Second, I think we love to immediately take a bite
[00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.600]   out of our candy for ego hunger,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.520]   our candy phone for ego hunger.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.040]   What have people said about us
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.160]   since the last time we checked?
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.280]   Who has taken note of us?
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.100]   Who has retweeted us or mentioned us
[00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:26.760]   or liked us or followed us?
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.580]   In our fallen sinful condition,
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.580]   there is an inordinate enjoyment
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.260]   of the human ego being attended to.
[00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.760]   Some of us are weak enough, wounded enough,
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   fragile enough, insecure enough
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.920]   that any little mention of us just feels so good.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.420]   It's like somebody kissed us.
[00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:55.460]   Third, I think we love to immediately take a bite
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.660]   out of our candy for our entertainment hunger.
[00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.240]   So this is entertainment candy.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:05.200]   There is on the internet, as we've all come to know,
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.080]   an endless stream of fascinating, weird, strange,
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.080]   wonderful, shocking, spellbinding, cute pictures
[00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   and quotes and videos and stories and links.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.600]   And many of us have gotten to the point
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.880]   where we're almost addicted to the need
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.180]   of something striking and bizarre
[00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.520]   and extraordinary and amazing.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:33.000]   So at least those three candy motives, I think,
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.360]   are at work as we wake up in the morning
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.360]   and have these cravings that we satisfy with our phones.
[00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.520]   Then there are these three avoidance motives.
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.040]   In other words, these aren't positive desires for something.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:51.360]   These are facing things in life
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.760]   that we simply want to avoid for another five minutes.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.680]   First, I would call it the boredom avoidance.
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:58.720]   We'd wake up in the morning,
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.160]   we find that the day in front of us simply looks boring.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.240]   It feels boring.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.200]   There's nothing exciting about coming in our day
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.360]   and little incentive to get out of bed.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:12.400]   And of course, the human soul hates a vacuum.
[00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.440]   And if there's nothing significant and positive
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.640]   and hopeful in front of us
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.760]   to fill the hope-shaped place in our souls,
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.640]   then we're gonna use our phones, perhaps,
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.040]   quickly to fill that hole
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.380]   and avoid having to step into all that boredom.
[00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.000]   Second, there is the responsibility avoidance.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We have a role, father, mother, boss, whatever.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.640]   There are burdens that are coming to us in the day
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.500]   that are fairly weighty.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:45.040]   The buck stops with us.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:49.200]   Many decisions have to be made about our children,
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.460]   the house, the car, the finances, dozens of other things.
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.280]   Life is full of weighty responsibilities
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:59.040]   and we feel inadequate for them.
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.680]   And we're lying there in bed feeling fearful,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.160]   and maybe even resentful
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:05.340]   that people put so much pressure on us.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:08.680]   And we just are not attracted to this day at all.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:10.800]   And we would very happily avoid it
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.240]   for another five or 10 minutes.
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:15.440]   And there's the phone to help us do it.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:20.200]   And the third avoidance incentive is hardship avoidance.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.020]   You may be in a season of life
[00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:26.140]   where what you meet when you get out of bed
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.800]   is not just boredom and not just responsibility,
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.080]   but you meet mega relational conflict
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.080]   or issues of disease or disability in the home
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.600]   or friends who are against you
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.760]   or pain in your own body and your joints
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:46.760]   that you can barely get out of bed
[00:07:46.760 --> 00:07:48.720]   because it hurts so bad in the morning.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:51.980]   And it's just easier to lie there a little longer
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:55.480]   and the phone adds to the escape.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.640]   So those, Tony, are at least six of the things
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.000]   I thought of that are functioning probably in my incentive
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.680]   when I'm inclined to go there first before something else.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.200]   And so there is a better way forward
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.240]   and I've probably used too much time on this.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:14.440]   So maybe we'll have to do the better way at another time.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.820]   - Yeah, let's do that tomorrow.
[00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:16.960]   This is Gold Pastor John.
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:18.720]   Thank you for your response here
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.240]   in helping us think through these issues.
[00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:22.440]   If you have a specific question about technology
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.080]   and technology habits in your life,
[00:08:24.080 --> 00:08:26.960]   we would love to get those questions from you.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:31.960]   Send them to us via email at askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:34.640]   For everything you need to know about this podcast,
