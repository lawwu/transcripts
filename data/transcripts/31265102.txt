[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.620]   - Hello friends,
[00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.280]   and welcome to this episode of the Everyday Educator.
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.640]   My name is Kelly Wilt,
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.120]   and today I have the pleasure of interviewing
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.780]   some of my very favorite people.
[00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.440]   I currently serve as a curriculum developer
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.360]   with Classical Conversations Multimedia.
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.000]   And one of the joys of that position
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.440]   is that I also have the blessing of emceeing
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.320]   Classical Conversations National Memory Master Competition.
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.440]   So you may have heard in the past
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.300]   some things about National Memory Master.
[00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.480]   Do these students draw the world from memory?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.720]   Do they recite the timeline backwards?
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.640]   Do they know all the memory work from all three cycles?
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.560]   Well, the answers to those three questions are yes,
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.880]   yes, and yes, and we'll be answering those questions
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.240]   and more on today's podcast.
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:06.320]   I am excited to have with me Ewan Fisher,
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.960]   who is our 2024 National Memory Master Champion,
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.720]   along with his mom, Kim.
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.740]   And today they are our very special guests
[00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.640]   on this episode of the Everyday Educator.
[00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.680]   So Ewan and Kim, first of all, let me say welcome.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.640]   And Kim, why don't you take a minute
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.960]   to introduce your family to our listening audience?
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.040]   - Hi, we live in Texas.
[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.880]   We've been a part of CC for several years,
[00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.920]   and we have loved the Memory Master process
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.880]   and the National Memory Master process.
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.800]   My husband is a math professor,
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:50.800]   and we have a dog named Lizzie Bennett,
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.840]   for you Pride and Prejudice fans out there.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.840]   - Love it, love it.
[00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.520]   - And we have 33 chickens that also have literary names,
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.280]   and we have a cat named Lily Wingfeather,
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.880]   for the Wingfeather Saga friends out there.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.440]   So we love homeschooling and we love reading,
[00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.840]   and we love being together.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.480]   - Oh, all good things, all good things.
[00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.360]   So first of all, Ewan, let me say congratulations
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.360]   on being named the 2024 National Memory Master Champion.
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.760]   After all the preparation you did beforehand,
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.880]   as well as the pressures of the competition,
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.720]   how did it feel when you heard your name
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.640]   announced as the winner?
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.640]   - Well, I was incredulous.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:39.800]   (laughing)
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.960]   - I love that word.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.680]   Tell me more, how did it feel?
[00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.320]   I remember, well, I was there to see your face,
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.960]   and you're right, you did look incredulous.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.120]   Were you surprised?
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.280]   Were you excited?
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.160]   How did it make you feel?
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.280]   - Both surprised and excited.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.600]   (laughing)
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.440]   - So good.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.680]   Well, this year's competition,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.680]   we had something new happen that had never happened before.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.080]   In our round two of National Memory Master,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.000]   we actually had five finalists move forward
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.360]   rather than our typical four.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.240]   So Ewan was one of our five finalists,
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:26.240]   and he did a great job with his presentations in round two
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.080]   after being completely flawless
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.320]   with remembering his memory work and timeline in round one.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.160]   I love that word, incredulous.
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.680]   So, Kim, Classical Conversations is a family
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.960]   made up of families, and that is evident
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.000]   by the way that we love each other,
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.600]   and we support each other at National Memory Master
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.200]   before, and during, and after the competition.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.600]   So tell us, how did you find out about CC,
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.880]   and what is your family's CC story?
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.240]   - We first started homeschooling about 12 years ago,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:06.200]   and my husband's job took us to Texas,
[00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:09.520]   and I did my first information meeting over the phone
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.520]   with a CC director, and I knew that my kids,
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.760]   that small children, that young children,
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.120]   that they had this ability to memorize things,
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.960]   and I had it on my heart that I wanted them
[00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.400]   to put good things in their heart
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.880]   and to memorize good things,
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.880]   and so the classical model, the trivium, the grammar stage,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:35.760]   my kids were there, and I saw that there was an opportunity
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.040]   for great benefit, that they could memorize good things,
[00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.080]   and I liked the structure of how CC
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.560]   systematically helped them learn good things
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.320]   and how they could learn how to learn,
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.920]   and when we moved to Texas and started CC,
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.520]   I was so supported by the CC community,
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.120]   and over the last 10 years in CC,
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.760]   that's just been such a blessing.
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.480]   All the families and all the people that we have met
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.980]   and how they've been such an encouragement along the way.
[00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.980]   - Oh, that's so wonderful.
[00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.800]   It's so great to hear that from the very beginning,
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:14.800]   you felt supported, because I really do think
[00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.760]   that community is one of the aspects
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.440]   of classical conversations that is truly valuable,
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.000]   especially when we're beginning homeschooling
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.360]   and trying to find the right path for our families.
[00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.880]   Now, Ewan, this fall, you are gonna be headed
[00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:31.920]   into a new world, my friend.
[00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.920]   Challenge A, how old were you when you started Foundations?
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.120]   - I was four years old.
[00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.280]   - Oh my goodness, were you a memory master
[00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.800]   from the very beginning,
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.320]   or was this something you decided to do later?
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.000]   - I started doing memory master four years ago,
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:54.640]   and I've done it every year since,
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.080]   so I've done it four times.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.920]   - Awesome.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.360]   So what made you decide to send in an entry
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.360]   to National Memory Master this year?
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   - My older sisters, Evelyn and Marianne,
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:10.080]   were also both chosen as National Memory Master finalists.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.480]   - Ah, okay.
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.480]   - And it was a really great experience for them.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.560]   - Oh, I'm so glad to hear that.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.040]   I'm so glad to hear that.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.840]   So in full disclosure, I do know Ewan's two older sisters.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.640]   Evelyn was scheduled to be a finalist in the year 2020,
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:32.080]   and unfortunately, that was the year
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.840]   that everything turned upside down with COVID,
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.880]   and the competition, unfortunately,
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:39.240]   had to be canceled due to that.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.320]   And Marianne was one of our finalists in 2022,
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.640]   did an outstanding job.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.840]   So I was really excited, Ewan,
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:52.840]   when I saw that you had also decided to compete this year.
[00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.080]   Kim, was pursuing National Memory Master
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.440]   something you encouraged Ewan to do,
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.560]   or was it mostly his idea?
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.600]   And tell us, what was creating a video entry like
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.400]   for you and for your family?
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:07.600]   - Well, we first heard about National Memory Master,
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   I saw it in some CC advertisements several years ago
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   before my oldest was even eligible,
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.240]   and I mentioned it to her at the time,
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.960]   and she said, "That sounds like so much fun."
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:18.800]   - Yes.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.960]   - And when I see challenges, I think,
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.600]   "Ooh, that looks like a really neat opportunity."
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:27.360]   And so, and my oldest was really excited about it,
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:30.840]   and the process of creating the video,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.840]   I realized that it's the last part of names,
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:35.920]   you know, those habits of grammar,
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.840]   the storytelling, taking what you have learned,
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:40.420]   and taking what you have memorized,
[00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.880]   and expressing it, and telling it in a story.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.560]   And creating the video audition,
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.400]   it was such a rewarding experience,
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.260]   she learned so much, she had a great time.
[00:07:50.260 --> 00:07:54.720]   And she was chosen as a finalist, we were so excited,
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.220]   and even though it was canceled,
[00:07:56.220 --> 00:07:58.520]   the friendships that she made with that group of kids
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.280]   are still a blessing to her.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:02.840]   So when it came time for Marianne's turn,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.000]   and we said, "Do you wanna do this?"
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.840]   And she said, "Absolutely."
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:10.840]   And so, again, you know, the video was a lot of work,
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:14.160]   but there's so many valuable lessons
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:18.520]   in learning to speak and storytell from memory,
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:20.040]   and learning to look at the camera,
[00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.640]   and learning to keep your body still,
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:24.520]   and learning to use dynamics
[00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.560]   when you're speaking to tell a story,
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:28.120]   learning to use good body language
[00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.080]   when you're trying to speak and tell a story.
[00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.320]   And again, it was a really rewarding experience
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.680]   to create the video, and then being chosen to compete,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.760]   for her, she actually got to go.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:40.520]   She was in the top four, and she did a fantastic job,
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.440]   I was so proud of her.
[00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:45.340]   And after the fact, even though she didn't win,
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:48.560]   she came away with some wonderful friendships,
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.400]   and still is pen pals with some of her great friends
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.480]   from that 2022 year.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.160]   And if they're listening, it's, hi everyone,
[00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.800]   they are such a great group of families.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.960]   And I think Ewan saw his sisters going through this,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.120]   and I don't know if he paid attention
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.120]   to all the work they did or not.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.960]   (laughing)
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.920]   If he just saw how they had such a good time,
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:14.960]   and they made good friends, and so he was excited.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:16.320]   We said, do you wanna do this too?
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:19.560]   You don't have to, and he said yes.
[00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:23.000]   So he went through the process of memory mastering early,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.240]   and then again, the video was a fantastic experience.
[00:09:26.240 --> 00:09:30.480]   So for our family, we saw the video
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:32.400]   just really as a capstone experience
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:33.680]   for the Foundations of Program,
[00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:35.400]   just kind of taking all that you've learned
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.960]   and telling a fun story with it.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:40.260]   And for each of them,
[00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.100]   we probably took over 30 takes of the video.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.800]   (laughing)
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:47.920]   So many fun memories of, well, the dog barked,
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.320]   or the doorbell rang, or all kinds of things
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.920]   that can go wrong, but being able to get a good take
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.560]   where they felt like, I said that my best,
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.200]   we were under the time limit, I didn't move around,
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.000]   I looked at the camera the whole time,
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.600]   and those are all such good skills to learn.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:10.160]   And so it, oh, and there's a couple times,
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.320]   the parents have to say some things to you on the video,
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.720]   and we did have a couple of takes
[00:10:13.720 --> 00:10:16.920]   that were not good because mom messed up.
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:19.000]   (laughing)
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Ewan reminded me of that just now.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.480]   They thought that was pretty funny.
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:25.080]   But it was just a good experience,
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:26.080]   a great learning experience,
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:29.560]   but it was definitely, it involved the whole family
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:32.080]   working together to do that.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.880]   So I think he was really inspired
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.120]   by the great experience that his older sisters had,
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.080]   and he says, "I want to do that too."
[00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:40.680]   - Oh, I love that, I love that.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.360]   So listening to you speak,
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:46.480]   I almost feel as if we need to schedule a separate podcast
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.880]   just so you can give tips and tricks (laughing)
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.080]   to families who are thinking about
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:54.480]   doing National Memory Master in the future,
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.600]   and maybe you're intimidated by the process
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.360]   of putting together that video entry
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.360]   because after helping shepherd three children
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.800]   through that experience,
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.560]   I know that you are a wealth of wisdom
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.200]   about what to do and what not to do
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.040]   when preparing a National Memory Master video.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.880]   That's so wonderful.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.280]   And I also love one of the things you've said
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.840]   about relationships that are cultivated
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:19.160]   at National Memory Master.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.080]   That is so very true,
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:25.120]   because I heard several people say, even this year,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:26.680]   that they came for the competition,
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.400]   but they stayed for the relationships
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.680]   and the friendships that were made from it.
[00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.800]   And what a blessing that is to see
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.680]   that even in the midst of competing for a title
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.520]   and for a prize, that those relationships were key,
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:46.680]   and that they were the thing that was the ultimate priority,
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.480]   even in the midst of the competition.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.320]   So wonderful.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.560]   Well, Ewan, I know it takes a lot of hard work
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:55.360]   to become a National Memory Master.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.440]   So when you found out that your video
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:01.160]   had been selected as a finalist video,
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:02.600]   and it was so wonderful,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.080]   if you're listening to this podcast,
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:07.160]   you definitely need to go to the CC website
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.080]   and watch Ewan's video.
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:10.920]   It alludes to "The Lord of the Rings."
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:14.480]   So if that entices you, please go take a look.
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.920]   But Ewan, once you found out
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.840]   that you were gonna be coming to the competition,
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.640]   what kinds of things did you do
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:24.600]   to help you be able to prepare?
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.600]   - Well, I drew a map of the world every day for a while.
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:31.000]   - Wow.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.320]   - And I also worked on learning the timeline,
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.480]   both forwards and backwards, every day.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:42.080]   And I also got quizzed by family members a lot.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.760]   (laughing)
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:45.080]   - Did they take turns?
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:47.360]   - Yes.
[00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.600]   - So good, so good.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.160]   Well, Kim, we know that pursuing National Memory Master
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:55.840]   is definitely not something a student does all alone.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.320]   So we know that Ewan was definitely not on his own
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.720]   in preparing in this way.
[00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   In what ways did your family and community surround you
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:11.320]   and show support for you and Ewan through this process?
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   - Well, Ewan has had fantastic tutors over his time in CC.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:23.120]   And he had Ms. Lori this year, Ms. Alyssa if you're listening
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:26.320]   and Ms. Sarah and his director, Ms. Ashley,
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:28.440]   and he's had so many good tutors.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:30.400]   And it was some of the memory work
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.760]   that we would come time to review that.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.240]   And he would say, "Oh, I'll never forget that
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:35.720]   "because Ms. Alyssa taught me this, this, and this."
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:36.840]   - Love that.
[00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:39.880]   - I feel like the community is definitely a part of,
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.160]   when you leave that community day,
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:44.720]   that memory work is already on its way in
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:47.280]   because of all the work that the tutors do.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:48.720]   And what were you gonna say?
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.600]   Were you gonna add something to that, Ewan?
[00:13:50.600 --> 00:13:53.840]   - I think that it was the,
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.520]   all the different first conjugation endings.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.760]   - Oh, that Ms. Alyssa helped me with.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.720]   - That was Ms. Alyssa's part.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.320]   (all laughing)
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:04.960]   But that was like a little saying for everyone.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:09.960]   Like, there's such and such like manages to work it in.
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.320]   - So through that Foundations program,
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.480]   just lots of tools to learn things
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.600]   and tools to learn things well.
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:20.560]   So I think one of the things that I would encourage anyone
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:22.480]   who thinks that preparing for National Memory Master
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:25.200]   is overwhelming, and I think Ewan would probably agree
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.600]   that once he found out that he was chosen,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.440]   it was pretty overwhelming.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:32.240]   And I think as his,
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.880]   I felt like my job was to kind of sit down
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.040]   and say, all right, we're gonna draw the map of the world,
[00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:40.160]   and this is overwhelming.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:42.840]   I want you to put down everything you could add in,
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.640]   and then we'll be done.
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.720]   And then tomorrow, he did a little bit more.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.120]   And initially, for him to put all that memory work in,
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.800]   it took a very, very long time,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:52.480]   much longer than the time limit.
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.080]   But every day, he was a little faster,
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.240]   and he did a little bit more.
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.680]   And I think that's one of the things I'm most proud of,
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.600]   of the growth, just that,
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.760]   and I think this is something that the classical model
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.920]   in CC encourages, is if you have a big task,
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.160]   break it into small pieces,
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.680]   just work on it a little bit every day.
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:12.640]   And every day, he could add more in.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:14.280]   Every day, it looked neater.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:17.080]   Every day, he was faster with the map.
[00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.080]   His older sisters definitely inspired him on the timeline.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.800]   So his older sister, Evelyn, is a classical ballerina,
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.640]   and she's been in the Nutcracker several years.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.920]   And so when she first started learning
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.280]   the timeline backwards several years ago,
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.800]   she learned it to the music of the second act
[00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.640]   of the Nutcracker, which are the divertissements.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:38.720]   And so Marianne, and you know,
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.400]   Ewan has performed in the Nutcracker as a guest,
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:43.040]   just a guest, a little boy guest.
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:44.560]   - Right. - At a party.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.920]   - At a few, several times.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.640]   But, so we know that really well.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.080]   And so for each of them, you know,
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.160]   that overwhelming aspect of learning the timeline backwards,
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.840]   they started by learning it in musical sections
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:58.320]   to the divertissements in the second act of the Nutcracker.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.240]   And from there, and they were instrumental
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:02.240]   in helping him do that.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.840]   He made recordings for himself,
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:07.720]   but his sister, Marianne, also had a fun system
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:09.840]   with the timeline cards that she taught Ewan,
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:12.080]   and that he kind of adapted and made his own.
[00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.960]   Do you wanna talk about how you practiced the timeline
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.160]   with the timeline cards?
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   - Well, we had, we took all the vocabulary cards, actually.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:23.960]   - From IEW. (laughs)
[00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:26.080]   You have their blue, green, and beige, right?
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:26.920]   - Yes. - Yeah.
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:31.880]   So we took those and we would lay them out in circles
[00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:33.440]   for all the different songs.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.080]   And I would have, and I would just have the timeline cards
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.200]   all laid out in a row.
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.200]   And I would just take a few of the timeline cards
[00:16:44.200 --> 00:16:47.880]   in a group, mix it up, and then put it back in order
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:49.400]   as fast as I could.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.920]   - Ah. - It helped.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.200]   - And so the IEW color codes,
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.440]   I know it sounds kind of crazy,
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:59.200]   but they were, each musical section had kind of a color.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.360]   And so he would organize them and rearrange them
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.600]   by musical section, but he had,
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:09.360]   so he had the auditory musical version of the timeline,
[00:17:09.360 --> 00:17:11.920]   but he also had the visual representation of the cards
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:14.200]   that were in order and that he could put in order
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:15.960]   so that he could see it and hear it
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:17.880]   when he was asked to recite.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.520]   - I love that, I love that.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:22.160]   So if you were listening to this episode
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:25.040]   and you were in need of memory tools
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.840]   to help you be able to recite the timeline backwards,
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:30.000]   you just need to listen to "The Nutcracker."
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:31.680]   (laughing)
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.480]   I love it, I love it. - Also.
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:35.120]   - Yes. - Also, unfortunately,
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:37.360]   now this has ruined the second act for me
[00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:39.400]   because every time I hear that music,
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.440]   I start thinking about the timeline.
[00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.040]   - Oh, no. (laughing)
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:48.040]   So every Christmas from now until forever, Ewan,
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:50.320]   you will think about the timeline song
[00:17:50.320 --> 00:17:51.960]   if you hear "The Nutcracker."
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.600]   - I love that, though, as a memory tool.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.760]   Who would have thought?
[00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:58.760]   But I do know we have some tools in our memory work
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:01.080]   that are built in, like our history songs
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:03.840]   and our timeline song to help our students
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.120]   be able to commit things to memory.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:09.480]   And I love the addition of those flashcards,
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:13.880]   even just using the color as a clue to memory.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.600]   It's amazing how God has designed our brains
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:18.440]   to be able to retain information.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.280]   And when we commit that information over time,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:23.560]   just like you were saying,
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.520]   bit by bit, a little more at a time,
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.840]   it's incredible what the Lord has designed us
[00:18:29.840 --> 00:18:31.160]   to be able to retain.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.480]   I love that.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:34.080]   Like I said, I think we definitely need
[00:18:34.080 --> 00:18:35.440]   to schedule another podcast
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.560]   just so you guys can share tips and tricks.
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:40.080]   So Ewan, I wanna talk a little bit
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:43.760]   about your National Memory Master experience.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:45.040]   And before we do that,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:46.600]   I just wanna remind our listeners
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   that round one of National Memory Master is a memory bee.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:55.920]   So during round one, as the emcee of the competition,
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:19:00.360]   I will be calling out questions in different heats
[00:19:00.360 --> 00:19:03.920]   from all three cycles of Foundations Memory Work,
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:05.480]   kind of popcorn style.
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.600]   You never know which cycle a question will come from.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:12.480]   You don't know which subject it will be from.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:15.680]   And then after each of the finalists on the platform
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.800]   have answered a memory work question,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:22.880]   then da, da, da, we go into a timeline heat
[00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:27.840]   where we ask our students to do some mental gymnastics
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:29.760]   related to timeline events,
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.080]   which you've already heard Ewan talk about a little bit
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.000]   in reciting the timeline backwards,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.280]   being prepared to do that.
[00:19:36.280 --> 00:19:37.800]   But Ewan, we did a lot more than that
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:39.840]   at competition this year, didn't we?
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:41.200]   - Yes.
[00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:42.280]   - We did.
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:44.720]   So let's think about round one.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:47.840]   When we did the memory bee portion
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.600]   and everyone was sitting on the chairs on the stage,
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:56.240]   what do you think was the hardest part of that round one?
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:00.240]   - Definitely the timeline questions.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:02.040]   - I had a feeling you were gonna say that.
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:04.040]   So why the timeline questions?
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:10.440]   - I feel like they just asked us to do harder things
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.840]   than memory work. - Maybe give an example.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:16.600]   - As the time you counted forward
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.880]   and then went back saying every card you didn't say.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:23.080]   - That was tough, right?
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.320]   - That was tough.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.160]   - That was tough.
[00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.400]   But the amazing thing is Ewan,
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:30.600]   you didn't make any errors in that part of the competition.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.440]   That was pretty amazing.
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:33.680]   - So when they asked you to do that,
[00:20:33.680 --> 00:20:35.680]   could you see the pictures of the timeline cards
[00:20:35.680 --> 00:20:36.760]   in a row in your head?
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:37.960]   Is that how you were doing it?
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:39.560]   Or how did you do that?
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.600]   - I saw the timeline cards in a row
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   and then mixing that together with songs is, it helps.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:51.240]   - Oh good, that's so good.
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:52.480]   I had a feeling you were gonna say
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:55.120]   the timeline questions were the hardest
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.640]   because we were definitely asking you to do things
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.520]   that are above and beyond what you would do
[00:21:00.520 --> 00:21:03.520]   when you proof for memory master in community.
[00:21:03.520 --> 00:21:06.640]   So you are having to actually think about the events,
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.880]   not just moving forward like you would
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.640]   when you proof for regular community memory master.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.240]   You are having to skip count events.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.120]   I think during one of the questions,
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:20.800]   I asked you to recite events backwards from an event.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:23.120]   So you were assigning backwards.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.560]   And at one point, I think I even asked you
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:28.000]   to recite five events forward
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.880]   and then go back to the original event
[00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:32.920]   and then recite backwards from that event too.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:34.960]   And you did an amazing job.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:38.480]   You and the other finalists who made it to round two
[00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:40.480]   did an incredible job.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:42.280]   - That question you talked about,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:45.000]   was that the one where you said the one in front,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.920]   then the one that you said the one in front of the card,
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.920]   you told us, then the one behind the card you told us.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.120]   - Yes.
[00:21:53.120 --> 00:21:55.240]   - Staying forward and backward alternate.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:58.440]   - Yes, yes, that was tough, wasn't it?
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.280]   - Yes.
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:03.000]   - So Ewan, what helped you?
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.320]   I mean, because we're talking about
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:07.400]   some crazy memory work recitation.
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.720]   What helped you to focus and remember your memory work
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:13.240]   in the different heats?
[00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.400]   Because you're a pretty cool cucumber.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:18.360]   I have to say, like you didn't seem like you were ruffled.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.400]   And I always loved seeing your expression
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.840]   whenever I told you that you got something right,
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.760]   because I think you were surprised at yourself
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:26.600]   and what you were able to do.
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:29.520]   But what helped you to keep your cool,
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   even with all of those things
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.560]   that you were having to think about
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.480]   and calculate forward and backward in your brain?
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:37.920]   Is there anything that you can think of
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:40.880]   that helped you to stay cool even under the pressure?
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.560]   - One thing that really helped
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:47.560]   was trying to mentally answer everybody else's questions.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.640]   - Yes, yes.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.600]   I remember during the competition,
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.160]   at one point I was watching the student
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.920]   who was behind the microphone.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.800]   And then I looked at everyone in the row
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.200]   behind that particular student,
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:04.960]   and I could see you all moving your fingers.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.680]   And I knew that you were all counting timeline events.
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.960]   And I think one of the dearest parts
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.120]   of being the MC is watching the expressions
[00:23:13.120 --> 00:23:15.840]   of the other finalists when they realized,
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:18.800]   before the judges said, "That is correct,"
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.280]   they would realize that their friend
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:24.360]   had gotten that really difficult answer correct.
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.840]   So again, going back to the fact
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.560]   that great relationships are built
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:30.480]   during National Memory Master,
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.160]   and it was so wonderful to see you guys
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   celebrating one another during the competition.
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:41.680]   Kim, as a parent, how did it feel
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.280]   to watch you and tackle these incredibly difficult feats
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:49.120]   of Timeline Gymnastics during round one,
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.920]   and then go on to round two?
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:54.120]   - One of the things that we prayed for for Ewan
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.800]   and that we'd ask others to pray
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:58.560]   was that he'd be able to recite with joy
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.920]   and that what he had learned would come to mind.
[00:24:00.920 --> 00:24:02.800]   And to see him recite,
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:04.680]   and I could tell that he was joyful,
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:07.200]   and you really could watch on the stage
[00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.120]   and you could see that he was cheering for his friends
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.000]   and that they were cheering for him.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:12.840]   - Yes.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.120]   - And that was such an encouragement.
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.680]   Now, all the parents, we were nervous for everybody.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.600]   We really did not want anyone to get out
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.640]   because you knew that all of the 16 finalists
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.960]   knew the memory work and they knew it well.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:29.360]   And we were really cheering for everyone and that helped.
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:34.080]   And I also knew that if he didn't remember something
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:36.800]   or if he made a mistake, that it would be okay.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.680]   And I was confident that he would come away
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.200]   from this experience with a good memory of it,
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.080]   with great friends and a great experience,
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:48.480]   and a feeling that I took a risk
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.720]   and I tried something hard and either was successful
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:55.000]   or it was not successful, but that it was okay.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And I hope that his older sister, when she came away,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.040]   and like I said, she was in the top four as a finalist.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:06.280]   And I think she would tell you
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:08.480]   that it was just such a wonderful experience
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.480]   and that winning wasn't necessary to her happiness.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.080]   So it's a delightful, exciting bonus.
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.720]   (laughing)
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.160]   But it was really rewarding to see him be joyful on stage
[00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.480]   and to see all of the kids cheering for each other
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.920]   and encouraging one another,
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:28.120]   and knowing that that prayer for joy was answered.
[00:25:28.120 --> 00:25:29.280]   - I love that, I love that.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.360]   And I would second that.
[00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:31.880]   You can definitely tell, Ewan,
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.400]   that you were joyful as you recited.
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:40.400]   And I think it is a blessing to see our children delight
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:43.240]   in the giftings that God has given to them.
[00:25:43.240 --> 00:25:45.960]   I think that was really evident on the platform
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:49.040]   as each student recited their memory work
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:54.920]   just to see how happy they were to be there
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:58.720]   and participating and spending time with their friends
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.920]   and celebrating the remarkable accomplishments
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.760]   that were made on that platform.
[00:26:06.760 --> 00:26:10.360]   And also knowing that these accomplishments
[00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:13.480]   were not an overnight decision.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:16.760]   No student that competed this year woke up and said,
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.560]   "I think I'm gonna do National Memory Master today."
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:22.160]   You could tell there were years and years
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.160]   of dedication and commitment,
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:25.560]   not only on the part of the student,
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.800]   but most definitely on the part of each parent
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.000]   that was in that room.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.720]   And so it was just a delight
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:37.200]   to celebrate that accomplishment of each family
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.360]   and not only the students.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.160]   So Ewan, I know we've talked about a lot of hard things,
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.160]   but if you close your eyes and think really hard,
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.200]   what do you think was the most difficult,
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   the hardest part of competing in National Memory Master?
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.360]   - I'm gonna ask, was it the hardest part
[00:26:55.360 --> 00:26:58.120]   before the competition or was the hardest part during?
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:27:00.960]   - Hmm, well if you have an answer for both,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.880]   why don't you give both?
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.080]   That's a really good delineation.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:08.360]   - So hardest part before the competition
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.240]   and hardest part during the competition.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.480]   - Yeah, let's do that.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:14.240]   What was the hardest part before the competition?
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:17.480]   - Before the competition,
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:22.480]   I think it was just trying to keep myself calm
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:29.320]   and just saying, "Calm down, calm down."
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.560]   (laughing)
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:33.640]   - Just wondering what could happen,
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:37.760]   probably trying to keep yourself calm.
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.720]   I can totally identify with that, Ewan.
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.400]   I think that probably would be the most difficult thing
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:46.120]   for me too if I were competing in National Memory Master.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:48.240]   What was the hardest part for you
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.480]   during National Memory Master?
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:53.200]   - I feel like there were two things
[00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.920]   that were harder than the others
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:59.920]   and that was the timeline questions, of course.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.440]   - Yes.
[00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:05.200]   - And also the story.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.440]   - Oh, let's talk a little bit more about that.
[00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.280]   Let's talk a little more about that.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.680]   So what was difficult about the story?
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.240]   Maybe we need to clarify for the people who are listening
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.440]   what you're talking about.
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.200]   In round two, our students,
[00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:20.560]   as part of their competing in round two,
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:23.120]   they're asked to go back to a room
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.880]   and to prepare a story prompt
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:30.160]   similar to what we do when they create an entry,
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:32.560]   a video entry for National Memory Master.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:35.320]   So Ewan, you got 20 minutes
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.600]   to look at 12 pieces of memory work
[00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:41.240]   and then you had to make a story, right?
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:42.360]   - Yes.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:44.680]   - So tell me what was difficult about that.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:50.120]   - It's just, that's one of the hardest things to prepare for.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.240]   I mean--
[00:28:52.240 --> 00:28:54.040]   - 'Cause you don't know what they're gonna choose.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:55.280]   - Yes.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.120]   - Right.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:29:00.640]   - You, I mean, you can get, you can,
[00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:04.560]   what's hard is when practicing,
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.000]   you tend to have people looking over your shoulder and stuff.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.240]   - Right.
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:11.960]   - And helping correct you,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:16.960]   but during the competition, there's just--
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:19.240]   - You're by yourself.
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:22.760]   - Yeah, and it's hard to prepare for that.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:25.280]   - That is true, that is true.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.960]   - It's hard to prepare for doing that by yourself
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:35.160]   when most of the preparing would be with people.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.480]   - Right.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.520]   - So that's hard.
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:40.400]   - Yeah, that is hard.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   And you actually recited all 12 pieces of memory work
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:50.520]   that were given to you when you gave your story prompt.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:52.200]   So that's kind of incredible
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:56.480]   because other parts of round two involve reciting John one,
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.320]   one through seven in Latin and English.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:04.040]   And then also I gave you a point on the timeline
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:07.640]   and you began reciting forward from that point,
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:10.880]   reciting as many timeline events as you could
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.760]   in the time that you were given.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:16.000]   And even after those two parts,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.960]   you were still able to remember those pieces of memory work
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.920]   and weave them into your story.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:25.720]   That in itself is a really incredible act of memory, friend.
[00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.200]   Well done.
[00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:31.400]   So Kim, what benefits do you see for you?
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:34.680]   And I will say this based on your past two experiences
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.960]   with Evelyn and with Marianne,
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.840]   what benefits do you see for them through preparing for
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.480]   and participating in National Memory Master?
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.480]   Now that it's over,
[00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:46.160]   do you look back and think you would do it again?
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.480]   I think I know the answer to that,
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:49.600]   but I'm gonna let you answer that question.
[00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:54.240]   - Part of the reward is really the preparation.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:57.800]   And I've already mentioned that the audition video
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.200]   was such a fantastic learning experience.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:06.200]   Just being asked to speak and to recite in that way,
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.160]   it's such a rewarding, good experience.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.200]   The preparation also,
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:13.520]   I think Ewan and his sisters and our family,
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.600]   it was, we all worked together.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.560]   It was encouraging.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.920]   And having all three participated in that,
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.760]   they have that shared memory and shared experience.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.240]   And of course they have the friendships and the families
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:27.720]   and the encouragement of,
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:30.080]   I had encouragement from the great moms
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:31.280]   that I met both years
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.680]   about moms who are trying to do the same things
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.760]   that are trying to disciple their children
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.440]   and all over the country
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   and all the beautiful ways that they're doing that,
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:41.960]   that's encouraging to you as a mom.
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:45.400]   I think that all three kids are blessed
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.120]   by the experience of seeing a hard, difficult,
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:52.400]   what seems an impossible task
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.800]   and working on it every day,
[00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:56.240]   just a little bit at a time
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.240]   and every day trying to do just a little bit more.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.160]   And for his older sisters,
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:06.000]   it really gave them confidence to try really hard things.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.880]   And when they had opportunities
[00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:10.480]   that came up in the following years,
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.040]   they weren't afraid.
[00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:14.520]   They weren't afraid to try something hard.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.160]   And that's what we want for all of our kids.
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:19.320]   We want them to not be afraid to do something hard,
[00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:20.800]   but then to have the tools
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   and have practiced through ownership and discipline,
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:26.520]   all those themes of talent.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.720]   - Yes.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.200]   - But to have practiced owning,
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:31.800]   this is something I want to do
[00:32:31.800 --> 00:32:34.800]   and kind of living out that daily discipline
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:37.040]   of doing what needs to be done
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:39.840]   and loving what needs to be done,
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.880]   learning to love the things that need to be done
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.240]   in order to do them well.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:48.240]   And when you work hard and when you work for the Lord,
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.560]   then you have something to share.
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:54.800]   And so I'm thankful for that experience
[00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:57.080]   that the National Mermaid Master Space
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:01.000]   created an opportunity to try something hard
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   and the beauty of it and the reward of it
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:04.240]   is not in the winning,
[00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.760]   but is in the process that you went through
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:10.400]   to go through it.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:11.240]   - I love that.
[00:33:11.240 --> 00:33:13.400]   I love learning to love what must be done
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.240]   and what you said earlier.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.080]   - That's actually a quote.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.400]   That's actually a quote from one of the CC students
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:20.000]   who was on the grad panel at National Conference.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.880]   - I think that's so wonderful
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:24.840]   and such a great philosophy to have.
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:28.240]   I mean, for life, period.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:30.120]   But even thinking about preparing for something
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.280]   like this competition,
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:36.160]   seeing, as you said, challenges as an opportunity
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   and just focusing on that mindset is what a difference.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:47.320]   That quote, learning to love what must be done,
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.640]   because if we love what must be done,
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.320]   we see it as an act of love.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:54.520]   We see it as a love offering to the Lord
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.600]   when we do it to the best of our ability.
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:59.240]   It's not for our glory, but it's for His.
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:01.080]   And I think that is so important.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:04.560]   That's one of the things that when we have the competition,
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:07.440]   we really try to emphasize the fact
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.560]   that we are celebrating a love offering
[00:34:10.560 --> 00:34:13.280]   from these students before the Lord.
[00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:18.040]   And what a joy it is to see them come into the competition
[00:34:18.040 --> 00:34:20.800]   already having that understanding and that mindset
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.320]   and that mentality.
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.240]   Just such a testimony to the parents
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.720]   who have instilled that love for the Lord
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.560]   and for learning about His word and His world,
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:35.400]   even prior to the National Memory Master Competition.
[00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:37.200]   Well, our time is almost up,
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:40.920]   but you and I want to give you the last word
[00:34:40.920 --> 00:34:42.600]   in our podcast today.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:45.960]   So if you could give any words of wisdom,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.360]   let's say that there is a foundation student
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.400]   that this fall they're gonna be going
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.760]   to their very last year of foundations
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.800]   and they're on the fence about whether or not
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:00.920]   they should try to do National Memory Master.
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:03.640]   What words of advice would you give to them
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:05.320]   or words of wisdom?
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.280]   Should they do it?
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:10.160]   What advice would you give to them?
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:12.200]   I would encourage it.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:17.080]   It's a fun experience and making the audition videos fun.
[00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   And also when studying, just go, just take,
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:24.240]   just do a little more every day
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.960]   until you've done everything that needs to be done.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.880]   Those are great words of wisdom.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:34.600]   Do a little bit every day
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:38.240]   until what needs to be done is done.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.080]   Excellent.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:42.480]   Well, Ewan, congratulations to you on your win
[00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.000]   and this year's competition.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.440]   I am so excited to see what the Lord
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:49.360]   is going to continue to do in and through your life
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:52.080]   as you move into challenge A in the fall.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:56.280]   And Kim, congratulations to you.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:58.240]   I say this not just for you,
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:01.080]   but also for Mary Ann and for Evelyn.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:04.000]   I just am so grateful for the words of wisdom
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   that you have shared here today.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:10.560]   And who knows, maybe we have lit the fire
[00:36:10.560 --> 00:36:15.040]   of the next round of National Memory Master finalists
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   for 2025 just through what has been shared here today.
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.240]   Thank you both so much.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:25.200]   And thank you Lister for turning into this episode
[00:36:25.200 --> 00:36:26.840]   of The Everyday Educator.
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:30.600]   Our prayer is that you are inspired and encouraged
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:34.440]   and that every day you will strive to be an educator
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:36.760]   that honors and glorifies the Lord.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.680]   Thanks so much.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.200]   We'll see you in the next one.
[00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.920]   (upbeat music)
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.980]   you
