[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (gentle music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:10.920]   - Do you think you can maybe talk through
[00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.720]   the first few months and then on through the first 20 years
[00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.240]   and then for the rest of their lives,
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.760]   what is the development of the human brain look like?
[00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:23.200]   What are the different stages?
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.400]   - Yeah, at the beginning you have to build a brain, right?
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.520]   And the brain is made of cells.
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:30.440]   - What's the very beginning?
[00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.680]   Which beginning are we talking about?
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.000]   - In the embryo.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.680]   As the embryo is developing in the womb,
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.200]   in addition to making all of the other tissues
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.740]   of the embryo, the muscle, the heart, the blood,
[00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.640]   the embryo is also building the brain.
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.160]   And it builds from a very simple structure
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.640]   called the neural tube,
[00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.820]   which is basically nothing but a tube of cells
[00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.440]   that spans sort of the length of the embryo
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.160]   from the head all the way to the tail,
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.580]   let's say, of the embryo.
[00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.200]   And then in human beings, over many months of gestation,
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.680]   from that neural tube,
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.120]   which contains stem cell-like cells of the brain,
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.680]   you will make many, many other building blocks of the brain.
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.280]   So all of the other cell types,
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.560]   'cause there are many, many different types of cells
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.600]   in the brain that will form specific structures
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.440]   of the brain.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.440]   So you can think about embryonic development of the brain
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.280]   as just the time in which you are making
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.120]   the building blocks, the cells.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.300]   - Are the stem cells relatively homogeneous, like uniform,
[00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.000]   or are they all different type?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.840]   - It's a very good question.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.920]   It's exactly how it works.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.840]   You start with a more homogeneous,
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.800]   perhaps more multipotent type of stem cell.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.640]   - What's multipotent?
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.200]   - Multipotent means that it has the potential
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.040]   to make many, many different types of other cells.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.480]   And then with time,
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.080]   these progenitors become more heterogeneous,
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.520]   which means more diverse.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.880]   There are gonna be many different types of the stem cells.
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.440]   And also, they will give rise to progeny,
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.400]   to other cells that are not stem cells,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.000]   that are specific cells of the brain,
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.760]   that are very different from the mother stem cell.
[00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.500]   And now you think about this process of making cells
[00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.980]   from the stem cells over many, many months of development
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.480]   for humans.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.320]   And what you're doing,
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.880]   you're building the cells that physically make the brain,
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.080]   and then you arrange them in specific structures
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.100]   that are present in the final brain.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.360]   So you can think about the embryonic development
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.780]   of the brain as the time where you're building the bricks.
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.200]   You're putting the bricks together to form buildings,
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.800]   structures, regions of the brain,
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.020]   and where you make the connections
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.700]   between these many different type of cells,
[00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.900]   especially nerve cells, neurons, right?
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.920]   That transmit action potentials and electricity.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.540]   - I've heard you also say somewhere,
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:02.940]   I think, correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.800]   that the order of the way this builds matters.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.720]   - Oh, yes.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.520]   If you are an engineer and you think about development,
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:11.840]   you can think of it as,
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.640]   well, I could also take all the cells
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.620]   and bring them all together into a brain in the end.
[00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.980]   But development is much more than that.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.520]   So the cells are made in a very specific order
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.040]   that subserve the final product that you need to get.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.540]   And so, for example, all of the nerve cells,
[00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.880]   the neurons, are made first,
[00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.040]   and all of the supportive cells of the neurons,
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.440]   like the glia, is made later.
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.040]   And there is a reason for that,
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.760]   because they have to assemble together in specific ways.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.600]   But you also may say,
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.360]   well, why don't we just put them all together in the end?
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.600]   It's because as they develop next to each other,
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.920]   they influence their own development.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.860]   So it's a different thing for a glia
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.060]   to be made alone in a dish
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.020]   than a glia cell be made in a developing embryo
[00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.980]   with all these other cells around it
[00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.340]   that produce all these other signals.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.540]   - First of all, that's mind-blowing,
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.460]   this development process.
[00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:10.380]   From my perspective in artificial intelligence,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.100]   you often think of how incredible the final product is,
[00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.840]   the final product, the brain.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.060]   But you're making me realize that the final product
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:22.680]   is just, the beautiful thing
[00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.100]   is the actual development process.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.100]   Do we know the code that drives that development?
[00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.620]   - Yeah.
[00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.500]   - Do we have any sense?
[00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.420]   - First of all, thank you for saying
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.940]   that it's really the formation of the brain.
[00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.300]   It's really its development,
[00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.740]   it's this incredibly choreographed dance
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.100]   that happens the same way every time
[00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.200]   each one of us builds the brain, right?
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.300]   And that builds an organ that allows us
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.540]   to do what we're doing today, right?
[00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.980]   That is mind-blowing,
[00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.540]   and this is why developmental neurobiologists
[00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:02.500]   never get tired of studying that.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.420]   Now you're asking about the code.
[00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:05.500]   What drives this?
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.140]   How is this done?
[00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:10.380]   Well, it's millions of years of evolution,
[00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.820]   of really fine-tuning gene expression programs
[00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:18.100]   that allow certain cells to be made at a certain time
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.340]   and to become a certain cell type,
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.340]   but also mechanical forces of pressure, bending.
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.980]   This embryo is not just, it will not stay a tube,
[00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:32.660]   this brain, for very long.
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.500]   At some point, this tube in the front of the embryo
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.820]   will expand to make the primordium of the brain, right?
[00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:43.500]   Now the forces that control, that the cells feel,
[00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.580]   and this is another beautiful thing,
[00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.460]   the very force that they feel,
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.900]   which is different from a week before or a week ago,
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:51.740]   will tell the cell,
[00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:54.260]   "Oh, you're being squished in a certain way.
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.180]   "Begin to produce these new genes
[00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.020]   "because now you are at the corner,
[00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.020]   "or you are in a stretch of cells," or whatever it is.
[00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.660]   So that mechanical, physical force
[00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:10.140]   shapes the fate of the cell as well.
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:12.580]   So it's not only chemical, it's also mechanical.
[00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:13.620]   - Mechanical.
[00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.140]   So from my perspective,
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:20.140]   biology is this incredibly complex mess, gooey mess.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.100]   So you're saying mechanical forces.
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:24.940]   - Yes.
[00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.460]   - How different is a computer
[00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.820]   or any kind of mechanical machine that we humans build
[00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.500]   and the biological systems?
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:35.340]   - Yeah.
[00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:37.340]   - 'Cause you've worked a lot with biological systems.
[00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:38.180]   - Yes.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.380]   - Are they as much of a mess as it seems
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.220]   from a perspective of a mechanical engineer?
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.100]   - Yeah.
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.060]   They are much more prone
[00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:52.340]   to taking alternative routes, right?
[00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:53.700]   So if you,
[00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.860]   we go back to printing a brain versus developing a brain.
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.140]   Of course, if you print a brain,
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.700]   given that you start with the same building blocks,
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:04.620]   the same cells,
[00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.300]   you could potentially print it the same way every time.
[00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:13.180]   But that final brain may not work the same way
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.100]   as a brain built during development does
[00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.380]   because the very same building blocks that you're using
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.100]   developed in a completely different environment, right?
[00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:23.700]   It was not the environment of the brain.
[00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:26.540]   Therefore, they're gonna be different just by definition.
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.140]   So if you instead use development to build,
[00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.380]   let's say a brain organoid,
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:35.500]   which maybe we will be talking about in a few minutes.
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:36.500]   - For sure.
[00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:37.620]   Those things are fascinating.
[00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:38.460]   - Yes.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:42.620]   So if you use processes of development,
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.020]   then when you watch it,
[00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:47.100]   you can see that sometimes things can go wrong
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.140]   in some organoids.
[00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.500]   And by wrong, I mean different one organoid from the next.
[00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.740]   While if you think about that embryo,
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.420]   it always goes right.
[00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:59.580]   So this development, for as complex as it is,
[00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.020]   every time a baby is born has,
[00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:04.300]   with very few exceptions,
[00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.820]   the brain is like the next baby.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.820]   But it's not the same if you develop it in a dish.
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.460]   And first of all, we don't even develop a brain,
[00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:16.700]   you develop something much simpler in the dish.
[00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:20.300]   But there are more options for building things differently,
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:23.580]   which really tells you that evolution
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:28.580]   has played a really tight game here
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:33.660]   for how in the end the brain is built in vivo.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:35.980]   - So just a quick, maybe dumb question,
[00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:38.940]   but it seems like this is not,
[00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.700]   the building process is not a dictatorship.
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.940]   It seems like there's not a centralized,
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:48.020]   like high level mechanism that says,
[00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.900]   okay, this cell built itself the wrong way,
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.140]   I'm gonna kill it.
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:56.060]   It seems like there's a really strong distributed mechanism.
[00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:58.100]   Is that in your sense?
[00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:01.540]   - There are a lot of possibilities, right?
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:05.700]   And if you think about, for example, different species,
[00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:07.380]   building their brain,
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:09.500]   each brain is a little bit different.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:11.660]   So the brain of a lizard is very different
[00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.140]   from that of a chicken, from that of one of us,
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:18.700]   and so on and so forth, and still is a brain,
[00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:21.580]   but it was built differently,
[00:09:21.580 --> 00:09:23.940]   starting from stem cells
[00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.660]   that pretty much had the same potential.
[00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:30.020]   But in the end, evolution builds different brains
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:33.180]   in different species, because that serves in a way
[00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.660]   the purpose of that species
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.580]   and the wellbeing of that organism.
[00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.340]   So there are many possibilities,
[00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:43.500]   but then there is a way,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:45.460]   and you were talking about a code.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:48.140]   Nobody knows what the entire code of development is.
[00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:49.260]   Of course we don't.
[00:09:49.260 --> 00:09:54.020]   We know bits and pieces of very specific aspects
[00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:55.140]   of development of the brain,
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.620]   what genes are involved to make a certain cell type,
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:09:59.180]   how those two cells interact
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.020]   to make the next level structure.
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:03.420]   That we might know, but the entirety of it,
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.780]   how it's so well controlled, it's really mind-blowing.
[00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:09.740]   - So in the first two months in the embryo,
[00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:13.340]   or whatever, the first few weeks, months, months.
[00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:17.740]   So yeah, the building blocks are constructed,
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:20.660]   the actual, the different regions of the brain,
[00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:23.380]   I guess, and the nervous system.
[00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.940]   - Well, this continues way longer
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:27.100]   than just the first few months.
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.060]   So over the very first few months,
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:32.660]   you build a lot of these cells,
[00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:37.060]   but then there is continuous building of new cell types
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:39.060]   all the way through birth.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.060]   And then even postnatally,
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.580]   I don't know if you've ever heard of myelin.
[00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.300]   Myelin is this sort of insulation
[00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:50.420]   that is built around the cables of the neurons
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.820]   so that the electricity can go really fast from--
[00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:53.980]   - The axons, I guess they're called.
[00:10:53.980 --> 00:10:56.580]   - The axons, they're called axons, exactly.
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.580]   And so as human beings, we myelinate our cells
[00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:04.900]   postnatally.
[00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:09.300]   A kid, a six-year-old kid has barely started
[00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:12.460]   the process of making the mature oligodendrocytes,
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:14.220]   which are the cells that then eventually
[00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:17.180]   will wrap the axons into myelin.
[00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.540]   And this will continue, believe it or not,
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.020]   until we are about 25, 30 years old.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:25.900]   So there is a continuous process of maturation
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:27.220]   and tweaking and additions,
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.060]   and also in response to what we do.
[00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.220]   (silence)
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.380]   (silence)
[00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:37.540]   (silence)
[00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:39.700]   (silence)
[00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.860]   (silence)
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.020]   (silence)
[00:11:44.020 --> 00:11:46.180]   (silence)
[00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.340]   (silence)
[00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:53.800]   Thanks for watching.
