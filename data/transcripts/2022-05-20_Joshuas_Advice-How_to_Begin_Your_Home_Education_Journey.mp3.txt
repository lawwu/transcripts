[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, a show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   skills, insight, and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.120]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.100]   My name is Josh Rochites and today on the show I want to reprise a topic that I try
[00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.100]   to address at least annually and I try to make sure that I talk about it around this
[00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.060]   time of year, although I do touch on it more frequently.
[00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:27.380]   Today happens to be Thursday, May 19, 2022 and during this season of the year, all around
[00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:31.820]   the world, there are millions and millions of school children who are being released
[00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.360]   from school for their summer break.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.140]   That means that there are millions and millions of parents who are sitting down and who are
[00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.180]   carefully considering what has worked well for their children, their family over the
[00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.240]   past year, and what they'd like to see different in the future.
[00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.220]   Those parents are thinking about their children, they're pondering and analyzing how their
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.580]   children's strengths have grown this past year, and they're considering whether the
[00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:05.060]   weaknesses or the needs that their children have are being adequately met by the family's
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.140]   current plan or program, the things that that family is currently doing.
[00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.980]   And so during this time of year, I'd like to be consistent to share with you some ideas
[00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:20.420]   that may be helpful for you if you decide as a parent that you'd like to try something
[00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.620]   different and I want to do that in the context of talking about education with a special
[00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.620]   emphasis on home education.
[00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.640]   Now I do that in the context of a personal finance podcast rather than on a separate
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:42.180]   platform because at its core, finances spends a lot of time dealing with children's needs
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.180]   and education.
[00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.460]   Virtually all parents have a significant portion of their income absorbed by the costs
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.820]   of their children.
[00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.020]   This is a normal factor of being a parent.
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.100]   And a major component of those costs involves education.
[00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.840]   Being a financial planner myself for many years, I've had many hundreds and hundreds
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.620]   of conversations about how do we save for our children's college education.
[00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.780]   I've had many conversations about can we afford to withdraw our child from the local
[00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.540]   government school and enroll him in a local private school.
[00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.380]   I've had many conversations, can we afford to have one parent stop earning an income
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.820]   so that that parent can homeschool the children.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:33.660]   And I've been somewhat loud in my critiques of the industrialized government school system
[00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.960]   and I want to be faithful though to not simply be one who provides a critique but rather
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.780]   one who provides ideas.
[00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.100]   And I know that this is of interest to you because you ask me about it all the time.
[00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.400]   And so on today's show, I want to share with you some ideas that I think are actionable
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.580]   and that may be helpful to you if you're looking for an alternative to what you have
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.540]   done recently.
[00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:02.780]   It thrills my heart to see that perhaps, I would say one of if not perhaps the greatest
[00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.060]   outcome that we've seen from the tragedy of the global COVID pandemic has been a massive
[00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.260]   decrease in the enrollment of children into the local government school system.
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.460]   New York Times article from May 17th headlined "With plunging enrollment, a seismic hit
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:25.220]   to public schools, the pandemic has supercharged the decline in the nation's public school
[00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:31.900]   system in ways that experts say will not easily be reversed."
[00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.180]   You can go and read the article if you care, but I consider this one of the most positive
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.700]   trends to see parents withdrawing their children from the government school system and finding
[00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.300]   alternatives is undoubtedly one of the most important and most productive trends of our
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   lifetime.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.540]   Now, not all of these parents are going to home education.
[00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540]   Many are.
[00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.980]   After all, we've seen that millions and millions of parents were thrust into home education,
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.380]   although a really crappy form of it, having their children enrolled in some horrible virtual
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.340]   school online.
[00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.460]   But we've seen overall that that's opened the doors to many people.
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:15.060]   This has a major social impact as parents have started to listen in on the classes their
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:19.620]   children have been enrolled in, be aware of what is actually being covered.
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.620]   It's opened many parents' eyes to what was actually happening in those classes, which
[00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.060]   that's a healthy thing.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.500]   And then on its whole, I think parents as most reasonable adults would look at, when
[00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.660]   you look at your child and you look at the schoolwork that your child is being required
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.420]   to do and you think, "Is this really useful?
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:39.100]   Is this really something that I need to do?"
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.020]   And this has contributed to a long-term trend in the rise of educational alternatives.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.580]   Even if we look specifically at homeschooling, I observed this tweet the other day from a
[00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.580]   guy that I follow online.
[00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.260]   He said this, "1970s, 13,000 homeschoolers in the United States.
[00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.780]   1980s, 200,000 homeschoolers.
[00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.940]   1990s, 850,000 homeschoolers.
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.380]   2000s, 1.5 million homeschoolers.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:08.020]   2010s, 1.7 million homeschoolers.
[00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.780]   2020s, 5 million homeschoolers."
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.820]   That statistic warms my heart because that is millions and millions of children saved
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:25.060]   from the trauma, from the drudgery that is the mass-industrialized government school
[00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.820]   system in the United States.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:35.500]   Now, I prefer to spend most of my time on positive, inspirational examples of things
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.060]   that can be done or should be done or you might want to be done.
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:42.340]   I prefer to do this rather than to be one who is a fault finder.
[00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:46.900]   Finding fault is easy, but at the end of the day, many people see faults, especially faults
[00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.740]   with the local government school, but they just don't know what to do.
[00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.420]   However, in order for me to share with you some ideas about what you can do, it's important
[00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.060]   that I make a careful critique.
[00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.940]   Why am I such a critic of the government school system?
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.900]   I could use days and days to answer that.
[00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:10.700]   There are many hours of audio in the annals of Radical Personal Finance with some of that
[00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.540]   audio, much of that audio being dedicated to critiques.
[00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:19.380]   But for today's show, I want to keep my critique simple and use it as a framework to provide
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.380]   an alternative.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:24.300]   Here is my critique.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:33.140]   In the industrialized government school system, the quality of education is low.
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.380]   The environment is toxic.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:43.220]   The control that you as a parent have over the influences of your children is nil, and
[00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:49.260]   the personalization of education that your child can have is almost non-existent.
[00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:57.300]   I repeat, overall a good framework for my critique of the industrialized government
[00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.340]   school system is this.
[00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:05.420]   The quality of education is horrifically low.
[00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:08.760]   The environment is toxic.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:17.020]   The control you have over the influences of your children is nil, and the personalization
[00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:26.300]   of education that your child can have in that mass industrialized system is almost non-existent.
[00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:33.380]   Put simply, the results suck, and any honest observer, whether on an individualized basis
[00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:40.280]   meeting graduating students or on a broad scale review of the data, will generally come
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.700]   to that conclusion.
[00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.260]   There are some positive inspirational stories.
[00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:52.380]   It warms your heart to see a child who had no chance in life and who was given opportunity
[00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:56.580]   to succeed and grasped that opportunity and succeeded.
[00:07:56.580 --> 00:08:00.720]   It's nice to meet a motivated young man or woman who's graduating from high school and
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:10.200]   is going places, but at its core, it's very difficult to find that the cause of that positive
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.940]   story was the local government school.
[00:08:14.940 --> 00:08:20.740]   If the local government school is the cause, generally it's not the system itself, rather
[00:08:20.740 --> 00:08:26.680]   it's some stellar human beings who are working in that system, a wonderful man or a wonderful
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:31.980]   woman who is seeking to have an impact and change something for the better.
[00:08:31.980 --> 00:08:34.540]   But the system itself is fighting against you.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:37.660]   Now, a couple of comments so we know where we're going.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:40.700]   Why do I say the quality of education is low?
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:47.700]   At its core, in most local government schools, there is no unifying theory of education.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:54.280]   Rather what you have is a hodgepodge of classes put together and those classes necessarily
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.980]   have to cater to the lowest common denominator in the class.
[00:08:58.980 --> 00:09:05.560]   You have poorly paid teachers, some of whom are good, many of whom are mediocre.
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.220]   You have very little accountability for those teachers.
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:14.600]   You have very few inspirational teachers among them.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:20.340]   The materials that those teachers are generally using are dated, they're often not world class,
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:25.840]   they're not written to appeal to the highest performers, but rather to be just barely manageable
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:28.540]   for the lowest performers.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:34.860]   And because there is no unifying theory of education, there's no overall coherent system
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:40.420]   of thought that's being taught, then the student doesn't really see the point.
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:45.740]   And the students quite rightly recognize, "I'm never going to use this.
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:46.740]   This doesn't matter.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:49.540]   Why do I have to do this?"
[00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:54.660]   The educational results measured by standardized test scores, global standards, etc. in the
[00:09:54.660 --> 00:09:56.940]   United States are awful.
[00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.560]   Next, the environment is toxic.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.940]   Why is the environment toxic?
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:08.060]   On the most recent Friday Q&A show, I discussed this in depth, but at its core, the environment
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.980]   in most schools is not conducive to learning.
[00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:12.980]   Why?
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:19.500]   Well, first, in many schools, you don't have a culture of excellence.
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.300]   You don't have a culture of studiousness.
[00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:27.100]   This is expressed in terms of the difficulty that a teacher has to maintain order in a
[00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.540]   classroom.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:36.420]   Your video feed can work just as well as mine to see legion of videos of students showing
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:41.620]   how raucous and unruly the classes can be in many schools.
[00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:49.260]   More importantly, the idea of taking students all with the same age and putting them in
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.420]   an artificial environment just often leads to all of the wrong sorts of peer pressure.
[00:10:54.420 --> 00:11:01.380]   Again, I critiqued this in depth on the most recent Friday Q&A show, but at its core, I
[00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:04.860]   guess I would just simply give one story.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:10.740]   If you were a good student in school, as I was, as my wife was, you know that if you're
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:16.040]   a good student, that excellence is not rewarded by your peers.
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:20.860]   One of the most shocking things to me in my own personal educational journey, I was homeschooled
[00:11:20.860 --> 00:11:25.100]   from kindergarten through seventh grade with the exception of third grade where I was enrolled
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.100]   in a local government school.
[00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:31.380]   Then in seventh grade through twelfth grade, I attended a local private Christian school.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:36.660]   One of the things that was quite shocking to me about attending that local school was
[00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:43.460]   how in seventh grade, I learned very quickly that excellence was not rewarded by general
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.340]   applause.
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:49.860]   I learned very quickly that if I did well on an exam, if I got a hundred on a test,
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:51.980]   I needed to hide that score.
[00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:55.740]   That was a really strange lesson to learn coming from a homeschool environment where
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:12:01.380]   excellence was encouraged to then quickly finding out from my peers that excellence
[00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.820]   was not to be encouraged.
[00:12:02.820 --> 00:12:07.100]   Of course, the teachers want to encourage excellence, but they're limited in terms of
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.580]   the amount of impact that they can have.
[00:12:08.580 --> 00:12:10.300]   It was a strange experience.
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:14.140]   My wife had the same experience.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.620]   During her elementary school years, she was in a private Christian school, and then she
[00:12:16.620 --> 00:12:20.740]   graduated for her middle and high school years from a local government school.
[00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:23.080]   We were talking about it recently, and she had the same experience.
[00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:26.020]   You never show your score if you do well.
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:31.700]   That's just a tiny little insight into the environment that you have where you have a
[00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:37.940]   toxic environment that doesn't reward learning, that doesn't give time for a student to actually
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.940]   study.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:43.320]   You have mediocre class presentations by a teacher, generally speaking.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:51.180]   You have mediocre textbooks that aren't really all that great, but they're chosen for their
[00:12:51.180 --> 00:12:56.300]   blandness and their acceptability rather than their excellence.
[00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:00.820]   That's not to say anything of even the actual toxic social environment that exists in so
[00:13:00.820 --> 00:13:03.020]   many government schools.
[00:13:03.020 --> 00:13:08.860]   Since government schools can't screen their student population for the best students with
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:15.220]   the highest moral character, since those government schools have to accept the local student population,
[00:13:15.220 --> 00:13:23.340]   and since they can't, without extreme situations, they can't expel students who disrupt the
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:30.320]   class or who have poor manners, who are rude, then it just leads to a really toxic social
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.380]   environment.
[00:13:32.380 --> 00:13:40.820]   Your child is subjected to this artificial environment where he or she is required to
[00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.900]   be in close contact with a random smattering of local people of his or her same age without
[00:13:46.900 --> 00:13:52.220]   any control based upon the quality of the character of those people.
[00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:58.420]   Next, the control that you have over the influences of your children is nil.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:05.300]   It's shocking to me to recognize that as parents, we turn over our children, if you use a local
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:11.080]   government school system, we turn over our children for the 15,000 most important hours
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:19.300]   of their life to people that we've never met, that we didn't hire, we didn't approve of,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:23.820]   we know nothing about their background until we get their TikTok feed.
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:30.980]   All of a sudden now, we get a better idea of who this particular teacher really is.
[00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:37.980]   You would never do that with a mere babysitter for your child, and yet all around the world,
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.980]   millions of parents just trot down to the local school, have a couple of interviews
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:42.980]   and say, "Hey, sounds good.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:44.440]   We've got good test scores.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.420]   We got an A-rated school district."
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:57.180]   And yet, these are people that you didn't choose, whose worldviews, character qualities,
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.340]   kindness, teaching skills you did not screen.
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:08.700]   And the control that you have over those influences is nil.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.260]   And then perhaps most importantly, the personalization of education that your child can have is almost
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:15.760]   non-existent.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:25.180]   By their very nature and design, government schools are an industrialized factory setting.
[00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:30.060]   And in an industrialized factory setting, everything is brought to the lowest common
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.740]   denominator.
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:40.640]   And what's worse, everything is brought to the lowest common denominator, and those specific
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:48.660]   decisions are coordinated by committees of, thankfully in the United States, locally elected
[00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:54.460]   persons, but still committees.
[00:15:54.460 --> 00:15:55.680]   It's horrible.
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:00.220]   And these committees cannot respond quickly to the changing conditions, and they certainly
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:05.980]   cannot respond to the individualized needs of your child.
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:09.840]   You would never accept that standard for yourself.
[00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:13.780]   If you had not been indoctrinated into it.
[00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:19.800]   You're here listening to my podcast because somehow along the way, you stumbled across
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:24.660]   it and you found value in it and you made a choice to continue.
[00:16:24.660 --> 00:16:29.660]   There are tens of thousands of other people who have come across my podcast and who have
[00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:34.460]   made the choice that it's not for them, and they've made other choices.
[00:16:34.460 --> 00:16:40.340]   As an adult, you are accustomed to making sure that when you go and commit your time
[00:16:40.340 --> 00:16:45.580]   to educational environments, where you're going to seek an education, you choose the
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:50.060]   very highest quality for your education.
[00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:57.180]   As an adult, you are accustomed to the idea, and you actually practice this, that when
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:03.620]   you're exposed to a toxic environment, you quickly withdraw yourself at a minimum, if
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:09.700]   not bust that door wide open and expose it for the evil that it is.
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.460]   But you at the very least withdraw yourself.
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:18.860]   As an adult, you are accustomed to the concept of control and choosing the influences that
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.020]   you surround yourself with.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:25.660]   And as an adult, you are accustomed to the idea that you get to personalize your education
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:31.100]   based upon the things that are important to you.
[00:17:31.100 --> 00:17:36.620]   Principle number one, treat your children like persons, individual, unique persons,
[00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:39.820]   image bearers of God who are worthy of respect.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.700]   They're not cattle to be stuck into a system that isn't good for them.
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:46.200]   They're people.
[00:17:46.200 --> 00:17:49.100]   They deserve respect.
[00:17:49.100 --> 00:17:53.060]   Your children may have fewer choices that they can make.
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:58.740]   You may force your children to do things that are good for them.
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:07.740]   But you'll do that very, very sparingly and very carefully.
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.500]   The reason that you choose an alternative for your child's education other than the
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:22.900]   local mass industrialized government school is to improve systematically those factors.
[00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:26.180]   And there are many options or choices that you might make.
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:29.220]   A local private school might fit your needs.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:32.180]   A carefully chosen magnet school might be for you.
[00:18:32.180 --> 00:18:35.700]   A really good charter school can have its usefulness.
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:41.700]   A great homeschool environment, maybe it's schooling by correspondence, a virtual school
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.140]   of some kind.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:46.380]   There are so many opportunities.
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.140]   But what you're seeking to do is to improve those factors.
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:52.660]   You want to improve the quality of education.
[00:18:52.660 --> 00:18:59.580]   You want to move your children from a toxic environment to a genuinely positive growth
[00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:01.740]   affirming environment.
[00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:07.380]   You want to exercise careful control over those people, those resources, those materials
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:11.380]   that are going to influence your children during the most important formative 15,000
[00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:13.500]   hours of their life.
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:17.700]   And you're going to personalize the education and learning opportunities that your child
[00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:23.180]   has for his or her own good.
[00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:28.460]   I genuinely believe that almost any situation is better than the local government school.
[00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.500]   We always have to put that "almost" in there because there are genuinely dangerous
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:37.920]   situations that people can be in, but there are situations where children's lives have
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:40.460]   been improved by the local government school.
[00:19:40.460 --> 00:19:45.260]   But when you compare the number of stories that we have of that versus the number of
[00:19:45.260 --> 00:19:51.060]   students who come out of school hating school, who come out of school determined never to
[00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:55.980]   learn again in the rest of their life, who come out barely being able to communicate,
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:20:04.900]   barely being able to read if they can at all, barely being numerate at the most basic level.
[00:20:04.900 --> 00:20:11.620]   We look at the amount of trauma, the amount of depression, anxiety, the number of teen
[00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:19.860]   suicides, the poor preparation that children have for life.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.340]   We need to do a better job.
[00:20:23.340 --> 00:20:27.780]   So what are some positive alternatives that you can consider?
[00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:31.940]   If you withdraw your children from a local government school, you will have a fork in
[00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:33.100]   the road.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:36.280]   The fork will be this.
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:42.760]   You will either choose a system where the primary coordination of your child's education
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:52.360]   is done by some external person or external system, or where you as a parent will be the
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.460]   primary coordinator of your child's education.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.820]   Notice my carefulness with words.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:10.740]   Clearly, if you are delegating the coordination of your child's education to an external person
[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:19.560]   or institution, that means that you are enrolling your children in some form of a school.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.340]   It just may not be the local government school.
[00:21:22.340 --> 00:21:28.480]   Here there are many good options, and there are many good reasons to choose this option.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:32.660]   This may look like a local brick and mortar private school.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:37.380]   It may look very traditional, just happens to be a local brick and mortar private school,
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:43.980]   or a local Christian school, or a local Catholic or Jewish or Muslim school of some kind.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.240]   There are many varieties of religious schooling.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.620]   Or this may look like some other hybrid model.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:57.780]   There are many good virtual schools that you could use to facilitate this.
[00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:01.060]   There are many countries around the world, many states who have put virtually all of
[00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:07.820]   their government school programs online, and they allow the children enrolled in those
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:15.120]   schools to use the teaching facilities of the government school system, but to not be
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.620]   sitting physically in the class.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:20.300]   These can be useful opportunities.
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:21.300]   I'm from Florida.
[00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:22.820]   Florida has Florida Virtual School.
[00:22:22.820 --> 00:22:25.460]   There are other ... I've talked to Australians all around.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:30.380]   Australia has a great program like this where you can say, "Hey, I'm going to keep my child
[00:22:30.380 --> 00:22:34.540]   in this system, but we're just going to use this while we're traveling around the world
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:36.180]   in our sailboat."
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:40.500]   There you can improve some of the opportunities.
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:45.940]   In that system, I might still argue that perhaps the curriculum is not world class in many
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:50.660]   cases, but at least you have a healthier environment.
[00:22:50.660 --> 00:22:53.940]   At least you have more control over the influences of your child.
[00:22:53.940 --> 00:22:58.140]   At least you can personalize your child's education with what your child is learning
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:23:03.860]   on the sailboat or whatever other decisions you make as a parent.
[00:23:03.860 --> 00:23:10.060]   There are many good options where you choose to delegate your authority over your children's
[00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:16.380]   education to an external school or an external coordinator of some kind.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.500]   I am convinced that this will grow massively in the years to come.
[00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.100]   All of the wool has fallen from our eyes through the COVID pandemic.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:34.780]   We now understand that if my child can sit at home and use a laptop and learn from the
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:40.860]   teachers in the local school district, then why can't my child sit at home and use a laptop
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:45.060]   and learn from the world's best teachers no matter what school district they happen to
[00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:49.220]   be from?
[00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:56.760]   These options where you delegate the coordination of your child's educational environment to
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:02.340]   an external person or an external institution can solve some unique problems that you can't
[00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:04.900]   solve in other circumstances.
[00:24:04.900 --> 00:24:12.380]   Clearly, this may be useful to solve the need for supervision of children.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.220]   There are many parents who maintain jobs.
[00:24:15.220 --> 00:24:19.660]   They don't feel that they can provide a place for their child to be.
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.500]   There's not a friend or a neighbor or a grandparent who's offering to supervise the child, and
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:27.500]   so they need someone to provide childcare.
[00:24:27.500 --> 00:24:31.380]   That's a very valid reason to seek out one of these options.
[00:24:31.380 --> 00:24:37.700]   There are times in which the burden of a parent being the one who is coordinating the education
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:39.340]   may simply be too high.
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:43.080]   A family can have intense needs.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.580]   Maybe they're going through a difficult time for some reason.
[00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.660]   The family is in difficulties.
[00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:54.100]   Maybe there's great stresses happening, and they need the stability of outsourcing and
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:58.740]   delegating the coordination of their child's education to another person.
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:04.940]   You can also find, due to the division of labor, that if you delegate your child's education
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:14.400]   to an external person or institution, then you can get a genuinely higher quality environment
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.360]   in some cases.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.900]   There are people who are really good at what they do.
[00:25:19.900 --> 00:25:27.020]   There are teachers who are world class, and those teachers may be a very important resource
[00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:30.400]   for your children to access.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:35.520]   At its core, the division of labor is a really important thing to tap into.
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:40.720]   In addition, there are some things that a school can do better.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:48.560]   For example, when I look at the things that a school, a formal, normal school can do better,
[00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:52.640]   I always look at things like sports, theater.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.960]   Those are things that you just can't do to the same caliber in any kind of homeschool
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.320]   environment.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.120]   Sports and theater, you can do those better in school.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.760]   Now, interestingly, many homeschoolers can still access those programs.
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:09.560]   There are, all around the world, there are homeschoolers whose parents are coordinating
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:13.800]   their education who can still go and join the local sports team at their local school,
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.040]   still go and act in the local theater productions.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:21.360]   That may be something worth considering, but sports and theater are really tough to do
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.800]   well in a homeschool environment, or at least team sports are really hard to do well in
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.800]   a homeschool environment.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.760]   I think another one is just simply the power of the network.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:38.040]   The network effect that comes from certain local elite institutions is extremely powerful,
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:44.400]   and that may be reason enough to enroll your children into a local school.
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:56.000]   A carefully chosen private school can eliminate virtually all of those critiques of the industrialized
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.040]   government school system.
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:05.200]   A carefully chosen private school will often very carefully screen and hire world-class
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:11.500]   teachers, and those world-class teachers have greater freedom to make sure that the educational
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:19.600]   outcome of their class environment is higher, so you can get a higher quality education.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:26.460]   Those private schools can carefully discriminate against the students that they don't want
[00:27:26.460 --> 00:27:30.880]   in the school for really any reason desired.
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.840]   They can discriminate based upon test scores, intelligence.
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:39.140]   They can discriminate based upon the background of the family.
[00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:43.200]   They can discriminate based upon religious convictions.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:51.960]   They can discriminate because of behavioral behavior, and they can expel students much
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:57.800]   more quickly and expel students permanently for much more minor infractions than the local
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:59.920]   government school can have.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.880]   Then those schools can maintain a much less toxic environment.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:14.080]   And then if you can get the ratio of adults to children at a more even number, then there
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:20.000]   can be enough adult leadership to minimize the negative impact of a bunch of age-banded
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.320]   children all put together.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:28.600]   And then because you can choose a private school very carefully, you have more control
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.320]   over the influences, and you're choosing people that you want to influence your children rather
[00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:38.360]   than just simply taking the default option.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:46.920]   And then private schools, in order to attract the best students, will often allow much more
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:53.760]   intense personalization of educational opportunities in order to attract the best students so your
[00:28:53.760 --> 00:28:58.560]   child can have a more personalized educational environment.
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:05.720]   This is why in virtually every society you will have a relatively small number of elite
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:11.400]   institutions where the wealthy elite will enroll their children.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:15.880]   Sometimes those are local schools, sometimes they're boarding schools.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:24.560]   And if a local society does not have an elite institution, then either the wealthy elite
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:29.200]   parents will choose a personalized, customized solution, which we'll talk about in just a
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:35.240]   moment, hiring private tutors as would be traditional in many places, or they'll literally
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.400]   send their child to a boarding school across the world.
[00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.240]   I have a great interest in Swiss boarding schools.
[00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.920]   Something about Switzerland has always captivated me.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:47.640]   I actually remember a book I read as a boy that started my love for Switzerland.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:52.760]   Of course, there are many countries that have this boarding school culture.
[00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:59.160]   And so I've spent hours reading brochures, looking at curricula, looking at all kinds
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.040]   of things for Swiss boarding schools on all levels.
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:07.160]   And I'm always fascinated because those kinds of options really do solve significant problems
[00:30:07.160 --> 00:30:12.120]   for the wealthy elite who come from places where they don't have something that's appropriate
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:15.360]   for their child.
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:19.880]   You may make that choice, and those are good, excellent choices.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.200]   And I'm excited to see that all around the world, there are new models that are being
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:30.680]   designed and implemented with the availability, and I think this is going to be the future,
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:33.440]   and a very strong future.
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:39.080]   Homeschooling in the traditional model, meaning an intense family-oriented education where
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:47.800]   students study at home, where mom is the teacher, where it's very kind of isolated.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.760]   Actually I don't know any homeschoolers who do that.
[00:30:50.760 --> 00:30:54.480]   Virtually all homeschoolers that I know, and I know a lot of them, at the very least have
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.600]   a significant local homeschool community.
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:00.960]   It's one of the benefits of growing from a few tens of thousands of homeschoolers across
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   the country.
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.800]   1970s, 13,000 homeschoolers to 5 million homeschoolers.
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:10.000]   All around the United States, you can find massive communities of co-ops of all different
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.160]   variations.
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.720]   And these co-ops work together to try to bring in some of the benefits of the group
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:24.480]   environment and to offset some of the disadvantages of an isolated family environment.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:27.520]   So I don't really know anybody who homeschools in that isolated way.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:34.080]   That said, my point was that there are certain disadvantages of that.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:38.400]   There are also many advantages that come from having a small environment.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:43.880]   And so the point is that the hybrid model is, I think, a very powerful model for the
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.180]   future.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:51.800]   And because you can now have the digitization of instruction, this hybrid model works even
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:53.280]   at an elite level.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:58.160]   And so you'll have in the future, I think, more and more local schools where they have
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.360]   a small school facility.
[00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   They have very careful, good grounds.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.960]   They have very carefully chosen student bodies.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:11.440]   But those small local schools can provide an elite education because they don't have
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:15.640]   to hire physically in the traditional way all of the world's best teachers.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:21.280]   So I think that the educational model of the future will be this hybrid approach.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.840]   Now let's pivot to the second leg.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:29.560]   The first leg, remember, was you're going to delegate your parental authority over the
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:35.880]   education of your children to another person or to another institution, to an outside institution
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.360]   that you've chosen carefully.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:45.200]   Or option B is you can choose to maintain that authority and maintain that coordination.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.520]   I think this is a choice that more parents should make.
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:53.240]   So what I want to spend the remainder of my time talking about is how you can feel more
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:58.040]   confident making this choice.
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:03.280]   Because the reason more parents don't do this, in my opinion, or one reason, is simply they
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:06.960]   don't feel confident that they can.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.880]   They haven't spent any time learning about it, thinking about it, considering it.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:16.160]   And I'd like to help you break that paradigm and change it.
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:22.080]   First, as a parent, especially since I know that you're listening to my program, and my
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:28.120]   program is massively populated in a very disproportionate manner by wealthy, successful, effective
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.200]   people, highly educated, wealthy, successful people.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:34.800]   First I want to promise you that you do know.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:41.120]   You at your core, you know what your children need to succeed.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:47.880]   Because you know who your children are and you know what's necessary for success in the
[00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:50.400]   modern world.
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.760]   And if you put those two things together, even though it might take you some days to
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:34:00.640]   actually write out a curriculum if that were required of you, at its core you could do
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.000]   it.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.320]   You could sit down and do it.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.760]   And I'll bet that if you did it, it would look something like this.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.320]   You would think about a lot of the subjects that you took in school when you were younger,
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.280]   and you would say, "You know what?
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:23.740]   I think a generalized exposure to most of those subjects is actually kind of important."
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:29.160]   Even if you had no educational theory, you had no overall model, you could probably just
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.600]   go through the subjects that you took in school, make a list of them and say, "Yeah, you know
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   what?
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.600]   Those are probably important.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:36.920]   I'm glad that I took those."
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:42.400]   Then you would say, "I need to get some good books on those subjects, and then I need to
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:49.800]   require my children to go through those books and read them, learn them, etc."
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.840]   Then along the way you would say, "There are some other skills that they need that maybe
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:54.240]   I didn't study when I was younger.
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:56.200]   Hey, I think that would be kind of important."
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:35:02.640]   You would put together a curriculum for your child, and then you would require your child
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:06.720]   to go through it.
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:12.880]   You would supplement that with a couple of local library cards and regular visits to
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.180]   the library.
[00:35:14.180 --> 00:35:17.620]   You would supplement that with a substantial book-buying budget.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:21.680]   You would seek to make sure that you were careful about the influences that your children,
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:24.360]   the negative influences that your children were exposed to.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:26.880]   You would try to bolster that with positive influences.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:31.360]   You would choose some positive social environments to make sure they had a good chance to learn
[00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:36.120]   to interact with others in a positive social environment, and that would be great.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.720]   It really is that simple.
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:45.680]   Now I want to share with you three philosophies or schools or resources that have been inspiring
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:46.800]   to me.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:52.000]   Philosophy number one is the philosophy of unschooling.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:58.280]   Schooling is a movement that has emerged as basically a backlash to many of the problems
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.160]   that I have described.
[00:36:00.160 --> 00:36:08.360]   It's emerged as a reaction to mass, compulsory, institutionalized government schooling.
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.480]   Many parents have realized, "Wait a second.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:13.400]   My child is not...
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:17.600]   This is not good for my children."
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:23.560]   Many parents will reflect on their own schooling and recognize that basically at its core,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:27.120]   I only remember the stuff that I actually cared about.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:29.200]   I'm in my mid-30s.
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.960]   I have many years of school under my belt, and I remember really only the things that
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.460]   I care about.
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:42.520]   All along the way, the institutionalized school setting didn't put a whole lot in my head
[00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:46.920]   that stuck except for the things that I care about.
[00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:55.120]   So unschoolers ask the question, "If I simply removed all of that compulsion, would my child
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:03.000]   naturally pursue his normal course of wanting to be a learner and then learn about the things
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.960]   that were important to him?"
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.320]   And I'm inspired by some of the many positive stories.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:16.720]   I think the critique of the unschoolers is well taken, and I think you can see some good
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:19.320]   positive inspirational stories.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:24.920]   And there are many serious people who take the topic seriously and who write about and
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:28.360]   talk about how to do unschooling very well.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:34.360]   At its core, a lot of people think, "Well, unschoolers just don't do anything."
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.320]   But there are many unschoolers who go beyond that and say, "Listen, don't think that we
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.460]   just don't do anything.
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:45.160]   We simply have a different approach to things.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:50.920]   We surround our children with an environment of resources available, inspirational things
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:55.000]   where they'll want to learn, and then they just follow their natural human inclination
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.920]   to want to learn."
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:02.680]   And to me, I find this inspiring because I genuinely do believe that humans are wired
[00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:03.900]   for learning.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:06.500]   Learning is a reward in and of itself.
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:09.120]   Learning is genuinely fun.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:14.600]   And yet I think it's the school system that often beats that love of learning out of us.
[00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:20.520]   I find this amazing as I watch it emerge in my children.
[00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:22.300]   My young children love to learn.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:26.040]   They always love to watch, to listen, and then, "Daddy, let me do it.
[00:38:26.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   I can do it.
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:28.040]   I can do it."
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.580]   And the more children I have, the younger that goes.
[00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:37.780]   My youngest, because he has siblings that are closer to him, my youngest is just much
[00:38:37.780 --> 00:38:39.720]   more intense about that.
[00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:43.480]   And so I think that people love to learn, and I think that that's a natural thing that
[00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.560]   occurs throughout life.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:49.760]   There are some negative influences that can take that away, but you can eliminate those
[00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.120]   negative influences.
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:55.480]   One negative influence can be the industrial school system.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:39:01.000]   Another influence can just simply be cotton candy for the brain.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:08.960]   I think that easy, mind-numbing, stupid activities like endlessly scrolling TikTok or endlessly
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:16.160]   flipping through YouTube or endlessly playing never-ending video games, etc., can dull the
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:22.400]   child's brain and diminish that love of learning in the same way that being surrounded by nothing
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:28.080]   but cookies and candy and chocolate cake can diminish your appetite for steak and eggs.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   But those things can be minimized, and then it's just natural to turn to the higher quality
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:39.920]   food options, just like it's natural to turn to the higher quality brain food options.
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:46.400]   I myself don't identify as an unschooler, and I find some of the unschooling community
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.480]   genuinely repulsive.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:54.960]   I'm a member of this Facebook group called Radical Unschooling, and it's unschooling
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.920]   on steroids, radical unschooling.
[00:39:56.920 --> 00:40:03.320]   And I originally joined it because I was attracted to the name, naturally, having myself had
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:08.520]   the domain of radical home education for some time.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.200]   I was attracted to the name, and I thought, "Let me check this out."
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:17.040]   I find a lot of it utterly repulsive because I think that there are many parents who have
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:27.560]   taken the high-quality output of some unschooling leaders, and they have turned it into a destructive
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:28.920]   system.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:36.400]   So I don't identify as an unschooler, but I find inspiration in some of their approaches
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:39.160]   and ideas.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:45.600]   What I think unschoolers get particularly right is the idea that learning happens best
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:52.000]   when it happens out of the desire of the student and when it happens in a pleasurable manner.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.240]   I think that's a really powerful concept, which leads me to what has been most inspirational
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:41:03.840]   for me, which is concept number two, which is the Charlotte Mason philosophy.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:10.880]   Let me give you a brief bit of background and then suggest a couple of specific resources.
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:16.800]   Charlotte Mason was an English schoolteacher who lived during the 19th century.
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:23.440]   She became a schoolteacher, and she wound up having a very long career organizing schools
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:30.160]   in England, a broad network of schools, both traditional school classrooms as well as providing
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:36.760]   curriculum options for some homeschool environments.
[00:41:36.760 --> 00:41:44.720]   Charlotte Mason was very keen to produce the best quality education for the masses that
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.360]   she could.
[00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:53.040]   She had long experience, and she thought and experimented and wrote with providing a really
[00:41:53.040 --> 00:41:56.760]   high quality education.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:03.280]   She developed a number of very important concepts that I think are worth paying attention to.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.000]   She was a peer of some other excellent leaders.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.080]   She was a peer of Maria Montessori, and then there are several other schooling traditions
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:16.160]   that were also peers of her.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:24.800]   But I have always found her particularly inspirational, primarily because of her broad approach to
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:32.280]   education and of the concepts that she wanted to use.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:38.920]   What I love is one of her core tenets was to provide for the child a delectable feast,
[00:42:38.920 --> 00:42:45.560]   a delectable feast of ideas, set before the child a delectable buffet of ideas, and then
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:52.720]   allow the child to pick and choose from that buffet in appropriate quantities and qualities.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:43:00.520]   Charlotte Mason wrote dozens of books, but she wrote six large volumes on education.
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:08.160]   I find very little disagreement with anything that she had to say, and reading her writing
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:13.120]   and reading her ideas has always been extremely inspirational to me.
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:18.080]   There are a few core pieces of a Charlotte Mason education that I think are worth paying
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:19.600]   attention to.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:26.360]   First, the reason I use unschooling as a bridge is that Charlotte Mason sought to minimize
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:36.580]   at every turn the drudgery of schooling and to maximize the excitement of education.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:39.440]   She did this in a number of ways.
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:50.080]   One way she did it was to focus on high-quality living books rather than dull, dreary textbooks.
[00:43:50.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   Charlotte understood very clearly that in order for us to grasp an idea, especially
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:05.200]   as children, that idea generally needs to be anchored in a really memorable story.
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   Because humans were wired for stories, not for dry facts.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:18.080]   If you put the facts in the context of a story, the human brain will capture those facts much
[00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:20.480]   more easily.
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:30.720]   Charlotte Mason also believed that education was not functional at its core, meaning that
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.040]   education was more than training for a job or just passing an exam or getting into the
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:39.400]   right college.
[00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:46.680]   She said, "Education is an atmosphere, a discipline, and a life.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:54.620]   Education is about finding out who we are and how we fit into the world of human beings
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:59.800]   and into the universe that God has created."
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:06.560]   Throughout history, there has been this tension between those who see and saw schooling or
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:15.000]   education as primarily functional and those who saw schooling or education as part of
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.360]   the development of the person.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:24.520]   The current battleground that you see this being fought is with so-called STEM education
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:27.960]   as compared against liberal arts education.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:33.440]   Right now, there is this intense focus that many parents have and many educators have
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.880]   that we need more STEM education.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:40.640]   They believe that if we can just have a greater effectiveness or greater focus on science
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:45.440]   and technology and math, then we'll have greater results.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:50.680]   This is just simply one more expression of the classic battle of education.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:55.200]   Go back a few decades, and it was all about being prepared for a job.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:57.680]   Education was primarily seen as preparing somebody for a job.
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.280]   We don't need to develop the person.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:03.480]   We just need to make the person basically literate, basically numerate so that they
[00:46:03.480 --> 00:46:06.880]   can function in the world of jobs.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:11.440]   Or education is supposed to be designed to help you get a better job.
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:15.520]   There's this classic contrast.
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:22.360]   When I was younger, I was waylaid into the philosophy that education should be practical.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:27.800]   While I'm not denying that there should be practical education and practical applications
[00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:32.080]   in education, I no longer consider myself in that camp.
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:37.360]   Now I consider myself firmly in the traditional liberal arts camp.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:45.840]   I desire for my children to experience that education is an atmosphere, it's a discipline,
[00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:52.880]   it's a life, it's a lifelong pursuit, and it's something that continues forever.
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:46:57.840]   Charlotte Mason believed that children are able to deal with ideas and knowledge, that
[00:46:57.840 --> 00:47:02.560]   they're not blank slates or empty sacks to be filled with information.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:07.600]   But she thought that children should do the work of dealing with ideas and knowledge rather
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:12.680]   than the teacher acting as a middleman, dispensing filtered knowledge.
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:18.240]   And so a Charlotte Mason education includes firsthand exposure to the great and noble
[00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:26.840]   ideas in every field through books, through art, through music, through poetry, etc.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:32.760]   There are many other practical applications of a Charlotte Mason education, but I find
[00:47:32.760 --> 00:47:39.320]   her ideas and ideals and models extremely inspirational.
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:47.400]   There's a wide degree of, what's the word, you can customize however you like, and I
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   think you should.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:52.840]   As a parent, you might find other things that have inspired you and adjust.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:48:01.600]   But if you're looking for a really high quality system of thought to apply to home education,
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:07.160]   I think that the ideas and philosophy of Charlotte Mason have a lot of merit.
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:13.520]   The bridge from unschooling to Charlotte Mason, as I said, is that you focus on making education
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:19.760]   a delectable feast, not dreary drudgery.
[00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:26.440]   And so you do that in a Charlotte Mason education in a variety of ways, but I see a Charlotte
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:33.040]   Mason education as bringing all the good of unschooling but diminishing the negatives
[00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.420]   of unschooling.
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:41.240]   If you are looking for resources on a Charlotte Mason education, the web is full of them.
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.140]   All you need to search is "Charlotte Mason education."
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:48.200]   If you put that into a web browser, into a search engine, you'll find a number of great
[00:48:48.200 --> 00:48:49.200]   resources.
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:55.200]   For example, Sonia Schaffer at Simply Charlotte Mason has excellent materials.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:56.720]   Her website is very useful.
[00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:58.900]   She sells a number of very useful products.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:02.320]   Her YouTube podcasts are really excellent.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.580]   There are a number of good podcasts.
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:10.280]   The resource that my family uses is called Ambleside Online.
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:12.280]   You can find it at AmblesideOnline.org.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:20.880]   Again, Ambleside, spelled like it sounds, A-M-B-L-E-S-I-D-E, AmblesideOnline.org.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:27.420]   AmblesideOnline.org is a curriculum that has been created over the last two decades by
[00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:34.760]   a network of Charlotte Mason-inspired moms and homeschoolers.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:39.640]   And they created this curriculum and they have posted it available free for anybody
[00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.860]   who is interested in following it.
[00:49:41.860 --> 00:49:50.560]   It is a complete curriculum that lays out for you a complete 12-year schooling plan
[00:49:50.560 --> 00:49:54.960]   with 36-week plans, lesson plans, etc. on a weekly basis.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:00.440]   And it gives you a complete and comprehensive curriculum that you can choose to follow if
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.360]   you would like.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.240]   If you choose to follow that curriculum, you would need to simply basically buy lots of
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:07.240]   books.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:11.680]   And so you buy lots of books and you follow and you work with your children through that.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:18.560]   On AmblesideOnline.org, they go over all of the details, they go over all of the approaches,
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.160]   they go over all the things that you will need and teach you how to do it.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:26.040]   And I think it's really, really excellent.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.520]   We've had great results.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:34.280]   My eldest is doing year 4 now of the Ambleside Online curriculum and at the moment we have
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:36.740]   no plans to change.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.960]   This approach is very flexible because you can add or take away.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:43.800]   So I've added a good number of things to it.
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:47.020]   I've taken away nothing but I've added to it.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:51.480]   And so you can adjust though as you like based upon your family's priorities or your family's
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.960]   models.
[00:50:53.960 --> 00:51:04.000]   What I find inspirational about this approach is that you can get significantly better results.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.480]   Really exciting results where you can maintain the joy and the enthusiasm of learning but
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:16.520]   have very high academic outcomes if you set up the appropriate environment.
[00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:22.360]   I try to be cautious about bragging on my children because it's common that parents
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:30.320]   do it and I don't want to draw unnecessary attention or to invade their privacy.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:36.280]   But by form of inspiration, what I love about homeschooling my children, especially using
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:45.080]   the Charlotte Mason approach, is seeing how they are more capable than most students are.
[00:51:45.080 --> 00:51:47.440]   So I'll give a simple example.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:51.540]   I was looking the other day at a little article on Lexile scores.
[00:51:51.540 --> 00:52:00.560]   If you're unfamiliar with Lexile scores, the Lexile scores are a measurement of basically
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.000]   the difficulty of a book.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.760]   This is useful because you want to be reading books that are appropriate to your current
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:11.400]   reading ability.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:14.940]   The Lexile scores, they don't score all books but the books that they do score, they map
[00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:20.200]   them to basically the broader industrialized government school system.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.800]   I was looking at some of the materials and here are a few selected Lexile scores.
[00:52:24.800 --> 00:52:28.560]   My second child is doing Amblesight Online year one.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:36.080]   In the beginning of year one, here are some of the books that we cover with this year
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:41.060]   one student who is now six.
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:45.840]   We use the Lang Blue Fairy book which has a Lexile score of 1180.
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:48.440]   That's a ninth grade classification.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:54.640]   Kipling's Just So Stories, Lexile score of 1060 which is sixth to seventh grade.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:58.240]   See Hollings book Paddle to the Sea is our geography book.
[00:52:58.240 --> 00:53:01.900]   That's a fifth grade 840 Lexile score.
[00:53:01.900 --> 00:53:08.200]   We use the Nesbitt Shakespeare book which is probably around ninth grade.
[00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:13.920]   We use the Lamb Stories from Shakespeare which is a 1390 Lexile score or a twelfth grade
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:19.640]   score and then some others that are fourth grade, ninth grade, sixth grade, sixth grade.
[00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:26.480]   The point of this is not that my six year old can read these things individually.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:32.600]   In the first few years, most of the reading is done aloud but what I've seen happen is
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:38.600]   that by exposing my children to very high quality literature and doing that continually
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:45.080]   from a very early age, then my children's capacity is much, much higher.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:49.740]   Then the way that we do it in a Charlotte Mason education is to make it accessible.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:57.000]   We break them into very short lessons so that the child can center his or her mind on the
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   content for a very short period of time.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.400]   I've seen that work such good.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.940]   Let's go on to year four.
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:07.600]   Here are some of the year four books.
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:11.520]   In the year four books, we have some sixth grade books, some ninth grade books as measured
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.480]   by the Lexile scores.
[00:54:13.480 --> 00:54:19.600]   We also have Bernford's book, Incredible Journey, which has a 1320 Lexile score, twelfth grade
[00:54:19.600 --> 00:54:22.240]   under the Lexile ratings.
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:26.040]   We're reading in year four, The Life and Adventures of Robinson Crusoe, the original one, which
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:30.200]   has a 1360 Lexile rating which is mapped to twelfth grade.
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:35.640]   We're reading Irving's book, Legend of Sleepy Hollow, which has a Lexile score of 1460 which
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:38.320]   is mapped to college junior.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:44.440]   We're reading Plutarch's Lives, which has a Lexile score of 1690 which is mapped to
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:49.920]   a graduate level approach.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:55.760]   I'm watching my eight year old just this morning, I'm reading Plutarch with him and watching
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:59.640]   him sort of kind of understand it.
[00:54:59.640 --> 00:55:07.000]   Now again, that's not to say that my eight year old has the capacity of a graduate level
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.440]   college student.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.440]   He doesn't.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:14.080]   He doesn't have the capacity to maintain it for long periods of time.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:19.640]   It doesn't have the capacity to engage with it in the advanced intellectual way that a
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:20.640]   college student would have.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:22.400]   Plutarch is something that we do all through the years.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:28.000]   We start it in year four and then we do it all the way through.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:34.120]   And in the Charlotte Mason method of breaking this into short lessons, doing read-alouds
[00:55:34.120 --> 00:55:40.800]   in the early years, that expansion is there and that expansion makes such a big difference.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:44.920]   Again, without trying to sound like a proud father but rather trying to share an inspirational
[00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:51.820]   story, I've been amazed at watching my eight year old enjoy Shakespeare.
[00:55:51.820 --> 00:55:59.080]   Now after him being in his fourth year of an Ambleside Online approach with lots and
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:04.480]   lots of reading, now every year we do two or three Shakespeare poems.
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:08.960]   And what I do with them is to help my eight year old is I still help him with an audio
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:15.920]   recording so I take the original Shakespeare script and I find a really well done audio
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:19.920]   performance of Shakespeare and then I have him read the script while listening to the
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:20.920]   audio.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:26.480]   But the amazing thing to me to watch is that I don't get any resistance from it and that
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.600]   he genuinely enjoys it.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:30.320]   I've been amazed at that.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:31.320]   I didn't enjoy Shakespeare.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:35.760]   I still probably don't enjoy Shakespeare as much as I perhaps would like to.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.880]   A lot of us have had a difficult relationship with Shakespeare over the years.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:42.720]   It's never been a priority for me but Shakespeare is not easy.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:47.640]   But when you put together the years of reading and then you do it in the right format, then
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:51.440]   I came in the other day and he was reading Julius Caesar and he was just cracking up.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:55.840]   I took a video of him cracking up saying, "Isn't this just so funny?"
[00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.160]   And then the same thing happened reading Two Gentlemen of Verona right now.
[00:57:00.160 --> 00:57:01.720]   And it's just amazing to me.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:06.880]   And so these are some of the advanced educational opportunities that you can do in an appropriate
[00:57:06.880 --> 00:57:11.400]   scenario and Charlotte Mason's methods are extremely accessible.
[00:57:11.400 --> 00:57:15.400]   So if you're looking for a good overall homeschool curriculum, I would encourage you to check
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:21.080]   out some of the material that's available free at amblesideonline.org.
[00:57:21.080 --> 00:57:26.720]   That brings us now to the third area of thought on education that I find very inspirational
[00:57:26.720 --> 00:57:30.720]   which is that of a classical education.
[00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:37.920]   I've had a bit of a conflicted relationship personally with the idea of a classical education
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:43.800]   because it's such a difficult thing to articulate.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:48.280]   The concept of classical education is fairly popular at the moment, or at least in the
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:50.880]   circles that I'm in, it's fairly popular.
[00:57:50.880 --> 00:57:55.960]   But when I try to dig into what people actually mean by a classical education, I've often
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:58:00.220]   found a lot of the answers that people have for what they mean by we're doing a classical
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:04.760]   education to be really lacking.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:10.360]   Commonly, when you ask people about a classical education, they'll say, "Well, we do the
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:15.640]   trivium," which is the classic grammar, logic, rhetoric.
[00:58:15.640 --> 00:58:19.720]   But you should approach to the trivium, you have the trivium and the quadrivium of classical
[00:58:19.720 --> 00:58:21.400]   education.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:28.240]   But often when people refer to that, they immediately cite Dorothy Sayers' essay, Lost
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:32.560]   Tools of Learning, which I've read the audio version to you years ago in the Annals of
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.560]   Radical Personal Fineness if that's of interest to you.
[00:58:35.560 --> 00:58:40.160]   But my concern with that is though, while I appreciate Sayers' contribution to the subject,
[00:58:40.160 --> 00:58:43.000]   I don't find a whole lot of evidence for her assertions.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:52.080]   Her assertion basically that the classic concept of a classical education is actually to take
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.320]   grammar, logic, and rhetoric on an age-banded approach.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:59.600]   First few years we study grammar, then logic, then rhetoric.
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:06.760]   I've also had a difficult concept with the veneration of Greek and Roman societies.
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:12.520]   Being a Christian, it's a little hard for Christians, we have to swallow a little bit,
[00:59:12.520 --> 00:59:17.760]   given that the Romans executed a whole bunch of our forebears.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:22.120]   And there was a very difficult relationship between Christians and Romans for a very long
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   time.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:30.880]   Now eventually Christianity won, but I find myself pretty suspicious of the society that
[00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:40.840]   created the thinking system of thought that allowed for the broad-scale persecution and
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:44.920]   execution and annihilation of so many Christians.
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:49.440]   Now history is full of those things, it's not a big thing, but it's a difficult thing
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.560]   to go about.
[00:59:50.560 --> 00:59:54.880]   In addition to that, Greek and Roman societies have a whole lot of things that I think were
[00:59:54.880 --> 00:59:55.880]   just really bad.
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:01.600]   They were slave states, they were massive statist people who didn't care that much for
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.800]   freedom, but yet they also made many positive contributions.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:10.360]   And so I don't appreciate the veneration of Greek and Roman society whole-scale, while
[01:00:10.360 --> 01:00:14.720]   I do think that we should study and learn from those societies that birthed the Western
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.400]   tradition that we are all a part of.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:25.760]   I also have found it difficult to understand how to integrate that, the study of ancient
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   languages.
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:32.080]   A classical education, I have a hard time accepting the idea that someone has a classical
[01:00:32.080 --> 01:00:39.440]   education if that person is not fluently, regularly reading in Latin and Greek.
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:43.520]   At its core, that's what a classical education encompasses.
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:47.480]   And yet I look around at the world of classical education as it's talked about in the modern
[01:00:47.480 --> 01:00:53.920]   day and I see very modest emphasis on Latin and Greek.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:56.960]   And that emphasis often just doesn't make sense.
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:00.840]   So over the years though, I have grown to appreciate it much more.
[01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:05.480]   And what finally resolved this for me was I read a book written by, I forget the author's
[01:01:05.480 --> 01:01:08.080]   name, but it was a Charlotte Mason acolyte.
[01:01:08.080 --> 01:01:12.200]   She was talking about the integration between a Charlotte Mason education and a classical
[01:01:12.200 --> 01:01:13.920]   education.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:19.480]   And what she wrote really helped me because at its core, Charlotte Mason was not anti-classical
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:21.360]   education.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:28.760]   But what she observed was that classical education has always been, and perhaps will always been,
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.520]   for an elite few.
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:36.880]   Classical education is for the elite few who have the time and the resources to invest
[01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:42.920]   into the world's best teachers and tutors to require the students to go through the
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.120]   classics on a very deep level.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:54.400]   But that that was probably never going to be of interest and appropriate to the masses.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:58.600]   Charlotte Mason, however, was looking at the utilitarian approach that was so common in
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:03.680]   her day and saying, "We need to give the masses more."
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:13.680]   And so put crudely, a Charlotte Mason education is a classical education for the masses.
[01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:20.760]   Charlotte Mason was in favor of reading in Latin, but in her day in the 19th century,
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:27.120]   she was just facing the turn where reading in Latin was no longer required to get an
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:29.200]   excellent education.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.200]   If you've not studied the history of education, I would remind you that prior to the 19th
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:41.000]   century, if you wanted to be educated, you had to read and write and speak Latin and
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:46.560]   Greek because that was the language in which all of the materials were available.
[01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:51.360]   And so even grammar, for example, one of the things that also unlocked a key for me was
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:58.540]   when I finally understood that grammar, the use of the word grammar in the trivium does
[01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.760]   not mean grammar the way that we use the term today.
[01:03:02.760 --> 01:03:08.200]   Today in 2022, when I use the English word grammar, you will generally think that I'm
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:13.280]   referring to the rules of the language.
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:19.600]   We would in the modern day think of the parts of speech, subjects, verbs, adjectives, adverbs.
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:25.440]   We would think about how we inflect those words, how we order words to create meaningful
[01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:26.680]   sentences.
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:32.320]   But that is not, in my current understanding, that is not what the ancient educators had
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:37.520]   in mind when they talked about grammar, especially in the trivium.
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:45.640]   Grammar has at its core the Greek word gram, which basically means the same as literature.
[01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:51.440]   There's a quote by Quintilian who says this, he says, "Let us assign to each calling its
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:57.040]   proper limits and let grammar or literature, to give it its Latin name, recognize its boundaries."
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.120]   That's from the Institutes of Oratory.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:07.080]   So now when I see the word grammar, I automatically substitute literature.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.920]   And that the study of grammar is not exclusively to learning how to read.
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:17.520]   I'll read another quote, because Quintilian does not limit the study of grammar to merely
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.280]   learning how to read.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:24.960]   He understands the word and uses it to continue to the level of reading with comprehension,
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:29.560]   which means that a wide variety of knowledge is also required for grammar.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:33.920]   Here's the quote, "Then again, grammar cannot be complete without a study of music, since
[01:04:33.920 --> 01:04:38.840]   it has to pronounce on questions of meter and rhythm, nor could it make the poets intelligible
[01:04:38.840 --> 01:04:40.800]   without a knowledge of astronomy.
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:45.700]   For to take a single instance in indicating the seasons of the year, they constantly refer
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:48.760]   to the rising and setting of constellations.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:52.160]   Again a knowledge of philosophy is essential to grammar, not only because of the countless
[01:04:52.160 --> 01:04:57.320]   passages in almost every poem, derived from the most intimate and subtle mysteries of
[01:04:57.320 --> 01:05:02.640]   natural science, but also for the sake of various Greek and Latin poets, writers who
[01:05:02.640 --> 01:05:07.200]   have embodied the teaching of philosophy in their verse."
[01:05:07.200 --> 01:05:12.200]   And I'm reading this from the book that I alluded to earlier, Consider This, The Charlotte
[01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:17.200]   Mason and the Classical Tradition, written by Karen Glass, who's one of the contributors
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:19.160]   at Amblesight Online.
[01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:25.000]   So when I finally understood that, to me it unlocked the meaning of classical education,
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:28.600]   because now whenever I see grammar I simply mean literature.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:35.080]   And then now the concept of literature, logic and rhetoric as part of the trivium makes
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:42.400]   vastly more sense than it did when I considered it in the context of grammar, logic and rhetoric.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:50.000]   So I believe that a classical education is very much worth having and worth pursuing.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:57.760]   I just would like there to be a higher use of the word than I see used around right now.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.080]   If you would like, if a classical education interests you, the book that I would recommend
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:09.720]   to you that has a complete curriculum outlined in it is the book from which I read the prologue
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.000]   in the episode immediately prior to this in the podcast feed, called The Well-Trained
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:21.080]   Mind by Susan Wise Bower and Jesse Wise, The Well-Trained Mind, a Guide to Classical Education
[01:06:21.080 --> 01:06:22.480]   at Home.
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:28.120]   And I think that this book is your best single book to start with to give you an overview
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:31.100]   of a classical education.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:38.000]   And while I don't see many significant differences myself between Charlotte Mason and a classical
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:45.600]   education, I think that either of those curricula are really excellent.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:51.840]   I think that The Well-Trained Mind is a book that all home educating parents should have
[01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:57.640]   on their shelf and should be referring to and that while I'm currently more attracted
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:07:07.960]   to the Ambleside Online curriculum, I basically draw from both and create my own hybrid system
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:11.480]   as my wife and I have talked about in the joint podcast that we released, because we
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.760]   do use some additional resources as well.
[01:07:13.760 --> 01:07:18.200]   And that's what you get to do as a parent, is you get to say, "Where are we short right
[01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:19.200]   now?
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:20.520]   What would we like to add in?"
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:21.960]   And add those things in.
[01:07:21.960 --> 01:07:29.440]   But if you use some of these frameworks to build upon, then you'll have a really powerful
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:30.760]   starting point.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:37.880]   I add in, just to add a little bit more, from the context of grammar, what I have done is
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:44.680]   I have laid out all of the subjects that I think my children should be exposed to.
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:53.400]   Then what I do is in the context of our daily formalized homeschooling, I keep a very, very
[01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   few subjects that I require and that I force.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.560]   So in this sense, I'm not an unschooler.
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:08.680]   So for example, my students, of whom I have two, my students have a math lesson that they
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:10.280]   do every single day.
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:16.760]   I believe that it is important to have the mental discipline where you are forced to
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:21.860]   do something difficult in order to develop character and virtue.
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:26.280]   My biggest complaint against the philosophy of unschooling is I see no systematic character
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:29.320]   development or the development of virtue.
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:34.920]   And I believe that at its core, that is the basic goal of a classical education is to
[01:08:34.920 --> 01:08:37.240]   develop virtue.
[01:08:37.240 --> 01:08:42.640]   And that's at the core of a Charlotte Mason education as well.
[01:08:42.640 --> 01:08:49.120]   Not a lot of disagreement between those camps.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.440]   That's my beef with unschooling.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.940]   So I require a math lesson every day.
[01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:56.560]   And that is the discipline.
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:03.760]   And as we do that discipline, then I believe that that math skill will, at its core, set
[01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:08.680]   the foundation for the very important STEM subjects that a student will access down the
[01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:09.920]   road.
[01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:15.540]   But on this topic, I agree with another one of my inspirations, Art Robinson, founder
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:21.880]   of RobinsonCurriculum.com, who doesn't believe that science is really of any worth until
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:23.800]   somebody is a mathematician.
[01:09:23.800 --> 01:09:24.800]   And I agree with him.
[01:09:24.800 --> 01:09:30.160]   I think that most education is wasted because it's done in the wrong order.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:35.900]   You have very little business doing science until you have basically completed math.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:39.100]   So math should be the cornerstone.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:44.360]   That's why reading, writing, and arithmetic has math as its cornerstone.
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:47.960]   Then after requiring math, then we do reading.
[01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:52.680]   But reading of carefully chosen living books is not drudgery.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:53.680]   It's not difficult.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:59.440]   It's not anything that is hard.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.800]   It's joyful.
[01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.480]   It's enjoyable.
[01:10:02.480 --> 01:10:08.000]   And where I think that unschoolers have... some unschoolers have it right.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.680]   Some unschoolers have this concept that basically, "I'm going to look for my child's... where
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:15.960]   my child's interests are.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.280]   What are his natural inclinations, his natural proclivities?
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:24.720]   And then I'm going to surround him with the resources that he needs to explore those things."
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:27.880]   I think that's the right approach.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:30.920]   Meaning you want to put the resources there.
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:36.080]   My complaint is, why on earth would you think that an eight-year-old has any clue about
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:41.360]   what his natural inclinations or proclivities are?
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:44.800]   Why would you think that a 14-year-old has any clue what his natural inclinations or
[01:10:44.800 --> 01:10:51.040]   proclivities are, unless that eight-year-old or 14-year-old has been exposed to a wide
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:54.160]   variety of options?
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:11:01.560]   So many people have had such insulated life experience where they have no idea what their
[01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:03.240]   options are.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:07.480]   And even if you say, "Hey, we're unschooling world schoolers.
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:11.080]   I'm exposing my children to the world's populations."
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:18.480]   Yeah, but you're leaving out a whole broad swath of interesting topics if you just are
[01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:24.760]   doing travel or you're just doing sports or archery or things like that.
[01:11:24.760 --> 01:11:31.120]   And so as a parent, I want to spread in front of my children a delectable feast, a delectable
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:32.920]   buffet of options.
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:39.900]   And then I want to consistently encourage them to sample each and every one of the options.
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:47.400]   But I want to do it in a very gentle way so that I don't force my children to study things
[01:11:47.400 --> 01:11:49.960]   that are genuinely not necessary.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:55.940]   And I want to emphasize the options that they most enjoy while continually bringing them
[01:11:55.940 --> 01:11:57.860]   back to sample other options.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:12:01.040]   Because as humans, our interests change over time.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:05.160]   And so I think that unschoolers who don't lay that feast in front of their children
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:07.140]   do a great disservice.
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:12.400]   And so reading is at its core, and reading is at the core of a classical education.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:15.000]   Reading is at the core of a Charlotte Mason education.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.200]   It's just a matter of reading the right kind of books, not dull, boring textbooks, but
[01:12:20.200 --> 01:12:24.920]   rather living, exciting books, and then reading them in the right way.
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:32.240]   Short lessons, which allow the child to access materials that are far beyond his or her capacity,
[01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:37.040]   and then maintaining those lessons for a long period of time so that the child's mind has
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:43.420]   time to dwell on the big ideas, not rushing through things, but stretching them out.
[01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:46.200]   And then you have the classic writing.
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:48.740]   And writing is where we think.
[01:12:48.740 --> 01:12:53.440]   We think most effectively as humans by writing.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:59.780]   And so in a Charlotte Mason approach, at the very young age, we teach children through
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:05.300]   what's called narration, which is oral narration in the beginning, where we don't do tests,
[01:13:05.300 --> 01:13:06.300]   we don't do quizzes.
[01:13:06.300 --> 01:13:11.140]   We simply require our children to narrate or to tell about what they read.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:18.100]   And then that narration that begins orally turns to written narrations down the road.
[01:13:18.100 --> 01:13:22.740]   And so at its core, those are the things that I think are important.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:26.180]   Then everything else can be interest-directed.
[01:13:26.180 --> 01:13:32.540]   So when I look at these options, I want to close with how does home education compare
[01:13:32.540 --> 01:13:36.740]   to the other option?
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:43.660]   I believe that there are good reasons for many families to choose to delegate your responsibility
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:49.100]   and authority as a parent over your child's education to an outside party.
[01:13:49.100 --> 01:13:55.300]   But I think that for many people, many more than currently realize it, a superior option
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:57.580]   is for you to direct it yourself.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:13:58.580]   Why?
[01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:08.860]   Well, number one, you can maximize each of those critiques that I made.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:14.140]   So I started with my critique and I said the quality of education is low.
[01:14:14.140 --> 01:14:21.600]   But in a homeschool environment where you're directing the education, you have the opportunity
[01:14:21.600 --> 01:14:26.860]   to make the quality of education the very best in the world.
[01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:34.100]   I work very hard and spend a lot of time carefully finding the best books in the world, written
[01:14:34.100 --> 01:14:39.540]   by the best minds in the world, crafted in the most interesting way.
[01:14:39.540 --> 01:14:43.260]   I work hard to find the world's best teachers.
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:47.620]   And in today's world where there are so many resources available, that's increasingly easy
[01:14:47.620 --> 01:14:51.260]   and easy to do.
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:59.180]   When I look at enrolling my children into a local institution, even the very best ones
[01:14:59.180 --> 01:15:04.320]   that are available to me, I am convinced it would be a major step down in the quality
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.860]   of education.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:10.840]   That's one reason I don't do it.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:16.560]   The environment, I critiqued mass government schools, industrialized government schools
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:19.480]   as having a toxic environment.
[01:15:19.480 --> 01:15:24.420]   In a home environment, you have complete and total control over the environment to make
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:29.260]   it as healthy and as productive as possible.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:35.180]   So you have the unconditional love and affection of parents.
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:38.620]   You have positive relationships among siblings.
[01:15:38.620 --> 01:15:45.380]   You can completely discriminate in any way that you want to create the kind of social
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:49.820]   environment around your child that you believe is best for your child.
[01:15:49.820 --> 01:15:57.260]   You can discriminate to keep out the influences that you don't want to be there, while bringing
[01:15:57.260 --> 01:16:00.340]   in the influences that you do want to be there.
[01:16:00.340 --> 01:16:02.940]   And then basically you can do the inverse.
[01:16:02.940 --> 01:16:11.140]   When you decide to expose your child to influences that you wouldn't ordinarily want to be around,
[01:16:11.140 --> 01:16:16.340]   you can choose the dosage, you can choose the manner, you can choose how you do that.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:20.300]   The control, which brings me to the third point, the control you have over the influence
[01:16:20.300 --> 01:16:21.840]   of your children is nil.
[01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:26.260]   Now the control you have over the influence of your children is maximal.
[01:16:26.260 --> 01:16:30.980]   And then the personalization of the education your child can have in the mass industrialized
[01:16:30.980 --> 01:16:33.380]   government school system is almost non-existent.
[01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:38.140]   Now it can be perfectly personalized.
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:40.580]   And that's really powerful.
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.660]   Over the last couple of years, I don't enjoy teaching my little children to read.
[01:16:44.660 --> 01:16:46.220]   My wife has done that.
[01:16:46.220 --> 01:16:50.060]   But over the last couple of years I've been so excited that my children are getting older
[01:16:50.060 --> 01:16:55.820]   and I've taken over more of the daily direction of my older children.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:01.580]   And to me that's so exciting because now I've had the opportunity to personalize and customize
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:06.620]   perfectly the education of each and every one of my children.
[01:17:06.620 --> 01:17:09.020]   And it's a one to one ratio.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.500]   When I work every day, I have my desk and my eight year old school desk is right in
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:14.700]   front of me.
[01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:19.740]   And so I can look over at any minute of the four hours that he works in my office in the
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:22.780]   morning and I can see what's happening.
[01:17:22.780 --> 01:17:29.540]   And I always can derive, although I'm not perfect, I try to aim for the perfect balance
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:37.300]   of just enough challenge to keep you learning, but not enough to overwhelm you or to shut
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:38.860]   you down.
[01:17:38.860 --> 01:17:43.220]   And when you have that one to one relationship or that one to two or one to three or whatever
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:48.740]   your number of homeschooling students is, it means that you can allow your students
[01:17:48.740 --> 01:17:53.180]   to go at the perfect rate for that student.
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:55.620]   So a practical application.
[01:17:55.620 --> 01:18:00.180]   And again, sharing this in the spirit of trying to say, here's things I'm learning, not the
[01:18:00.180 --> 01:18:01.180]   goal.
[01:18:01.180 --> 01:18:03.140]   The goal is not bragging.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:09.660]   My eight year old student is extremely advanced in reading and in math.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:16.040]   And so I keep pushing steadily day by day, pushing reading and math to keep him challenged.
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.960]   But he's significantly behind in writing.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.280]   We're doing remedial writing.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:28.900]   And so I don't have to fit into somebody else's structure.
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:35.660]   I can keep his pace in each area appropriate.
[01:18:35.660 --> 01:18:41.940]   If he were enrolled in a class that was an English class, his reading skills would be
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:48.160]   vastly ahead of the grade standard and his writing skills would be significantly behind
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.320]   the grade standard.
[01:18:50.320 --> 01:18:56.580]   But as an individual, it really doesn't matter because I can make sure that we're working
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:19:00.860]   through a basic curriculum and the goal is get better every single day.
[01:19:00.860 --> 01:19:02.500]   Get better every day.
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:08.380]   And then I can help him to shore up weaknesses in his overall approach.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:11.820]   And so I keep pushing hard on reading and writing.
[01:19:11.820 --> 01:19:17.820]   I keep, excuse me, on reading and math to keep him going as fast as his capacities stand
[01:19:17.820 --> 01:19:18.820]   for.
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:24.060]   But where he's behind of standard, then I push just enough that he's getting better
[01:19:24.060 --> 01:19:27.060]   and then I'm seeking to fill in the areas.
[01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:32.300]   So we work hard on oral narration, which he's behind in.
[01:19:32.300 --> 01:19:37.340]   But we work hard on that because those same oral narration skills are the skills that
[01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.800]   you need to be a skilled writer down the road.
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:46.260]   And then I've sped up the teaching of typing, proper typing skills.
[01:19:46.260 --> 01:19:49.920]   And then later that will result in even audio dictation.
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.520]   And so maybe I have a student who has a handicap.
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:56.800]   I don't, it's not a handicap.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:20:00.160]   It's just kind of normal boyhood development.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:03.040]   But maybe I have a student who has a handicap.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:06.560]   But that handicap doesn't have to affect every area.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:12.240]   And so if I customize each and everything and make sure that each student is pushed
[01:20:12.240 --> 01:20:19.540]   as hard as is possible to keep the student challenged without overwhelming the student,
[01:20:19.540 --> 01:20:22.720]   but you to eliminate the boredom, you have the maximum opportunity.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:24.200]   And I think this is our goal as parents.
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:26.400]   This is what we want.
[01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:31.640]   I got to imagine that if you're listening and you're a parent, that resonates with you.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:39.820]   You want your children's strengths to be maximized, their weaknesses to be minimized, but addressed.
[01:20:39.820 --> 01:20:43.200]   You would love for your teachers to do that, but teachers have an impossible task.
[01:20:43.200 --> 01:20:45.340]   They can't do it.
[01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:47.580]   But you may be able to do it.
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:54.740]   So when I look at enrolling my homeschooled students in an institution, and I have a few
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:21:02.680]   reasons why that may be something we do in the future, on some of these areas, I think
[01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.760]   it's a significant disadvantage.
[01:21:04.760 --> 01:21:07.560]   And I think it's worth noting that.
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:15.980]   When you look at the cost, I think of, although your prices may vary, I think that most private
[01:21:15.980 --> 01:21:23.280]   schools for not college, talking about K through 12 in the US system, are generally
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:30.700]   going to be at this point somewhere between $20,000 to $40,000 per year, perhaps higher
[01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:32.180]   for some of the elite schools.
[01:21:32.180 --> 01:21:38.580]   But $20,000 a year is a pretty kind of ordinary middle grade private school tuition, at least
[01:21:38.580 --> 01:21:40.620]   as I can see right now in many markets.
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:44.060]   There are a few markets where there may be smaller schools that get in a little bit under
[01:21:44.060 --> 01:21:45.700]   that.
[01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:48.380]   So when I look at each of my children, I just kind of naturally count.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:50.460]   I say, OK, $20,000 a year for each of you.
[01:21:50.460 --> 01:21:54.020]   I'm not going to put you in the government mass industrialized school system, but I've
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.480]   got $20,000 a year to spend on each of you.
[01:21:56.480 --> 01:21:59.980]   So 20 times 4, you do the math.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:07.780]   I can buy the world's best books and get a steal of a deal compared to $20,000 a year.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.060]   Let me give you context.
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:20.140]   I added up the book list from Ambleside Online, and the core curriculum comes out to something
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:23.380]   like 800 to 1,000 books.
[01:22:23.380 --> 01:22:28.020]   And then some of the extra free reading, what not, comes up to my number was around 1,400
[01:22:28.020 --> 01:22:30.580]   to 1,500 books.
[01:22:30.580 --> 01:22:34.100]   That's in addition to all of the other reading that my children do.
[01:22:34.100 --> 01:22:37.620]   By the time they complete the Ambleside Online curriculum, they'll have read something like
[01:22:37.620 --> 01:22:39.580]   1,500 books.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:42.580]   And these are some of the world's best books.
[01:22:42.580 --> 01:22:49.100]   Compare that book consumption that you can do in a home school environment with the number
[01:22:49.100 --> 01:22:54.420]   of books that your children will read in a more traditional system.
[01:22:54.420 --> 01:22:55.420]   I don't know this.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:56.420]   I haven't searched.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:23:02.580]   But if I think of my own schooling at a private school, we would have a number of textbooks,
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.020]   which we would read portions from.
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:08.300]   In K-12, we never read an entire textbook.
[01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:10.780]   We would often, I think, barely cover even half of it.
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:12.620]   Sometimes we never even read the textbook.
[01:23:12.620 --> 01:23:14.260]   We just had a textbook.
[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:20.860]   So textbook information is appropriate in some circumstances, but generally doesn't
[01:23:20.860 --> 01:23:24.420]   activate the love of a child for a subject.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:26.780]   That's the biggest problem with textbooks.
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:32.540]   If a child loves a subject and wants to have access to a good overview of the subject,
[01:23:32.540 --> 01:23:34.360]   then the textbooks can be helpful.
[01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:39.940]   The textbooks, I don't think, are capable of activating a love for a subject.
[01:23:39.940 --> 01:23:42.380]   They're basically a necessary evil.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:44.340]   And then what?
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:49.860]   Your child may read 15 to 30 books a year in many systems.
[01:23:49.860 --> 01:23:56.500]   It's hard for me to imagine a 10th grader in most school systems being assigned more
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:24:02.340]   than 30 books, if that, really in the institution.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:06.180]   Even at the college level, I've read essays by many college professors that they've had
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:10.980]   to dramatically lower the reading requirements of their students, even though the college
[01:24:10.980 --> 01:24:17.420]   professors themselves are very motivated to assign the reading, but their students just
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.420]   can't do it.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:21.220]   Their students lack the capacity to do it.
[01:24:21.220 --> 01:24:24.900]   So my point was that I can hire the world's best teachers.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:30.580]   I can also do it in a much more time-intensive manner.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:36.900]   One of my biggest frustrations with having attended a private Christian school for my
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:41.300]   7th through 12th grade experience is while I appreciate certain things about that, I
[01:24:41.300 --> 01:24:45.540]   considered much of it a massive waste of time.
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:51.820]   In a home education environment, I think that for younger children, you should have basically
[01:24:51.820 --> 01:24:56.380]   maximum of about three hours of formalized work.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:01.300]   For middle-aged children, it should probably be about four hours at a maximum.
[01:25:01.300 --> 01:25:06.260]   And then for older students, perhaps six to seven hours maximum.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:10.140]   That's directed, guided curriculum.
[01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:14.060]   That's not to say that the student may not be doing many more learning opportunities
[01:25:14.060 --> 01:25:15.060]   in addition to that.
[01:25:15.060 --> 01:25:17.060]   I think ideally you are.
[01:25:17.060 --> 01:25:23.460]   But that the curriculum that I described to you, right, that we're using Amblesight Online,
[01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:29.540]   those 1,200 to 1,400 books depending on which ones you choose, that's basically three to
[01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:34.860]   four hours a day for most of that.
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:42.860]   Compare that to the eight to ten hours a day that can be sucked up by the more traditional
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:46.640]   school system.
[01:25:46.640 --> 01:25:53.620]   Then you get into the mental health of the student.
[01:25:53.620 --> 01:26:01.500]   In many school systems, you have this dichotomy.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:05.180]   You have some students who are frustrated and just don't do well, which causes them
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:07.860]   to suffer self-esteem issues.
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:10.980]   You have some students who are incapable, not doing well.
[01:26:10.980 --> 01:26:13.820]   But then you have students who are high achievers.
[01:26:13.820 --> 01:26:18.120]   But what's happening very consistently in so many places is the students who are really
[01:26:18.120 --> 01:26:26.660]   excelling are winding up a bundle of nerves because they don't have time to do their work.
[01:26:26.660 --> 01:26:30.180]   You have students doing hours of homework on a nightly basis.
[01:26:30.180 --> 01:26:32.820]   There should never be a reason for homework.
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:34.220]   Never.
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:37.380]   What's the point of going to school if you have to go to school and then go home and
[01:26:37.380 --> 01:26:39.420]   do homework?
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:40.940]   It's a waste of time.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:46.420]   The problem is, however, that the school system itself is so inefficient that in order to
[01:26:46.420 --> 01:26:50.220]   keep a student progressing forward, you have to assign the homework.
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:56.780]   If you study the lives of high-achieving students, you find a terrible system.
[01:26:56.780 --> 01:26:58.140]   They're not getting enough sleep.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.580]   It's causing major problems to their health.
[01:27:00.580 --> 01:27:05.220]   They're sacrificing all kinds of things and turning themselves into a worn-out bundle
[01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:09.980]   of nerves to try to achieve something because they're smart.
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:14.500]   Take that same student, pull her out of that environment, put her in an environment where
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:18.380]   she doesn't have to wake up until her body wakes her up, put him into a place where he
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:25.460]   can get as much exercise during the day as necessary to feel good and to be healthy,
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:29.540]   where you can sit out in the sunshine and read your books and you have the time to do
[01:27:29.540 --> 01:27:33.220]   it, take out all the extraneous stuff and now you can collapse the education.
[01:27:33.220 --> 01:27:38.500]   You can get a better education in much less time, which now you free the student up for
[01:27:38.500 --> 01:27:42.060]   more extracurricular activities.
[01:27:42.060 --> 01:27:47.580]   So now all of the other stuff that we want to do, business skills, entrepreneurship,
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:51.980]   sports skills or whatever, can fit in very easily around the edge and yet you can still
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:58.100]   have a world-class education, especially even a world-class liberal arts education.
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:04.060]   Now your liberal arts don't have to compete with your utilitarian stuff.
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:11.260]   I could go on all day, I'll make one final point.
[01:28:11.260 --> 01:28:20.580]   If you are a homeschooling parent, this job genuinely, once you get past the first few
[01:28:20.580 --> 01:28:26.200]   years should not take much time.
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:29.420]   It should simply require a little bit of coordination.
[01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:35.660]   And the reason is this, many people have this flawed idea that parents who homeschool their
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:40.360]   children teach their children.
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.620]   As a parent, we of course need to teach our children all kinds of things.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.960]   We need to teach our children to make their beds, to wash their dishes, to wear their
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.400]   clothes properly.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:52.220]   We need to teach our children to be good citizens, good friends.
[01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:55.300]   We need to teach our children to be kind, to be honest, etc.
[01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:57.940]   Those are the things that we teach our children as parents.
[01:28:57.940 --> 01:29:03.980]   But when it comes to academics, we may need to teach our children to read.
[01:29:03.980 --> 01:29:06.140]   That's not that tough.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:11.580]   We may need to teach our children some basic introductory mathematics.
[01:29:11.580 --> 01:29:19.020]   But very quickly, we need to teach our children to teach themselves.
[01:29:19.020 --> 01:29:24.120]   Now at its core, that's the most important function of education.
[01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:33.360]   We educate our children so that they can educate themselves to accomplish their goals.
[01:29:33.360 --> 01:29:39.680]   I have very little interest in teaching my children their academics.
[01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:45.000]   I don't take much time with it at all.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.240]   At this point in time, I handle virtually all of the coordination of my eight-year-old's
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:51.920]   education.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:54.880]   That's working better in our family right now.
[01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:58.520]   It doesn't take me much time because I don't do it.
[01:29:58.520 --> 01:30:03.880]   I just simply set up the environment and then I give my student the checklist and say, "Here's
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:08.320]   what you need to do," and I just make sure that he does it.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:10.920]   That doesn't require that much time from me.
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:16.960]   This is why I've tried to point you to two excellent curricula, meaning Amblesight Online
[01:30:16.960 --> 01:30:20.240]   and the curriculum in Well-Trained Mind.
[01:30:20.240 --> 01:30:21.600]   Either one of these is fine.
[01:30:21.600 --> 01:30:25.760]   You just make up your lesson plans, you buy the books, then you give your child the checklist,
[01:30:25.760 --> 01:30:28.480]   and you follow the system.
[01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:34.800]   The point is that education is something that you have to do for yourself.
[01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.480]   All education is self-education.
[01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:42.760]   As a parent, you're more of a coordinator and an overseer of your child's education
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:46.680]   than you are a teacher.
[01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:51.840]   When your child needs teachers, you simply assess, "What's the best teacher that my child
[01:30:51.840 --> 01:30:52.840]   needs?"
[01:30:52.840 --> 01:30:58.720]   In most cases, the best teacher is going to be a carefully chosen book, a well-chosen
[01:30:58.720 --> 01:30:59.720]   book.
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.140]   This was one of my frustrations from the beginning through college.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:10.440]   My best experience came in graduate school because when I did my master's degree, I did
[01:31:10.440 --> 01:31:15.540]   the entire thing, save two capstone classes with distance study.
[01:31:15.540 --> 01:31:19.240]   The way it worked, they would mail me a textbook, I would read the textbook, and I would take
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:20.240]   an exam.
[01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:22.400]   Pass the exam, they'd send me another textbook.
[01:31:22.400 --> 01:31:29.680]   They mailed me a textbook, I read the textbook, listen to the lectures, took the exam.
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:34.680]   They send me a textbook, tell me, "Read these articles in addition," I go and take the exam.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:39.920]   And then in the capstone course, then we went ahead for the in-person module.
[01:31:39.920 --> 01:31:42.960]   They sent me a long list of articles and essays to read.
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:43.960]   I read them.
[01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:45.200]   I went to Pennsylvania for two weeks.
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.720]   We met together, no, for a week, I can't remember.
[01:31:47.720 --> 01:31:50.760]   For a week or two, we met together every single day, eight hours.
[01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:56.640]   We talked, talked, talked, talked, talked, had some very important lectures, done.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.640]   Most education should be acquired at its beginning stages by reading.
[01:32:01.640 --> 01:32:10.380]   There is nothing, once you get past basic reading, there is nothing that I can see that
[01:32:10.380 --> 01:32:17.880]   a high school student needs an in-person teacher for that's better than a combination of the
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:26.560]   best books, the best living books, the best textbooks, and where appropriate, video presentations.
[01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.280]   Why do I talk about video presentations?
[01:32:30.280 --> 01:32:35.680]   One of the opportunities we have in 2022 that we simply didn't have in 2002 is video presentations.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:39.160]   And I think this is underused.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:44.280]   We should not be doing what so many are doing now, which is put everything on video.
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:48.320]   You should not take the same things that you had to do in 1990 and then just record it
[01:32:48.320 --> 01:32:49.320]   all on Classroom.
[01:32:49.320 --> 01:32:54.640]   But what you should do, because books are still a better, more efficient way and a more
[01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:59.600]   effective way of acquiring basic knowledge and information.
[01:32:59.600 --> 01:33:05.400]   But what we should do then is seek out the best teachers and bring them in where they're
[01:33:05.400 --> 01:33:06.400]   important.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:12.520]   For example, I've already chosen my son's or my children's physics teacher.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:14.720]   It's going to be Walter Lewin.
[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:22.000]   Walter Lewin is an amazing physics teacher who taught physics for years at MIT.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:23.680]   And he's recorded all of his lectures.
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:27.200]   And his lectures are so good.
[01:33:27.200 --> 01:33:28.480]   They're just so fun to watch.
[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:35.300]   He's got 1.3 million people on, almost 1.4 million subscribers on his YouTube channel.
[01:33:35.300 --> 01:33:37.160]   And he's so good.
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:39.760]   And so there's a place for a lecture.
[01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:47.020]   But I want my students to watch Walter Lewin's lectures, not just unnecessary extraneous
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:49.920]   lectures in their local school.
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:52.200]   So there are places, right?
[01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:56.000]   Maybe it's lab work, et cetera, where you can bring in teachers.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:01.600]   But when those are brought in on top of the other stuff, you get much better results than
[01:34:01.600 --> 01:34:06.480]   stifling students and sucking up all their time with endless lectures on a daily basis
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:09.720]   when they could just read the same information about 10 to 15 minutes.
[01:34:09.720 --> 01:34:11.960]   I hope it doesn't sound like I'm complaining too much.
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:15.680]   But literally, I would sit in class in high school and in college and I would think, why
[01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:17.080]   on earth am I being here?
[01:34:17.080 --> 01:34:18.280]   Why am I here?
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:20.880]   Why are we going to sit here and go through what we just read in the book?
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:21.880]   I read the book.
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:22.880]   I know it.
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:23.880]   I got it.
[01:34:23.880 --> 01:34:24.880]   Why am I sitting here?
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:25.880]   But I was required to sit there.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:27.080]   And it's a complete and total waste of time.
[01:34:27.080 --> 01:34:33.720]   And so as I stated, the best thing for me with my experience was when I got to give
[01:34:33.720 --> 01:34:36.240]   me the book, give me a test, and I'll be done.
[01:34:36.240 --> 01:34:37.640]   Now flip to you.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:40.880]   Maybe you have a student or I have a student who's very different.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:43.940]   Well then you can choose that environment.
[01:34:43.940 --> 01:34:47.360]   And maybe for your student, you hire a tutor.
[01:34:47.360 --> 01:34:53.200]   And this is where one of the models that I think is very underappreciated.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:35:00.400]   Let's say that you don't want to or can't designate the time to supervise your child's
[01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:03.680]   education.
[01:35:03.680 --> 01:35:09.400]   I think more parents should seriously simply consider going to the old model of hiring
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.400]   a tutor.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:15.620]   If you have a couple of students, it's hard to do this on $20,000 a year, at least not
[01:35:15.620 --> 01:35:17.880]   if you're in the US.
[01:35:17.880 --> 01:35:23.240]   You could do this in some cases globally, where you could hire a very highly qualified
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:25.680]   international tutor.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.100]   Someone's coming from a lower cost of living, a highly educated individual, for perhaps
[01:35:30.100 --> 01:35:36.640]   maybe not $20,000, but $30,000 or $40,000 a year, pay living expenses, etc.
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:45.420]   But when I look at my children, if we come to the point in my family where I don't want
[01:35:45.420 --> 01:35:49.800]   to direct it or my wife doesn't want to direct their education, before I just willy-nilly
[01:35:49.800 --> 01:35:57.780]   go out and enroll my children in a school, I will seriously consider hiring a full-time
[01:35:57.780 --> 01:36:04.520]   live-in tutor or facilitator of my children's education.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:09.360]   Because now we can put those best of both worlds together.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:12.880]   And when I compare this to the cost of private schools, especially with our lifestyle, where
[01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:16.880]   I don't want to be stuck on a school schedule of when we can travel and we have to be in
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.800]   the same hordes of other people in the middle of the summer season or Memorial Day or whatever,
[01:36:21.800 --> 01:36:25.240]   I want to still be free to travel the world and live how we want to live.
[01:36:25.240 --> 01:36:32.360]   Then having a full-time live-in tutor is, I think, a much under-discussed option that
[01:36:32.360 --> 01:36:36.520]   many people don't consider that brings together some of the benefits.
[01:36:36.520 --> 01:36:46.520]   So the point is that each parent needs to choose what is best for your child.
[01:36:46.520 --> 01:36:51.320]   And my goal here is just to provide some options because parents are often looking and they
[01:36:51.320 --> 01:36:53.000]   don't know where to start.
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:59.000]   I believe that at its core, if you just simply set up a system where you have your child
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.720]   read a lot, do math every day, and write a lot regularly, it doesn't have to be a lot
[01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:09.840]   but write regularly, then that's world-class.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.000]   World-class.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.360]   The bar is so low, it really doesn't need much more than that.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:20.580]   If you just give your student a list of a few hundred books and/or turn him loose in
[01:37:20.580 --> 01:37:25.320]   a library and say, "Check out a bunch of books and read them," and once you're reading for
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:34.240]   20 to 30 hours a week, which is nothing, you'll have a world-class education.
[01:37:34.240 --> 01:37:38.560]   If you require your student to do some math, go to khanacademy.com.
[01:37:38.560 --> 01:37:41.920]   All the math classes are there for free if you don't have a formalized curriculum that
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:43.680]   you like.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:44.900]   Everything is available.
[01:37:44.900 --> 01:37:46.680]   And then writing.
[01:37:46.680 --> 01:37:49.920]   People become good writers by reading.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:56.020]   Writing is a skill that once you're past the basics of letter formation, writing skills
[01:37:56.020 --> 01:37:59.280]   do not improve unless you are reading.
[01:37:59.280 --> 01:38:01.640]   It's one of the things that's been known for a long time.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:04.700]   You don't write more to write better.
[01:38:04.700 --> 01:38:09.900]   You read more and then you write.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:14.600]   Reading more and reading extensively improves your writing.
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:16.720]   You could have a curriculum even where you didn't even assign writing.
[01:38:16.720 --> 01:38:20.800]   I'm convinced that if a student just did enough reading and had the basic skills either of
[01:38:20.800 --> 01:38:26.720]   letter formation by hand or of typing, eventually writing is a natural occurrence.
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:32.520]   There's nobody out there who is a reader who isn't good at grammar and who is an extensive
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.880]   reader, a significant reader, who isn't good at grammar and who isn't eventually good at
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:37.880]   writing.
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:43.840]   But there are a lot of people who aren't readers who hate their grammar class and hate their
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.920]   writing classes.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:48.720]   My idea simply in today's show is to give you those resources.
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:56.680]   Number one, gain from the benefits of unschoolers who really genuinely are showing us that you're
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:57.680]   a reader.
[01:38:57.680 --> 01:38:58.680]   You don't need to do all that much.
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:02.920]   You need to simply maintain good input around your student and your student will naturally
[01:39:02.920 --> 01:39:06.160]   want to learn.
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:09.280]   Gain also input and inspiration from Charlotte Mason.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:12.640]   I love the emblesiteonline.org curriculum.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:13.720]   Free curriculum.
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:14.880]   It's all there for you.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:16.760]   You can jump in, read about it.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:18.040]   All the book lists are there.
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:19.040]   It's wonderful.
[01:39:19.040 --> 01:39:20.760]   Really have nothing bad to say about it.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:24.360]   I also really love the classical tradition.
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:30.400]   While I'm not yet entirely sold, that I'm going to make sure that my children have the
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:37.080]   full classical education of reading everything in Latin and Greek, we'll see.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.100]   We'll see in the years to come.
[01:39:39.100 --> 01:39:44.360]   But if you're looking for a really good resource for the classical tradition, then just get
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:50.200]   Susan Wise Bower's book, The Well-Trained Mind, and follow her outline in that book.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:52.600]   All of these are good options.
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:40:02.200]   In conclusion, if you can, pull your children out of the industrialized mass government
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:03.600]   school.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:07.040]   Don't think, "Oh, it's good enough."
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:09.920]   These are your children that we're talking about.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:16.600]   You need to provide the very best that you can for your children.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:23.800]   It's very hard for me to see how the best that you can for virtually anybody is going
[01:40:23.800 --> 01:40:30.640]   to be a local industrialized school approach.
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:34.640]   Don't buy the hogwash of, "Oh, it's an A-rated school or it's a B-rated school."
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.560]   All this stuff is nonsense.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:37.560]   Don't buy that stuff.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:38.560]   A, at what?
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:42.840]   At passing tests or at making children love to learn?
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:44.160]   A, at what?
[01:40:44.160 --> 01:40:49.760]   Of teaching a child how to go out and educate himself on the skills and the things that
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:56.320]   he's going to need to know to be successful in life or on, again, passing a test?
[01:40:56.320 --> 01:40:58.280]   What's the point?
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.600]   A-rated at what?
[01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:05.760]   At making children be confident, effective young adults or at turning children into neurotic
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:07.920]   messes?
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:12.200]   A, at what?
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:17.760]   You're better off saying, "Grandma, can you just make sure that our children have a safe
[01:41:17.760 --> 01:41:23.760]   environment and just give them a library card and go and get 50 books a week?
[01:41:23.760 --> 01:41:27.920]   They can read whatever they want from the library, minimize the screens and all that
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:30.920]   stuff, and your child is going to be well-educated."
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:36.080]   If it was good enough for Benjamin Franklin, it's good enough for our children.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.640]   If it's good enough for Booker T. Washington, it's good enough for our children.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:44.520]   I promise you, that's why I mentioned the um-schooling.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:49.620]   But if you're unhappy with the education that your children are getting or if it's not the
[01:41:49.620 --> 01:41:55.960]   best that you can imagine for them, then take the action to make it different.
[01:41:55.960 --> 01:42:00.800]   If you do it, it's cheaper to do it now in the way that I'm describing it than it is
[01:42:00.800 --> 01:42:02.400]   to try to make up for it in college.
[01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.760]   You're not going to make up for it in college.
[01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:08.640]   Get the early years right.
[01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:12.160]   Do the best that you can with the resources that you have based upon the constraints that
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:17.340]   you have and your individual discernment of what's best for your family.
[01:42:17.340 --> 01:42:22.060]   But if you get the early years really good, you set the foundation for the later years
[01:42:22.060 --> 01:42:25.500]   being really easy and really simple.
[01:42:25.500 --> 01:42:32.060]   But if you let the mass industrialized government school system mess up the early years and
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:38.140]   snuff out the spark from your children's lives, destroy their love of learning, beat them
[01:42:38.140 --> 01:42:42.020]   down because they're the tall nail that needs to be beaten down.
[01:42:42.020 --> 01:42:47.220]   If you let that happen, it's not necessarily irrecoverable.
[01:42:47.220 --> 01:42:51.640]   The unschoolers especially have a whole thing they call de-schooling.
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:55.060]   Go and look about de-schooling and you find people give lectures on how to de-school your
[01:42:55.060 --> 01:42:56.060]   child.
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:01.940]   Again, I'm not a promoter of that myself.
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:08.540]   But if you can keep the spark alive and keep it from being extinguished, then feed it in
[01:43:08.540 --> 01:43:14.220]   those early years and then in the later years everything is easy.
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.100]   I'll simply close with that metaphor.
[01:43:16.100 --> 01:43:17.500]   It's the third time I've said close.
[01:43:17.500 --> 01:43:20.340]   Yes, I'm aware of it.
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:23.100]   Years ago I learned when building a fire.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:28.880]   Here is the secret to a healthy campfire if you are interested.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:34.100]   Many times I would go to a campground and especially if you're buying the wood, you're
[01:43:34.100 --> 01:43:38.340]   cost conscious and you're buying a $7 bundle of wood because you're trying to protect the
[01:43:38.340 --> 01:43:43.100]   North Carolina pine forests from the pine bugs in Georgia.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:45.540]   They have signs everywhere when you camp across the country.
[01:43:45.540 --> 01:43:51.580]   You want to keep your wood local to minimize pest infestation, etc.
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:55.540]   You often wind up buying firewood and you think, "Hey, you know what?
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:57.260]   I'm going to take it easy.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:01.900]   I need this firewood to last me the whole night and I've got two bundles of firewood
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:03.540]   and I want this to last me the whole night.
[01:44:03.540 --> 01:44:07.500]   What I'm going to do is I'm going to put a little bit of firewood on the fire, a little
[01:44:07.500 --> 01:44:13.540]   bit, and then I'm going to just nurse it along."
[01:44:13.540 --> 01:44:18.540]   But if you've ever built a fire, you quickly learn that doesn't work.
[01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:22.840]   You can't put a little bit of kindling on and then try to nurse it on and put a log
[01:44:22.840 --> 01:44:23.840]   on in the future.
[01:44:23.840 --> 01:44:25.000]   It doesn't work.
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:32.260]   Because what happens is in order to get your logs lit, then you have to have enough hot
[01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:36.620]   coals and enough heat to really get the logs going.
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:39.220]   Doing it a little bit at a time in the beginning just does not work.
[01:44:39.220 --> 01:44:40.540]   You have to do it.
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:45.560]   The right way to build a fire is you start with your kindling and then you put your logs
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:50.520]   on and you get your fire big, big, big in the beginning.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:51.960]   Pour on the wood in the beginning.
[01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:57.260]   And then what that does is it creates a big, hot, thick, deep bed of coals.
[01:44:57.260 --> 01:45:00.660]   Then not only will you have the fire in the beginning, but now you can just casually from
[01:45:00.660 --> 01:45:06.680]   time to time put on another log, a little bit more wood when and as you need to.
[01:45:06.680 --> 01:45:09.820]   That's the secret to a campfire.
[01:45:09.820 --> 01:45:12.740]   Take that metaphor over to education.
[01:45:12.740 --> 01:45:18.380]   If you get the early years right, then you can absorb a whole lot of stuff that's wrong
[01:45:18.380 --> 01:45:21.700]   down the way.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:31.060]   I don't know if I could have survived the institutional school setting if I hadn't been
[01:45:31.060 --> 01:45:38.560]   homeschooled for the first seven years of my education.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:43.380]   Because I made such progress at those seven years that kind of carried me through coasting
[01:45:43.380 --> 01:45:47.080]   for the remaining five years.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.660]   I don't know.
[01:45:48.660 --> 01:45:53.220]   My parents had good reasons to enroll me and there are some of the same reasons why, even
[01:45:53.220 --> 01:45:56.820]   though I think I probably won't, there's some of the same reasons why I always reserve the
[01:45:56.820 --> 01:46:02.020]   option and I'm very thoughtful and every year we analyze, "Okay, should we put our children
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:04.500]   into an institution?"
[01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:08.300]   But I think the same thing applies to yours.
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:14.180]   If you have young children, if you can get those basics settled, you can keep the environment
[01:46:14.180 --> 01:46:19.980]   where they learn to read and read really well and read a lot and understand that knowledge
[01:46:19.980 --> 01:46:21.740]   comes from reading.
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:26.820]   Even if later they find themselves stifled by an institution, they're going to be carried
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:28.540]   through.
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:30.660]   Same thing with math.
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:36.280]   If you get a good solid foundation in math, that carries you through the weaker foundations
[01:46:36.280 --> 01:46:38.060]   down the road.
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:44.900]   So if you can get the early years right and you have a really well-educated child who's
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:50.260]   got good exposure, lots and lots of grammar, meaning literature, lots of reading, lots
[01:46:50.260 --> 01:46:56.060]   of exposure, then that child can find an area of specialization, that child can get college
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:47:00.620]   scholarships, that child can succeed in high school, can succeed in college, et cetera.
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:03.540]   But it's really hard to come the other way around.
[01:47:03.540 --> 01:47:06.540]   Not impossible, but really hard.
[01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:11.740]   If you don't get those early years really, really strong, then it just becomes kind of
[01:47:11.740 --> 01:47:16.880]   a constant hard process like that fire.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.880]   With that, I really will close.
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.940]   I hope these ideas have been helpful and useful to you.
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:25.220]   I hope these resources are things that you find useful.
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:29.060]   Education your children is a big financial topic, and I hope that this has been useful
[01:47:29.060 --> 01:47:30.060]   to you.
[01:47:30.060 --> 01:47:37.460]   I wish you great discernment and great wisdom as you seek to shepherd and guide the lives
[01:47:37.460 --> 01:47:41.300]   that are entrusted to you.
[01:47:41.300 --> 01:47:43.940]   I trust you to do a good job with that.
[01:47:43.940 --> 01:47:45.860]   Remember, I don't know your children.
[01:47:45.860 --> 01:47:49.100]   Sharing ideas, you figure out the appropriate application.
