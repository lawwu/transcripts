[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.040]   Welcome to Radical Personal Finance, the show dedicated to providing you with the knowledge,
[00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:11.480]   skills, insight and encouragement you need to live a rich and meaningful life now while
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.040]   building a plan for financial freedom in 10 years or less.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.760]   One of the obvious aspects of financial freedom is interesting ways to earn your income, ideally
[00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.200]   in the best way possible that suits your lifestyle.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.160]   My guest today is Brad DeGraw.
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.320]   Brad is here to teach us a little bit about what he's doing.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.360]   Brad, introduce yourself and share with us a little bit about your story.
[00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.360]   Thanks.
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.720]   I'm Brad DeGraw.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.520]   I am a big fan of Amazon.
[00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.600]   In fact, I'm an Amazon nerd.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.600]   I started with $100 and a Wi-Fi connection four years ago.
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.080]   Through that time, I've been able to build a brand that sells seven figures a year.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.320]   You're going to have to expand that because most of us think of Amazon as the corporate
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.840]   company that we're just actually buying from, but Amazon is much more than that.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.400]   It's a trading platform, right?
[00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.440]   It's a third-party platform where people like you, me, even your audience members can go
[00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.360]   there and sell products.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.380]   So third-party products, you can create your own brand.
[00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.720]   You can even resell existing products that you could find laying around the house or
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.720]   in the stores.
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.000]   What got you turned on to the idea?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.080]   You know, I got fired too many times.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.640]   All good things come out of a firing, right?
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.640]   I got fired way too many times and my brain was fried.
[00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.720]   I picked up a book that put out the idea that you could buy arbitrage.
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.120]   Basically, you could buy clearance inventory from retail stores and sell it for retail
[00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.720]   or sometimes even beyond retail.
[00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.640]   That's how I was able to start with $100.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.440]   I went to the stores and I bought the clearance merchandise right off the shelf, right through
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.140]   the front door, and I made six figures my first year.
[00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.240]   So you were physically packaging things up and shipping it out yourself, trundling boxes
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.280]   down to the post office, that type of thing?
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.280]   Yes.
[00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.040]   In the beginning, I lived in a second-floor apartment, no garage, so I had to carry up
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.280]   1,000 pounds of inventory every week and back down the stairs and into the car to the UPS
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.280]   store.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.840]   It was rough in the beginning, but that's what hustled us.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.720]   Is that opportunity still available today?
[00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.080]   That's a great place to start.
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.100]   If someone wanted to get started with very little risk, you could buy known brands of
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:33.360]   products from Walgreens or Sam's Club, Costco, Walmart.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.920]   You could start buying very low and selling high, ship it into Amazon's inventory, and
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.360]   then they ship it to the customers.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:54.040]   Many people perceive Amazon as a low-price leader, a good place to find deals.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040]   Why is this possible?
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.640]   If Amazon itself, shouldn't they be providing the products for cheaper?
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.240]   If Walmart can sell them out their front door for a discounted price, why can't Amazon?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.640]   Amazon's really all about give it to me now.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.960]   It's instant gratification, quick delivery.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.880]   They're not promoting themselves as the absolute best price.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.080]   In many cases, people will pay a premium to not have just the product, but have the product
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.200]   delivered right to their door.
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.720]   There are people who don't go outside for health reasons, or maybe they're students.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   They don't have a car.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.440]   They don't have access to a Costco or a Sam's Club.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.840]   There's tons of people.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.240]   Maybe they live in Alaska or Hawaii, and the stores just aren't available.
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:41.520]   There's tons of people who will pay for products and the additional service and the warranty
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.760]   and the guarantees that Amazon provides.
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:49.120]   I heard a friend of mine was down from New York City recently and was telling me that
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.680]   in the office building in New York City where he works, you basically just don't even want
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:59.920]   to try to leave the office in the mid-morning to mid-day simply because you're not going
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.740]   to get back in or out because the elevators are so full with all the Amazon delivery people
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.400]   doing same-day delivery service.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.200]   I just realized that this Amazon even the same-day delivery thing culture has completely
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.440]   passed me by.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:16.720]   That was something that snuck up on me.
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.120]   I had no clue about that.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.800]   It's an amazing game changer.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.440]   Tell me what were the products that you started with?
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.000]   In the beginning, I did health and beauty products.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.360]   Even though I didn't wear lipstick and cosmetics, it was an interesting place to start because
[00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.000]   they're seasonal.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   The seasons change and the colors and the variations.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.800]   I was able to jump in at the end of one season and the beginning of the next.
[00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.500]   Just because the seasons change doesn't mean that everyone wants to change with it.
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:56.720]   People wanted those colors and styles that were now out of season.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.100]   That's one easy place to start.
[00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.920]   Now we manufacture our products.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:08.400]   I'm in love with pet products, parenting products, privacy products, sports and outdoor things.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.480]   Those are great places to be because they're emotional.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.760]   Anytime you can charge and connect with someone's emotions with a product, it's the best because
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.760]   you can charge a premium at that point.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.000]   Tell me about the arc of your business.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.200]   What year was this that you started and what have been the changes and developments that
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.640]   you've made as time has gone by?
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:36.640]   We started in 2012.
[00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.080]   Like I said, I was fired too many times.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.840]   I didn't have a lot of money or options.
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.220]   I started with a Kindle Fire and a little personal MiFi connection.
[00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:52.560]   As I found that you can make money on buying low and selling high, I noticed other people
[00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:54.080]   were doing the same.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.160]   When we're all selling the exact same product, there will be someone who wants to drop their
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.400]   price a little bit.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.960]   We call this price erosion.
[00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.040]   It's seeing who can make the least amount of money the fastest.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.400]   So I wanted to do something different.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.040]   I created bundles.
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:15.120]   So instead of selling a single product, I now sold a three-pack, which made me the only
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:20.680]   one selling the three-pack so I could keep my price steady and drive it higher.
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.040]   Next up, once I learned how to create Amazon listings, I learned how to create traffic,
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.640]   drive traffic to the listing, make great images and copies so that we had better conversion.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:37.120]   That means the people who see it are more interested in buying it.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:41.680]   And then that evolved into actually designing our own products.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:43.760]   In the beginning, we did a Me Too product.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.760]   It was a skinny pill called Garcinia Cambogia.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:54.640]   Dr. Oz promoted this as a magic weight loss pill, and so we produced that.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.320]   Eventually we learned that you had to do something that was unique in Me Too.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.400]   I'm sorry, unique rather than a Me Too product.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.520]   It needed just a little bit of innovation rather than duplication.
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:10.680]   And that's how now we have a designer who will help us make products better.
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:15.440]   You can just simply look at any best-selling product on Amazon and read the one, two and
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.320]   three-star reviews.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.120]   Those will tell you people's missed expectations.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.320]   And from there, you can fix it.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.040]   Sometimes it's something simple you don't even need a designer for.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.800]   Sometimes it's just packaging.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.040]   You just change the packaging and the product gets to the people unbroken or in a better
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.040]   condition.
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:38.320]   Ted: And then you just hope that people start buying your product and then you get better
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.080]   reviews and so then Amazon suggests it as an alternative item?
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.160]   Tell me about the actual buying process once you introduce a product.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:48.400]   Dr. Oz: Absolutely.
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:54.040]   So once you have a product made, and you can make them here in the US or overseas, it doesn't
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:58.680]   matter where you make them, but once a product is made, we want to get reviews because the
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.200]   Internet's a scary place.
[00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:02.160]   No one wants to be first.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:05.360]   So we get reviews from bloggers.
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.840]   So we'll send our product for free out to people who have blogs.
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.560]   And then they'll take a look at the product.
[00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.760]   They'll do a video of how they open it and they'll share their experience.
[00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.720]   Since we make great products, it's easy to assume that we're going to get great reviews.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.320]   So we have bloggers not just put Amazon reviews up there, but they also blog about it all
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.160]   over the Internet, places we don't have time for.
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.080]   So this makes the product more appealing.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:36.200]   Next up, we have great images, great copywriting.
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.620]   People do judge the book by its cover, so we have a great first image.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.740]   We run some paid traffic.
[00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:47.120]   So without making it super technical, Amazon has their own paid traffic platform.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.400]   And you're talking nickels and dimes.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:55.400]   It's the cheapest traffic you'll ever buy and it has a really great conversion rate.
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:59.920]   And from there, the momentum of a great product carries itself.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:06.720]   How do you go – so you have an idea for a product.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.520]   How do you go through the process of actually getting it designed and built and manufactured?
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.320]   Sure.
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.480]   So once you've picked your market – a market is a group of people who are passionate about
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:21.400]   spending money on a specific problem, fantasy, and desire.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:26.140]   Then you look at the products that they're already buying, what brands are already there.
[00:09:26.140 --> 00:09:32.360]   We read the one, two, and three-star reviews and we find the flaw or the missed expectation.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.700]   And many times, that's fixable.
[00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:38.800]   So it could be a dog collar that has cheap plastic buckles.
[00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:43.920]   Well, we could make it with higher quality plastic.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.320]   Then we reach out to the manufacturers.
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:50.760]   There are great manufacturers here in the U.S. as well as overseas.
[00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:53.680]   Alibaba is a good place to start if you've never done anything.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:58.000]   Alibaba is an option, but you want to qualify the people.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.240]   You don't want to just send money.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.040]   If you send money without great communication, that money is gone.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.760]   So communication is key.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.280]   We have a quick, easy script for talking to manufacturers.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:12.160]   There's three things that you need to ask.
[00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.160]   Tell me if I'm being long-winded.
[00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:14.160]   Can I dive into those three things?
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   That's all right.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:16.960]   In a podcast, my audience loves it.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:17.960]   Okay.
[00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.800]   I'll dive into the three things.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:24.480]   So on your first conversation with your manufacturer, whether it's domestic or overseas, you need
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:26.880]   to ask three things.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:33.080]   And those three things are, "What's the best way to get you paid?"
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:35.640]   Because different places have different options.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:39.400]   PayPal is not necessarily the easiest thing overseas.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.080]   Even domestically, you don't normally pay people with PayPal.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.360]   So it would be credit cards, wire transfer, things like that.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:51.440]   The person you're talking to loves this because they make money when you give them money.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.680]   Otherwise, you're kind of wasting their time.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:59.080]   So they'll give you better service when they understand you're a real customer.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:03.600]   Number two is, "What is the turnaround time from the time I get you paid to the time you're
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   ready to ship?
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:08.360]   How long does it take you to manufacture this type of product?"
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:12.920]   And the third thing is, "What's a realistic first order?"
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:18.480]   They may also call it the minimum order, a sample order, or an MOQ.
[00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:21.760]   That's minimum order quantity.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:27.640]   Now from there, you want to make sure they understand your design change.
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:29.800]   So what we do is we'll create a document.
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:33.760]   I'm from Missouri originally, so pictures do a lot for me.
[00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.200]   Especially if you're working with someone overseas, English probably isn't their first
[00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:38.200]   language.
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:43.500]   So I'll have a picture of the product with a little call-out saying, "Instead of lower
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:48.720]   quality plastic, make it a higher grade plastic or food grade silicone," or so on and so on.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.240]   And I'll make it impossible for them to misunderstand.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:56.720]   And then we communicate back and forth so that they make their clear on what the design
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:57.880]   changes are.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.640]   Does that make sense?
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:05.680]   So are you just simply sending them the physical product that you bought on Amazon and said,
[00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:09.360]   "Hey, or in some cases you're not even sending them the product.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.480]   You're saying, 'I'm copying this.'"
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:12.480]   Yep.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:16.800]   Sometimes we send the product and sometimes we just send the image.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.840]   We'll almost always buy the product.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.140]   It's nice to buy.
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:24.320]   If you're basing your product off another one, it's important to buy it.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:28.860]   Not only do you have the product so you can feel it and test it, but you get the full
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:30.080]   customer experience.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.800]   So if they have product inserts with coupons that say, "Go to the retail store," that's
[00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:36.320]   important to know.
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:42.080]   Their packaging, everything you can learn, you can learn through a customer experience.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.640]   Wow.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:47.720]   How do you handle, what are the minimum orders?
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.360]   Because that's one of the challenges.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.800]   You have a nice hook to open up.
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:54.480]   "Hey, I started with $100 and a Wi-Fi connection."
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.840]   That's a nice hook to get the conversation started.
[00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.920]   But at the end of the day, you're not buying products from China through Alibaba for $100.
[00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.800]   You're going to be out some money to get these things manufactured.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:06.800]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:14.400]   So a realistic startup budget is anywhere from $1,000 to $5,000 is realistic.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.560]   Half the products I've ever started have been for less than $1,000, soup to nuts.
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:24.520]   But yeah, your minimums can vary all over the place depending on what the product is
[00:13:24.520 --> 00:13:26.120]   and how complex it is.
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:29.920]   Sometimes you can get a minimum order of one unit over in China.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:33.560]   They really want to hook you and do business with you.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:40.320]   But most of the time, a few hundred to maybe 500 is a realistic first order.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:46.720]   So okay, so I've developed, I've seen a product and I've had an idea for how to improve it.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:47.720]   I've read the reviews.
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   I've done my research.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:53.280]   I know we're glossing over a whole lot of work here.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.640]   Now I order my units.
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:00.560]   How many units of a product are you ordering with some of these things that you're doing
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.720]   and what are the next steps?
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.760]   The fewest I've ever ordered I think was a dozen.
[00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:13.200]   And the most I've ever ordered the first time was 6,000 pieces.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.640]   So for me, there's a range.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:19.200]   A few hundred pieces is realistic up to maybe 500.
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.520]   Now they arrive.
[00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:23.600]   The first order I always have shipped to my house.
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.840]   So my neighbors hate it.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:31.600]   Someone comes with a drop gate and a pallet shows up and it's a little awkward.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.520]   But you cut open the box and you see, is this what we wanted?
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:39.720]   Now ideally, you would have already had it inspected, especially if it's overseas.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:45.280]   You can pay 100, 200 bucks and you have a third-party inspector go to the factory just
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:46.880]   to make sure the products are correct.
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:48.480]   They'll take pictures.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:51.920]   They'll make sure the product's correct.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:53.600]   So we get it in our house.
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.600]   We double check it.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.200]   We make sure the measurements are right, the thickness.
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Any change that we decided was important, we make sure that's complete.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:05.080]   Make sure it's labeled properly.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.920]   And then we ship it into Amazon.
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:10.240]   Amazon has great rates with UPS.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.880]   It's like 75% discount.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.320]   It's ridiculous.
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:19.360]   And so UPS will take all the boxes and pallets and ship them into Amazon's warehouse.
[00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:22.400]   Amazon has warehouses all over the United States.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:27.360]   So you ship it in there in bulk and then one by one, as the orders come in, they ship it
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:31.680]   to the customers in a little smiley face box.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:34.880]   - And does Amazon charge you fees to hold it in the warehouse?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:36.600]   What if your product doesn't sell?
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.560]   - Well, yeah, there are fees in the warehouse.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.920]   They're very, very low.
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:43.360]   They're lower than anywhere else I could find.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.160]   So it's abnormally cheap to put the inventory in Amazon's warehouse.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:51.960]   Plus, you don't want to turn your house into a warehouse.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   Next up, you do have to pay UPS to truck it from here to there.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.220]   There are transaction fees.
[00:15:59.220 --> 00:16:04.300]   When it's all said and done, you're about 25, 30% in overhead.
[00:16:04.300 --> 00:16:05.840]   By the time you do a transaction.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:10.840]   So if you're selling a product for $30, 10 bucks of that went into overhead between Amazon's
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:18.360]   fees and shipping and storage, all the little nickels and dimes that add up.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.080]   So if you're doing a $30 product, you want to make sure you're profitable.
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:26.120]   You need to make that product somewhere between $5 and $10.
[00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:27.280]   Your landed cost.
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:31.720]   When you say landed cost, that's the cost of the product, the packaging, any sort of
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:39.120]   inserts and shipping into Amazon's warehouse needs to be between $5 and $10.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:42.240]   You've been doing this for four years now.
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:46.760]   Do you have any guess on how many products you've done this process with?
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.720]   It's been probably three, four dozen.
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:55.520]   And are all of them still for sale or have any of them passed through the life cycle
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:17:00.080]   where you've pulled them from the Amazon store page now?
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.880]   You're a great interviewer.
[00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.320]   This is what nobody talks about is there's a bell curve.
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:10.720]   Everyone loves to talk about the top 20%, the 80/20, but the reality is it's 80/20 on
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.200]   both sides.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.640]   So there's a bell curve.
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.880]   And if you hold your hand up in front of you, that's what your product mix looks like.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:20.640]   One out of five is a rock star.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:23.880]   One out of five is a total dud.
[00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:28.320]   Every nickel you put into it is gone and you just wish you never thought of the idea.
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:29.960]   You wish you never touched it.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:31.160]   That's okay.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.760]   And then about three out of five times, it's a base hit or a double.
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:40.240]   You make money, but maybe you had to trim the price so that you can move volume or you
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:46.040]   make money, but you had to hold your margins up and you're just not moving a lot of volume.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.240]   And so it makes money, but you're not bragging about it.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:53.200]   It's not going to get you retired, but you keep them around until you have something
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.000]   better to do with the money.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   Right.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.640]   So I'm glad you brought out just the distribution because as I was thinking about the marketplace,
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.520]   my next question was going to be – and I'll just go ahead and ask it.
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:09.220]   If you'd be willing, pick a product that was kind of the middle of the road, not one
[00:18:09.220 --> 00:18:13.120]   that you brag about or not one that was a total failure, but pick a product that was
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:17.340]   middle of the road, it was profitable, and describe what the product was, how you came
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:22.400]   up with the idea and how long the lifecycle went and frankly how much money you made on
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.400]   it.
[00:18:23.400 --> 00:18:25.960]   And then kind of the actual story of it.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   Sure.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:29.320]   Well, I already mentioned earlier Garcinia Cambogia.
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:32.960]   That's a great one to use as a case study.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:37.480]   So what we did is we listened to Dr. Oz.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.280]   If you haven't heard of him, he's a market maker.
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.880]   The writers of the show are fantastic.
[00:18:42.880 --> 00:18:48.320]   So he goes out and recommends a specific product that can – health-related product that can
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   change your life.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:56.080]   So Garcinia Cambogia was the latest and greatest thing back in 2012.
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:58.720]   So what I did is I called suppliers.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:01.720]   There are supplement suppliers all over.
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.720]   You can get supplements made in the U.S.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:04.720]   I highly recommend.
[00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:08.240]   If you're going to do supplements, you start in the U.S.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:13.160]   And so our cost, our landed cost on the product was about $5 a bottle.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.320]   So they had us order 96 units was our minimum order.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.480]   So call it 100 for easy math.
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:24.240]   We were in this product for $500 product cost.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:29.080]   And I still had to pay a little bit of money for a label design, a little bit of money
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:34.760]   for shipping, and boom, I had a product for less than $1,000.
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:37.560]   Now my product cost was $5 a unit.
[00:19:37.560 --> 00:19:44.080]   We were selling this thing between $25 and $40 a unit.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:50.200]   So it was great markup, great margins, easy to replenish, and in a perfect world, people
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.200]   would take the product.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.080]   They'd take a month's supply and order in three or four weeks.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:20:00.600]   Now the unfortunate reality is a lot of people who are into weight loss products, they're
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:05.440]   into buying weight loss products rather than using weight loss products.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:10.040]   I had no idea going into this that that was a reality.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.560]   So we would actually call the people up.
[00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.960]   "Hey, how are you enjoying the product?
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.680]   What is your customer experience like?
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:19.120]   Are you getting everything you expected and more?"
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.440]   And the reality is people weren't actually opening the bottles and taking the pills.
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:27.080]   A third of the time, they never even opened the bottle.
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:32.680]   Now it's crazy for you and I that like to think we're logical people, but I was hoping
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:33.760]   to get reorders.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.840]   And some of the people who even reordered, it's like, "Hey, this is your eighth purchase.
[00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.880]   You're telling me you still never opened the first bottle?"
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.200]   "No, I've been traveling and busy and excuse and excuse and excuse."
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   "Well, do you want your money back?
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:51.160]   We don't want to take your money until you're getting some value here."
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:52.160]   "No, no, no.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.160]   Don't worry about it.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.840]   I've just seen another commercial and I bought some more."
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:02.360]   So that's one of the experiences.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:04.120]   You asked how much money we made.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.440]   Over $100,000 in profit.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:10.920]   At the time, I had a partner on that one who covered things like insurance and some of
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:14.480]   the other headaches that can be challenging.
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:18.520]   And so my split on that was low six figures.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.200]   And partnerships can be tough.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.880]   That's not what the episode is about.
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.080]   But if you can avoid it, maybe you should avoid it because I end up giving him the entire
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.040]   business for nothing.
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:36.400]   So, obviously, if you guys collectively as a partnership entity, if collectively you
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:41.360]   profited $100,000 or in excess of that, then you reordered many times.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:48.040]   So once you had the first 100 – was 100 units – you're using a bottle as a unit
[00:21:48.040 --> 00:21:51.600]   or were you counting a box of bottles as a unit?
[00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.600]   "No.
[00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.440]   One unit would be like 60.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:56.440]   Was it 60?
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:58.840]   I think it was 60 pills in a bottle."
[00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.760]   So you ordered once.
[00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:06.160]   You sold out of the 100 and then after that, you gained some confidence with the market.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:10.920]   More people were buying it and you made additional orders and started making larger orders.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:18.400]   How did you get from – because 100 units at just say $40 a unit at the top end, that's
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.180]   $4,000 of gross revenue.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:24.240]   So tell me about the process through where you figured out how to order more and then
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:26.400]   when the market started dying off.
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.000]   So reordering is the easiest thing.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.280]   Once you have a product made, your life gets so easy because reordering can simply be an
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:39.040]   email or a phone call and now you have more inventory.
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:40.760]   So for me, I was fortunate.
[00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:44.920]   We had multiple suppliers and that's another tip for you.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:46.080]   You don't need one supplier.
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:51.320]   You need like three because when your product takes off and everyone's buying it and your
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:53.900]   supplier is backordered, you'll pull out your hair.
[00:22:53.900 --> 00:22:59.940]   So make sure that you have multiple avenues for supply.
[00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.860]   So you could just simply – what I did is I just called them.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:07.860]   I had a local supplier here in Denver who made fantastic products.
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:11.240]   They always tested very high.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:17.300]   And so I just called them, picked them up and dropped them right off at UPS same day.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:21.780]   So if you're having to deal with a supplier that's not in the town that you live in, it'll
[00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:22.780]   be the same.
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:26.900]   You'll make a phone call, an email and they'll ship them either right to your house or right
[00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:29.380]   into Amazon's fulfillment center.
[00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:33.340]   And you want to reorder about the time you sell through half of your inventory.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:40.420]   So if you buy 500 units, you want to sell through about 250 and then reach your supplier
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.300]   and say, "Hey, let's do some more."
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:45.820]   And the supplier's job is to upsell you.
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:48.980]   "Hey, can we bump it to 1,000 units this time?
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.260]   I'll give you a little better price break or 2,000."
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:56.680]   Whatever you ordered before, assume that they're going to talk you into buying more.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:57.680]   And that's okay.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.940]   As long as you're on an upward trend, you're fine.
[00:23:59.940 --> 00:24:03.860]   Once your business kind of plateaus and it's steady – let's say you're doing 30 units
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.220]   a day and it's held that way for a month, two months, three months – that's probably
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   your ceiling.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:14.980]   That's probably where it's going to plateau out.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:19.700]   I like to hold between six weeks and three months' worth of inventory, more towards
[00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:23.980]   the fourth quarter and less in spring and summer.
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:29.540]   At this point in time, tell me about your operation.
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:31.700]   Do you have employees?
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:32.700]   Do you have staff?
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:33.700]   Do you have virtual staff?
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:38.660]   How are you managing your business, your Amazon business presently?
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:42.900]   So we have workers overseas in the Philippines.
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:43.900]   They are fantastic.
[00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:48.500]   They're not technically speaking employees because there's a legal definition of what
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:53.040]   that is and they don't meet that – they don't check the box.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:56.060]   So most of our team is in the Philippines.
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:24:57.060]   They are fantastic.
[00:24:57.060 --> 00:25:00.100]   They log in and they work virtually.
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.920]   So they can buy traffic, write copy, fix listings.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.140]   They can do all the technical online things that need done – reach out to suppliers,
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:10.780]   research inventory discrepancies.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:17.440]   There's a fair amount of little things that add up to a small pile.
[00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:24.860]   And then locally here in the United States, we have what we call associates and alliances.
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:29.700]   So the person who helps us with design, he's an engineer.
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.820]   We give him a split of the revenue.
[00:25:32.820 --> 00:25:36.640]   I have someone who helps us with paid traffic.
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.840]   And again, they get paid on performance.
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.400]   So as we're profitable, it's profitable for them.
[00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.780]   As we're not profitable, then nobody's happy.
[00:25:45.780 --> 00:25:48.600]   Nobody's eating well.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:50.320]   So they're not really employees either.
[00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:55.120]   They're more like revenue partners.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:58.880]   Do you market your products outside of Amazon?
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:03.920]   You know, the next place to go beyond Amazon – Amazon's the easiest place.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:04.920]   Start with Amazon.
[00:26:04.920 --> 00:26:09.960]   But next up, you want to do your own website, probably a Shopify or BigCommerce.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.560]   They're virtually the same.
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:14.000]   Shopify is the one we use.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:15.880]   You can buy templates.
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:21.080]   And within an hour or at least one day, you can have your own website going.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.140]   The challenge with that is just because you have the website doesn't mean anyone knows
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:26.140]   it's there.
[00:26:26.140 --> 00:26:29.780]   You'll want to go ahead and start getting traffic to it.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:33.040]   So yeah, you'll want to have – each brand you create, you'll want to have your own
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.160]   site for.
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:38.440]   And Shopify is the easiest way to do it.
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:42.120]   Have you successfully marketed any of your products outside of the Amazon channel to
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:48.220]   where a significant – where you've built a significant following of people searching
[00:26:48.220 --> 00:26:50.240]   you out because of that brand?
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:56.540]   Or has everything been these similar products but slightly improved, marketed through Amazon?
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:58.520]   Most of it's coming through Amazon.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.000]   And we're working on getting into brick-and-mortar stores now.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:10.240]   So it'd be a huge accomplishment this year if we get into Target, Sam's Club, Costco.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:16.480]   Those would be huge wins for us because those distribution channels can be even bigger than
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.480]   Amazon.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:24.240]   So the reason I'm kind of probing is I'm fascinated by the marketing end.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.400]   And I'm also fascinated by ways to get into it simply and easily.
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.280]   Let me give a little bit of backstory.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:41.880]   I've always been interested to watch how brands create their market where they just
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:47.040]   go and starting from nothing, they build this following.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:52.000]   The most striking example to me was I remember very clearly I was in high school when Under
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:58.600]   Armor came out and Under Armor came out and they launched with this big idea of – it
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:02.120]   was some kind of like Sunday night series on football.
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:06.640]   And somehow I wound up seeing a few of the episodes and it was – you saw these little
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.680]   Under Armor logos, UA logos everywhere.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:12.640]   And it was just incredible placement.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:16.400]   But they were targeting it and they had kind of built this whole TV show basically as far
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.600]   as I could tell around the Under Armor brand.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:21.600]   And that was essentially where it was launched.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.480]   And today it's ubiquitous.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:26.560]   And they took their idea and they completely developed it.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:32.320]   And I see people do this again and again and again where there is no brand and they create
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:36.520]   a brand out – they just create a brand from nothing.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.960]   And that brand has certain attributes, has certain things whether it's the – what's
[00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:41.960]   the latest one?
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.000]   The Yeti coolers is one I've watched over the last couple of years.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.360]   You got these $300, $400 coolers that yes, they are a little bit better but they're
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:53.800]   also 20 times more expensive than many other coolers.
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.720]   But they built a whole brand out of them.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.600]   There's – people want to be associated with it.
[00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:03.400]   And the challenge of that is I've always been daunted by the prospect of figuring out
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:05.520]   how to do that.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   It requires a budget.
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:12.200]   It requires people who – integrated messaging, integrated marketing, et cetera.
[00:29:12.200 --> 00:29:16.720]   But what you're describing is the modern way to test products, get products out there,
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.920]   see what sells.
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:22.040]   And then on the back end, you can go ahead and transition from the single channel sales
[00:29:22.040 --> 00:29:26.540]   through Amazon to the larger brand where you can create more of that following where people
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:31.040]   are buying not just because this product fits the attributes but they're buying the brand
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.200]   which seems to be the way that many large consumer goods are sold.
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.600]   So that's why I'm so interested to think about how you could start easy, start cheap,
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.880]   see if your product has traction and then transition it to a much larger thing that
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:51.840]   can ultimately be either have a higher sales or ultimately be sold.
[00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:52.840]   Absolutely.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:58.840]   In fact, if the listeners are taking notes, this is the one thing you must write down.
[00:29:58.840 --> 00:30:05.680]   A market is a group of people who are passionate about spending money on a specific problem,
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.440]   fantasy, desire and then underline problem, fantasy, desire.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:12.240]   That's what we build our business on.
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:14.880]   It has nothing to do with what's in the box.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.760]   Yeah, our products are great.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.600]   They're the best.
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.900]   But that's not why people buy them.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.760]   They buy them because they're scratching an itch.
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.200]   Remember the people who bought the weight loss pills?
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:31.080]   They bought the pills multiple times and never opened the bottle because we were selling
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.180]   them into that fantasy that they could eat whatever they wanted and their body would
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:37.640]   stay the same.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:41.920]   When we did the testing, it's odd that no one really wanted to wear a bikini.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:46.560]   They just wanted the same body in a year from now while eating seven desserts.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:48.160]   It wasn't actually about losing weight.
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:54.460]   It was about maintaining a fantasy that we can eat anything and there's no consequences.
[00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.480]   That was the fantasy.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.320]   Amazing.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:04.700]   I mean, use this to do good in the world.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.560]   This is powerful, powerful stuff.
[00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:14.440]   I'm laughing and I'm not going to join in on the critical bandwagon of being critical
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:19.000]   of people who buy weight loss supplements and don't use them because I've done it.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.920]   It makes me feel guilty about having wasted the money when I think back and recognize
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:25.600]   the times that I did it.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:31.560]   But what often happens is in that situation, you buy the product because of the emotional
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:35.080]   appeal to the fact, "Well, I'm going to be this type of person.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:37.560]   I'm going to be the kind of person that does it."
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.680]   In buying it, you satisfy that often.
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.480]   You satisfy that emotional idea that I'm the type of person who takes healthy green stuff
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.160]   or who takes these supplements and things like that.
[00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:51.440]   But then when it actually comes in, the actual discipline of using them, well, that's hard
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:54.960]   work and you already got the feeling that you were looking for, the feeling of being
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.240]   that type of person.
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.520]   So you put the pills in the bottle.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:02.040]   You put them in the cabinet or whatever and then guiltily over the next few years, after
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:05.800]   a few months, you finally cancel the auto order that they suckered you into and then
[00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:08.280]   guiltily you go ahead and use them up.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:11.520]   But because you feel guilty about it and you don't really like it and finally you just
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:13.140]   throw away the last bottle.
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:17.720]   It's a very sad thing and I can't be critical of other people because I've done it myself.
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:22.680]   Well, and this is something maybe a little closer to home for other folks who haven't
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:24.240]   is I'm a dad.
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.400]   If you're a parent, you definitely have done this.
[00:32:27.400 --> 00:32:31.640]   I live in a fantasy that I'm the best dad in the world, that my kid has a better childhood
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:36.000]   than I've had, that I'm a better dad than my dad was.
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:40.960]   And every mom has the same fantasy and will spend unreasonable amounts of money to prove
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:41.960]   it.
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:48.520]   So when my kid was an infant, I bought Your Baby Can Read and I paid $180 for these flash
[00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:49.520]   cards.
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:57.640]   I was happy and proud and nobody cared, but I spent it and I was happier at spending $180
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.960]   rather than like $10.
[00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:05.640]   It wouldn't have filled that void, that feeling of I gotta do something.
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.760]   I don't know what I'm doing as a parent.
[00:33:08.760 --> 00:33:11.200]   I think a lot of folks can relate to that.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:18.800]   So that's a really good example because I am very interested in infant and early childhood
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:20.960]   education.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:26.200]   The founder of Your Baby Can Read, I really respect and admire him and I admire what they
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.800]   did with their product.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:31.920]   And I've read some of the other scientific work and also some of the other reviews, the
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:36.600]   people bashing the idea of early childhood education, et cetera.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.960]   It's an interesting controversy.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:43.520]   But I've always been interested in that and I've noticed that I think there's an opportunity
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   there.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:48.560]   I didn't buy Your Baby Can Read, but my wife and I, we made flashcards.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.960]   We followed the, loosely followed, followed as it needs to be understood very loosely,
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:58.680]   but the Doman method, there's one of the, a guy named Glenn Doman was one of the leaders
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   in that area.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:02.880]   And it's been a fascinating thing for me to watch with children.
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:07.320]   But the Your Baby Can Read story is interesting because he got into trouble, as I understand
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.880]   it, I guess with the FTC.
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:17.080]   I'm not sure if you're familiar with the case, but he got into trouble with people saying,
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:18.960]   "Hey, this is a ripoff.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.960]   It doesn't work.
[00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.300]   You can't teach your baby to read."
[00:34:22.300 --> 00:34:27.720]   Are you familiar with any of the, as a consumer of that product and also as a product maker,
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.680]   have you followed any of that legal journey or that battle that went on with the Your
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.000]   Baby Can Read brand?
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.680]   Very high level.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:41.840]   And just so the audience knows, neither one of us are lawyers, so this shouldn't be considered
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:45.180]   legal advice, but it's a general best practice.
[00:34:45.180 --> 00:34:46.880]   You do want to watch what you say.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.620]   You want to give people the emotion that they're looking for without being deceptive.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:58.980]   We want to keep their expectations realistic, but their emotions high.
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.660]   And that's where things kind of spun out of control.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.660]   Right.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:07.860]   And that was, so where I was going with it was just to talk about legal liability and
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:12.700]   if you've faced any problems with that so far and then ideas for protecting yourself.
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:18.440]   Because in that, now again, I'm not an attorney nor did I review in depth any of the materials,
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:23.060]   but in looking at it and studying the founder, at the time I looked into it very briefly,
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.200]   I could be wrong.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:28.280]   But I never saw anything that I felt was based upon reading some of the books and some of
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.760]   the stuff behind the scenes.
[00:35:29.760 --> 00:35:38.160]   I never saw anything that I felt was actually – he wasn't – I didn't see any fraud
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   that was committed.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:42.400]   I didn't see any unreasonable stuff that was done.
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:48.720]   I saw that I think people misunderstood what your baby reading actually meant.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:54.440]   Your one-year-old reading does not mean that you can hand them the constitution and expect
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:59.520]   them to articulate the importance of the Tenth Amendment and how we should be employing and
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:03.600]   applying the Tenth Amendment in today's world to curb the growth of government federal
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.760]   power.
[00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.460]   That is not what you can expect.
[00:36:06.460 --> 00:36:10.520]   But your baby can read and the curriculum was effective.
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:16.280]   So I was interested to see how there was such a distinction between what people were expecting
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.920]   and then the legal liabilities that came from it versus what the founder actually knew.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.900]   The founder seemed to be doing a good job creating a product that if properly used and
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.440]   properly understood was effective.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   Go ahead.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.080]   Michael Munger (00:36:30): I agree with you totally.
[00:36:30.080 --> 00:36:35.380]   My son is now nine and he's reading Moby Dick for fun.
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:36.960]   The program did a great job.
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:39.480]   But yes, it's possible to oversell things.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:45.560]   It's possible for people to point their finger at you and say, "My life is ruined and it's
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:50.280]   all your fault," especially if you're going to do something that goes in or on the body
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:53.160]   with the intent of making changes.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:55.200]   That's where liability can come from.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.720]   And so now we stay away from products that are ingestibles because you do want to have
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.600]   yourself covered.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:05.240]   That's why there's liability insurance.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.800]   You can get product liability insurance.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.760]   You can get business liability insurance.
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:13.920]   And again, I'm not an insurance agent, but you should probably talk to an insurance agent
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.640]   and have them upsell you into an umbrella policy.
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:23.280]   Umbrella policy means anything we forgot to buy insurance on, you're covered.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:28.360]   So insurance is great, especially if you have to use it knock on wood.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:33.520]   We haven't had to use anything in our business associated with the product side.
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.880]   Real estate-wise, that's a different story.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:40.880]   - All right, Brad, let's talk lifestyle.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:46.720]   When you started saying find a product and copy it, it made me think of the famous excerpt
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:51.240]   from Tim Ferriss' Four-Hour Workweek.
[00:37:51.240 --> 00:37:54.680]   I remember I was an early finder of that book.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.360]   So I've watched the whole phenomenon develop.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:01.600]   I found it one day just bumbling around in a bookstore and then it was about a month
[00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:05.720]   or two later it started showing up, or about a month later, it started showing up on every
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:09.280]   blog, every mention, et cetera, and I've seen so many people go through it.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:18.160]   Well, in that book, he, the author Tim Ferriss, famously uses the idea of a four-hour workweek
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:23.040]   and he talks about how that can be created with, using his terminology, the creation
[00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.160]   of a muse, an income muse, M-U-S-E.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:32.440]   The idea is you can have this business that runs itself.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:39.000]   In the book, which has since been updated, he discussed doing it with custom shirts,
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.040]   like French sailor shirts, if my memory is correct, and he identified that you find the
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.680]   market, you create the supplier, you buy the ads.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.680]   At that time, he wasn't focusing on Amazon.
[00:38:46.680 --> 00:38:49.160]   He was focusing on Google AdWords, but same thing.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.880]   Then you get a drop shipper, et cetera, and then you sit back and you collect the profits
[00:38:54.880 --> 00:39:01.440]   while you sip Mai Tais on the beach in Columbia and basically get rich.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.000]   I would assume you're familiar with that concept.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:09.120]   The challenge is I want to hear what your workweek is actually like and I don't want
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:11.440]   the fluffy sales letter approach.
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:18.280]   I want to know what your actual workweek is like with building these businesses and what
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   you actually do and how much time was required in the beginning of getting them, finding
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:26.880]   the virtual staff members in the Philippines and people.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:28.880]   I want to hear about the actual business.
[00:39:28.880 --> 00:39:31.360]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:33.880]   I live a fairly simple life.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.060]   I'm walking distance to my kid's school.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:39.040]   That starts the day, five days a week.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.400]   I walk my kid to school.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.120]   I walk back and I think.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:47.400]   I take a half-hour shower because that's where my great ideas come from, is just a steaming
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   shower.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.400]   Do you have that product?
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:54.000]   I have it on my Amazon wish list to take notes in the shower.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Do you have one of those?
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   I actually have one of those.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Okay.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.360]   I even made one that's huge because I ran out of room so I just bought some Plexiglas
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.560]   and put it in the shower.
[00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.960]   It's amazing at the creativity that happens there because the phone's not ringing, you're
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:11.960]   not checking email.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:16.680]   The whole world leaves you alone when you're in the restroom.
[00:40:16.680 --> 00:40:20.560]   I spend time there and just get started with the day.
[00:40:20.560 --> 00:40:21.760]   I have a great breakfast.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:27.040]   My wife makes steak and French toast and I'm feeling it.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:30.280]   Actually, most of the time, five days a week, I try to go sugar-free.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.400]   No carbs, nothing that turns into sugar.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.080]   I have steak and eggs.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.560]   The weekend, we go crazy.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:39.840]   Then I talk to the team.
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:42.320]   About 10 a.m., we have a team meeting.
[00:40:42.320 --> 00:40:46.640]   It's super late in the Philippines but that's good because their kids are asleep.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:48.760]   We have team meetings five days a week.
[00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:52.520]   I just talk about what's going on in the business because I don't actually do the day-to-day
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.520]   operations.
[00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:57.480]   I want to talk to the people who do and that's the Filipinos.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:00.120]   They tell me what's going on, what's working, what's not working.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.280]   We brainstorm.
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:02.440]   We sing karaoke.
[00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:03.440]   We laugh.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.440]   We joke.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:06.240]   They're more than just workers.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:09.360]   We're in charge of helping them get a better lifestyle.
[00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:15.740]   It's a different cultural experience than you may find with most U.S. workers.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.480]   That normally goes for about an hour.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:20.360]   I'll do a call like this or some mentoring.
[00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.960]   I have some people I'm helping with their brands.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:28.800]   I'm also part of some small groups where we launch products together.
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:32.640]   We split the equity and the brand and the cash flow.
[00:41:32.640 --> 00:41:34.760]   One of them I call the band.
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:38.040]   It's an engineer and a traffic person.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:43.720]   We're able to just merge our talents into just an unbeatable stack.
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:46.280]   Then in the afternoon, I pick up my kid from school.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:50.400]   Again, I just walk up the hill, grab him, come home.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.640]   We hang out.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:58.220]   We do kid stuff, dinner, jump back online, goof off, research more product opportunities
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:41:59.220]   or brands.
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:00.220]   I'm a dork.
[00:42:00.220 --> 00:42:01.220]   I can't turn it off.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:02.220]   I'm addicted.
[00:42:02.220 --> 00:42:06.280]   Then call it a day, watch a movie or something.
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:09.040]   It's simple, kind of boring.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:10.040]   We travel a bit.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.560]   I just got back from Arizona.
[00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.640]   I took my wife to the Grand Canyon.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:14.640]   She's never seen that.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.800]   We went to Sedona and it was fantastic.
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:21.560]   We go to Thailand in October for a couple of weeks every year.
[00:42:21.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   Just simple things but rewarding things.
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:36.040]   >> So when you were building the staff, tell me about how you actually found and developed
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.960]   your Filipino team.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.560]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:42.280]   I'll tell you the real story.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.600]   It's nice to have a glamorous thing.
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:45.600]   It wasn't glamour.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.880]   It was actually a little bit stressful.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:53.640]   I bought a few pallets of inventory and it was supposed to be retail condition.
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.320]   It was supposed to be just new.
[00:42:55.320 --> 00:42:57.320]   It's called shelf pulls.
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:43:02.040]   Maybe the manufacturer changed the color of the box and so they have a new model.
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:05.640]   So I bought a few pallets of inventory that was supposed to be retail ready.
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:09.040]   When I got it, there were no boxes or everything was crushed.
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:14.240]   It wasn't fit for Amazon but it was something we could do on eBay.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.560]   The problem is I don't know anything about eBay other than people have lower standards
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:22.160]   of product presentation.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:23.960]   So I hired someone in the Philippines.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:28.560]   I said, "If you can do eBay listings, I'll keep you busy."
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:34.560]   And what would take me like three, four hours to do a listing, he was able to jam out 100
[00:43:34.560 --> 00:43:36.480]   listings a day.
[00:43:36.480 --> 00:43:37.840]   And I said, "This is great.
[00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:41.920]   If you can keep learning more things, I'd love you to do more things."
[00:43:41.920 --> 00:43:46.640]   And so we do screen sharing and I'd show him more tips and more tricks and more day-to-day
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:48.400]   tasks.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.000]   And now we call that the fire watcher document.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:54.800]   So every day there are things that you have to do to make sure if there is a fire, we
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:57.680]   put it out when it's small.
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.680]   And the team just grew.
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:00.960]   My needs grew.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.200]   The team's developed.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:06.520]   And we have training five days a week.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:09.200]   I'm the godfather of their kids.
[00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:13.160]   When they need something, they come to me and say, "Hey, I want to go get my MBA."
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   Great.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   Go have fun.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.760]   Let's try to keep the work going.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:21.800]   If you need anything, let's rely on the other team members to kind of pick up slack.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:29.080]   And it's just kind of one big harmonious unit.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:32.920]   Do you feel like this is the type of business that somebody could do part-time?
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:37.400]   That's the best way to start is part-time.
[00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:42.920]   So if you have a job or if you have tons of other obligations, I'd recommend starting
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.000]   part-time.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.400]   Take it as though you'd take a college class.
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.960]   Put a few hours a week into it, a couple nights a week.
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:56.680]   And before you know it, you have something that's financially rewarding enough, emotionally
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.600]   rewarding enough to pour more into it.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.200]   It's an amazing world we live in.
[00:45:05.200 --> 00:45:06.200]   Amazing world we live in.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.280]   Anything that I haven't asked you about that you think would be of interest to my audience
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:12.720]   before we get to kind of your websites and contact info and all that?
[00:45:12.720 --> 00:45:13.720]   Sure.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:18.280]   I'm going to pretend you asked the question, "What's the most important decision you've
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:19.280]   ever made?"
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:22.480]   Brad, what's the most important decision that you've ever made?
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.880]   Picking an amazing spouse.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:32.280]   I think if you do that one thing right, everything else in life becomes easier and more rewarding.
[00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:38.640]   And if that's not working out for you, find a way to make that relationship work.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:42.520]   That's the thing, because this is someone that you spend all your time with, awake and
[00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:43.760]   asleep.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:48.780]   Make sure that you pour your consciousness into having an amazing spouse.
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.080]   Invest in that person more than you invest in anything else.
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:53.080]   Invest in your spouse.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.080]   Amen.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   That's the word of my gospel.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:46:00.120]   Brad, tell us about your websites, your services, offerings, courses, etc.
