[00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:05.920]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.880]   This is Drake here.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.120]   First, I'd like to say I'm a big fan of your work
[00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.520]   and your books have helped me greatly.
[00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.200]   I wanted to ask a question regarding career capital.
[00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.280]   I've just finished my undergraduate studies
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.800]   and I'm looking to start my career.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.760]   I've graduated with two degrees with a strong GPA
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.320]   and have done several research opportunities.
[00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.560]   In other words, I believe I have accrued
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.480]   a lot of career capital.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.600]   How can I leverage what I've done in my studies
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.200]   as a student as career capital in order
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.680]   to start a satisfying career?
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:49.680]   Well, at your current age, the career capital that you have
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.000]   is basically relevant to unlocking particular jobs.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.280]   So you have where you went to school, what you studied,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.920]   what your grades are.
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.520]   For a lot of jobs, that's an important piece
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.320]   of career capital required to unlock that job,
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.200]   that you need good enough grades and a good enough program
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.600]   at a good enough school to even be interviewed for the job.
[00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.140]   This is basically the main investment
[00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.160]   you can do with capital you have acquired as a student, which
[00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.960]   is to say there's not a ton you can do with it yet.
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.680]   So it opens up more opportunities.
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.600]   That's great.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.720]   So pick one.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.040]   And it should be an opportunity, as we talk about a lot
[00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.440]   on the show, that is of interest to you.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.680]   And more importantly, you see that as you--
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.240]   if and when you get better at this particular position,
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.640]   it will open up options in the future that really appeal to
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.200]   you, that you will have good opportunities in the future
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.880]   if and when you acquire career capital ongoing to make
[00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.880]   interesting investments.
[00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.560]   So if you're looking at becoming a lawyer at a big city firm,
[00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.200]   you actually maybe are going to have a limited number of options
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.640]   for actually investing career capital as you build it up,
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.280]   because that's a particular job in which the only thing you
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.360]   can really get in exchange for your career capital
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.440]   is more money.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.400]   But you're actually very constrained about what
[00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.280]   your working life looks like as compared to, let's say,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.440]   an entrepreneurial pursuit where if you build up
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.800]   a lot of career capital there, you
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.440]   have a huge number of options of what
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.680]   you want to do with your life, what you want your life
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.680]   to be like, et cetera.
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.320]   So right now, you're at the very beginning.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.160]   You have good grades.
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.660]   Good.
[00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:21.620]   You have good degrees.
[00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:22.240]   Good.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.240]   That opens up options.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.480]   Choose an option.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.920]   Now you're kind of starting over.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.240]   The collections of capital have been cleared.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.200]   And you need to start building the career capital
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.240]   specifically in that position with an eye
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.160]   towards investing it, metaphorically speaking,
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.600]   down the line to make your working life
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   veer towards what resonates and away from what doesn't.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.640]   So how do you do that?
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.480]   Well, when you have a new job, I usually
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.320]   come back and say there's a couple of things
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.480]   that are important right off the bat.
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.440]   Number one, perhaps most of all, be dependable.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.680]   When you say you're going to do something, you do it.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.780]   When someone gives you something, it gets done.
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:58.880]   If you're not going to get it done,
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.200]   when you say you're going to get it done, you let people know,
[00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.040]   hey, I know I said I'd have this done by Wednesday.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.200]   It's taking longer than I thought.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.840]   It's going to be Friday morning.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.900]   And then you get it to them in that new time
[00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.200]   you said you're going to do it.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.080]   You be the person that people trust.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.840]   They're organized.
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:12.880]   They have their act together.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.560]   They finish stuff.
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.480]   They say they're going to finish.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.160]   That sounds basic, but it's one of the most important
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.840]   distinguishing things you can do in the first year or two
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.880]   of a new job.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.500]   That is the foundation on which you're
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.520]   going to build the fastest possible path to a lot more
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.200]   career capital acquisition.
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.280]   Number two, do the work you do at a high level of quality.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.760]   So I say I'm going to get this done.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'm going to get it done.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.160]   I'm not just going to do it.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.080]   I'm going to do it really well.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.560]   The people who give me something to do are not going to worry.
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.160]   Is this fine?
[00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.280]   Do I have to go over it?
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:45.640]   Maybe it's not really going to be what I want.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.800]   They trust that when you do something,
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.480]   it's going to be done really well.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.240]   Now, this may take more time, but because of thing number
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.280]   one, you know how to get more time
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.980]   because you were very organized and things
[00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.220]   don't drop through the cracks.
[00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:58.920]   So you know now to say, instead of I'll
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.260]   get this done later today, you say
[00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.340]   I'll have it done in two days because you know
[00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.580]   it's going to take more time.
[00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:05.820]   Or you know you have three other things on your plate,
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.660]   and this is going to have to slot in.
[00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:09.540]   So you can give them realistic assessments
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.500]   of when it's going to get done and give yourself enough time
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.940]   to do it really well.
[00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.900]   You do those two things.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.300]   You're dependable, and you deliver with quality.
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.420]   You do those two things for one to two years
[00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.800]   in almost any knowledge work style job,
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.840]   and the career capital is going to start
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.800]   being shoveled into your metaphorical bank vault here.
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.040]   Options are going to open up.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.080]   You're going to get moved up the chain really quickly.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.040]   People are going to want you on their teams.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.960]   You're going to get put in charge
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.040]   of more interesting projects, bigger stake projects.
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:38.160]   You're going to take bigger swings for the company.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.120]   All sorts of great things are going to happen.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.400]   They're going to allow you in about six or seven years
[00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.040]   to have a lot of autonomy of your career,
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.240]   make some investments, and make your career something
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.440]   that's really cool.
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.140]   But in the first one or two years,
[00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.320]   that's how you get that whole path started.
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:53.940]   So what's going to support all of that, make that possible?
[00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:55.980]   You got to care about productivity.
[00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:57.400]   You got to care about it.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.180]   You got to be organized.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.440]   Where does information go?
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.800]   How do I keep track of it?
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:02.860]   What am I doing this week?
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.780]   How does that fit into my plan for this quarter?
[00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.820]   What am I doing today in my time block planning?
[00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:09.300]   Is there full capture going on in a shutdown routine?
[00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.520]   All of the different types of things I talk about here
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.420]   for organizing what's on your plate
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.600]   and making the most use of the time you have,
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.420]   if you can master that, that will enable you
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.400]   to then be dependable, that will enable you
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.560]   to then deliver with quality, and that will enable
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.420]   almost everything else good that comes.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.800]   So I know it's not exciting what you have facing you
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.520]   for the next year or two, but it's really important.
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:36.740]   It is a time for geeking out about how you handle
[00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.340]   the mechanics of actually adding value to information,
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.540]   the basic function of knowledge work,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.500]   geek out on productivity, have your act together,
[00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.580]   be dependable, do quality.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.900]   That's gonna lead to cool places.
[00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.700]   And then all you have to do is remember
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:55.280]   that as that capital accrues, as it eventually will,
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:58.020]   that it does you no good unless you actually invest it.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.620]   And so you have to have a good vision
[00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.380]   of what you want in your life, what resonates,
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.900]   what doesn't, what lifestyle appeals,
[00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.500]   what lifestyle doesn't, so that when you actually
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.980]   have some leverage, you can apply that leverage
[00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.740]   in a very intentional direction.
[00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.320]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:15.900]   (upbeat music)
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.080]   (upbeat music)
