[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.720]   - Matthew, a teenage listener of the podcast,
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.420]   writes on to ask this.
[00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.060]   Dear Pastor John, when I hang out with my dad,
[00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.420]   I feel discouraged in my Christian walk
[00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.640]   because he gives me the feeling that God is a God
[00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.280]   who is full of rules of what I can and cannot do.
[00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.180]   Whereas, when I hang out with my friends,
[00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.640]   they encourage me by talking about the joys we have
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.360]   in Christ and how awesome Christ is.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.840]   I'm only 15 years old, and I feel as if this
[00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.000]   is driving a wedge between me and my dad.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.040]   How can I overcome this feeling?
[00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860]   Am I in the wrong?
[00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.960]   What would you say to Matthew, Pastor John?
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.920]   - I don't know enough about Matthew or his dad
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.880]   or his friends to pronounce on whether he's in the wrong.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.520]   But I do have things I wanna say to Matthew.
[00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.100]   And there's three of 'em, and here they are.
[00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.720]   First, Matthew, never lose sight
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.520]   of the biblical command to honor your mother
[00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.520]   and your father.
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:02.560]   Here's what the Bible says.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.960]   You know this, just a reminder.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.980]   Honor your father and mother.
[00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.180]   This is the first commandment with promise,
[00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.800]   that it may go well with you,
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.840]   and that you may live long in the land.
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.000]   One way to honor your father is to empathize
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.220]   with the long, hard challenge of raising children.
[00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.980]   Seems to me that your dad has put in 15 years
[00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.680]   into this job, if not more,
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.280]   if you've got brothers and sisters.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.280]   One of the things that makes it so hard to be a parent,
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.380]   and I have been one five times over for now 42 years.
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.160]   One of the things that makes it so hard
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.880]   is the unusual responsibility for children
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.760]   that parents feel that friends don't feel.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.000]   Parents long for their children to make wise decisions
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.480]   that don't ruin their lives, or ruin
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.120]   their Christ-exalting influence in the world.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.880]   So for all those years, 15 for you,
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.200]   your dad has had to balance do's and don'ts,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.360]   which are absolutely necessary to raise kids,
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.640]   with the blessings of forgiveness,
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.980]   and the wonders of grace.
[00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.840]   This is not easy, and I would encourage you
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.760]   to honor your dad by empathizing
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.220]   with this enormous difficulty of getting the balance right.
[00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.840]   You're gonna do it yourself someday, perhaps,
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.300]   and you will want your kid to be patient with you.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.020]   I would also encourage you, Matthew,
[00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.360]   to honor your dad by admitting
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.360]   that some of the feelings you have
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.940]   when you hang out with your dad,
[00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.360]   you say, "When I hang out with dad,
[00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.440]   "I feel discouraged in my Christian walk."
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.120]   Some of those feelings may be owing
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.480]   to some things that are in you
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:04.120]   that cause you to overreact to your dad,
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.920]   rather than being a problem that's only in your dad.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.640]   There might be some issues in you
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.240]   that make you respond in a discouraged way that way.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.240]   A lot of children feel oppressed by their parents
[00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.860]   when it's not all the parents' fault.
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.420]   It's just the way a young person feels.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.780]   I'll give you an illustration, Matthew.
[00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.460]   When I was 13, I can remember this day.
[00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:30.380]   It's not a proud day to me.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.380]   One day, my mother asked me to take out the garbage,
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:38.520]   and I remember, I can see the place where I was standing.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.020]   I can see the white, round-topped garbage can
[00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.020]   that she had to lift off.
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.580]   I could just see it like it was yesterday,
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.780]   and I almost screamed at her,
[00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.740]   "Doo, doo, doo!
[00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.020]   All I ever hear around this place is doo!"
[00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.620]   Now, that was not true.
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.100]   It wasn't true.
[00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:04.100]   My mother was a servant of no small proportion.
[00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:08.760]   So what was going on?
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.760]   There was something in my 13-year-old frustrated soul
[00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.980]   that was all out of whack on that afternoon.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.400]   I was dead wrong to talk to her that way.
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.140]   I was factually wrong to talk to her that way,
[00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.060]   but something was going on in me.
[00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.500]   She was not responsible at that moment for my anger.
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.460]   I was, and so I just want to suggest, Matthew,
[00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.340]   that you be careful, be careful,
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.260]   that some of your frustration that may be building up
[00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.860]   might be coming from stuff in you,
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.500]   not just from stuff in your dad.
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.100]   That's my first suggestion.
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:51.100]   Honor your dad in those ways.
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.100]   Second, I would suggest that you use this season
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:01.540]   of life and growth, this season of frustration, in a sense,
[00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:07.380]   to make sure that you have a balanced and biblical view
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:12.420]   of how gospel joy and gospel rules,
[00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.540]   or dos and don'ts, relate to each other,
[00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:17.060]   how they fit together.
[00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.060]   Because right now, you feel like dad is all rule-focused
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:27.380]   and my friends are all joy-focused and Christ-focused,
[00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:31.340]   which raises the question, and this is just a question,
[00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.000]   do you have a biblical understanding
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.900]   of how the two fit together?
[00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.180]   Be careful that you don't just go
[00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.280]   with what makes you feel good.
[00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:45.260]   Like, it may be that biblical rules and biblical joy
[00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.860]   fit together in a way that's different than your experience
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.740]   and that you need to adjust your experience some
[00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.260]   in order to live in accord with the way the Bible talks
[00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.540]   about the relationship between biblical rules
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.580]   and biblical joy.
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.260]   Don't make the mistake that Martin Luther made.
[00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.900]   Have you heard of Martin Luther, the reformer?
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.160]   Martin Luther read the book of James,
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.980]   filled with rules and imperatives and commands.
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:19.380]   He read the book of James and he felt the same way
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.540]   about the book of James that you feel about your dad.
[00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.180]   He felt rules, rules, rules.
[00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.660]   Where's the joy of the gospel in this book?
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.540]   And he's talking about the book of the Bible.
[00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:31.740]   He was wrong.
[00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.240]   He called it an epistle of straw
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.600]   because he didn't have it sorted out properly yet.
[00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:41.440]   Well, you might possibly make the same mistake
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.320]   Martin Luther made in regard to your dad,
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.180]   like he made in regard to the book of James.
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:47.860]   Just be careful.
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.080]   I don't want to defend your dad here
[00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.200]   because I don't know whether he is lopsided
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.300]   in his understanding.
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.820]   I just want to make sure that you take this season
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.800]   as an opportunity to grow in your own balanced understanding
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.100]   of how gospel joy and gospel rules relate to each other.
[00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.940]   Here's the last thing.
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.300]   Here's the last thing I would say, Matthew.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:08.300]   At this stage in life,
[00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:11.640]   imagine something that may be almost impossible.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:15.040]   Namely, you may be at a position of growth and maturity
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.400]   where you can actually minister to your dad
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:21.820]   and not just focus on his failures to minister to you.
[00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.180]   A lot of kids never get to this place.
[00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:26.180]   I mean, think about this, Matthew.
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:30.220]   You're 15 and you're discerning some things very well.
[00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:33.920]   Here's one thing I want you to ask the Lord to do.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.760]   Pray like this, "God, give me the grace, even at 15,
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:41.360]   without being presumptuous, without being proud,
[00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:44.840]   without being disrespectful, to be a lover,
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.500]   a blesser, a minister to my dad.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.680]   My dad seems to be hung up on some stuff.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.960]   I wish he had more joy."
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.680]   Well, instead of going to bed at night,
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.640]   angry at your dad, frustrated with your dad,
[00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:00.160]   disappointed in your dad,
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.280]   how about going to bed at night, praying for your dad,
[00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:06.260]   longing that some things that the Lord is teaching you
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.320]   could become a blessing to your dad?
[00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:11.680]   Matthew, believe it or not,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.680]   there are kids that in their 30s, 40s, 50s,
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:20.300]   never have learned to do this.
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:21.640]   They never have.
[00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:23.920]   They're still angry at dad.
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.180]   They're still angry at mom.
[00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:30.300]   They still, all they think about is what they didn't get,
[00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.300]   rather than how they might minister now to a broken dad,
[00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:38.380]   a broken mom, who never got it quite right.
[00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:43.380]   So what a gift of maturity that would be for you at age 15.
[00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.800]   So those are my three suggestions.
[00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:50.460]   Matthew, honor your dad with empathy and understanding.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.340]   Number two, grow in your grasp of how Bible joy
[00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.380]   and Bible rules fit together.
[00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:00.180]   Care as much about how to minister
[00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:04.340]   to your dad's discouragement or your dad's encouragement
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:09.100]   as you care about his ministering to you.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.980]   - Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:12.100]   And thank you, Matthew, for your excellent question.
