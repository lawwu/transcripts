[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.420]   So, for about a year, linguistic scholars of the Master's University and the Master's
[00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.600]   Seminary have been working on a translation called the Legacy Standard Bible.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.960]   It's come to completion now.
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.400]   The first printed form of it is the New Testament Sums and Proverbs.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:28.920]   It's the best English translation I have ever read.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.680]   It's the most diligently prepared translation, and one of the wonderful features of it is
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:47.600]   it calls God by the name He asked to be remembered by.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:58.240]   I want you just to listen, standing, to Psalm 37 from the living Word of God, the living
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:05.600]   Word of the eternal God, whose name is Yahweh.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.740]   This is the Legacy Standard Bible translation, first time read publicly anyplace.
[00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.000]   Do not fret because of evildoers.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.580]   Be not envious toward doers of unrighteousness, for they will wither quickly like the grass
[00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.760]   and fade like the green herb.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.720]   Trust in Yahweh and do good.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.700]   Dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.180]   Delight yourself in Yahweh, and He will give you the desires of your heart.
[00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.980]   Commit your way to Yahweh.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.740]   Trust in Him and He will do it.
[00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.920]   He will bring forth your righteousness as the light and your judgment as the noonday.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.940]   Be still in Yahweh and wait patiently for Him.
[00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.800]   Do not fret because of Him who prospers in His way, because of the man who carries out
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.480]   schemes of wickedness.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.920]   Cease from anger and forsake wrath.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.920]   Do not fret.
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.000]   It leads only to evildoing, for evildoers will be cut off.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.780]   But those who hope for Yahweh, they will inherit the land, yet a little while, and the wicked
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.720]   man will be no more.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.940]   He will look carefully at his place, and he will not be there.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.320]   But the lowly will inherit the land and will delight themselves in abundant peace.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.760]   The wicked schemes against the righteous and gnashes at him with his teeth.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.220]   The Lord laughs at him, for He sees that His day is coming.
[00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.200]   The wicked have drawn the sword and bent their bow to cast down the afflicted and the needy,
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.880]   to slay those who are upright in conduct.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:03:00.400]   Their sword will enter their own heart, and their bows will be broken.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.000]   Better is a little of the righteous than the abundance of many wicked.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.960]   For the arms of the wicked will be broken, but Yahweh sustains the righteous.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   Yahweh knows the days of the blameless, and their inheritance will be forever.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.580]   They will not be ashamed in the time of evil, and in the days of famine, they will be satisfied.
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.880]   But the wicked will perish, and the enemies of Yahweh will be like the glory of the pastures.
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.600]   They vanish in smoke.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.880]   They vanish away.
[00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.040]   The wicked borrows and does not pay back, but the righteous is gracious and gives.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.960]   For those blessed by Him will inherit the land, but those cursed by Him will be cut
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.560]   off.
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:56.520]   The footsteps of a man are established by Yahweh, and He delights in His way.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.800]   When He falls, He will not be hurled headlong, because Yahweh is the one who sustains His
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.040]   hand.
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.520]   I was young, and now I am old; yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or His seed
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.640]   begging bread.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:14.080]   All day long He is gracious and lends, and His seed is a blessing.
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:18.120]   Depart from evil and do good, so you will dwell forever.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:25.640]   For Yahweh loves justice and will not forsake His holy ones; they are kept forever.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.680]   But the seed of the wicked will be cut off.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.160]   The righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.880]   The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, and His tongue speaks justice.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.720]   The law of His God is in His heart.
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.240]   His steps do not slip.
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:48.000]   The wicked spies upon the righteous and seeks to put Him to death.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.760]   Yahweh will not forsake Him in His hand; He will not condemn Him when He is judged.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:02.800]   Hope for Yahweh and keep His way, and He will exalt you to inherit the land.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.200]   But the wicked are cut off; you will see it.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.160]   I have seen a wicked, ruthless man, spreading himself like a luxuriant tree in its native
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   soil.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:16.480]   Then he passed away, and behold, he was no more.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.920]   I sought for him, but he could not be found.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.480]   Observe the blameless man, and behold the upright.
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:33.840]   For the man of peace will have a posterity, but transgressors will be altogether destroyed.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:37.960]   The posterity of the wicked will be cut off.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.600]   But the salvation of the righteous is from Yahweh.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.840]   He is their strength in time of distress.
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.040]   Yahweh helps them and protects them.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:58.480]   He protects them from the wicked and saves them because they take refuge in Him.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.800]   Is that not a magnificent portion of Scripture?
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:11.040]   And did you feel the almost jarring reality of calling God by His name?
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.400]   He wants you to do that.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.320]   It's that intimate.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:20.540]   He wants you to call Him by His name.
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:31.080]   Jesus said, John 8:58, "Before Abraham was, I am."
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.440]   He was declaring His deity as the I Am.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.120]   What does it mean that God's name is Yahweh, I Am that I Am?
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:44.960]   It expresses His eternality, the fact that He is uncreated, that He's the source of
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.680]   all life, that He is timeless, that He is unchangeable, that He is self-existent and
[00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:53.920]   self-sufficient.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.960]   When you say "Lord," you're talking about His sovereignty.
[00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:03.760]   In all English Bibles, Yahweh is translated "Lord" in uppercase letters, but that just
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.020]   repeats "Adonai."
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.800]   It doesn't give you the name of God, which is the covenant name that expresses His eternal
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.000]   being.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   He wants you to know His name, and you say it all the time.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:27.440]   Every time you say, "Hallelujah," you say, "Praise Yahweh."
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:38.120]   This translation, for that and a number of reasons, is a priceless treasure, amazing
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:40.040]   effort.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:43.960]   And this is the first form of it, New Testament with Psalms and Proverbs, the full Bible
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.320]   will be out later this year, but we're going to give these to every man at Shepherds Conference.
[00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:55.680]   And I know you want to get your hands on mine, but this is the only one I've got.
[00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   (audience laughing)
