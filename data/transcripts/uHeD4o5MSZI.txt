[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280]   Well, how do we shepherd small children through the pains of life?
[00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.000]   The question comes to us from a mom in Baltimore named Taylor.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.120]   She writes, "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.860]   My husband and I have been deeply encouraged and greatly challenged by this podcast and
[00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.020]   through all the Desiring God resources.
[00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.020]   Thank you.
[00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.280]   I just started your new book, Providence, and it is stirring my heart with great affection
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.120]   toward our God.
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.160]   Thank you for helping to align my emotions through your writings with the reality that
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.680]   is ours.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.260]   This past fall, my husband was in a serious car accident.
[00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.460]   He walked away from it with just a concussion, but our car was totaled.
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.800]   When we shared this with our three-year-old in an age-appropriate way, he was greatly
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760]   affected by this, even angered.
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.100]   We tried to explain how God had allowed this and protected Daddy through his providence,
[00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:57.720]   but he had two responses asking when God will "make Daddy dead" and showing anger towards
[00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.920]   God and wanting to "beat him up."
[00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.960]   How would you explain suffering in light of God's providence to a toddler and help him
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.000]   to love God more for it?
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.920]   There are two principles that need to be taken into account when choosing what to say to
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.760]   a particular audience or child, what to say about God.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.840]   One principle is whether they are open and mature enough to understand the truth, and
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.720]   the other principle is whether we have spoken the truth clearly and boldly enough so that
[00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.560]   a real judgment can be formed about it.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.800]   Two passages of Scripture relate to that first principle.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.120]   Jesus said, "Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.600]   lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you."
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:07.080]   I'm not saying you should think of your three-year-old as a dog or a pig, although his responses
[00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.440]   were the kind of responses Jesus had in mind when he gave that principle, "I'm gonna beat
[00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.440]   God up."
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.560]   Rather, the point is, there are audiences or children that are so spring-loaded to reject
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.520]   the truth that Jesus warns us not to bring reproach on the truth by having it trampled
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.760]   under their feet.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.800]   Your three-year-old may show himself to have such an attitude towards God's providence
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.880]   that you should measure your teaching by what he can hear.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.560]   You don't substitute falsehood for truth.
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.680]   You simply decide how much and when you can share.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.560]   The other passage is 1 Corinthians 3, 1-3, "I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   people but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:08.640]   I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it, and even now you are
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.800]   not ready, for you are still of the flesh.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.480]   For while there's jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.680]   only in a human way?"
[00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.800]   Here the problem is not with swinishness, but immaturity.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:30.600]   I could not address you as spiritual people but as infants.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.700]   So that's the first principle.
[00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:41.360]   Use the audience or the person, the child, open enough, mature enough to receive the
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   particular truth you're talking about.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.280]   Here's the second principle, namely, whether we have spoken the doctrine clearly and boldly
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:59.160]   enough so that the people have a real sense of its truth and worth and beauty.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:07.740]   Paul says, 2 Corinthians 4, verse 2, "We have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways.
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.580]   We refuse to practice cunning or tamper with God's Word, but by an open statement of the
[00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:20.180]   truth, we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God."
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.300]   An open statement of the truth.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.620]   That's what's needed for a clear grasp of the doctrine and a sense that it is good and
[00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:33.300]   wise and just and beautiful.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.700]   So you can see how this is almost the exact opposite of the first principle.
[00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.380]   In that case, we might say too much, and in the second case, we might say too little or
[00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.980]   hedge the truth a bit.
[00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:57.260]   Now what I have in mind in this second case, the second principle, is perhaps being so
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:06.740]   cautious or so hesitating or so qualifying in our talk about God's sovereignty that a
[00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:17.420]   child may pick up in the way things are explained or the tone of voice that mom and dad are
[00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:23.540]   not exactly excited or joyful about God's providence.
[00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:31.140]   The child may hear in the explanation a kind of permission not to like this doctrine.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:34.440]   A lot of people talk that way about God.
[00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.660]   They are so ready to excuse anger at God that they talk about his sovereignty as though
[00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.340]   it actually invites anger.
[00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.300]   I think anger at God is always wrong.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.140]   Always.
[00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:55.340]   If you feel it, of course you should say it.
[00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.520]   But to feel anger at God is sinful.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.940]   So I don't think our tone of voice or the way we talk about God's providence should
[00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.380]   sound like it invites disapproval.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.600]   I don't know which of these two principles—say less, say more—should govern these parents
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.200]   right at this moment with this child.
[00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:24.420]   But I'm very surprised that a three-year-old feels free to talk about beating God up.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:32.460]   It surely sounds like God has been presented to him in a way that God is too small, too
[00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.460]   human-like.
[00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:40.100]   But I'm not there, and I can't say with any certainty.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.460]   So what about the last part of the question?
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.580]   How would you explain God's providence to a toddler and help him to love God more for
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.460]   his providence?
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:52.460]   Four suggestions.
[00:06:52.460 --> 00:07:02.600]   First, tell him stories that illustrate how bad things often are God's wise and merciful
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.100]   way of doing good to us.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:12.420]   For example, I know several stories where a serious injury happened to a person, and
[00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:20.860]   it was the way the doctors found the cancer in the lacerated leg, which enabled the doctors
[00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:24.460]   to start therapy, which saved the person's life.
[00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.700]   And then you can teach the child that's always true.
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:32.380]   It's always true when bad things happen to God's children.
[00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:39.460]   He always does good through them, even if we can't see it.
[00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:44.380]   Another example is when you go to the doctor, he pokes at you, or go to the dentist, he
[00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:49.380]   drills on you, or a doctor cuts you to have surgery to save your life.
[00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:51.380]   He hurts you to save you.
[00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:55.500]   The doctor's always doing that for our good.
[00:07:55.500 --> 00:08:02.540]   So you tell those stories to children to build in the truth that they can grasp bad things,
[00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:07.660]   hurtful things, painful things are not unloving things from God.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:10.020]   They can get that very early.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:17.140]   Second suggestion, weave into your teaching again and again the passages that say suffering
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.660]   is necessary for Christians and designed by God.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.780]   Teach a child that suffering is normal, not exceptional for Christians.
[00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:37.540]   Matthew 5.12, 24.9, John 15.20, Romans 5.3, James 1.2, 1.12, 1 Peter 1.6, 1 Peter 4.12,
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.020]   and on and on and on.
[00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.100]   Saturate your kids with this doctrine.
[00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:49.980]   Third, related to that second suggestion, teach your child that we are sinners and that
[00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:54.300]   we don't deserve anything good from God.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:09:00.420]   The surprising thing in the world of rebels like us is not pain.
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:03.380]   The surprising thing is pleasure.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:11.740]   God is super overabundant good to his creation, giving us better than we deserve every day
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:14.820]   all the time, better than we deserve.
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:22.060]   In fact, everybody gets better than they deserve once you understand the nature of sin.
[00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:28.020]   God is never unjust in the suffering of this world, never.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:31.580]   We don't deserve better than we get, ever.
[00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:35.300]   We always deserve worse than we get.
[00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:39.220]   Every good thing is grace, grace, grace.
[00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:44.700]   Teach a child grace as undeserved favor.
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:49.580]   Strip a child of all sense of entitlement before God.
[00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:56.680]   Finally, point the child over and over again to the cross of Christ, where the worst suffering
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:05.660]   happened in the world, and explain how the death of his son was planned by God.
[00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:10.440]   Acts 4.27, Isaiah 53, 4-10.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:19.820]   This is where the child will see how bad his own sin is, because when he asks, "Mommy,
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:26.100]   Daddy, why would God do that to his own son?"
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:35.820]   The answer is that Mommy's and Daddy's sin and your sin is that bad and takes that
[00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:40.640]   much suffering and love from God.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:49.000]   I think if those four suggestions are followed, children will be more able to submit to God's
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   providence and feel thankful for everything that God turns for good.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.960]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:59.640]   And thank you for the question, Taylor.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:02.920]   Parenting raises so many questions, so many challenging questions.
[00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:09.360]   And if you have one that we can help out with, send it to us at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:13.240]   On our homepage, you'll see a little link there to send us an email to send us your
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.240]   question.
[00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:19.320]   Well, can a perfect man, a perfect man who never sinned and who never struggled with
[00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:23.840]   ongoing sin habits, can he truly feel and know the power of temptation?
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:26.920]   That's a debate when it comes to Christ.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:31.760]   Can he really sympathize with us if he never tasted the pleasures of sin himself?
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:36.720]   It's a great question, and we will work toward an answer when we return on Wednesday.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   We'll see you then.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.220]   [END]
