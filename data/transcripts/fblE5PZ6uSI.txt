[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   But I thought I would start today's episode reacting to my own article.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:13.080]   So the day before we're recording this episode, I published my, my latest for the
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.600]   New Yorker was a bit of a longer piece and I've been reading, writing recently.
[00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.080]   It was more of a 5,000 word, more of an Epic piece.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:25.680]   And, uh, the title is the rise of the internet's creative middle class.
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.960]   And, uh, I thought I would go through just the big ideas from this article.
[00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.920]   And then I have a couple of follow-up points about some follow-up points, not
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.000]   in the article, but based on reactions I've gotten to the article since it's come out.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.200]   So if you're watching this, instead of listening to this, I also have the article
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.760]   loaded up here on the HQ tablet.
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.640]   So you can actually see the words I'm talking about.
[00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.600]   If you're just listening though, I'll, I'll read what I'm saying.
[00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.880]   So you'll be able to follow along.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.280]   All right.
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.600]   So I just want to give you the, the, the main bullet points is 5,000 words.
[00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.280]   There's, you know, a lot of details, but the, the article opened with me
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.760]   going to the studio of breaking points.
[00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.800]   So breaking points is a internet news show.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.880]   Uh, it's hosted by Sagar and Jetty and Crystal Ball.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.800]   So they both come from journalism backgrounds, Sagar from the right,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.120]   Crystal from the left.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.240]   So Sagar used to be the white house correspondent for the daily caller.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.040]   Crystal was a host of a show on MSNBC.
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.760]   Uh, years ago, they came together to do a show together called rising.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.040]   That was filmed at the Hill, the publication, the Hill here in DC.
[00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.720]   And the whole idea was someone from the left, someone from the
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:40.960]   right talking about the news.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.920]   Uh, and then they went independent.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.600]   And so a couple of years ago, they went independent and said,
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.640]   we can do this ourselves.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.720]   And so I went to their studio.
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:49.680]   They leased some studio space downtown here in downtown DC.
[00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.640]   They have a cool set $60,000 camera system that films at a really high
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.560]   resolution so that you can stream this onto big screen TVs.
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.600]   And it looks really nice, real control room with actual, you know, upper
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.040]   middle-aged engineer control room type men in there working, try casters and.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.120]   And the sound and it was a real professional operation.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.960]   They do a new show.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.240]   Uh, it's on the internet.
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.160]   If you subscribe, you get it on YouTube.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.440]   There's a podcast version.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.000]   They put clips of it on YouTube, uh, for free.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.560]   So I went to visit this and visit them.
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.600]   If the names sound familiar, it's they've gotten a lot of
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.240]   exposure through Joe Rogan.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:29.920]   So he likes them because they come at news from the left and the right.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.760]   And so they end up in kind of independent territory as opposed to just trying to
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.240]   work backwards from what's our point.
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.160]   So they're on that show a lot.
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.560]   I think that's, that helped them grow, but they had a history from before them.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.560]   Um, and I've been on, I was on rising to talk about one of my
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.640]   books before they went independent.
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.880]   I've been on Saugers podcast.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.640]   So I've, I've crossed paths with them before.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.480]   All right.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.000]   So you look at that show, um, and you see that it's doing well.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.360]   It's doing well.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.600]   It does not require nearly the overhead of their old traditional TV shows.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.640]   They have only eight hourly contractors and yet their viewership metrics are
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.320]   already outpacing their former show.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.280]   So they have more views.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.840]   If you look on YouTube, if you look at podcast downloads, whatever
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.840]   metrics you want to look at.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.320]   They're doing better than the old traditionally produced TV show
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.640]   at a fraction of the cost.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.240]   So my point is early in this article is, uh, that's interesting.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.800]   And maybe there's a lesson to be learned there about the evolution of news.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.040]   But the reason why I was focusing on breaking points, the reason why I wanted
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.360]   to introduce them to the readers of this article is that I think they
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:33.280]   show a more important trend.
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.840]   And here's my exact words from the article, one in which a dismissed
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.600]   prophecy about the potential of the internet to support creative work
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.320]   might be making a triumphant return.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.280]   So they are my piece of evidence that a once dismissed prophecy about the
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.240]   internet might be finally coming true.
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.640]   All right.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.680]   So what is that prophecy?
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:56.240]   Well, we got to go all the way back to 2008.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.560]   Remember 2008 was a very different time than the web is today.
[00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.720]   This was at the beginning of the web 2.0 revolution.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.160]   So this was the beginning of that idea that you as a consumer could
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.120]   contribute content to the web.
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.360]   As opposed to just going to websites and consuming content.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.120]   We're used to that now, but it was a big deal back then.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.720]   So it was in 2008 when web 2.0 was first becoming a thing that Kevin Kelly,
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.200]   the former executive editor of Wired, actually the founding executive editor
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.280]   of Wired, uh, and general techno optimist.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   So someone who, uh, provided a nice blurb for so good.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.880]   They can't ignore you.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.640]   He had a nice blurb for a world without email.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.000]   So I've crossed paths with Kevin Kelly over the years.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.440]   He wrote a very internet important, I would say essay called a thousand true fans.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.400]   This is going to be the prophecy that this article is about.
[00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.800]   So the basic idea with a thousand true fans is Kevin Kelly was saying now
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.040]   that the internet is here, now that the internet is interactive, now that
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:00.520]   you can produce and post content as easily as you can consume it.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:09.480]   This is going to be a boon for creative professionals because now as a creative
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.720]   professional, you can not only post your stuff online, you can interact with people.
[00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.800]   Online you have, uh, at your fingertips, this whole vast audience of the entire
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.080]   world's population and all you have to do, and this was his thousand true fans
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:29.920]   concept, all you had to do is find a, and cultivate a small, but loyal fan base.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.360]   Of all the millions and millions of internet users.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:36.480]   If you can find, this was his math, a thousand loyal supporters,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:41.440]   each of whom is willing to spend a hundred dollars a year on you and your art.
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.800]   You're now making a good middle-class living doing creative work.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:48.920]   Those was a really big deal essay.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:52.720]   It was really influential because the idea was pre-internet.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:58.320]   If you were a creative type, you only had access to the people who were
[00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:02.080]   proximate to you, the people who live near you, the people who lived in your
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.080]   town, unless you were one of the vanishing people, you were not going to
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.640]   be a vanishingly small few who had access to national international
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.880]   broadcast platforms like television or newspapers, but there was such a
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.360]   small number of people who could be in the movies or be on TV or be in the
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:20.560]   newspaper that almost everyone else who wanted to do creative work, you only
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.600]   had access to people who happened to be nearby.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.840]   And it was probably going to be difficult for you to find enough real
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.600]   spans who lived within 50 miles of you to actually make a living.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.920]   And Kelly's point is the internet changes that because now you can
[00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:36.240]   assemble these thousand true fans from anywhere around the world
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.200]   and make a living off of it.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.960]   So now you've unlocked the economic potential for lots of different
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.040]   creative types to actually make a living doing creative work.
[00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:50.720]   As I argued, this essay hit right as the economic crisis of 2008 was picking up
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:52.800]   steam, so it was really aspirational.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.080]   People's savings were going away.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.760]   Their retirement accounts were disappearing.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.960]   Their jobs were either they were losing them or they're having the screws
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:03.880]   turned to them working longer for less money because everyone was faltering.
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.680]   And this idea of, hey, with this new technology, forget this diminishing rat
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.080]   race, you can make a living, support your family doing creative work.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:13.040]   Very aspirational.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.920]   This essay became very popular.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.200]   Right.
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.920]   Here's the part that most people didn't know about.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:23.760]   If you go back and look at the reception of this essay, yes, it became very popular,
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.480]   but almost immediately there was pushback.
[00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:33.120]   And one of the strongest sources of pushback came from Jaron Lanier, whose
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.280]   work I talk about a lot on the show.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.120]   Jaron knew Kevin Kelly.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.840]   They've known each other since the eighties.
[00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.200]   When Kevin first met Jaron to interview him about his pioneering
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.960]   work on virtual reality, they were both techno optimists from the West coast scene.
[00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:53.560]   Jaron Lanier in particular was a really big open culture advocate.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.280]   Software should be free.
[00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:56.320]   Bit should be free.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.000]   The internet's going to create this sort of utopian world.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.560]   What had happened to Jaron though, we've talked about this before on the show, is
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.480]   he took a hard turn towards skepticism.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:13.800]   He eventually went back and renounced his techno optimist views and said, the
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.720]   internet is not going the way I hoped.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.080]   And the internet is beginning to bifurcate the haves and the have not.
[00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.120]   And all the, all the, the value generated is ossifying at a very small number of
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:28.960]   companies and a very small number of individuals that have a lot of stock in
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:29.360]   those companies.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   So he had, he had had this turn towards skepticism around this point.
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.080]   And he looked to Kevin Kelly's a thousand true fans essay and almost
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:41.080]   immediately came back and said, Kevin, this makes sense on paper, but if it was
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:44.000]   true, we should see more people doing this successfully.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.240]   So where are all of these artists and musicians that have a thousand true fans
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:51.800]   that they have cultivated online, making a middle-class living.
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:53.480]   The web has been around now for a while.
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:55.960]   Technologically, this has been possible for a while.
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:57.320]   Where are they?
[00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.720]   And this is, this is a little known chapter in this history, but, but Kevin
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.960]   actually posted a follow-up essay.
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.360]   It's pretty soon after.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:13.680]   And he explained Jaren's hesitancy and he said, okay, let's, let's prove Jaren wrong.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.040]   And I, in fact, I have the exact wording here in the article.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.400]   He said, okay, to prove Jaren wrong, this is Kevin Kelly, right.
[00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.640]   Into his audience, simply submit a candidate in the comments, a musician
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:28.480]   with no ties to old media models now make it a hundred percent of their
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.520]   living in the open media environment.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:32.200]   Right.
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.600]   So Jaren complained, Kevin said, no, no, I'm sure artists and creative
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.400]   types living on this model exist.
[00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.680]   And let's find them.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:44.200]   And he challenged his readers and they couldn't find anybody.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:49.440]   The way Jaren summarized it later in his book, you are not a gadget, which you
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.640]   should read if you have not very influential book for techno criticism
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:59.680]   circles, they identified a handful at most of artists who satisfy that theory.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:02.880]   And if you really go down the rabbit hole on this and look at the artists they
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:05.760]   found, it was kind of questionable whether they qualified or not.
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.360]   Like they basically couldn't find anyone.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:12.040]   And by the time Jaren published, you were not a gadget is a chapter about a thousand
[00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:14.800]   true fans in that manifesto where he's like, this just didn't work.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:22.040]   That's a true fans was hopeful, but it wasn't actually something that we saw.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:23.840]   Come to fruition.
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:29.480]   And so for people who studied the internet, it was sort of this sad case study of
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:33.240]   optimism that soon bled away.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.400]   So what actually happened here?
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.120]   Well, I think Jaren Lanier has a really good argument that it was the structure,
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.760]   the evolving structure of the web itself that scuttled the feasibility of a
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:53.040]   thousand true fans, and in particular, the hijacking of web 2.0 by a small number of
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:59.520]   large social media platform monopolies like Facebook and then later Instagram and
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.120]   Twitter.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:06.200]   And the way Jaren tells us, I think it's a really important critique is that Google
[00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:12.480]   ads came along earlier in the two thousands and they showed that embedded ads could
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.040]   make money.
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:18.440]   So in other words, putting ads on content that normal individuals made.
[00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:23.120]   So here's my website, here is calnewport.com and I'm doing Google adsense and it
[00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.000]   will automatically put ads onto the content I generated.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.320]   This made a lot of money for Google.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.800]   It became a basically a money minting machine.
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   And there was this aha light that went on in the techno circles out in Silicon
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.920]   Valley, which is web 2.0 means lots of people are creating a lot of content.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:44.840]   All of that content can be essentially the fertilizer for our advertising money
[00:11:44.840 --> 00:11:45.160]   trees.
[00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:52.200]   So social media came along and even though it originally pushed itself as being about
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.080]   connection and relationships and making it easier to express yourself and connect to
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:58.760]   others, that was not the pitch being made to investors.
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.880]   The pitch being made to investors is all of these millions of people are going to be
[00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:02.800]   generating content.
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:08.040]   If we can get that content generated on our servers, on our platforms, we get all the
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.280]   money from all the ads we can place on it.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:15.360]   And so a small number of companies basically hijacked the web 2.0 revolution.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.000]   It said, yeah, yeah, yeah, you should express yourself on the web, but you do it in
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:19.840]   our walled garden.
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.600]   We can control it.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.840]   And that became, as Jaren explains it, the downfall of the thousand true fans model,
[00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:30.920]   because once these companies were making hundreds of billions of dollars evaluation
[00:12:30.920 --> 00:12:37.520]   appear out of nowhere, just off of the back of this digital sharecropping that was
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:43.000]   occurring out there in this hijacked world of web 2.0, they began pushing their
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   technology platforms to optimize the money this made.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.440]   And this, this eventually led to these streaming style models.
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.200]   Twitter led the way, but then Facebook and Instagram followed.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:58.680]   These models where you were no longer even going to social media homepages of
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:12:59.400]   individuals.
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:02.440]   You were no longer posting on the wall of your friend on Facebook.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.280]   Algorithms would just pull interesting information off of the platform and put it
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.720]   into an infinite scroll stream.
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:11.840]   And you as a consumer would just keep scrolling through this.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:18.600]   Everything you were seeing was designed to hit your fancy, to give you distraction
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.040]   in the moment, to give you those little chemical bursts.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:28.120]   In that setting, the thousand true fans was not going to survive.
[00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.480]   And here's the words I wrote.
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:34.960]   This relentless pace rewards passive consumption, not active interaction with
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.120]   individual creators.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:39.360]   So here's why.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.160]   As a creator, you can submit your creations into the stream, but once there, they
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.600]   will be chopped up and commoditized.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.160]   If you're lucky, perhaps something will, you post will temporarily spark a surge of
[00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:52.760]   engagement, but the same spectators exhausted by the onslaught will soon shift
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.320]   their weary attentions to the next recommended item following close behind.
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.880]   So this is what happened when web 2.0 got hijacked.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:04.200]   All of this user created content got chopped up and commoditized and put into an
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:07.800]   algorithmically optimized stream where it was dehumanized, barely connected to the
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:09.080]   individuals who created it.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.720]   And we sit there and watch this just stream past.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:21.200]   That was not an environment well suited for many different individual idiosyncratic
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.880]   creators to foster and create communities, small, but loyal communities based around
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:30.000]   their work that they could then monetize and make a living off of it.
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.880]   So that was why, at least in Jaron Lennar's telling, that is why the dream of a
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.280]   thousand true fans fell apart.
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.720]   But then we go back to breaking points.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:48.680]   And what I wrote here is perhaps we were too quick to dismiss Kelly's a thousand
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.400]   true fans theory.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:56.000]   It faltered in 2008, 2008, but 14 years later, it might be making a comeback.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:01.080]   Because you look at something like breaking points and what you see is actually
[00:15:01.080 --> 00:15:04.640]   something very much like Kelly's original model in action.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:12.680]   Sager and Crystal are not 20 million follower Instagram influencers.
[00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:14.840]   They're not one of these YouTube Mr.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:21.440]   B style superstars that gets 26 million views on every video they put up.
[00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.880]   They have roughly 10,000 subscribers.
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:28.120]   So yes, it's a factor of 10 larger than Kelly's original prediction, but within
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.040]   that same ballpark, 10,000 subscribers.
[00:15:30.040 --> 00:15:36.640]   So a small number by any of those large follower count type scales, 10,000
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:39.920]   subscribers who pay them money because they respect what they're doing.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:44.400]   They like the style of independent news that Crystal and Sager produce.
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:48.800]   Off of those 10,000 subscribers, they are able to produce the show.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:51.480]   And they pay themselves.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.280]   I, you know, I talked to him about it, salaries that are more or less in line
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:59.000]   with what they were making when they were hosting the show at the Hill.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:15:59.880]   Right.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.680]   So they're not trying to, uh, become immensely wealthy.
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:05.600]   Uh, they can cover their budget.
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:07.160]   They can cover the studio they lease.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.120]   And those are hourly contractors that help work their equipment, the eight
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.760]   hourly contractors that helps pay for their time and it, and it works out.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:15.160]   And when I pushed them, I was like, well, you guys want to go the route
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:17.240]   of the ringer or of Gimlet.
[00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.880]   You want to take on venture capital money and build up a huge staff and grow a
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.560]   large network that you can then sell for $200 million down the line.
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:26.800]   They had zero interest in that.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.720]   Crystal was really clear.
[00:16:29.720 --> 00:16:35.080]   She wanted to get away from bureaucracy and giant offices
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.040]   and having to deal with staff.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.240]   They just wanted to produce their show.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.000]   They want to do news.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.080]   They want to be able to do it full time.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.760]   It's Kevin Kelly's thousand true fans come to fruition.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:49.680]   When I go on the article and give a lot of examples, like we can actually find a
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:57.000]   lot of examples of this now of people who have modest size audiences of strong fans.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:03.560]   Who pay them money for the content or whatever they produce, allowing
[00:17:03.560 --> 00:17:08.200]   them to make a good living, not to become rich, but can make a good living.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   Again, that's the Kevin Kelly dream.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.840]   I gave two reasons for this.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:17.280]   Number one, I think the rise of online news paywalls and subscription video
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:21.640]   streaming services like Netflix got us used to the idea of paying
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.680]   all a cart for digital content.
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:28.960]   When Kevin Kelly wrote his original essay, that was a time where people
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.080]   thought no one's ever going to pay money for digital content online.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:36.640]   Everything has to be free.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:37.920]   Everything has to be ad supported.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:38.960]   Now we're used to it.
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.440]   We pay newyorker.com.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.960]   We pay Netflix.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:43.920]   We pay Hulu.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:47.880]   We're kind of used to paying all a cart for digital content.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:51.640]   So once we're used to that, when someone like Sager and Crystal comes along,
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.600]   we're like, yeah, it's just another thing I pay a little bit of
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.720]   money for to get digital content.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:01.120]   The other thing to change was attitudes towards social media.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:05.880]   So there was a time, and I know this because I used to get roasted, where
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.680]   social media was where all the energy is.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:13.360]   So the idea that you would leave social media and interact with creators
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:17.840]   directly over the internet without using the intermediation of social media
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:19.800]   would have been considered risky or weird.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.160]   Now, for all the reasons we talk about on the show, there's a lot of pushback
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:26.760]   and skepticism and distrust about social media.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.920]   So this idea that I'm going to subscribe to breaking points using a small app
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:37.680]   like Supercast and they have MailChimp is going to email me direct link URLs.
[00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:41.360]   They're unlisted videos, a whole ecosystem I'm using to interact with them.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:42.840]   It has nothing to do with social media.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:46.120]   Now we're used to that or we're excited to do that.
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:49.000]   So we needed those two innovations, getting used to paying for digital content
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.520]   and to being comfortable leaving the walled gardens, the heavily controlled
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.160]   walled gardens of social media and interacting with creators
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:57.280]   through other internet tools.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.760]   Those two things have come together.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:04.040]   And I think we see this revolution of the return of people potentially being
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.680]   able to make a living online.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.280]   One of the other big examples I give is podcasting.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:10.120]   Right.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:15.160]   I mean, what is a successful podcast, if not a perfect demonstration of
[00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:20.560]   Kevin Kelly's theory in action, you have this audience of dedicated fans who
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:26.560]   are willing to stream hours of your audio content each week from an
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:33.760]   advertiser perspective that is really valuable and you can monetize that.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:38.480]   And with a modest, but really strong audience, you can make a creative
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:42.800]   living with a podcast. I worked out the numbers for this article.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:46.560]   I mean, depending on the type of content, et cetera, et cetera, something
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:50.360]   like 30,000 downloads a week.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:56.080]   So if you had 30,000 dedicated fans who had listened to one episode of your
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.400]   show per week and with the right number of ads, if you do the math somewhere
[00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.640]   in there, you get to Kevin Kelly's a hundred thousand dollars a year.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.720]   So again, this is all within the ballpark of his original number.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.360]   But we're, this is the optimism here.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:16.200]   We are returning to a place where it's possible for a larger, more diverse
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:20.240]   group of creative types, doing a more diverse array of creative activities.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:25.960]   Like Sager and Crystal, like a bunch of podcasters out there to actually really
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:28.640]   make a full-time living, doing creative work by leveraging the potential of the
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:31.840]   internet, it required that we escaped the social media walled gardens.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.120]   It required that we got more comfortable spending money for digital content.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.600]   But I think this is a good thing that's happening.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.000]   All right.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.160]   So that's what my article is about.
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:42.840]   Two quick follow-up points after that article came out.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:47.360]   One, I talked to Kevin Kelly a little bit after it came out and he confirmed
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:52.880]   actually more recently, he gets more and more notes from people who read that
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:58.200]   original essay and are successfully making a living with a small, but dedicated group
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:58.600]   of fans.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.320]   So he can confirm directly.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:03.760]   He hears from people succeeding with that more and more.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:08.600]   The other point, and I'll make this briefly, someone sent me a note and I hear
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.440]   this critique a lot, so let me just address it real briefly.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:18.000]   They say, yeah, maybe it's true that there's more avenues now to make a living
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.520]   creatively online, but it's really hard and it often requires whatever timing and
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:31.360]   luck and Crystal and Sager already had media backgrounds and, and it's not just
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.160]   like anyone can just go and do this.
[00:21:34.160 --> 00:21:39.920]   And my reaction to that is yes, of course, making a living doing creative
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.200]   work is really hard.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:46.200]   It requires talent and it requires luck and it requires opportunity.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.400]   Now, I think what we're seeing with the thousand true fans model is that
[00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:53.920]   opportunity piece has vastly broadened.
[00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:58.000]   You don't have to be one of the vanishingly small few to get on cable news or
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.880]   have a newspaper column.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.000]   Now there's a lot more opportunities with the internet to make a living creatively,
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.920]   but you still need the talent timing, luck portion of that.
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:09.040]   And most people just don't have that.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.760]   But I think that's always the case.
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:14.880]   We're talking about the democrat democratizing any type of media.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.080]   This is always the critique that comes back.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.520]   Blogs come along and they say, Hey, this is going to, this is going to
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.680]   really revolutionize print.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.120]   Now there's now anyone can publish print.
[00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.360]   You don't have to be in a newspaper.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.240]   And the people said, oh, that, that revolution failed because most blogs are
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:29.440]   bad.
[00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:32.160]   Of course, most blogs are bad, but it did.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:36.480]   Open up a lot more people who had a lot of talent and a lot of luck to actually
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.120]   find an audience that would have been able to before.
[00:22:38.120 --> 00:22:38.960]   Same thing with podcasts.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.400]   People say most podcasts are bad and don't make money.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.600]   That's true, but it opened up a lot more opportunity for a lot more people with
[00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:50.640]   talent and luck to actually go and do that before podcasts were available.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.000]   So I think that's the key caveat I want to make is that there's no technological
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:55.360]   revolution.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:58.040]   That's going to mean anyone who wants to make a living doing creative work can,
[00:22:58.040 --> 00:23:00.960]   that's always going to be really hard, but it used to be that you had an
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:03.600]   incredibly narrow group of people who even had a shot.
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:05.920]   Now, a lot more people have a shot to take.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.840]   And of course, most people will still miss it, but we're going to have vastly
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:12.680]   more successful creatives because there's vastly more people out there with talent
[00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.360]   and the right timing and the right thing to say, or the right skill for the
[00:23:16.360 --> 00:23:16.600]   moment.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.320]   There's vastly more people out there than there used to be opportunities to, to
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:20.920]   support them.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.240]   And so I think that's all a good thing.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.240]   So there you go.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:33.040]   A little injection of optimism into a otherwise normally grim topic area.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:36.160]   There are some good things happening with the internet.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:38.160]   Did it take you a long time to write that?
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:43.160]   Uh, yeah, that took a little while, like 5,000 words.
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:44.480]   Those are, those are longer pieces.
[00:23:44.480 --> 00:23:49.040]   Um, but honestly this one was in production longer than it probably took me to
[00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:49.400]   write it.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:54.800]   I mean, so what I did was there's kind of a break in my, my writing, my last call
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.560]   was in January.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.280]   Uh, and then I, I had to kind of take a break because of administrative stuff at
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:00.840]   Georgetown.
[00:24:00.840 --> 00:24:05.040]   When I turned my energy back to this article, I, it took me a month.
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:10.040]   I went back and looked at it a month of solid work to get it done.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.000]   I did that back in March and then there's just production just, you know, it takes a
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:14.360]   long time.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.840]   So, so yeah, that took about a month of work.
[00:24:16.840 --> 00:24:21.920]   Whereas my column from last fall, it'd take about a week of work per column.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.800]   You talk to Kevin Kelly a lot?
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.880]   No, just off and on.
[00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:27.600]   We just kind of.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.000]   How old is he?
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.160]   He's like in his sixties, right?
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:31.800]   Or is he older?
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.200]   Older.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.560]   Probably, probably now in his seventies.
[00:24:35.560 --> 00:24:37.960]   He's on Ferris's podcast every now and then, right?
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:39.080]   He's a cool guy.
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:39.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:39.760]   Yeah.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.560]   He sent me some stuff.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.520]   I'm not going to talk about it now because I'm going to write about it.
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:45.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.640]   But he sent me some new thoughts he had on some things.
[00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:49.760]   Really creative guy.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:55.360]   There's a classic Kevin Kelly article from five or six years ago on artificial
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:56.320]   intelligence and wired.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:57.320]   Everyone should go back and read it.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:57.800]   It's really good.
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:59.760]   Really prophetic.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:07.600]   and read it, it's really good, really prophetic.
