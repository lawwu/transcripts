[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.920]   Mele Kalikimaka everybody, it's Sam from Financial Samurai. I'm recording from Honolulu, Hawaii,
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:12.320]   where it's actually kind of rainy and very, very windy. But I'm here at home with my parents,
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.240]   whom I haven't seen in two years. And I gotta say, it feels so good to see them because
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.700]   they're in their mid 70s. And you know, you just never know how much time you have left
[00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:26.200]   seeing your parents if they're around, or your friends or family. So let's not take
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.600]   our time for granted. This pandemic has obviously been a real damper for most of our lives,
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.080]   including my own. And with the latest Omicron virus spreading throughout the world, this
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.160]   thing is just going to continue. But as we look at 2022, I think we're all just gonna
[00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.920]   have to accept that the virus will be part of our lives, it's going to be endemic. And
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.720]   we're just going to have to move on and live our lives knowing that there's never going
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.700]   to be zero risk, just like with investing, except for if you invest in a CD or money
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.900]   market account up to 250,000 per person, there's always going to be risk, but it's hard to
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.560]   put our lives on hold forever. In this episode, I want to talk about having a day job and
[00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.680]   being an entrepreneur, because I've done both for a while now 13 years each actually on
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.680]   the dot. And I see the positives of both sides. I highly encourage all of you who have day
[00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.720]   jobs, stable income, health care benefits, retirement savings benefits, to look on the
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.360]   side a side hustle to try to make more money to try to do things that you like that could
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:37.080]   make more money. This is something that I did starting in 2009. And about 2.7 years
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.440]   later, I was able to break free from my corporate job forever. But of course, entrepreneurship
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:50.520]   is not that easy. It's a journey of discovery. The hardest things to just start. It is after
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.360]   you start when you start learning and evolving and pivoting and developing your message,
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.480]   your product, your brand, and so forth. It really is under the comfort of a stable job,
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.600]   where you can really experiment, take risks, and explore new subject areas when you don't
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.720]   need the money. And so as you develop those ideas and that business, over time, you're
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.560]   going to get more and more confidence where you might think one day, hmm, maybe it's time
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.200]   to take that leap of faith and do something new. And I think you can think that way, once
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.640]   you've been able to replicate about a quarter of your annual gross income, and after about
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.960]   a half a replication of half your annual gross income, I think it's clear that the momentum
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.560]   is there. And you can really take some risks if you want to. The greatest thing about the
[00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.800]   internet technology and being able to work from home is that we can leverage these things
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.760]   to make more money on the side. And the more money you make, the more you can save and
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.680]   the more you can invest. Each new income source you develop is like adding another engine
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:02.680]   on your jet. And it becomes kind of addicting actually, where you're earning extra income,
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.560]   and you're saving extra money and investing more and you're seeing your wealth compound.
[00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.680]   It's part of the reason why on the one hand, you see some employees only work, let's say
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.160]   two to four hours a day because they can get away with being more productive at home. And
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.880]   on the other hand, you're seeing other people who really want to make more and achieve financial
[00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.040]   freedom quicker, take on two jobs. I don't know if you guys saw that expose on the Wall
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.120]   Street Journal. But that person is also a financial samurai reader. And I asked him
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.440]   to share a guest post about how he's able to get two jobs, make double the money, have
[00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.200]   extra benefits, and get away with it. Now, obviously, there's moral dilemmas involved.
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:49.320]   But the reality is, employers are being much more flexible with what employees can do today,
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.280]   than back when I was working. From 1999 to 2012, when I was working in finance, we had
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.860]   to submit this thing called the outside interest system, where if we were making money outside
[00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.040]   of the firm, we had to disclose it. And most of the time, the firm would say no. But nowadays,
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:13.240]   I just talked to a person who works at Google, he's got a podcast, he is doing consulting,
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.880]   he's writing a book, he's making a lot of outside income, six figures worth of outside
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.480]   income while he's also working at Google, making six figures. And that is pretty attractive.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.400]   It's a really good power boost to help you on your way to financial freedom. Now, obviously,
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.260]   you can only keep this up for too long, because eventually you might burn out or you might
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.940]   get sick of one thing, as you see something else grow tremendously. I'm not sure most
[00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.100]   people have a spending problem. You know, the media talks a lot about how we don't save
[00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.460]   enough and we buy stupid things that we don't need on credit card debt with an 18% interest
[00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.740]   rate. I'm sure a lot of people do this. However, I think what's more important to focus on
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.160]   is generating more income. You have a spending problem, which I think can be more easily
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:07.260]   fixed or an income problem, which is a bigger challenge, right? Because it takes a lot more
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:13.760]   work to generate more income, more creativity, more risk, more action. So before you take
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.860]   a leap of faith, I want to highlight how much you need to make as a freelancer or as an
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.280]   entrepreneur to replicate your day job income. So let's say your day job income is $100,000.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.900]   I believe you need to make at least 130% to 160% of your day job income to replicate that
[00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.940]   income. In other words, if you're an entrepreneur or freelancer, you've got to make $130,000
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:45.120]   to $160,000 to replicate the day job income of $100,000. And why is that? Well, as an
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.460]   employee with $100,000 income, here are some things you might get. Retirement benefits,
[00:05:51.460 --> 00:06:00.660]   subsidized healthcare, paid time off, subsidized life insurance, short term and long term disability,
[00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:06.460]   employee ongoing training, you know, benefits such as going back to school part time. And
[00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:10.920]   also, you'll probably get automatic minimum raises every single year, especially with
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:15.400]   inflation so high right now. In addition, here are some things you don't have to pay
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:23.800]   as an employee. Social Security, you pay 7.65%. That's your employee portion, whereas the
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:33.320]   employer also pays 7.65%. So if you take 7.65% times $100,000, that's $7,650. You don't have
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:39.360]   to play as an employee. Then there's state franchise tax. This is in California, you
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:46.000]   pay $800 a year for the privilege of having your own business. Then you might have to
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.760]   hire a business accountant, a bookkeeper, then you might have to have capital expenditure
[00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:57.600]   to grow your business, travel expenses, meals, office expenses, and marketing expenses. All
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:03.800]   this stuff adds up to the point where, yeah, you have to make about 30 to 60% more than
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:10.280]   your day job income to replicate your day job income. And that just is the way it is.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:15.800]   But in return, you've got a business that is generating cash flow. Further, you can
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:22.040]   always sell your business as a multiple of revenue, or operating profits or net profits.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.680]   So you have that one two punch that can help you build wealth. And then finally, you get
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:31.840]   to be your own boss. But the irony is, and the funny saying is, I quit my nine to five
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:39.880]   job to be free to work 24/7. And this thing is so true, as I see here at the end of 2021,
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:45.160]   looking ahead into the first quarter of 2022. The first quarter of any calendar year is
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:51.120]   generally the biggest quarter of the year, especially in finance. What are the top two
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:56.680]   New Year's resolutions everybody has? Make more money, get in better shape. And it's
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:02.440]   going to be like that probably for the history of mankind. So as an entrepreneur, you really
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:08.000]   can't rest during the winter holidays. Because first quarter is so important. You got to
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:13.080]   make it count when it counts the most. For me, I'm thinking, well, what will my predictions
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.200]   be for the stock market, the real estate market and alternative assets for 2022. I've also
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.920]   got to come up with new ideas and new topics that I'll talk about beyond just investing,
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:29.120]   right? Because personal finance is so much more than just investing in stocks, real estate
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:34.760]   and alternative assets. There's what to do with your money, how to raise your family,
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:40.160]   education, health care, just like an endless stream of topics that I'm trying to think
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.240]   about and plan ahead. So all of us can benefit. Then I've got to think about marketing copy
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:52.040]   and how to market my new book coming out on June 28 2022 as well. That's going to be a
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:57.960]   lot of work. So as an entrepreneur, it's kind of endless. I've already gotten several out
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:02.600]   of office responses that said, hey, we'll be gone for the next two weeks. We'll be back
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:08.080]   in the new year. And that is something you really have to be able to appreciate as an
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:13.840]   employee. Don't take for granted the ability to make money while on vacation. But perhaps
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:20.000]   more powerful and more beneficial for employees is the ability to switch off. Just turn that
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:25.640]   switch off of always go, go, go. So you can spend time with your friends and family and
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:31.280]   relax. This is frankly something I've had a lot of trouble doing since I started Financial
[00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:36.940]   Samurai so long ago, and especially during the pandemic where I've got a family to support.
[00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:43.520]   So bottom line is there are positives to both sides of being an employee and as an entrepreneur.
[00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:48.840]   And let us not take what we have for granted. I hope all of you all have a wonderful, wonderful
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:54.280]   holiday. Hopefully you're spending time with friends and family and really reflect on this
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.640]   incredible year 2021. I'm gonna do a lot of reflecting over the next several weeks. And
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:05.480]   I just realized this is officially the 100th episode that I've published on this podcast
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:10.340]   channel. So thanks for sticking with me all this time. Refuse to quit. That's been my
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:18.200]   motto in 2020 and in 2021. No matter how difficult things get, refuse to quit. Thanks so much
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:23.440]   everyone. Happy holidays. And if you enjoyed this episode, I always love a positive review.
