[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800]   One of the reasons I'm proud to be an historian
[00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.180]   is that Churchill was one.
[00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.500]   History was a constant echo for him.
[00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.560]   It gave him endless signposts.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.020]   In the startup community, there is a cult of Napoleon
[00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.560]   -that is solely-- -Is there?
[00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.640]   I didn't know that. Seriously, is there?
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.900]   Your biography is the part of the canon here.
[00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.860]   (LAUGHS)
[00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.940]   If MacArthur had used nuclear weapons
[00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.740]   against the Chinese crossing the Yalu River,
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.120]   then, yes, he might well have actually won that war,
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.540]   but it would have lowered the moral barrier
[00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.120]   so significantly that nuclear weapons would have been used
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:36.380]   an awful lot more.
[00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.540]   In the future, war will be fought between two sets of drones,
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.220]   and the humans won't be in the loop,
[00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.180]   because decision-making has to take place
[00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.560]   far, far faster than the human mind can work.
[00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.980]   Today, I have the pleasure of speaking with Andrew Roberts,
[00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.200]   who is, most recently, the author of Conflict,
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.980]   The Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine.
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.200]   And this book is like Churchill's histories
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.360]   of the Second World War, the First World War,
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:12.160]   in that one of the principal actors in the conflicts discussed here
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.840]   is the co-author, General David Petraeus,
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.760]   who commanded the US forces in Afghanistan and Iraq,
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.140]   as one of your co-authors.
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.800]   And speaking of Churchill,
[00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.120]   Andrew is also the author of some superb and magnificent biographies
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.420]   of Churchill, Napoleon, King George,
[00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.760]   and an excellent book about World War II.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.420]   But first, let's begin with Conflict.
[00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.340]   -Andrew, welcome to the podcast. -Thank you very much indeed, Dwarkesh.
[00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.640]   It's an honour to be on your show.
[00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.560]   So, my first question is this.
[00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.180]   When we look at the first half of the 20th century,
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.440]   it seems like we got unlucky many times in a row.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.640]   You know, World War I, World War II,
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.360]   the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia,
[00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.700]   the Maoist Revolution in China,
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.280]   all those things seem like they didn't have to happen
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.160]   from reading historians about those topics,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   that if you reversed a bunch of contingent factors a few years back,
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.780]   any one of them could have not happened,
[00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.660]   and in each of those cases, tens of millions of people died.
[00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.040]   When we look at the second half of the 20th century,
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.700]   which you write about in these books,
[00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.240]   it seems like we got lucky again and again, right?
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.580]   So, the Cuban Missile Crisis doesn't go nuclear,
[00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.700]   we have all these proxy wars that don't go nuclear
[00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.240]   or result in a world war,
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.160]   China and India liberalise, communism falls.
[00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.500]   What explains why we had such different luck
[00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.280]   in these two different parts of the century?
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.360]   The invention of the nuclear bomb.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.200]   It's pretty much as easy as that.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.240]   You have all of these wars take place
[00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.320]   in the post-nuclear age after 1945.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.080]   And so, as a result, you have an umbrella
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.460]   under which everybody acts.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.160]   But although there are hundreds of wars that break out,
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.660]   about 140 wars, they have to be fought
[00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.120]   in an essentially limited way
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.500]   because of the existence of nuclear weapons.
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.700]   But couldn't you have said the same thing before World War I?
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.820]   And in fact, many did say that before World War I,
[00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.320]   where we have all this heavy artillery,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.080]   we have these, you can kill millions of people even then,
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.080]   and they still went to war.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.200]   So, how much does nuclear war explain
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   the absence of something escalating?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.420]   Well, you're right that the First World War
[00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:19.380]   did come about in part because of the arms race.
[00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.260]   But the knowledge that the nuclear bomb
[00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.380]   could obliterate the entire planet
[00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.340]   is something that has always managed
[00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.000]   to make wars limited post-1945.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.120]   What happened in 1914?
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.720]   The most people you could kill in a single moment
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.080]   would be as the result of an artillery shell.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.540]   And that's nothing like a nuclear bomb, frankly.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.540]   So, it's apples and pears, I think.
[00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:50.840]   It's really interesting in this book,
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.080]   you write about all these conflicts
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.840]   that have happened since World War II.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.760]   And in many cases, they're counterinsurgencies
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.140]   or civil wars.
[00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:00.920]   And it's interesting when one side gets to say
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.840]   that they're the legitimate force
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.000]   fighting for the country's independence
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.260]   against foreign aggressors,
[00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.760]   when both sides are getting foreign funding and support.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.080]   So, I'm curious how come the US has been bad
[00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:14.160]   at the propaganda here, where Ho Chi Minh
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.120]   or the Taliban get to say that they're the legitimate forces
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.620]   fighting for their country?
[00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:20.380]   Or how does that determination get made?
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.200]   Yes, that's a very good point.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.540]   I mean, I think in both cases,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.420]   obviously Ho Chi Minh and the Taliban
[00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.240]   both were local inhabitants in a way
[00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.120]   that the United States obviously wasn't in either place.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:36.420]   But whether they represented the majority of the people
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.420]   in either North Vietnam or Afghanistan
[00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.620]   is a completely different issue.
[00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.860]   So, it's much more a question of whether or not
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.780]   they are totalitarian powers who are able
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.860]   to establish dominance and keep it
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.960]   in a difficult and dangerous part of the world.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.500]   And that's what both of them were able to do.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.900]   It didn't mean that they have a legitimacy
[00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.860]   in the kinds of Jeffersonian democracy
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.500]   that one would like in a utopian world.
[00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.540]   But if they are the people that are wielding the power
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.700]   in the sense of a Marxist-Leninist clique,
[00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.960]   of course, in North Vietnam, you have to deal with them.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.000]   And they are the established government.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.960]   But it's interesting that South Vietnam
[00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.460]   or the government in Afghanistan
[00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:31.160]   didn't seem to have that same sort of legitimacy
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.240]   that these other insurgencies had,
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.320]   even though they were still local governments.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.240]   Do you think not? I rather think they do.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.480]   I mean, obviously, they're both immensely inefficient
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.320]   and useless and corrupt.
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.400]   But nonetheless, I don't think that that detracts
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.320]   from the fact that they were more legitimate
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.060]   than the forces that were rising up against them.
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.940]   Yeah, and in fact, this might be a good opportunity
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.180]   for you to discuss the four key tenets
[00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.560]   of strategic leadership that you discuss in the book.
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.920]   Yes, well, what we found in the book very much, very strongly,
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.300]   and it's interesting you should have mentioned
[00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.060]   the Chinese Civil War, because you get that
[00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.800]   very powerfully as well,
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.060]   is that the side that wins wars very often
[00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:18.600]   is not the one that controls the cities
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.180]   or has the largest amount of men
[00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.180]   or has the best weaponry.
[00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:25.980]   As you mentioned the Chinese Civil War,
[00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.220]   let's look at that for a second.
[00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.380]   It's the Kuomintang Nationalist Forces
[00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:33.680]   at the outset of that war had all the major cities.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.380]   They had four or five times the number of men.
[00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:39.260]   And they also had all the advanced weaponry
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.680]   that they'd taken off the Japanese
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.460]   at the time of the Japanese surrender in 1945.
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:45.180]   Yet they still lost that war.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.760]   One of the reasons was that they didn't have
[00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:50.260]   very impressive strategic leadership.
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:53.100]   And Chiang Kai-shek, even when he did come up
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:57.520]   with good plans, often had warlords below him
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.300]   that refused to carry them out.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.260]   So what we discovered in war after war
[00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.440]   is that the thing that matters most
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.760]   is this concept of strategic leadership,
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:12.980]   by which we mean having a leader at the top,
[00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:17.400]   either civil or military, but the ultimate decision maker.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:19.180]   And it's usually best when there's somebody
[00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.360]   who represents the civil and somebody
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.060]   who represents the military, and they get on.
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:29.140]   And they need to get the big idea for the war right.
[00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.980]   They need to then be able to communicate that
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.300]   to their lieutenants effectively,
[00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:38.020]   and indeed to the wider country.
[00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.980]   They need to be able to implement it
[00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.680]   aggressively and efficiently.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.180]   And then they need, as the fourth of the levels,
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:53.380]   to continue to adapt the big idea
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.760]   to circumstances on the ground
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:57.340]   and to the way in which war develops,
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:08:02.920]   because obviously no war carries out according to plan.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.680]   The enemy always has a say.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.540]   And then to refine it again and again and again.
[00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:13.140]   And so the people who are able to do that
[00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:14.880]   are very often victorious,
[00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.840]   even though they start off the campaign
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.040]   with many more disadvantages than their enemy.
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.620]   You know, I think this might be a good opportunity
[00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:26.120]   to start talking about Iraq and Afghanistan,
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.660]   which obviously your co-author can speak to like nobody else.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:33.500]   I found it really interesting in reading his accounts
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.840]   of what happened in those two countries,
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.120]   especially Iraq, which was a premeditated invasion.
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.540]   It wasn't something we had to just immediately do, right?
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.880]   It was a completely different casus belli
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.200]   with the weapons of mass destruction than 9/11.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.380]   Well, and also the surprise attack on Kuwait, of course.
[00:08:49.380 --> 00:08:53.540]   I mean, that's the ultimate reason that this took place,
[00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.920]   what had happened 13 years before
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.380]   and the 13 years in between, you know, it wasn't just WMD.
[00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.800]   Yeah, yeah, although I guess that 13 years
[00:09:03.800 --> 00:09:06.960]   still leaves us enough time to have a plan of what to do.
[00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:09.620]   And I found it interesting that, you know, you're discussing
[00:09:09.620 --> 00:09:13.660]   that after the regime has been changed,
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.700]   you realize that there's not a plan for how to ensure security
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:19.460]   and stability in the country.
[00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:21.540]   And I just can't imagine, I mean, you have obviously
[00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.000]   have really intelligent people like David Petraeus there
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.040]   who are working on this.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:27.340]   How is it possible that there was an invasion
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:29.240]   of these countries without a good plan
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.540]   of how to secure them afterwards?
[00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.620]   Well, he wasn't working on it.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.120]   He was working on how to destroy the Iraqi army
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.200]   and get to Baghdad.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.960]   And the people who were working on it
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   were a completely different set of generals
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:44.700]   who were failing to work out what to do
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:46.580]   once you had got to Baghdad.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:49.620]   And you assumed that the thing to do would be
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:51.460]   to get rid of the Ba'ath Party,
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:54.460]   which essentially ran the country,
[00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:56.740]   down to the sort of fourth level.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.540]   It was all very well getting rid of Saddam's sons
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:03.200]   and some of the other people at the top level.
[00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:08.380]   But when you do that, and also you essentially send
[00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:10.960]   the army home and not tell them how they're going
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:14.500]   to feed their families and allow them to keep their weapons,
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:18.080]   you've got a recipe for disaster.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.740]   And sure enough, disaster happened.
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:24.740]   But that can't be blamed on the sort of soldiers
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.740]   at the point of the spear who did an extremely good job,
[00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:32.420]   who overthrew that regime in double quick time.
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.000]   Now, speaking of strategic leadership,
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.620]   why is it that we don't have a figure natively
[00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.960]   in Iraq and Afghanistan who had that level
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.000]   of leadership themselves, you know,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.160]   as Zelensky in Iraq and Afghanistan,
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.320]   where in the book, General Petraeus discusses
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:52.540]   the endless frustrations he had with Malaki in Iraq.
[00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:55.380]   And of course, Ghani leaves Afghanistan
[00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.700]   when the Taliban start routing the Afghani forces.
[00:10:57.700 --> 00:10:59.660]   And Karzai, of course, also in Afghanistan.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:02.320]   Yeah, these guys come in for a bit of a pasting,
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:05.040]   understandably, in our book,
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.080]   because they are not the sort of Churchillian figures
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:11.500]   that Zelensky is.
[00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:15.780]   I think it partly, it's down to the sectarian nature
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:18.160]   of Iraqi and Afghan society,
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.820]   tribal nature of society,
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.420]   where however good a leader is,
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:28.920]   he doesn't automatically command the attention
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.420]   and loyalty of other people in the same country.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.280]   You know, the thing about Zelensky
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.920]   was that it was very clear very early on
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.340]   that he was speaking for the huge majority of the country.
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:42.660]   And it's very difficult for an Iraqi or Afghan leader,
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:45.380]   however good they are, and I'm not saying for one minute
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.160]   that Malaki and Karzai were any good,
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:52.840]   let alone the last chap who gets into his helicopter
[00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:55.880]   weighed down with suitcases full of money
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:58.920]   and hightails it out of there, you know.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.340]   By complete contrast, you do have Zelensky,
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:05.160]   who shows all of those four qualities of leadership
[00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.120]   that I mentioned, and also, of course,
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.800]   who decided he was going to stay in Kyiv,
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:12.160]   fight in Kyiv, his family were going to stay in Kyiv.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:17.680]   He wasn't going to let any military age male Ukrainians
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.420]   leave the country, and his big idea was,
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.460]   "I need ammunition, not a ride."
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:27.680]   What is our big idea, the Americans' big idea in Ukraine?
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:32.260]   What is the ceasefire or end arrangement we are driving at,
[00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:35.500]   which we think would be plausible for both sides to accept?
[00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:41.960]   Good question. I don't think Biden has articulated one properly yet.
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.840]   Zelensky has, which is the obvious one,
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.000]   which is that we're not going to allow 18 to 19% of our country
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.460]   to forever be under the rule of the Russians,
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.120]   and we're going to throw them out.
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:59.880]   And when David and I visited Kyiv about four months ago,
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:07.700]   we came across a huge level of national unity over that big idea.
[00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:12.080]   All the generals, of course, and the ministers could subscribe to it,
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:14.080]   but they're sort of paid to, it's part of their job.
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:19.540]   But so also did everybody on the street and everybody that we spoke to.
[00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:23.200]   They all absolutely believed in ultimate victory.
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:25.420]   They didn't know how long it was going to take.
[00:13:25.420 --> 00:13:29.920]   They didn't know how much more blood was going to have to be shed.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.740]   But they all believed that this would not stand
[00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.620]   and that they were going to ultimately be victorious,
[00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:43.960]   even if you, the Americans, cut off their funding after the next election.
[00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:47.000]   Right. But what is the answer to the American question of,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.340]   what is our goal? Is that the same as the Ukrainian goal?
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:50.620]   No, I don't think it is at the moment.
[00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:55.120]   It seems to be to wait until other countries, such as Britain,
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.880]   give a new set of weaponry,
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   then to give much more of the same kind of weaponry,
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:04.880]   then to wait until somebody else gives some more advanced weaponry.
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.500]   You saw this with anti-tank weaponry, later with tanks,
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.880]   then with artillery, then long-range artillery.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:18.080]   Now you've been giving them this ATAKMS, which are very impressive.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:23.000]   But you've hung back a bit with fighter aircraft and so on.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.740]   So it seems to be a piecemeal approach,
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.460]   where you wait until the Russians don't respond,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.960]   and then you give a bit more.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:35.280]   Frankly, it would have been much better, I think,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:42.240]   to have armed the Ukrainians earlier with the Leopards, essentially,
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.620]   and the tanks that they really needed for this big Southern counter-offensive,
[00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:49.000]   and come out wholeheartedly for them.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.960]   Now, you've given them a lot of money, obviously.
[00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.700]   44 billion is a very significant amount of money,
[00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:57.960]   and the Europeans have given as much or slightly more now.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:02.660]   But still, the Russians are in control of 18% of the country,
[00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.780]   and they've been building what the Ukrainians were expecting,
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:08.160]   hundreds of yards of minefields.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:12.360]   In fact, there are miles of minefields down in the south there.
[00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.040]   And so I'm afraid it's a long and bloody slog.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.120]   But we've seen wars like this before.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.320]   This is one of the things that we write about,
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:23.820]   the Korean War being a classic example,
[00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:27.400]   where you just have to thrash it out.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:29.780]   Actually, I want to ask you about Korea in a second.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:32.400]   I guess you might have just answered this question right now,
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:36.400]   but it does seem weird that we're slowly funding a war of attrition.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:40.780]   You know, it's classic Clausewitz to focus your effort on the point of attack.
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:43.860]   If you're just slowly doling out this equipment,
[00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:47.120]   why not just give it to them all at once so they can have a successful counter-offensive?
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:50.940]   Because I don't think you've got the political will in the United States
[00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.200]   to do that, frankly.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:57.820]   I think that, yes, you have a sort of nominal majority in both houses,
[00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.580]   but especially with your lower house at the moment, what's going on there?
[00:16:01.580 --> 00:16:09.820]   You don't have the sense of national will to do that.
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:14.980]   And so as a result, these poor Ukrainians are fighting and dying.
[00:16:15.060 --> 00:16:19.060]   When you do give them stuff, it's extremely helpful and useful.
[00:16:19.060 --> 00:16:24.260]   But as I say, the key point is that they will carry on fighting and dying,
[00:16:24.260 --> 00:16:26.060]   even if you didn't give them the stuff,
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:30.760]   because they're not going to have America essentially dictating to them
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.380]   what their national destiny is.
[00:16:33.380 --> 00:16:35.260]   Now, speaking of the Korean War,
[00:16:35.260 --> 00:16:39.340]   the chapter you wrote about this in your book was really interesting and great.
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:44.760]   And I wonder if Truman had decided to use a nuclear bomb in Korea,
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.760]   had agreed with MacArthur to do so,
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.520]   whether the taboo that we have against tactical nuclear weapons
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.520]   would not have emerged in the first place.
[00:16:53.520 --> 00:16:56.020]   And so, you know, the Soviets would have used it in Afghanistan,
[00:16:56.020 --> 00:16:58.380]   we would use it in Vietnam,
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.060]   and Thatcher would have used it in the Falklands.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:03.680]   No, I don't. I wouldn't go that far,
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.180]   because that would have wiped out the Falklands
[00:17:06.180 --> 00:17:09.980]   and we were trying to win back the Falklands.
[00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:12.020]   But yeah, no, you're quite right, of course.
[00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.940]   If MacArthur had used nuclear weapons
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:18.720]   against the Chinese crossing the Yalu River,
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:22.100]   then yes, he might well have actually won that war,
[00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:27.260]   but it would have lowered the moral barrier so significantly
[00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:31.060]   that nuclear weapons would have been used an awful lot more,
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:32.640]   as it is today.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.820]   Although there's lots of sabre rattling by Lavrov and Putin,
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:40.520]   it doesn't really look as though...
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:44.360]   I mean, yes, there might be a catastrophic disaster
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:46.860]   at the Japarizha nuclear plant,
[00:17:46.860 --> 00:17:50.100]   but it's very unlikely for Putin, actually,
[00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:54.220]   to use tactical nuclear missiles in Ukraine.
[00:17:54.220 --> 00:17:57.280]   Not least, of course, because the Chinese don't want him to.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.480]   But had they been a regular feature of warfare
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:03.720]   in the 1950s, '60s, '70s, and so on,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:06.520]   then, yeah, he might well do it.
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:08.900]   I just think it's important, when you're looking back in history,
[00:18:08.980 --> 00:18:14.820]   to give credit at decisions that are not often discussed like this,
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.560]   where Truman just decided to lose Korea rather than...
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.820]   At the time, the taboo didn't even exist,
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:24.280]   but rather than to create a taboo against nuclear weapons.
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.360]   Exactly. He did create it.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.980]   As did Clement Attlee, actually.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:31.600]   To give him his due, the British Prime Minister flew over to Washington,
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.280]   very concerned about this talk,
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:39.860]   MacArthur's talk about using a nuclear bomb.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.700]   And so he needs to get some credit as well.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:47.480]   And also, actually, Truman needs credit for sacking MacArthur in the first place,
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:50.700]   because MacArthur did have some...
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.020]   I mean, he was a charismatic and impressive figure,
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:55.780]   whose island-hopping policy in the Second World War
[00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.120]   was inspired and so on.
[00:18:58.120 --> 00:19:00.480]   But he was the classic example of the general
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.580]   who becomes too powerful, an over-mighty subject,
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:07.900]   who had political ambitions himself,
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:12.900]   who got the Chinese involvement in the war completely wrong,
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.860]   got the big ideas wrong, essentially,
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.280]   and had to be sacked.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.080]   That's also an interesting point, how overwhelmingly popular he was.
[00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:24.660]   I remember reading in Lyndon Johnson's biography
[00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:28.200]   that when MacArthur came to Congress to speak after he was sacked
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.200]   about the Korean War's progression,
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:32.200]   somebody said, "This is the closest thing."
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.240]   If he had wanted to, MacArthur was so popular
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.240]   that he could have just said, "We're going to sack the capital,"
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:37.660]   and people would have just followed him.
[00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:44.400]   Well, having seen what happened on January the 6th of last year,
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:47.320]   it's obviously not completely impossible.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.200]   Okay, going back to Iraq and Afghanistan,
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:54.520]   how much have those conflicts, those counterinsurgency operations,
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:59.520]   prepared the American military for a war with a peer competitor, like China?
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:04.580]   A great deal, obviously, but that's true of most wars.
[00:20:04.580 --> 00:20:10.540]   It's interesting, of course, China hasn't actually fought a major war
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:15.200]   for a very long time, really, and since the 1960s against India.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:20.040]   So actual practice is an incredibly useful thing.
[00:20:20.040 --> 00:20:22.500]   If Ukraine were ever to be allowed into NATO, for example,
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:28.160]   we'd have 900,000 troops on the southern border of NATO.
[00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:30.700]   It would be a huge addition.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:35.860]   So actually having troops that have fought is a...
[00:20:35.860 --> 00:20:41.860]   There's no amount of training that is the same as actual war fighting.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:45.160]   What you mentioned earlier, actually, I was just thinking about
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:48.500]   that good question you asked about nuclear bombs.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   Of course, what we're seeing today in Gaza
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:55.740]   is a classic example of limited war in that,
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:21:01.240]   however vicious and ghastly and painful and bloody it's going to be,
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.980]   it is the story of a group fighting against a country
[00:21:05.980 --> 00:21:11.820]   which has got the nuclear bomb, alone of all the countries in the region,
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:18.820]   and is, on moral grounds, not prepared even to threaten the use of it.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:24.580]   So in that sense, the Netanyahu government has a...
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.400]   It's not doing what Lavrov and Putin are doing
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:33.660]   by sabre-rattling the nuclear option, which does exist.
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:41.280]   So much of what is happening is as a result of Tehran wanting it to happen.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.040]   And Tehran doesn't have the bomb and Israel does.
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:48.280]   And yet Israel is not threatening Tehran.
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.080]   Yeah, and that's a really interesting point.
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:58.320]   As early as 1973, you could have had Israel nuke the Egyptian beachheads.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:00.700]   And it was a war of self-defence.
[00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:03.780]   You either die if you don't use it or you lose the war.
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:09.860]   Exactly. '73 was an existential war in the way that this one at the moment isn't.
[00:22:09.860 --> 00:22:12.780]   Now, obviously, we don't know what's going to happen within Israel,
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.940]   with the West Bank, with Hezbollah, with the Iranians and Syrians.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.760]   It's not impossible that this could turn into an existential war for Israel.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:29.180]   But the possession of the nuclear bomb hasn't done Israel any favours.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:32.380]   Equally, it hasn't weakened Israel either.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.840]   Is deterrence dead?
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.640]   So speaking of Israel, Iran funded these Hamas terrorists to conduct this attack.
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:44.800]   And as far as I know, there's no serious repercussions on Iran itself for doing this,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:46.960]   or funding Hezbollah, of course.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.580]   Is deterrence as a doctrine, is that dead?
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:55.380]   No, because it's working very well in Southeast Asia, in Taiwan.
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:23:01.580]   It is only dead amongst people who are so irrational and illogical
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:07.300]   that they don't mind, essentially, being extirpated
[00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:12.920]   in the way that the Israelis might soon be trying to extirpate Hamas.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.540]   So if you sort of don't care,
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:20.420]   if you believe that God has given you the right and duty to kill Jews,
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.700]   then you're not going to be deterred in the same way
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:29.580]   that a much more rational and logical actor such as Xi Jinping is,
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:34.880]   where he wakes up every morning and thinks, "Right, should I be invading Taiwan?"
[00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.080]   And he recognises, looks to the world situation,
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:42.080]   to the might of America in the South China Seas,
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:44.460]   and looks to all his neighbours,
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:47.580]   all but North Korea, of which hate and fear him,
[00:23:47.580 --> 00:23:50.580]   and recognises that today's not the day to do it.
[00:23:50.580 --> 00:23:53.000]   And that is what deterrence is.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.200]   It's incredibly expensive, of course, deterrence,
[00:23:55.200 --> 00:23:57.240]   but it's immensely cheap at the same time,
[00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:59.700]   compared to the alternative, which is war.
[00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:02.420]   So, yeah, this is one of the points you make in the book,
[00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.660]   is that money spent on deterrence is seldom wasted,
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.580]   but deterrence also has to be credible.
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:12.500]   Now, regardless, separate from the question of whether America
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:16.120]   would actually intervene if China invaded Taiwan,
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:20.740]   is it rational for the Chinese to believe that America would intervene,
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.620]   on behalf of an island with 20 million people,
[00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.000]   have a kinetic war with China over an island off the coast of China?
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.820]   Does that make sense? Is that deterrence credible for Chinese?
[00:24:29.820 --> 00:24:31.320]   It is. It certainly is,
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:37.620]   because there is what's been called strategic ambiguity in the American stance,
[00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:41.580]   and that is something that no rational actor wants to have to deal with.
[00:24:41.580 --> 00:24:47.820]   An America which could be sucked into a major war,
[00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:56.460]   an America that would maybe act irrationally over Taiwan,
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:25:01.000]   or which, as you can see with the AUKUS treaty,
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.960]   has got ambitions to stand up to China,
[00:25:05.040 --> 00:25:08.160]   and feels that it needs to carry them out.
[00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:14.840]   The public statements are obviously not intended deliberately to provoke China,
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:21.580]   but they're pretty straightforward in being ambiguous enough
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:23.580]   that China doesn't want to take the risk.
[00:25:23.580 --> 00:25:31.240]   Whilst, obviously, the United States military budget is so enormous, so vast,
[00:25:31.340 --> 00:25:36.580]   it's capable of deterring China.
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:42.960]   If it was to send the wrong messages, taking ships away and so on,
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   then it might not.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.460]   Look at what America's done in Ukraine.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:52.840]   And Xi recognizes that it's led a coalition
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:57.620]   which has fought very hard and so far hasn't lost.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:02.300]   And so, without a single American serviceman being involved,
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:05.000]   were American servicemen involved, which they would be,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.040]   in a Taiwan confrontation,
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.720]   the American president would be much, much more likely to go all in.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:17.420]   Yeah, although, if, for example, China blockades Taiwan
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:20.920]   and puts the onus on America to launch the kinetic war
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:22.680]   to break through the blockade,
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.800]   I wonder if then, put in those terms,
[00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:28.000]   an American president would not intervene,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.340]   or at least the Chinese wouldn't expect an American president
[00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:32.800]   to launch the kinetic war, to break the blockade.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:38.120]   Well, they've obviously war-gamed this a million times in the Pentagon.
[00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:45.000]   And I think that your remark about 20 million people
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.760]   is obviously an apposite one.
[00:26:46.760 --> 00:26:53.000]   But do let's also remember that Taiwan has 80% of the semiconductor industry,
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.120]   or at least the high-level semiconductor industry.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.660]   There were lots of good things being done to mitigate that against that now.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:04.160]   But nonetheless, it would be catastrophic
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:10.080]   for China to be able to snaffle all of that in a single coup d'etat.
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:15.040]   And obviously, the Biden administration knows that.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.700]   Before we return to conflict,
[00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.160]   I do want to ask you some questions about Churchill and World War II.
[00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:23.700]   And in fact, this is actually a good jumping off point,
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:27.040]   because speaking of rational leaders,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.820]   I'm struck when reading your biography of Churchill
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:32.820]   of how much of his thinking is more emotive,
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:35.620]   less probabilistic, much more principled.
[00:27:35.620 --> 00:27:38.420]   And when I try to backtest how I would have reacted,
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.460]   given my mindset, to World War II, if I was in Britain,
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:44.920]   I have to admit, I like to think in terms of probabilities and expected value,
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:48.240]   I would have said, "What's the expected value of fighting Germany
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.960]   in 1938 over Czechoslovakia?
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:53.080]   What would happen if he just didn't?"
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:58.460]   And it probably might just be best to run our odds with appeasement.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:00.960]   And I wonder if this is just a one-off case,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.840]   or do you think in general that illustrates a weakness
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:08.700]   in the more probabilistic way of thinking about geopolitics
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.380]   compared to Churchill's more emotional, oratorial, principled way?
[00:28:12.380 --> 00:28:15.380]   I don't really agree with you with the premise,
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.840]   because I think that Churchill, yes, he was emotional and principled,
[00:28:20.920 --> 00:28:28.140]   but also he recognised that the advance that the Germans made
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:34.960]   between the Sudeten crisis, which ended in Munich in September 1938,
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:38.640]   and the outbreak of war a year later in September 1939,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:47.300]   was so huge, especially in their creation of bombers and tanks and so on.
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:53.300]   And also, it was helped so much by taking the Skoda factories of the Czechs
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:57.880]   from Czechoslovakia and churning out tanks for Germany,
[00:28:57.880 --> 00:29:03.460]   that it was a rational thing to have tried to have stopped Germany
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:04.760]   invading Czechoslovakia.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:08.840]   So what Churchill was doing, yes, he was emotional
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:12.520]   and a great rhetorician and so on,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:17.820]   but he was also making a very, very hard-nosed decision
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.280]   with regard to balance of power,
[00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:24.060]   recognising that, in fact, Germany was in a much stronger position
[00:29:24.060 --> 00:29:27.360]   a year later than it had been at the time of Munich.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.360]   Now, it's remarkable to what extent Churchill had read,
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.060]   and not only read, but written, a tremendous amount of history.
[00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:39.240]   And I'm curious how concretely that history informed
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.180]   his decision-making as a leader.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:43.320]   Was it at the level of tactics and geography,
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.700]   where you see how old battles in the same places are fought?
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:47.440]   Was it a level of grand strategy?
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.560]   Was it at the understanding of human nature?
[00:29:49.560 --> 00:29:52.620]   What level did that understanding of history help him?
[00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.780]   All of those and more. All of those and more.
[00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:58.580]   One of the reasons I'm proud to be an historian is that Churchill was one.
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.660]   And he used his--
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:03.740]   He used-- I mean, primarily, that was his job,
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:06.900]   you know, in the 1930s when he was out of office,
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.440]   was to write history books.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:14.680]   And one of his great ancestor, John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough,
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.520]   is a--
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.940]   It's almost like an autobiography of the Second World War.
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:23.980]   And he's actually writing about his own ancestor 200 years beforehand.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:29.900]   But it is extraordinary how many things to do with tactics
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:33.640]   and strategy, of course, but also with how to deal with allies
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.320]   and how to deal with domestic political opinion and so on.
[00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:40.520]   All of these things are gone into.
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:46.320]   And then only five years after the publication of that book,
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:49.480]   he is prime minister and fighting a world war himself.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:53.480]   History was a constant echo for him.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   It gave him endless signposts.
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.140]   It's mentioned in some 10% of his speeches in the Second World War.
[00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:05.060]   He-- 10% of those speeches do have references to history.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:08.060]   He was basically telling the British people that,
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:13.260]   "Look back at the Spanish Armada, look back at Napoleonic Wars.
[00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:16.220]   We have been in this dangerous situation before.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:18.840]   The country has seen great perils before."
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:21.760]   Elizabeth I and the Spanish Armada, for example.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:24.520]   And we've come through them and been victorious.
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:29.140]   So, yes, he recognized the sort of political power
[00:31:29.140 --> 00:31:31.980]   of historical analogy.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.860]   And he bent it to his overall overarching theme
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:39.060]   that we have to stand up to the Nazis.
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.680]   Actually, so speaking of this,
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.860]   if we think of Churchill as an applied historian,
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:45.820]   this isn't a question I was planning on asking you,
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.180]   but you are in the House of Lords.
[00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:50.220]   You've written about these, I guess, basically everything
[00:31:50.220 --> 00:31:53.940]   that's happened in the last few centuries across your 20 books.
[00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:56.900]   Would you ever consider getting more involved with politics?
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:57.980]   Well, I'm a politician.
[00:31:57.980 --> 00:32:01.900]   I mean, I go to the House of Lords from Monday
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:04.900]   to Wednesday lunchtime to dinnertime.
[00:32:04.900 --> 00:32:10.100]   I go and vote in the divisions, you know.
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:15.480]   And no, I can't see how much more involved in politics
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.940]   I can be than speaking and voting in one of the chambers of our parliament.
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.860]   If you want to refine that slightly, do, Tarkesh.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:28.480]   Yeah, let me restate the question.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.760]   Would you consider running for,
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:35.720]   aspiring towards a leadership position in the UK,
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.840]   given how successful past historians have been at that endeavour?
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.260]   Well, we've just mentioned one past historian who's been successful.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:47.560]   I assure you that there are an awful lot of other ones who haven't.
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:54.300]   No, I'm very happy with the extent that I involve myself in politics in the UK.
[00:32:54.300 --> 00:32:57.640]   I've got to get back down to writing history books, frankly,
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:03.100]   is the reason I was put on earth, really.
[00:33:03.100 --> 00:33:07.060]   Now, tying back, Churchill, and your most recent book,
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:09.560]   there's this interesting thing where wartime leaders,
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:12.380]   very successful wartime leaders, are kicked out of office
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.100]   after they win their wars.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:18.220]   Churchill in 1945, de Gaulle resigns in '46.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.420]   He led the French against the Nazis.
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.840]   And then, more recently, which you discuss in your book,
[00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:27.660]   George H.W. Bush possibly has the most successful foreign policy
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:30.720]   since World War II, the unification of Germany,
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.620]   the fall of the Soviet bloc without a single shot being fired,
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:35.840]   and many others, but...
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:38.800]   David Lloyd George is the other classic example, of course.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.920]   You know, David Lloyd George led us to victory in the First World War.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:44.040]   He was out by 1922.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.340]   So what is this? Why are we, in democratic countries,
[00:33:47.340 --> 00:33:51.800]   keen to kick out the people who win us these wars and foreign policy wins?
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:55.000]   Because we recognise that the skills you need in peace
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.500]   are completely different from the ones you need in war.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:03.300]   And what the Labour Party was offering in 1945, for example,
[00:34:03.300 --> 00:34:08.180]   this sort of new Jerusalem of socialism and the welfare state
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:13.600]   and nationalising the Bank of England and free stuff, essentially,
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:19.760]   National Health Service, was going to be given by Clemens Attlee,
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:24.460]   but although much of that was going to be done by Winston Churchill as well,
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:27.220]   they recognised that the Conservatives didn't have their heart in it
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.100]   in the same way that the socialists did.
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:32.720]   So it's completely rational, isn't it, in a democratic country,
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:35.680]   to go for, when you've got a choice of leaders,
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:40.640]   to go for the one who's going to lead you through the peace,
[00:34:40.640 --> 00:34:44.380]   however well the person who led you through the war did.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:48.340]   Although that particular example of socialism in Britain
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:51.760]   doesn't seem like the rational choice for the British population to have made.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.500]   Well, it did after six years of gruelling warfare,
[00:34:54.500 --> 00:35:00.920]   where people wanted to have a sort of more healthy and better life,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.300]   and they assumed that socialism was going to be able to do that for them.
[00:35:05.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   It took us half a century before we grew out of that particular miasma.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:12.920]   Now, let's talk about future wars,
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:17.140]   which is something interesting that you and General Petraeus survey
[00:35:17.220 --> 00:35:18.720]   in your most recent book.
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:22.300]   You mentioned that the balance of power
[00:35:22.300 --> 00:35:25.840]   has shifted more towards defence than offence recently.
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.140]   -Why is that? -We're seeing that, aren't we?
[00:35:28.140 --> 00:35:32.300]   We will be about to see that, I fear, in Gaza.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:36.560]   In Napoleonic times, it was one in three.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:39.880]   You needed three attackers for every defender.
[00:35:39.880 --> 00:35:45.600]   That probably stays true until the Second World War.
[00:35:45.680 --> 00:35:51.640]   But, frankly, taking Gaza as an indication,
[00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:54.920]   with IEDs, with booby traps,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.960]   certainly with all these tunnels,
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.640]   and with the capacity for ambush,
[00:36:01.640 --> 00:36:04.640]   and for sniper fire as well,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.180]   which has come on leaps and bounds since the old days of Stalingrad,
[00:36:09.180 --> 00:36:15.560]   you need certainly more than three to one in offence.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:23.560]   It's an interesting fact that when Clausewitz was writing,
[00:36:23.560 --> 00:36:28.760]   three to one was a perfectly reasonable ratio,
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:32.380]   but I think that's gone to the birds now.
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:33.720]   Oh, interesting.
[00:36:33.720 --> 00:36:37.300]   This just preempted and answered a question I was about to ask you.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.020]   It's remarkable to me that a three to one ratio,
[00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:43.260]   which Clausewitz first came up with, has stayed consistent for...
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.380]   I guess the answer is that it hasn't,
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.640]   but I was about to ask,
[00:36:46.640 --> 00:36:50.140]   it's weird that for hundreds of years, with all these new technologies,
[00:36:50.140 --> 00:36:53.600]   that ratio is still the one that people use, that technicians still use.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:57.640]   Yes, well, as I say, they did until well into our lifetimes,
[00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.140]   but they'd be mad today,
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:02.600]   because that has altered,
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.640]   especially, of course, in built-up areas,
[00:37:05.640 --> 00:37:10.380]   in the kind of situation which one gets in Gaza,
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:13.600]   with lots of high-rise buildings,
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.420]   fewer now than there were, to be frank,
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:20.640]   but lots of built-up areas.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.600]   You can look at, for example, the Battle of Monte Cassino,
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:31.600]   where, because the Allies flattened the whole monastery,
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:36.380]   actually, the rubble was more easy for the Germans to defend
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:39.920]   with machine gun nests and so on,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.140]   than if the actual building had been left standing.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:45.600]   So there is an argument, actually, that you do better
[00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:48.920]   if you don't blast the buildings,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:53.100]   as you saw also in Mariupol, which you mentioned earlier.
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.100]   And then there's, of course, Stalingrad,
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:58.880]   where they fight something called Ratzkrieg,
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.260]   which is essentially rat war,
[00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:04.340]   because people are fighting down in the cellars,
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:08.460]   you know, it's hand-to-hand stuff, it's extremely vicious,
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:13.260]   where every building, every room has to be fought,
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:15.640]   sometimes down with bayonets.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.340]   So this kind of fighting, which, of course,
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:23.720]   is heavily, heavily full of high-casualty raids,
[00:38:23.720 --> 00:38:26.760]   might well be the one that we're about to see
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:30.720]   the IDF enter in Gaza.
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.140]   That's a scary comparison, the Gaza becomes Stalingrad.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.880]   I didn't think of it that way, but that's wow.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.560]   In my house in London,
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.060]   I have an actual copy of one of Winston Churchill's speeches
[00:38:44.060 --> 00:38:46.060]   with his handwritten annotations,
[00:38:46.060 --> 00:38:49.720]   and one of the sentences is that London,
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.300]   fought street by street, could engulf and devour
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:55.560]   an entire hostile army.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.380]   And one hopes that it doesn't happen, obviously, to the IDF,
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:05.300]   but, you know, that's the reality of house-to-house fighting.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.680]   Actually, while we're on the subject,
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.640]   I have a few other questions on World War II
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.520]   that I want to ask you before we return to future wars.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:13.300]   You have this really interesting book,
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:15.980]   I think probably my favourite book about World War II,
[00:39:15.980 --> 00:39:18.480]   The Storms of War, which I highly recommend.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:24.180]   And in it, you make the claim that we're not
[00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:29.680]   for the ideologically inspired blunders of Hitler and the Nazis,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.760]   that they could have won World War II.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:34.220]   And then you detail a lot of the mistakes they made.
[00:39:34.300 --> 00:39:37.480]   But when we step back and look at, after America joins the war,
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:41.220]   the overwhelming industrial output of America,
[00:39:41.220 --> 00:39:42.800]   even if they didn't make these mistakes,
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.380]   is there really any chance that, you know,
[00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:48.140]   you have a country that has, like, 2X the GNP
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.100]   and is outproducing the rest of the world,
[00:39:50.100 --> 00:39:51.380]   combined ships and planes,
[00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:52.980]   that you could have really stood up to that?
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:56.140]   Well, why did Hitler declare war against America?
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.600]   There wouldn't have been a war
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.840]   if he hadn't declared war against America.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   You'd have fought a war against the country
[00:40:01.940 --> 00:40:04.340]   that attacked you, Japan.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:09.840]   And so, and the reason is because he was a Nazi,
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:12.980]   because he believed that Jews and blacks
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.440]   dominated the American decision-making process,
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.600]   which, by the way, is completely absurd.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:22.260]   When one looks at the Roosevelt administration,
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:26.220]   it had very, very few Jews or blacks.
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:30.580]   But nonetheless, the Nazis didn't, sort of,
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.840]   do their factual accuracy.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:37.340]   It wasn't always their highest attribute.
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:41.420]   And they also thought that Americans were cowards
[00:40:41.420 --> 00:40:43.040]   and wouldn't be able to fight very well,
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.120]   which is extraordinary,
[00:40:44.120 --> 00:40:47.000]   considering that the Americans had fought very well,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.880]   indeed, in the First World War.
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.380]   Adolf Hitler told Molotov,
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:58.320]   when they were in a bunker in 1940 in Berlin,
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:01.000]   that if the Americans did come into the war,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.700]   they wouldn't be able to actually put any troops
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:10.280]   into the Western theatre until the year 1970.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.420]   As it was, needless to say, by November 1942,
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:15.380]   you had a quarter of a million GIs
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:18.660]   storming ashore in North Africa.
[00:41:18.740 --> 00:41:22.320]   So, this sense of ideology,
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:24.940]   you see it also, of course, six months earlier,
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:26.900]   in the June of 1941,
[00:41:26.900 --> 00:41:31.200]   where Hitler invades Russia
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.940]   in the belief that the Slavic people
[00:41:33.940 --> 00:41:39.360]   can't stand up to the great German Aryan master race.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:42.240]   And as Goebbels said to him,
[00:41:42.240 --> 00:41:44.440]   "We'll kick in the door and the whole rotten edifice
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:45.980]   will come crashing down,"
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.020]   talking about the Bolshevik state.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:50.820]   But that's not what happened, of course.
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:54.640]   And the Russians fighting on their own territory,
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.240]   i.e. when they're not fighting an adventure,
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:01.560]   a foreign adventure, like in Poland or in Finland,
[00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:05.140]   or now in Ukraine, are actually very good soldiers.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:07.480]   So, he got that wrong.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:11.940]   Again and again, Hitler put his Nazi ideology
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:16.940]   before the strategic best interests of the German Reich.
[00:42:17.020 --> 00:42:20.400]   It was fascinating to read the different mistakes Hitler made.
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.820]   Obviously, from liquidating six million
[00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:27.780]   of his most productive, intelligent, and well-educated people,
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.440]   to the timing of Operation Barbarossa,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:31.100]   or launching it in the first place,
[00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:33.520]   to the timing of launching World War II in the first place.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.020]   But even if he hadn't declared war on America,
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:40.360]   the Lend-Lease Aid, on whose basis the Soviets
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:42.440]   were able to drive back the Germans,
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:44.360]   would still have continued.
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:45.860]   And that was, of course, a meat grinder,
[00:42:45.940 --> 00:42:49.360]   where the overwhelming majority of German troops died.
[00:42:49.360 --> 00:42:51.060]   So, I guess you could say, well,
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:54.560]   then he wouldn't have done Operation Barbarossa at all.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:57.020]   But then, are we still talking about the same war?
[00:42:57.020 --> 00:43:02.640]   He would have invaded Russia and be caught in this enormous war.
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:05.440]   And, but if he hadn't declared war on the United States,
[00:43:05.440 --> 00:43:07.320]   it's very difficult to work out how Roosevelt
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.560]   would have been able to have declared war on him,
[00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:13.140]   especially if you're fighting a full-scale war against Japan,
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.820]   which, by that stage, had, by early 1942,
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:20.060]   covered one-eighth of the world's surface.
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:23.060]   It's a huge undertaking.
[00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:25.520]   But by the calendar year 19...
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:28.060]   You're absolutely right about the might of American production.
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:30.520]   By the calendar year 1944,
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:33.780]   when the British produced 28,000 warplanes,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:38.820]   the Russians and the Germans both produced 40,000 each,
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:41.560]   the United States produced 98,000 warplanes.
[00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.520]   It's almost as much as the whole of the rest of the world put together.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.360]   They were building Liberty ships at the rate of one a week.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:52.740]   It was just a truly extraordinary thing
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:55.080]   in terms of just sheer production.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:57.280]   So, of course, that was going to give them
[00:43:57.280 --> 00:44:01.360]   the final say over who commanded at D-Day,
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.860]   when D-Day would happen,
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:09.940]   and what would happen once they landed in France.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.360]   But it also had huge implications
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   for everything else, really, in the Second World War as well.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:18.440]   And you're also completely right to say
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:21.140]   for every five Germans killed in conflict,
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:25.400]   I don't mean bombed from the air, I mean killed on a battlefield,
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.480]   four of them died on the Eastern Front.
[00:44:27.480 --> 00:44:32.320]   Now, given how misled Hitler was by Nazi ideology,
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.980]   why weren't the Soviets as misled by communist ideology
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.780]   in the waging of World War II?
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:43.400]   Because communist ideology hadn't affected
[00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.360]   actual Politburo,
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:49.620]   the way in which the Politburo worked, understandably.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:53.400]   There was no sort of dictatorship of the proletariat
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.860]   or anything like that,
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:59.280]   let alone any equality.
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:02.480]   He was obviously a totalitarian dictator,
[00:45:02.480 --> 00:45:05.660]   but what he did learn was
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.900]   that the Hitlerian way of fighting the war
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.980]   was not the most productive one.
[00:45:11.980 --> 00:45:15.200]   So what you get after Operation Barbarossa,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:19.040]   after which he had some kind of a mini mental breakdown
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.900]   in the immediate hours that he learned about it,
[00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.700]   how the one man he trusted in politics, Adolf Hitler,
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:26.320]   had betrayed him.
[00:45:26.320 --> 00:45:31.280]   For a paranoid, that's a difficult moment to take.
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:37.820]   But then what he does is to start to lean on those marshals,
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:42.900]   such as Konev and Zhukov and Rokossovsky and others,
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:47.160]   and gives them a lot more power than they ever had before,
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:49.980]   and listens to them and takes their advice,
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:55.440]   and actually has a much more kind of Western view,
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:00.600]   the relationship between Churchill, Roosevelt,
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:03.140]   Alan Brooke and George Marshall,
[00:46:03.140 --> 00:46:06.480]   which I write about in my book, Masters and Commanders,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.360]   is a big sort of give and take,
[00:46:10.360 --> 00:46:14.400]   a much more sort of democratic and Western way
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.820]   of coming to military decisions.
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:19.820]   And that's the one that Stalin adopts, and quite rightly,
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:24.680]   and completely contrasted from what's going on in the Wulffshansa,
[00:46:24.760 --> 00:46:29.220]   1800 miles behind the German front,
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:33.600]   which is actually the Fuhrer listening,
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:36.820]   sometimes for hours, to his generals,
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:40.320]   most of whom know strategy far better than he,
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:43.780]   because they actually went to staff colleges,
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.100]   and they fought, of course, as officers in the First World War,
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.100]   rather than just as a corporal.
[00:46:49.100 --> 00:46:54.660]   And men like Rundstedt and Guderian and Manstein,
[00:46:54.740 --> 00:47:01.360]   and so on, these people would be listened to by Hitler.
[00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:04.000]   And then right at the end of the meeting,
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   Hitler would sum up and say that they were going to do
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.340]   exactly what he'd originally said right at the beginning of the meeting.
[00:47:10.340 --> 00:47:17.660]   And we have every word said by everybody at the Fuhrer conferences,
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.380]   because the stenographers took down every word that was said.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.840]   And it's very clear that they would go into tremendous detail.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:33.500]   But ultimately, the Fuhrer, his way was the way that the Wehrmacht went.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:37.500]   This is actually interesting, and this is one of the points you discuss in conflict.
[00:47:37.500 --> 00:47:40.880]   You talk about the different ways in which democracies or dictatorships
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:42.580]   are able to execute wars.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:47.140]   And World War II is obviously the perfect example to evaluate this.
[00:47:47.140 --> 00:47:50.140]   Well, except for the Soviet Union was not a democracy, of course,
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:52.140]   and it was on the winning side.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:57.140]   There is that glaring glitch in the argument.
[00:47:57.140 --> 00:47:59.300]   Right, right, right. Fair enough.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:02.100]   But so you have the allied,
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:04.720]   the Western democracies have this strategy by committee,
[00:48:04.720 --> 00:48:07.440]   I think you described it in Storms of War.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:11.940]   And that obviously means that something as stupid as Operation Barbarossa
[00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:16.140]   never happens, you have to come to consensus between all these leaders.
[00:48:16.140 --> 00:48:18.560]   At the same time, in your Napoleon biography,
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:21.820]   you have the singular genius who is able to execute these moves
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:27.320]   that even his advisors often are like, "Well, you shouldn't do that."
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:29.480]   I guess in the case of Russia, they were right.
[00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:34.640]   But yeah, so maybe just you can talk generally
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.820]   about the merits of strategy by consensus
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:41.360]   versus strategy by a singular mind.
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.060]   Yes. Actually, the interesting thing about Napoleon in 1812
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:50.360]   is that he wasn't warned by his generals that it was a big mistake.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:54.820]   And this was partly because he and they thought
[00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:57.140]   that this was going to be a three-week campaign.
[00:48:57.140 --> 00:49:02.180]   And it was only going to go about 50 miles into Russian territory
[00:49:02.180 --> 00:49:06.680]   before the Russians capitulated or came to a big battle and were defeated.
[00:49:06.680 --> 00:49:12.400]   And he had absolutely no plans at all to go all the way to Moscow in 1812.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:17.320]   That would have seemed, as he was crossing the Neman River,
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:19.100]   as a complete absurdity.
[00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:23.280]   He was drawn in more and more into the Russian heartland
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:30.480]   until finally they gave battle in September 1812 at Borodino.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:34.560]   And then he went on and took Moscow.
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:41.700]   But he left enough time to get back from Moscow to Smolensk.
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:46.940]   It was, in fact, more time than he had taken to get from Smolensk to Moscow.
[00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:50.120]   There are other reasons, which I go into in the book,
[00:49:50.120 --> 00:49:54.020]   about why the retreat from Moscow turned into the catastrophe it did.
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.980]   But it wasn't actually primarily the weather at the beginning, at least.
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:02.240]   So, yes, Napoleon is the classic example
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:07.120]   of the single-mind strategic leader
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:11.940]   who, like, I don't know, Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar,
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:18.700]   has the whole centrality of the campaign in his head, essentially.
[00:50:18.700 --> 00:50:21.400]   But, of course, he does lose.
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:28.440]   And after 1812, you have the various coalitions of 1813 and 1814,
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:29.820]   which force him to abdicate.
[00:50:29.820 --> 00:50:34.120]   Then he comes back, of course, in the Hundred Days and loses there as well.
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:42.620]   So that is, in contrast to the much more collegiate way
[00:50:42.620 --> 00:50:46.740]   that Wellington and Schwarzenberg and Blucher and so on
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:49.580]   interacted with one another.
[00:50:49.580 --> 00:50:55.080]   But, yes, your overall thesis, I think, is absolutely right
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:58.280]   about democracies being better at fighting wars.
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:01.820]   But dictatorships, of course, and totalitarian ones,
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:03.900]   are authoritarian as well.
[00:51:03.980 --> 00:51:05.640]   And much better at starting wars,
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:09.220]   because they do have the element of surprise very often.
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:13.680]   One looks at the Yom Kippur War, of course.
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:19.100]   You look at 9/11, Pearl Harbor, Barbarossa that you mentioned earlier,
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:25.100]   the Falklands, the attack on Kuwait by Saddam.
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:28.760]   - There's a great line... - The Chinese sneaking into Korea.
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:33.640]   The Chinese crossing the Yalu River.
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.140]   160,000 of them at the dead of night.
[00:51:36.140 --> 00:51:38.440]   It's the most extraordinary surprise attack.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.520]   And there's that wonderful line of Paul Wolfowitz's,
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:48.100]   when he said that surprise attacks take place so often in history
[00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:52.020]   that the only surprising thing is that we're still surprised by them.
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:54.180]   And that is right.
[00:51:54.180 --> 00:51:57.020]   Democracies can do surprise attacks.
[00:51:57.020 --> 00:52:00.220]   Obviously, the major exception to that rule
[00:52:00.300 --> 00:52:06.840]   is when Israel did successfully carry out the Six-Day War surprise attack
[00:52:06.840 --> 00:52:09.020]   at the beginning of that conflict.
[00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:12.060]   But otherwise, democracies tend not to.
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:14.380]   And by the way, it's a good thing not to,
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:18.720]   because what it does do is light a fire under the country
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.800]   that's been surprised.
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:23.760]   Classic examples, of course, being Pearl Harbor.
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:29.100]   And it makes them feel outraged and angry.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:34.480]   And as a result, they tend to extract revenge.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.760]   And by the way, what Hamas did on the 7th of October
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.760]   is a classic example of that, of course.
[00:52:39.760 --> 00:52:45.760]   That's a surprise attack which was, by its own light, immensely successful,
[00:52:45.760 --> 00:52:49.840]   but which will have lit a fire under Israel
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:54.300]   that is going to be very dangerous for Hamas.
[00:52:54.300 --> 00:52:57.840]   This is an excellent opportunity to ask you about "Bring Us Back to the Future" war,
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:53:00.160]   which you discuss in your newest book, "Conflict."
[00:53:00.160 --> 00:53:04.160]   The question I have is, given you discuss in the book,
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:10.080]   we have satellite reconnaissance and drones and all this cyber espionage,
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.000]   given how clearly we can see the world now with these new technologies,
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.040]   are large-scale surprise attacks ever going to be possible again?
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:21.200]   That's a very good question.
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:24.420]   I'm tempted to say no, because you're quite right.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:29.240]   Everything can be spotted on the battlefield today.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:33.740]   Obviously, the Hamas surprise attack was a much, much smaller scale
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:38.660]   than a complete nation-on-nation kind of attack
[00:53:38.660 --> 00:53:42.120]   like Barbarossa or Pearl Harbor.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:47.320]   But nonetheless, it is much more difficult to hide troops today
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:51.000]   than it ever has been in the past.
[00:53:51.080 --> 00:53:54.080]   That doesn't change, of course, the psychology of what happens
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:57.080]   when you are surprised in the way that Israel was.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:54:02.660]   But, yeah, in the 10th chapter, the last chapter of our book,
[00:54:02.660 --> 00:54:05.040]   we call it "The Future of War."
[00:54:05.040 --> 00:54:08.160]   We look at areas like cyber and space,
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:13.200]   but also sensors, AI, robotics, and drones, of course.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.120]   You know, in the future,
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.120]   the war will be fought between two sets of drones,
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:21.860]   and the humans won't be in the loop.
[00:54:21.860 --> 00:54:24.320]   They'll be on the loop. They'll have written the algorithms.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:29.280]   But, of course, they won't be in the loop,
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:33.080]   because decision-making has to take place far, far faster
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.820]   than the human mind can work.
[00:54:35.820 --> 00:54:42.740]   If a human is involved and at the controls of weaponry of the future,
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.280]   then he'll lose.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:47.900]   It has to be fought between two sets of machines.
[00:54:47.980 --> 00:54:51.440]   And, of course, that has great advantages in terms of speed,
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:54.980]   but also machines have no conscience.
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:57.560]   They don't feel fear or cowardice.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.980]   They don't feel remorse or regret or pity.
[00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:05.020]   It's going to be a much more dangerous world in that sense.
[00:55:05.020 --> 00:55:08.640]   Yeah, and that has all kinds of interesting implications.
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.180]   From the technical, which you discuss in the book,
[00:55:12.180 --> 00:55:15.820]   that the electromagnetic spectrum will be under much greater contention,
[00:55:15.900 --> 00:55:18.740]   because then you can jam the electronics and the communications
[00:55:18.740 --> 00:55:20.900]   between these devices.
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:24.360]   To the strategic, I mean, you have these examples,
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.200]   famously, let's say, in the 1980s, when the stock market crashes,
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:30.360]   because an algorithm malfunctions.
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:32.400]   If that leads to a world war,
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.060]   whatever that was, the equivalent of that leads to a world war.
[00:55:35.060 --> 00:55:38.020]   So, you discuss in your Ukraine chapter
[00:55:38.020 --> 00:55:43.560]   that tech entrepreneurs are now having a much bigger impact
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.900]   on the waging of war,
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:50.940]   where, obviously, you have Elon Musk providing startling services to Ukraine,
[00:55:50.940 --> 00:55:54.280]   and notably, refusing to provide the service
[00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.860]   to help with the surprise attack,
[00:55:56.860 --> 00:56:02.600]   the naval surprise attack that Ukraine was planning on launching in Crimea.
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:06.360]   Now, how will the ability of tech entrepreneurs
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:10.320]   to dictate where and how they will get involved
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.040]   in lending their technology to governments,
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:17.040]   how will that play into the future strategy?
[00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.660]   Will they be a force for peace, or will they not be a force at all?
[00:56:20.660 --> 00:56:22.540]   Because if the government really wants your technology,
[00:56:22.540 --> 00:56:24.620]   in the end, they can just expropriate it.
[00:56:24.620 --> 00:56:26.860]   I don't think they'll do that,
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:31.860]   except for in times of extreme stress and crisis.
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:35.240]   But, no, actually, there's a very wide,
[00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:39.000]   and, I think, overall, very positive area
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.740]   that tech entrepreneurs can play here.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:47.000]   And Starlink, yes, it's true that Mr. Musk
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.540]   did refuse to help one attack in Crimea,
[00:56:51.540 --> 00:56:56.860]   but, overall, Starlink has been invaluable in this war.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.000]   I mean, in a way, it is the first proper internet war.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.200]   You know, people with iPhones on the battlefield
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:08.880]   can upload both images and, obviously, also map references,
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:15.000]   which can prove extremely useful to drones and artillery.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.700]   And this is one of the reasons that Kyiv didn't fall
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:23.700]   in the opening parts of the Russo-Ukrainian war,
[00:57:23.700 --> 00:57:28.660]   because Ukrainian artillery was being...
[00:57:28.740 --> 00:57:32.740]   given the accurate information
[00:57:32.740 --> 00:57:36.160]   on all sorts of open intelligence, open sources.
[00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:39.660]   It was a new kind of warfare,
[00:57:39.660 --> 00:57:43.420]   which the Russians took a very long time to catch up with.
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:48.040]   And, of course, because they didn't have their own people on the ground,
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:49.920]   whereas Ukraine did.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:55.700]   The native population was 100% opposed to the Russian invasion
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:57:59.860]   in every area apart from four Donbass oblasts.
[00:57:59.860 --> 00:58:06.000]   You essentially had just a multitude of information sources
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.500]   that were proving to be incredibly useful.
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:12.540]   So that's one aspect of the modernity.
[00:58:12.540 --> 00:58:14.280]   The next one, obviously, is drones
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:19.700]   and the use they've been put to by the Ukrainians.
[00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:25.080]   But the sort of innovative stance of the Ukrainians
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:28.360]   has been really extraordinarily impressive.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:33.200]   And when tech people all across the world,
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:36.160]   not just, obviously, in the United States,
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:40.200]   came out very actively in support of Ukraine,
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.780]   it really did move the dial.
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:46.580]   And so I think with companies like Panentir
[00:58:46.580 --> 00:58:51.040]   and others that are really making huge advances,
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:56.540]   and the cutting edge still being with the West
[00:58:56.540 --> 00:59:01.040]   in terms of tech entrepreneurial ability,
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:03.160]   this is a good thing for the West.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:09.320]   And some individuals are going to be pretty much, like Mr. Musk is,
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:14.620]   the most important private individuals, I would say,
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.000]   to actually affect warfare
[00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:23.200]   since Thiessen and Krupp back before the First World War.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:28.860]   So it really is a new world, but it's not a bad new world.
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:30.860]   It could actually be an extremely good new world
[00:59:30.860 --> 00:59:33.460]   for the West and for democracy.
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:38.420]   Yeah. Speaking of tech entrepreneurs and their personalities,
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:40.880]   let's discuss your biography of Napoleon.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.660]   So I'm not aware if you're aware of this,
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:46.000]   but living in San Francisco,
[00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.960]   there is, in the startup community,
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.000]   there is a cult of Napoleon that is still emerging.
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.700]   Is there? I didn't know that. Seriously, is there?
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.920]   Your biography is part of the canon here.
[00:59:57.920 --> 00:59:59.920]   [laughing]
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.540]   So in the person of Napoleon,
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:07.920]   I think startup founders see the best aspects of themselves resemble.
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:10.160]   You have somebody who is a young upstart,
[01:00:10.160 --> 01:00:13.160]   just stupendously energetic and competent,
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.540]   much more efficient than the bureaucracies and old systems around him,
[01:00:17.540 --> 01:00:21.320]   a reformer, tremendously intellectually curious,
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:24.120]   an autodidact. You can just go down the list.
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:25.820]   What is your reaction?
[01:00:25.820 --> 01:00:29.000]   I love that. I love that. That's exactly what...
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:34.200]   Yeah, absolutely. He was totally fascinated by every new thing.
[01:00:34.200 --> 01:00:41.360]   He flung himself into ideas for balloons and submarines
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:47.120]   and anything that could be useful for agricultural development.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:53.120]   He was fascinated by trying to build bridges faster and better and cheaper.
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:56.700]   He was a real go-getter
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:03.860]   when it came to giving prizes for new chemical components and so on.
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:07.620]   This was somebody who created the Legendes d'honneur
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:12.580]   not just for soldiers but very much for inventors and entrepreneurs
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:17.780]   and people like that who he felt were going to help France
[01:01:17.780 --> 01:01:22.580]   outstrip Britain, which had a head start on France in the Industrial Revolution.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:28.340]   So there was a very strong sort of nationalist reasoning
[01:01:28.340 --> 01:01:31.920]   behind his embrace of science.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:38.660]   But he was made a Fellow of the French Academy
[01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:41.220]   on the basis of his genuine interest,
[01:01:41.220 --> 01:01:45.460]   not just because he was the first Consul of France.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:47.760]   And he used to attend all their meetings.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.340]   This was an extraordinary thing.
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:52.720]   If there was going to be a meeting on, I don't know, electricity,
[01:01:52.720 --> 01:01:57.380]   sitting in the front there would be the first Consul taking notes.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:06.720]   So I can understand why young tech entrepreneurs might like Napoleon,
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:09.180]   and I'm thrilled that my book might be helping with that.
[01:02:09.180 --> 01:02:13.220]   Yeah, I think you'd be surprised at the extent of it.
[01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:16.920]   Also, it's true that megalomaniacs also love Napoleon.
[01:02:16.920 --> 01:02:22.340]   So I'm not saying that there is a massive Venn diagram shaded area
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:24.720]   between tech entrepreneurs and megalomaniacs,
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:30.380]   but liking Napoleon doesn't necessarily mean
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:35.300]   that you're going to be a great tech entrepreneur, shall we say.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.760]   On the point of being a futurist,
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:41.600]   it's really remarkable in your Churchill biography you discuss
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:46.680]   the ways in which he saw the influence of tanks and planes
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.640]   and even nuclear energy far before many others.
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:55.560]   His best friend was the Oxford Professor for Physics,
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:58.380]   Professor Lindemann, and later Lord Charwell.
[01:02:58.380 --> 01:03:00.840]   He was a...
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:04.020]   I mean, when it comes to the people that he had around him,
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:06.880]   he loved having scientists around him.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:12.340]   He said that scientists should be on tap, but not on top.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:17.140]   So he did recognise that he didn't want to have a world run by scientists,
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:20.020]   but he definitely wanted to know what they were thinking.
[01:03:20.100 --> 01:03:23.720]   And as early as the mid-1920s,
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:28.420]   so a good 20 years before the atom bomb,
[01:03:28.420 --> 01:03:31.420]   he talked about how an entire city could be destroyed
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:34.420]   by a nuclear bomb the size of an orange.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:38.380]   And, you know, that was very advanced stuff, frankly.
[01:03:38.380 --> 01:03:44.760]   He, of course, was fascinated by the use of radar in the Second World War,
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:47.020]   especially at the very beginning of the Second World War,
[01:03:47.100 --> 01:03:50.840]   how one could bend the German rays
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.800]   to mean that their bombers were sent off target
[01:03:54.800 --> 01:03:57.720]   and didn't fly over British cities.
[01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.600]   He wanted to get into the real nitty-gritty of all of that.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:08.060]   And, of course, the ultimate sort of mathematical genius machine,
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:14.020]   the Enigma, the ultra machine that wrote the Enigma code.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:17.640]   So in everything to do with that,
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:22.220]   he was also really interested in sort of learning and understanding
[01:04:22.220 --> 01:04:24.600]   the reasoning behind what was going on.
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:30.720]   It's very easy to think of Churchill as a bit of a reactionary figure,
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:34.100]   this sort of tubby Tory with his cigars and his brandy
[01:04:34.100 --> 01:04:38.980]   and wanting to hang on to India and all of these sort of very much
[01:04:38.980 --> 01:04:43.260]   sort of set in the past kind of attitudes and attributes.
[01:04:43.340 --> 01:04:48.180]   But really, he was somebody who was obsessed with the future.
[01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:52.600]   But on the point of Napoleon, it's interesting the way you describe
[01:04:52.600 --> 01:04:55.140]   the way he would micromanage every aspect of the empire.
[01:04:55.140 --> 01:04:59.840]   And obviously, his energy and efficiency reads, honestly,
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.180]   like an Elon Musk biography,
[01:05:02.180 --> 01:05:05.720]   where Elon is micromanaging the engines on his Raptors
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:08.060]   at the same time running these five other companies.
[01:05:08.060 --> 01:05:11.340]   I wonder what you think a person like Napoleon does today.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:14.380]   If that seems that a genes is born today,
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:16.380]   does he become an Elon Musk or does he do something else?
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:18.260]   No, that's exactly what he of course he does.
[01:05:18.260 --> 01:05:22.800]   Absolutely. He goes to Silicon Valley and sets up his own company
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:28.140]   and makes a billion out of finding something useful
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.300]   to advance mankind with.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:33.000]   That's exactly what Napoleon does today.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.100]   And by the way, if he has anything like the same acquisitive techniques,
[01:05:38.180 --> 01:05:42.640]   he probably buys up lots of other companies around him
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:45.900]   in the way that Napoleon invaded country after country.
[01:05:45.900 --> 01:05:47.600]   But when he did invade those countries,
[01:05:47.600 --> 01:05:52.140]   what he would do, for example, in Italy after the Italian campaign,
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:56.560]   and he entered Milan, the first thing he did was to get together
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:02.320]   the Milanese intellectuals, the writers, the scientists,
[01:06:02.320 --> 01:06:05.060]   the chemists, and so on.
[01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:09.720]   He was very interested in astronomy and so on,
[01:06:09.720 --> 01:06:14.360]   and would talk to them about their thing.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:16.900]   So you had an intellectual as leader,
[01:06:16.900 --> 01:06:21.560]   which frankly the Bourbons for the last thousand years of French history,
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:24.560]   it's very difficult to think of more than one or two
[01:06:24.560 --> 01:06:28.600]   genuine intellectuals as ruler.
[01:06:28.600 --> 01:06:31.440]   And so one can understand why he became popular
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:36.100]   amongst the middle class and the intellectuals themselves.
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:38.940]   And he would also, one of the other things he would do
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:41.780]   was to go into every town he went into,
[01:06:41.780 --> 01:06:44.900]   he would go into the ghetto and free the Jews
[01:06:44.900 --> 01:06:48.900]   and give them civil and religious rights and so on.
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:52.360]   And I think that was tremendously forward thinking
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:56.060]   for that day and age as well, and a very attractive feature about him.
[01:06:56.060 --> 01:06:58.520]   You know, obviously the biography of Napoleon,
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:00.440]   a must and tragically,
[01:07:00.440 --> 01:07:04.520]   and I noticed this about many other biographies of great people I read,
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.320]   is often what makes them great in the first place
[01:07:07.320 --> 01:07:10.280]   is they keep making these double or nothing gambles
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:13.240]   that catapult them to the top.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.860]   And then of course, at some point, your luck runs out.
[01:07:15.860 --> 01:07:19.400]   That's obviously oversimplification in every single case.
[01:07:19.400 --> 01:07:21.820]   But I wonder if this is also a pattern you notice
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.440]   in the lives of great figures, you could say for Elon,
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.980]   having his reputation and fortune wasted away
[01:07:28.060 --> 01:07:30.900]   and the author of Twitter could be an example of one such thing.
[01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:33.140]   But what is your reaction to that?
[01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:37.740]   Yes, of course, hubris is the occupational hazard
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:41.440]   of hugely successful people, needless to say.
[01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.360]   I mean, it's probably also the occupational hazard of lots of other people,
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.480]   but we just don't know about it because they're not usually successful.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.320]   But one does tend to get stuck in one's ways.
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:56.400]   One can't necessarily, you know, old dog new tricks.
[01:07:56.480 --> 01:08:01.160]   You can't necessarily reinvent yourself
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:05.240]   and therefore you go down the same old paths.
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:07.320]   I would say in Napoleon's defence, of course,
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:11.400]   not least that idea that when he invaded in 1812,
[01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:14.980]   which is the key moment, you know, after that, nothing good happens.
[01:08:14.980 --> 01:08:18.700]   And before that, lots and lots of good things happen.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.820]   But the key thing about that is that, look,
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.320]   he had beaten the Russians twice before.
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.940]   He was invading with an army of 615,000,
[01:08:27.940 --> 01:08:31.400]   which was the same size as Paris at that time.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.860]   He knew that the Russian army
[01:08:35.860 --> 01:08:39.060]   was only about half the size of his.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:43.280]   And he didn't want to go too far into Russia,
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:45.440]   which, of course, as I mentioned earlier,
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:47.240]   changed in the course of the campaign.
[01:08:47.240 --> 01:08:50.280]   But it wasn't an insane, hubristic, mad decision
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.320]   to go to war against Russia in 1812.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:55.740]   What was hubristic, mad and insane
[01:08:55.740 --> 01:08:59.240]   was to try to beat Britain
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:03.660]   by imposing a continental blockade on the entirety of Europe
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:07.400]   and therefore attempting to sort of crush Britain
[01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:12.780]   by stopping smuggling, which was completely rife,
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:15.740]   and to stop every other country
[01:09:15.740 --> 01:09:19.820]   from entering into free trade with Britain.
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:22.400]   It was that belief in that protectionism
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:25.480]   could somehow win the war against Britain.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:26.660]   That was the mad thing.
[01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:30.080]   And that's what led him into the Peninsula Campaign,
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:32.580]   which cost him a quarter of a million soldiers.
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.620]   Wow.
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:37.120]   Actually, so if you have somebody like Napoleon,
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:40.280]   who for his entire life has succeeded in--
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.620]   who is at the tail end of multiple bell curves,
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:46.860]   succeeded in ways that nobody else is succeeding
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:48.620]   or could anticipate, or people tell him,
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:51.240]   "Well, that's not possible," and he accomplishes it.
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:54.700]   Obviously, he has to take advisors with a grain of salt,
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.320]   knowing that he has been able to do things
[01:09:56.320 --> 01:09:58.080]   that others have not been able to do.
[01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:00.040]   But he also has to recognize his limits.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:01.820]   And this is not just a question of Napoleon in particular,
[01:10:01.820 --> 01:10:03.240]   but just in general.
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:06.040]   How does somebody who is at the tail end
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.620]   of multiple distributions not fall back to mediocrity
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.200]   when making judgments about themselves,
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:13.280]   but also recognize their limits?
[01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:17.660]   It's always a question of choosing the right advisors, isn't it?
[01:10:17.740 --> 01:10:21.200]   In domestic politics, areas that he knew he didn't know
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:24.860]   that much about, legal codes and so on.
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:28.440]   He, although it's called the Napoleonic Code,
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.900]   actually, of course, it was his legal experts
[01:10:30.900 --> 01:10:33.400]   who drew it up and saw it through
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:36.400]   and passed the legislation and so on.
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:39.440]   And so areas that he wasn't particularly interested in,
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:44.520]   he did allow a considerable degree to be decided by--
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:50.360]   not decided by, that's one stage too far, but advised upon.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:53.980]   He was the dictator, he had the ultimate decision.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:59.700]   But he was very good at choosing advisors,
[01:10:59.700 --> 01:11:05.120]   quite regardless of what their status were in society,
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:08.440]   you know, or quite how respectable they were.
[01:11:08.440 --> 01:11:10.440]   There's a man called Cambassière,
[01:11:10.440 --> 01:11:15.740]   who was a truly powerful figure, and he was gay.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.740]   And this was something that was pretty much unknown at that stage,
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:20.860]   he was outwardly gay.
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:23.360]   And at a time when, of course, that was against the law.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:27.320]   But Napoleon didn't mind that because he was so good at his job
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.360]   that he kept him on as arch-chancellor.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:35.200]   Some of the marshals, he was a true believer in meritocracy
[01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:37.860]   and that some of his marshals, there were 26 marshals,
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:42.060]   13 of them came from the working classes,
[01:11:42.060 --> 01:11:45.320]   and in some cases below, they were peasants,
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:49.480]   they were the sons of innkeepers, and barrel coopers,
[01:11:49.480 --> 01:11:52.480]   and domestic servants, and so on.
[01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.440]   And yet, if he saw that a man was lucky,
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.560]   was one of the things he always wanted in his generals,
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:03.400]   but also was a natural leader,
[01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.940]   he would appoint him, and they became marshals.
[01:12:06.940 --> 01:12:08.740]   And all the marshals, apart from a couple,
[01:12:08.740 --> 01:12:13.200]   became dukes and princes, two of them became kings.
[01:12:13.280 --> 01:12:16.400]   You know, to be the son of a barrel cooper
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.820]   and to become a king in the early 19th century
[01:12:20.820 --> 01:12:24.120]   was a truly extraordinary thing in an army
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:29.160]   where, for the last thousand years, certainly,
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:31.820]   your rank and status in life was very much the same
[01:12:31.820 --> 01:12:33.820]   as your father and grandfather.
[01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:34.940]   One thing I found really interesting
[01:12:34.940 --> 01:12:37.700]   in your biographies of Napoleon and Churchill,
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.520]   if I'm remembering correctly,
[01:12:39.620 --> 01:12:44.400]   both of them wrote a novel in their early 20s or thereabouts
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.780]   where they save their country in battle.
[01:12:46.780 --> 01:12:49.620]   Or not they, a character saves their country in battle
[01:12:49.620 --> 01:12:51.360]   and wins over a pretty maiden.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:54.080]   And I remember those details, but I thought,
[01:12:54.080 --> 01:12:55.280]   "Wow, both of them did that?"
[01:12:55.280 --> 01:12:57.000]   That's a really interesting detail.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.160]   What explains this?
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:03.040]   Yes, it's probably a terrible psychological disorder,
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:05.360]   but I've just realized that I did the same thing
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:07.120]   when I was in my 20s.
[01:13:07.200 --> 01:13:10.440]   I had a novel in which I saved the country
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.320]   and married the fair maiden.
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:14.980]   Gosh, I don't know what that makes me.
[01:13:14.980 --> 01:13:18.480]   I'm probably a megalomaniac like Napoleon.
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.740]   But yes, they're both great reads, by the way.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:25.780]   I love Clisson and Eugénie,
[01:13:25.780 --> 01:13:28.280]   the book you're referring to by Napoleon.
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:32.320]   But the best one by far is Savarola by Winston Churchill,
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:35.700]   where you see lots of rolling Churchillian phrases
[01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:39.400]   which come out again and again later on in life.
[01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.120]   And you're right, in both of them,
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:44.200]   they're very, very obviously autobiographical.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:46.480]   And the hero...
[01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.900]   Actually, in Savarola, the hero doesn't...
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:52.320]   He saves the country, but then he goes off into exile.
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.400]   And I think, doesn't the Napoleon figure
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.900]   die heroically in battle after saving the nation?
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.120]   But there's a lot of nation-saving going on
[01:14:02.200 --> 01:14:06.080]   in both of those youthful novels.
[01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:07.900]   Now that we're nearing the end of our time,
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:11.780]   I want to ask you about how is it possible
[01:14:11.780 --> 01:14:14.400]   you're in the House of Lords, I just realized that...
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.740]   Well, I knew you were in the House of Lords,
[01:14:15.740 --> 01:14:17.900]   but I just realized how much of your time that consumes.
[01:14:17.900 --> 01:14:20.440]   On top of that, you're writing these books that are...
[01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:22.200]   You know, your biographies are widely recognized
[01:14:22.200 --> 01:14:24.120]   as the best biographies of these people
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.400]   who have thousands of biographies written about them.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:29.480]   And you're doing... You've written 20 books.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:31.780]   How are you managing your time? How is this possible?
[01:14:31.860 --> 01:14:35.280]   Because I start work at 4 a.m. every day.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:39.400]   You get five hours or so before anyone wants to bother you
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.280]   or, you know, irritate you.
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.740]   And so that's the trick. It's time management.
[01:14:47.740 --> 01:14:50.980]   I have a nap every single day
[01:14:50.980 --> 01:14:53.440]   for about half an hour in the afternoon.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:57.240]   I've been doing it since I was at Cambridge 40 years ago.
[01:14:57.320 --> 01:15:01.200]   And so I've trained my body to switch off
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.780]   and then switch back on again.
[01:15:02.780 --> 01:15:06.560]   And it means that you get two days, essentially,
[01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:10.280]   you know, of work out of one day on Earth.
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.060]   So it's... I mean, obviously,
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.560]   everybody's body clock is completely different.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:18.200]   But I do recommend, if you're young enough to start,
[01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.400]   and as I say, I started when I was in my early 20s,
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:25.600]   you can really squeeze more time out of the day
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:28.480]   than you think is mathematically possible.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:31.780]   Yeah, I'm 23, so this might be a perfect time to launch this habit.
[01:15:31.780 --> 01:15:34.280]   Today's the day. Make sure after lunch,
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.660]   you put on an eye patch and literally go to bed.
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:45.320]   And you will find that you've squeezed an extra day out of the day.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:46.980]   So why is biography,
[01:15:46.980 --> 01:15:49.940]   which is a genre you've employed across many of your books,
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:55.160]   and of course, books that have become overwhelmingly famous, rightly so,
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:58.620]   why is that the best medium to understand an era
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:02.280]   or to understand that impact of the era on the present?
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:07.400]   Because it focuses the mind, concentrates the mind on one person.
[01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:10.700]   You emotionally connect with that person.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:13.860]   You either love him or hate him or her, of course.
[01:16:13.860 --> 01:16:18.200]   I have done some work on writing about women.
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:21.940]   It's the great man and woman theory of history, of course.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:26.360]   And I do believe in that because I think that although, of course,
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:31.680]   there are enormous historical movements that happen,
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:36.060]   you know, the decline of magic and the rise of science and so on,
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:38.980]   the industrialization and everything,
[01:16:38.980 --> 01:16:44.640]   those come about as the result of the deliberate choices
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.940]   made by millions, indeed, billions of people.
[01:16:48.020 --> 01:16:52.400]   And you can't look at something like the invasion of Russia
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:55.100]   we were talking about earlier in 1812,
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:17:00.400]   or Churchill's decision to fight on and not make peace with Hitler in 1940
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:05.720]   and not recognize that the individual does play an absolutely central role
[01:17:05.720 --> 01:17:10.360]   in some major world-changing decisions.
[01:17:10.360 --> 01:17:15.360]   So I think it is intellectually justified to write biography.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:19.180]   A lot of Whigs and determinists and Marxists don't.
[01:17:19.180 --> 01:17:26.680]   They think that biography is far too anti-determinist.
[01:17:26.680 --> 01:17:31.520]   But in fact, you know, what are we but our decisions?
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:35.140]   Man is spirit, as Churchill said.
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:42.060]   And so I think it stacks up as a reasonable way for me to spend my time.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:45.580]   Yeah, indeed. I think that's a great place to close this conversation.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.880]   This was absolutely fascinating.
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:50.800]   And the book, again, I highly recommend it.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:56.260]   It was a really thorough and interesting read about recent conflicts
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:17:59.880]   with insights from not only one of the best historians in the world,
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:04.680]   but also somebody who commanded the two most recent campaigns
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:08.460]   that involved conflicts since World War II.
[01:18:08.540 --> 01:18:14.420]   So the book is Conflict, the Evolution of Warfare from 1945 to Ukraine,
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:17.920]   available at Amazon and fine bookstores everywhere.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:21.840]   -Andrew, thank you so much. -Thank you, Dworkesh. I really enjoyed it.
[01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:25.760]   Hey, everybody. I hope you enjoyed that episode.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:29.760]   As always, the most helpful thing you can do is to share the podcast.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.340]   Send it to people you think might enjoy it, put it in Twitter,
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:35.420]   your group chats, et cetera. It just splits the world.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.960]   Appreciate your listening. I'll see you next time. Cheers.
