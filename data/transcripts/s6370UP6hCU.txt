[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.840]   Is my career in marketing vain?
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.080]   It's a great question and it comes to us frequently.
[00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.360]   What we're going to address today is often reflected in emails that we get from Christians
[00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.960]   who work not only in marketing, but also in the clothing industry and in all facets of
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.560]   the fashion world as well.
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.080]   Here's the question, it's from a young man.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.680]   Pastor John, hello, I'm a long-time listener of yours and appreciate the podcast.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:36.400]   I work at Nike and have often wrestled with my position at the company being that my job
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.240]   is in marketing.
[00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:44.360]   I sell luxury goods to people who don't need them and often who cannot afford them.
[00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.040]   On the other hand, the company gives away millions of dollars as well as shoes and clothing.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.560]   I want to be excellent in my work in glorifying God.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.400]   I also want to honor my managers as those in authority over me.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.040]   But I'm against the consumerist ways of America, and yet I feel I'm in some ways contributing
[00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.320]   to them.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.160]   How do I balance these tensions and continue to work hard with my hands so that I'm not
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.920]   a burden to anyone?
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.920]   Can the products of a humanist company like mine be at all redeemed by the God-glorifying
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:22.240]   work done by their Christian employees, or is a career change needed?
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:30.680]   If I worked in marketing, I would ask myself these five questions, at least.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.000]   First, am I always telling the truth?
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.360]   God is a God of truth.
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.120]   He commanded us to bear witness in the truth, that is, not to bear false witness.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:47.920]   He told us in Ephesians to speak the truth to one another.
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.240]   His apostles said they could do nothing against the truth.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.520]   Christians are radically truth-driven people.
[00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.120]   We really believe there is such a thing as truth, so we should ask regularly, "Is my
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.680]   messaging always truthful?"
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:13.560]   Second, if I succeed in my marketing efforts, am I helping people?
[00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.440]   Am I doing them good?
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.760]   Jesus said that whoever would be great must be the servant of all, which means we seek
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.120]   their good.
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.480]   Paul said, "Let everything be done in love."
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.320]   And he added that love does no wrong to a neighbor.
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:37.960]   So I must ask, "Is my service or is my product doing good for people or hurting them or confirming
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.760]   them in some hurtful pattern of behavior or thinking?"
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.320]   Third, am I in a position to significantly change the way my company does business so
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:55.400]   that people will be helped rather than hurt by what we do and the way we do it?
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.480]   Or is that an unrealistic expectation that given the position I have, I could significantly
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.160]   alter things for the good of this company and what it does?
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:15.920]   Fourth, are my professional efforts and successes magnifying Christ?
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.920]   That is, are what I do and the way I do it and its outcomes showing more clearly that
[00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.760]   Christ is supremely valuable, more valuable than anything?
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.040]   Paul said that was his life's goalâ€”to magnify Christ in his body, whether by life
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.600]   or by death.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:41.680]   He said that he counted everything as loss compared to Christ.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   I don't mean to claim that it is simple or easy in any job to show that Christ is
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:56.040]   more valuable than the job or the salary or the esteem or the benefits or the relationships.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.920]   I don't claim that any of that is easy or obvious, but I do claim that we should ask
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.680]   that question.
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:12.720]   And I do think that in asking it, God will help us get a read on whether we are doing
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.440]   his revealed will in our job.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.120]   Here's the last question, the fifth question.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.720]   Is a different career path or a different vocation open to me where my gifts could be
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.160]   used and these questions could be answered in a more satisfying way?
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:38.680]   I pose this question because I don't want to give the impression that an employee is
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:44.080]   responsible for all the misdeeds of the company he works for.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:50.280]   The more he knows, the more responsible he is; the more power he has, the more responsible
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.280]   he is.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.160]   But I don't think it is automatic that one must leave a job because there is sin in the
[00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.360]   company.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.680]   In 1 Corinthians 7, Paul says that remaining in the position where we were called to Christ
[00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.560]   is the Christian norm.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:11.560]   We are to remain there, it says, with God, with God.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.680]   And that would change a lot of things, but it doesn't necessarily mean you leave the
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.880]   position.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:24.120]   But he also says if the door is open for a change, and you can and you should, then go
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.240]   ahead, seek it.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.720]   So those are my five questions that I would ask myself if I were in marketing.
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.480]   Now let's get more specific.
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:39.760]   Our friend writes and says two things are troubling him, and they should.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:46.840]   He says, "I sell luxury goods to people who don't need them and often can't afford them."
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.640]   And the second thing he says is, "I am against the consumerist ways of America, and yet I
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.440]   feel I'm in some ways contributing to them."
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.960]   So there are two issues here.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:08.380]   One is the objective fact that his marketing effectiveness is confirming people in a sinful
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:15.000]   mindset with regard to money and possessions, so it seems, and the other is that he's aware
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.880]   of it and feels bad about it.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.560]   Now both of those are a problem.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.760]   The second one is a conscience problem.
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.160]   The Bible is very serious about not acting against our conscience.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:33.240]   It's also clear that a conscience can be distorted or needs to be recalibrated according to God's
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.620]   revealed will.
[00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:39.860]   It might be too loose or it might be too tight, and God's word needs to shape the conscience.
[00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:44.960]   But while it's being shaped, while it's being calibrated according to God's word, it should
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:48.080]   also in general be followed.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.200]   To go against your conscience is to say to God, "I don't mind risking displeasing you."
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.760]   That's a very dangerous thing to say.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:58.080]   We ought not say that.
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.160]   We ought not act that way.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:06.760]   Now the other issue, the first one, is more objective and needs to be tested by Scripture.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:12.860]   Is my marketing effectiveness really confirming people in a sinful mindset with regard to
[00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:15.340]   money and possessions?
[00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.500]   And here's what I have found over the years as I've tried to think of my own life, the
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:25.820]   people I minister to, all the different ways we handle money.
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:32.600]   I have found that the most helpful thing in providing guidance and putting a governor
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:39.060]   on the love of money, my love of money, my love of comfort, my love of ease, one of the
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:47.660]   most effective things to put a proper biblical governor on that is not simply to take isolated
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:56.160]   texts here and there and try to figure out precise applications from those texts, which
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:08:01.940]   seems to almost never work because you always come up with some scenario where those texts
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:11.220]   might not be valid here, rather to let the relentless stream of New Testament texts about
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.380]   money wash over me.
[00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.900]   That has a very salutary effect.
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:26.660]   The New Testament is relentless in pushing us toward a wartime simplicity and economy
[00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:32.660]   for the sake of the kingdom and away from luxury and away from affluence and away from
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.220]   finery and opulence.
[00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.660]   Here are some of the passages.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:45.340]   So here's a little bit of the waterfall, the stream that I'm talking about that needs to
[00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.340]   wash over us.
[00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:51.780]   Luke 6, 20, "Blessed are you poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven.
[00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:55.660]   Woe to you rich, for you have received your consolation."
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:02.700]   Luke 8, 14, "They are choked by the cares and riches and pleasures of life."
[00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:07.460]   Luke 9, 58, "The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.
[00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:08.780]   Come follow me."
[00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:15.220]   Luke 12, 15, "A person's life does not consist in his possessions."
[00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:20.660]   Matthew 6, 19, "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, but in heaven."
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:27.620]   Luke 12, 20, "To the bigger barn builder, fool, this night your soul be required of
[00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:28.700]   you.
[00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:33.580]   So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich towards God."
[00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:38.980]   Luke 12, 33, "Sell your possessions, give alms, provide yourselves with purses in heaven."
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:45.060]   Luke 14, 33, "Whoever does not renounce all that he has cannot be my disciple."
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:50.540]   Luke 18, 24, "How hard it will be for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom
[00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:51.540]   of heaven."
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:58.060]   2 Corinthians 8, 2, "In a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:02.980]   extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of liberality."
[00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:06.540]   1 Timothy 6, 7, "We brought nothing into the world.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.020]   We can't take anything out of the world, but if we have food and clothing with these,
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.780]   we will be content."
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:18.420]   Hebrews 13, 5, "Keep your life free from the love of money."
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:21.760]   And the list could go on and on.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:30.780]   And the point of all those texts, I think, is to pose the question, is what we do and
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:38.240]   say about money communicating that Christ is more precious than money?
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:41.060]   His security is better than the security of money.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.000]   His power is better than the power of money.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.660]   His preciousness is better than the preciousness of money.
[00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:54.980]   That's what our life is supposed to say to the world, supposed to communicate.
[00:10:54.980 --> 00:11:04.660]   Samuel Grafton once said, "A penny will hide the biggest star in the universe if you
[00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:08.140]   hold it close enough to your eye."
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:17.260]   So for ourselves and for others, we should ask very seriously, are we putting the penny
[00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:25.740]   so close to our eye and to their eye that the star of God's worth is made harder to
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:27.300]   see?
[00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:31.140]   So important to hear this, and I know this episode will speak to a lot of listeners in
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:36.700]   their given fields of employment who are wrestling with trying to find a career that appeases
[00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:45.580]   the market and also one that serves very real and tangible needs in the lives of their neighbors.
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.580]   It's no small challenge.
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:49.100]   Thank you, Pastor John, for addressing this.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.100]   And thanks for listening.

[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.220]   Well, how should we respond when we feel unappreciated?
[00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:12.580]   It's a question that we all face.
[00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:16.440]   We all want to excel and we all want to be noticed.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:17.780]   We all want to be thanked.
[00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:19.780]   We want our efforts to be valued.
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:21.700]   That's only natural.
[00:12:21.700 --> 00:12:25.900]   And yet instead of telling us to get used to being unappreciated, God actually gives
[00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:33.620]   us some incredible promises that we are being appreciated in ways we may have never, ever
[00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.620]   expected.
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.820]   Pastor John will explain how next time on Wednesday.
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.820]   I'm Tony Reinke.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:39.620]   We'll see you then.
[00:12:39.620 --> 00:12:40.120]   Bye.

[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.120]   Bye.
[00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:46.120]   Bye.
