[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660]   I'm a big fan of the view that top-level athletic performance is super cognitively intense,
[00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.580]   that most top athletes are really extraordinarily smart.
[00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.120]   And I don't just mean smart on the court, though obviously that, but smart more broadly,
[00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.600]   and that this is underrated.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.680]   I think Michelle Dawson was the one who talked me into this, but absolutely, I'm with you
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.680]   all the way.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.680]   Do you think it's just mutational load or like the actual act of--
[00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.800]   I think you actually have to be really smart to figure out how to lead a team, how to improve
[00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.960]   yourself, how to practice, how to outsmart the opposition, all these other things.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.040]   Maybe not the only way to get there, but very G-loaded.
[00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.040]   Interesting.
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.840]   And you certainly see some super talented athletes who just go bust, or they may destroy
[00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.240]   themselves with drugs, or there's plenty of tales like that.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.200]   You don't have to look hard.
