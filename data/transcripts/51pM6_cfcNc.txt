[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.160]   I'd say I started making pretty good money around 16, 17. And it was like, "Oh, this is awesome.
[00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.560]   I'm going to take all my friends to Hawaii. I'm going to Sharper Image and buying all the gear."
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:19.840]   And at some point, my dad gave me the best advice. He said, "I really think you should
[00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.040]   put some of that money away." I was like, "Why?" I said, "It's just going to keep raining down on me."
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.280]   And he said, "Well, you just don't know if this is going to last." Because he really wanted me to go
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.040]   to college. He was like, "If you're going to do this, you should really save from what you're
[00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:48.320]   making here." And so when I was 17, he co-signed a mortgage for a home. I bought a home when I was
[00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:54.000]   17. It was my money, but he co-signed it just because I was not 18. And because you might not
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.720]   have had the income to qualify for a mortgage. No, I did. I had the income to qualify, but I
[00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:04.240]   literally was not old enough to sign the paperwork by myself. Hello, and welcome to another episode
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.880]   of All The Hacks, a show about upgrading your life, money, and travel. I'm your host, Chris
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.120]   Hutchins. And as you can probably see, I have a few skateboards hanging on the wall behind me.
[00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.680]   It's not just because they look cool. I have loved skateboarding since it was a daily habit of mine
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.960]   as a kid, and I still skate a bit today. Well, you probably can't see, but one of those skateboards,
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.800]   this one, is actually signed by Tony Hawk, who I looked up to for so many years when I was skating,
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.840]   which is why it is surreal that I'm sitting down with Tony today for this episode. He's one of the
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.600]   most decorated athletes in the world. He turned pro at 14, and by 16, he was considered the best
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.720]   competitive skateboarder on earth. He was a world champion for 12 years in a row. He launched a
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:50.800]   video game franchise with 30 million games sold. He also runs a skate brand, a nonprofit clothing
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.800]   brand, and has made hundreds of appearances on movies, magazines, and TV shows. We're going to
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.680]   talk about his career, how he pushed himself to achieve things that so many people thought were
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.560]   impossible. We're talking about what lessons we can take away from his career in skateboarding,
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.320]   what he's learned being a parent to four kids, and some of his favorite travel hacks. We also
[00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.040]   shot this in person at his studio, which has an awesome three-camera setup, so I hope you enjoy.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.080]   And since I'm still getting this YouTube channel going, please do me a favor and click the thumbs
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:32.320]   up and subscribe to the channel. All right, let's do this. Tony, welcome to the show.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.800]   Thank you. Yeah, so before we jump in,
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   what is one thing you think most people just don't get about skateboarding or skateboard culture?
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:46.640]   Um, the amount of discipline it takes. I think that there's still a stigma that skaters,
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.880]   especially people who make their living from skateboarding or from riding their skateboards,
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   are slackers, are stoners. They just get up late, they do what they want, they go trespassing,
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:04.720]   they go skate. And to get to a certain level of skating, to get to some of the more difficult
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:14.080]   maneuvers, it takes years of discipline and perseverance, pain. And I think that that's lost
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:21.760]   in the noise of these guys are, they're rebels, they got crazy hairdos, you know, they go against
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:28.720]   the grain. It's like those things are also true in a lot of ways, but they do that out of, it's
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.320]   more out of function of where they came from, because especially in the early 90s, mid 90s,
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   there were no places to skate. And you had to break into places, you know, you had to hop fences
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.320]   and go to schoolyards or go to, go to plazas to, to find any type of terrain.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.840]   And then skaters got labeled as, as outcasts and outlaws through that.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.000]   Yeah. I remember flipping over like Shays lounges at the pool and trying to grind the,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.160]   the like rails on there. Like there was, there was nothing to do back then. Um,
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.360]   I know you have a lot of discipline, right? You talk about how important it was
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.800]   going back to the early days. Was there anything about your upbringing that kind of drove that
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:18.960]   competition and determination? I was just always very determined. That's my, that was my,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.480]   my mom's best explanation for it because people would say I was a terror and I was a nightmare
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.880]   and I was relentless. And she's like, he's just very determined. And that was her nice way of,
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:35.360]   of summarizing my behavior. But I think that I wanted to figure things out and,
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.600]   and I was going to do it at all costs. Like I wanted to, I mean, I play baseball and basketball,
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.680]   but I didn't thrive and only because of my size, you know, I was committed to it and I was,
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:52.080]   I was doing the work and I was trying to get in the mix, but I just, I didn't have the,
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.120]   the strength or the, or the height to really make a difference.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:59.280]   Um, cause I was really small for my age. And then when I found skating,
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:04.800]   I still had the same disadvantage, but there was something about it that was much more creative
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:11.520]   that I enjoyed. It wasn't, it wasn't a team sport. I didn't have to, I didn't have to listen to a
[00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.720]   coach or, or rely on the team. And, and there was something about that that spoke to me, but also
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:25.120]   just the, the, the whole culture and how people's attitudes was, was very do it yourself and they
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.760]   were proactive and I loved it. I know you said it's not a team sport, but there were a lot of
[00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:33.600]   other people involved. There were a lot of other skaters. It wasn't, it wasn't that,
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:38.880]   that it was so individualistic that it was like, I'm just on my own mission. I love the community
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:44.320]   of it. I love that you could go to the skate park and be trying to learn something. And suddenly
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.280]   people rally around you because they just want to see you succeed. And then you have the support.
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:56.880]   And like, in that sense, you have a team, but you're not, you're, you're not relying on each
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.200]   other for the, for the, the, I don't know, coordination or anything like that. You know,
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.600]   it was very much like, like, you could do it. You got it. All right. And then, and then someone else
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.280]   is trying something else and then you, you get behind that. And, and I, and I think that spoke
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:19.600]   to me a lot too, because I was, you know, I was, I was really small for my age. I didn't feel like
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.960]   I fit in anywhere. I was, I was bullied a lot, mostly because of my size, but also just because
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.240]   I was, you know, not, I was not the cool kid. And then when I found skateboarding, there were
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:35.200]   a bunch of people like me all trying to find their way and, and they, they all connected through
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.160]   skateboarding. Yeah. I, I look back to my childhood and I remember like those days I was not the cool
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   kid. I was like the computer nerd and skateboard nerd. And you know, you found our tribe, if you
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.240]   will. Yeah. I didn't have, I think the determination you did. I remember all I wanted was to skate at
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.520]   like an amazing level and it just never clicked for me. I found determination other places later
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.400]   in life, but it was so hard. You, I've seen, you know, documented, fortunately, a lot of your
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:10.800]   experiences in life are documented against all odds, against all pain. You know, I, I remember
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:16.800]   watching the X games in, in 99, where you're trying to do your 900 is, you know, 12 times in a row,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:23.200]   falling, falling, even this year, trying to kick flip for five, 10 minutes after surgery. Like,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:29.040]   what do you think allows you to go and just keep going? Because I remember sitting in the garage,
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.000]   trying to kick flip for hours. And then I just, I just gave up at some point and I just couldn't
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.800]   keep going. I think firstly, that I have convinced myself that whatever it is I'm trying is possible.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.160]   And so I just have to figure out the right approach to make it so. And that,
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:54.400]   that comes in a lot of forms. But, but I do feel like, especially if I go to try a new trick,
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:08:00.800]   it's like, I have every element of this trick. I know how to spin. I know how to flip my board. I,
[00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:05.840]   I have landed in similar fashions. So it's like, how do I combine all those elements to make this
[00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:12.240]   one thing work? And I think I, I rely on that so much that I'll, I'm willing to push through
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:18.000]   pain and exhaustion to get there. It doesn't always work. I mean, like when you talk about,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.480]   you know, you saw the 900 was 12 tries. Those 12 tries are representative of thousands of tries.
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:32.480]   I tried that trick for 10 years. So 12 tries was nothing. You know what I mean?
[00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:35.920]   There was a 12 I got to witness. No, but I'm saying, but, but you, but,
[00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:40.080]   but I understand that if people saw that from the outside, they're like, Oh, he won't give up.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:44.240]   And I was like, yeah, you have no idea how deep that not give up goes, especially for
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:51.680]   that particular move. Um, I would try dozens of tries in one session only to walk away with a
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.800]   broken rib. So heal up and come back and do it again, heal up and come back and try again.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:01.360]   Actually after the broken rib that put me on pause that, that one, I had actually stepped
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   away from that trick after getting hurt like that. Um, and at some point thought
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.960]   I've given it everything I have, I've fully committed to it and that's what happens. So
[00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:17.440]   maybe it's not in the cards at the time. Did you think I'm quitting on this endeavor or I did?
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.600]   Yeah, actually after, after I broke my rib, I was like, I, I had every element, I had every piece
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.720]   of it. I had the landing, I had everything. And so if it didn't work, it's never going to work.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:34.560]   But in that one instance at the X games, the reason I even tried it was because it was the
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.280]   best trick event. I had a trick in mind for what I wanted to do that I had made once before.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.240]   And so I thought I'm just going to try it. That's my best trick. I'm going to try to get to that
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.240]   trick. And I got to it very early. So I didn't really have anything else planned. And so the
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:56.720]   announcer actually at the time, the announcer that was on site said, Oh, let's see one of those 900
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.040]   attempts. That's what, that's what started it. Was that part of your being was being encouraged
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:07.840]   by others or was it internal motivation? No, I mean, I, I think that I probably would have
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.240]   tried it anyway. Cause it's like, yeah, that, that would be my next trick that I'd like to
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:21.200]   accomplish would be the next best trick for sure. Um, and so I tried it more to appease the crowd,
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:25.760]   like, Oh, this is what, this is what it looks like. And then somewhere around the third or
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.240]   fourth try, my, my speed was consistent. My spin was consistent. I started spotting the landing.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:36.880]   And in previous attempts, I only ever spotted the landing, maybe one out of five tries
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:42.080]   because the ramps were all pretty terrible back then. You couldn't, you couldn't rely on the speed
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:49.920]   or they weren't, they weren't, um, uh, the walls weren't the same. So you're always kind of
[00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:56.480]   struggling to adjust. And that ramp was built really well. So I didn't have to struggle with
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:02.080]   the, with the construction. It was more like I could rely on the speed and the, the trueness of
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:07.520]   it. So, so after about my fourth, third or fourth try that I'm, I can see it. I see it every time I
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:12.800]   might as well try to make it again. And when I did try to make it the first time, when I tried
[00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   to put it on the wall, I fell forward, but I didn't fall forward so hard that I got hurt again.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.840]   And that was the key because it was like, Oh, maybe I can adjust, I can adjust the landing
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:34.400]   and I can try to get more in my back foot. And then I, I turned, I made, I basically shifted
[00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.680]   my weight mid spin so that when my landed, I was more on the back foot and I was too far on the
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:47.680]   back foot. And then I shot at backwards. We call that shooting out. Um, so the first one, I was
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.480]   too top heavy. I fell forward the second one, the ones I tried to make. And then that next one I
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:57.200]   shot out. And it was like, that, that was the magic moment because it was like, well, split the
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:01.920]   difference and that's it. And then that's when it worked. Wow. So, so it sounds like you, you've
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.120]   gotten close to giving up, but are there things that someone listening, let's say someone listening
[00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:11.040]   is hearing this story. They're like, this guy's not afraid of anything. Are there other, other
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:16.240]   sports, other things in life that you're, that you have fear from? Oh, for sure. I like, I surf
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:21.280]   and I don't like big surf. I don't, people say, you know, you ride these giant ramps. Yeah. But
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:27.280]   if I fall, the giant ramp doesn't crash on top of me and hold me underwater. You know what I mean?
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:33.680]   That's I, I, I just never, my brother was, he is a surfer. Um, and that's how I got into
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.640]   skateboarding, my older brother. And, um, but when I would go surf with him and he wanted,
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:42.560]   like, he's, he has plenty of experience. He'd go out to pretty heavy stuff. And it's just like,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:48.640]   I don't that I like riding a big wave, but I don't, I don't want to suffer the consequences
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:54.320]   of falling on one. I mean, having my first experience surfing was a friend of mine took
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:12:57.920]   me and he was like, let's just try these on a short board. I had no idea what I was doing.
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:03.360]   Yeah. Not, not a great first experience on a short board. Uh, and then the next one was like
[00:13:03.360 --> 00:13:07.520]   Hawaii long board, super chill. I was like, Oh, I could get back into this. Well, I'll tell you,
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.960]   I have since I have surfed through my years because my brother wouldn't allow me to exist
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:19.040]   without at least a foot, a foot or a toe in the water, so to speak. But I, um, have, I have fallen
[00:13:19.040 --> 00:13:27.600]   in love with the wave machines, the wave pools, because they are consistent. Um, they're not
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:35.680]   too scary. Um, and they are like skate parks because when you go surfing out in the wild,
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:40.480]   you never really know what you're going to get, right? You get waves and sometimes they're good.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:45.200]   Sometimes they're not good. Um, you've got to figure out kind of how to navigate nature and
[00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:50.800]   where the swell is going to hit. Those things are, the waves are always good. They're, they're always
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:57.200]   going to barrel. And so in that sense, you have what, what I consider a skate park to try to learn
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:02.640]   tricks and try to learn techniques. So yeah, I get it. It's not like, it's not the purest thing.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:09.440]   It's not, you're not out in nature, but, um, but for me, it's just a controlled environment and it
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:14.160]   very much feels like skateboarding. Yeah. I've been waiting for a time where I'm near one of
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:18.560]   these wave parks because I don't think there's one near, near San Francisco, at least close enough.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:26.480]   Uh, Lamore Fresno. Okay. Not go out for a few hours and then come back. Uh, yeah. Yeah. Um,
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:31.520]   so you've got this crazy determination with skateboarding. Did you ever figure out or,
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:36.400]   or do you know the secret to applying that to something else? I think for my personal life,
[00:14:36.400 --> 00:14:40.800]   there are things where I'm like, I'm wildly obsessed with optimizing travel.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.720]   And, but that doesn't mean that I can take that same thing and apply it necessarily
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:48.720]   to go learn a kickflip though. You've somewhat inspired me to do that as soon as I get home today.
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:54.720]   I think I learned the value of, of patience and perseverance and that I've, I've transcended
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:03.920]   to being a parent, to being a business owner, to, to travel, to, you know, pretty much everything.
[00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:08.880]   I learned all that through skating. And is there a way that you applied that? I,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.800]   you know, it's, it's not always natural for someone who's, I could do this as hard. I could
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.240]   try everything and then they get to work and they're like, Oh, it's hard. Like, how do you
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:19.920]   rewire your brain to say, Oh, well, I know how to do this with skateboarding. Um, I think this
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:27.120]   is more of that. Yeah. And also, also trying to, uh, trying to reach back to remembering, well,
[00:15:27.120 --> 00:15:33.280]   how, how was I able to figure this out? And I, I don't know a good example. I think that
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:39.200]   with parenting, especially it's so easy to get frustrated and give up. It really is like,
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:43.920]   you know, I, I get it. It's hard, man. When, especially when your kids are relentless and
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:49.600]   they're difficult and you want to just be like, you know, you, you want to just yell and you can't,
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.280]   that's not effective. And so you've got to figure out how to sort of change your approach
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:02.480]   and to see what is effective. And that is really hard. And so, but I learned that through skating
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:08.320]   and I learned, and I've had plenty of kids, so I've had time to figure it out even more so.
[00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:13.680]   Um, but I think that it's, it's just more that I, and I learned the value of persistence
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:19.280]   and determination and you do see the results eventually, but they're not, it's, it's not some,
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:25.120]   it's not some wow moment always. Yeah. You know what I mean? You've got to sort of see,
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:30.400]   you, you, you take your wins, your small wins as long the way.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.560]   I'm early on the parenting journey with one at two and six months, but
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:39.760]   I've seen some small wins and it's like, Oh yeah. And those, and those, um,
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:44.960]   they're exponentially get better. Yeah. And you can see that, Oh, well I planted the seed.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.160]   I'll tell you what I did with all my kids early on. And it was hard. Cause I was, you know,
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:57.120]   very much in the early days, kind of a single parent. Um, I just travel with them in a way.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:02.000]   It wasn't a question of like, Oh, I gotta go. I'm going to have to find care. It was, we're going.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.920]   And in the beginning that was super hard, especially when they're, when they're toddlers
[00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:10.400]   and you know, they, they don't have patients. We didn't have iPhones or anything like that. So it
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:15.440]   was more like, all right, we're like, I remember I took my son, my oldest son. I took him to Japan
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.920]   when he was four, because I had the opportunity to do some skate demos. No one was paying me to
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:26.080]   skate demos at the time I was struggling to pay bills. And it was like this, this, uh, brand in
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:31.360]   Osaka said, Oh, we want you to come to our skate shop and do two skate exhibitions a day in the
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:36.400]   skate shop. So they built these little, these little ramps in their skate shop, like moved all
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:44.480]   their inventory. And, um, and I brought him along and yeah, it was challenging, but, but, but it
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:51.040]   made him appreciate different cultures and travel and things like that later on. And it wasn't even
[00:17:51.040 --> 00:18:01.600]   a, like nowadays he's 30 now, um, he's adventurous. Um, he understands and, and is, I hate using the
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.440]   word tolerant, but, but he is embraces other cultures and other ways of life. You know what
[00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:11.840]   I mean? It's, it's, it's not like everything's so, Oh, it's weird. It's crazy. This food or
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:18.720]   the way they do things. He's, he's down for it. Yeah. I think in the moment, we just took a trip
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:23.600]   with two kids, two, two and two and six months. And it's brutal. But you, you think, why are we
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.440]   doing this? And you got to constantly remind yourself, well, there's a reason we're doing
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:32.080]   this. We're doing this. I think in those, in those years, it's super hard because it's like,
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:37.440]   they're not going to remember any of this, but it does set a precedent and it sets a way of, of
[00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:44.480]   functioning with your family that they get used to. And you'll see other kids try to do that.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:47.920]   Like eventually they're going to want to bring friends along. The friends are like, what? I
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:54.640]   don't, I can't, where do we go? What do we do? And you'll, your kids will be dialed in. Yeah.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:19:00.400]   Even adapting ourselves, getting comfortable with, okay, well, traveling in London with two kids is
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:05.280]   very different from two single adults. And so like, we're trying to get comfortable with that,
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:10.480]   which was hard. And I think it, it worked really well. I know you've said, you know,
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:16.480]   skateboarding is a title, but your favorite title is parenting or dad. Um, is there anything else
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:21.600]   you were trying to teach your kids that to give them that determination? Do they have it? Did they
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:27.680]   see it from you? I think they see it from me by example, but, but I do feel like there is a bit
[00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:35.760]   also nature over nurture where I see them and they're all different. And a couple of them have
[00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:40.160]   that relentless determination and they're going to see it through against all odds, against all
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:50.000]   injury. Um, uh, one of them was actually kind of so, so determined and so fearless that I worried
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:55.920]   for him when he was young. I used to say I was my son Keegan, but I used to say like, you don't go,
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:20:00.960]   you don't babysit Keegan. You go on death watch. You're just trying to keep him from, from hurting
[00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:04.800]   himself because he doesn't understand the consequences of all the stuff that he's trying to
[00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:13.120]   do. Um, so they're all, they're all very different, but, but I do see that they do have that same
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:19.040]   sense of commitment. And was that a conscious thing or do you think it was just by watching
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:23.440]   you have it yourself? Well, I, that's what I said. I think, I think the, the, each of them are
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.760]   different, but they all do see them see their challenges through. Some are just a little more
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:35.200]   daring with their challenges. And I can't say they got that from me. I mean, maybe they,
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:40.240]   they saw that I would, I would pose a challenge and then I would see it through for sure.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.360]   But like I said, they, you know, there was one, like some, my kids were really,
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:51.440]   really good skaters, really solid, um, had the foundational skills, but didn't really want to
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:58.560]   push their limits too hard or put themselves in danger. And then other ones, one especially was
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:03.840]   not great at skating early on, didn't want to put in the hard work to get the foundational skills,
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:11.680]   but would try anything and get hurt. Didn't care. And were you there pushing or supporting,
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:15.040]   or what was your kind of role to help them kind of grow and evolve?
[00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:22.400]   It's, it's hard with my position because of course I'm, I'm qualified to give them advice,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.440]   but because I'm dad, they don't want to hear it. And I actually have seen it happen time and time
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:32.720]   again, where I'll, I'll tell them to try something or to do it a different way. They don't take my
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:36.480]   advice because they're determined to do it their way. One of their friends is like, Oh, you should
[00:21:36.480 --> 00:21:41.680]   put your foot over here more. And they do it and it works. Like, that's what I told you.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.840]   I feel like the same applies with spouses as well.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:52.880]   Maybe a little bit. Um, but, but, uh, but they do it. And honestly, it's, it's fun too,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.000]   cause they all skate. And, um, so when we go travel and they're all adults now, my, all of
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.320]   our boys, uh, two are still in college, um, three are on their own. And then my daughter's the only
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:09.200]   one still at home. She's 14. So whenever we travel, um, you know, they're, they're very
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.920]   self-sufficient, but the, what they want to do when we go places to go to the skate parks.
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:18.320]   And at some point he was like, you guys, can I get a break from skating maybe?
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:24.720]   So I ended up going with them as their filmer. That's my role. And we travel together.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:28.560]   We actually talk a lot about travel on the show. I'm imagining you've been to,
[00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:31.760]   I don't know, countless countries. I don't, I don't know if you even keep track.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.280]   Is there a favorite? Is there, are there places that you love going and going back to that,
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.960]   you know, aside from just the skating, there might inspire people listening to.
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:49.360]   I, I, Iceland is amazing because it's, the landscape is so diverse. I can't explain it,
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:54.400]   but you, like, you go there as soon as you leave the airport, it looks like you're on the moon.
[00:22:54.400 --> 00:23:01.040]   And there's just all of these, all of this, um, moss covering these rocks and there's the blue
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:09.280]   lagoon. And, and then as you drive South, it completely changes into like, uh, almost like
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.840]   a farm setting. And then, and then it changes again, like another half hour into the drive.
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:19.760]   And, and, um, yeah, I mean, it can get really cold there, but it's really, it's an amazing place. Um,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:26.560]   and so my wife and I went there a long time ago, almost, almost 15 years ago now,
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:34.160]   and it felt very untapped. Definitely wasn't a tourist destination. And now it feels much more
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:39.920]   like there is tourism, but if you just drive out of the city, you can see some amazing sites.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:44.160]   My general rule is if you go, not when everyone else goes and leave a little bit
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.160]   outside, you can have a very different experience. Yeah, we're not afraid to,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:54.400]   to go way off the beaten path, um, which we do a lot. Uh, other than that, Japan is just so,
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:24:02.000]   so surreal. It feels like a video game. I, we just did an episode on Japan and
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:08.320]   we, the episode was like three, we were like three hours in and we covered Tokyo and Kyoto,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:13.920]   like with, and Japan couldn't even get kind of close to comprehending the entire country. And
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:18.240]   the guy I was talking to had been there 20 times or something. And like, he's just still like
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:23.040]   every, everywhere I go, I see something new. So every time. Yeah. And, and we, we brought our
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.400]   kids when they were all, I brought all of them when they were pretty young, but we brought them
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:33.200]   all when they were, you know, just before they were teenagers and they were all mesmerized.
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:39.680]   Like it was fascinating. Even, even the, the, even Disneyland is, you know, it's still the
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:44.720]   magic kingdom, but it's very different. Japan's one of the coolest places. Uh, early on,
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:50.480]   you traveled a lot as a skater before you'd hit the kind of success you've had now. I gotta ask
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:55.760]   a question. I know everyone is thinking because multiple people said I should ask, uh, were you
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.680]   racking up all these miles? Cause I know you weren't, you weren't making a lot, uh, in the
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   early days, uh, especially in that kind of mid part of your career. What was that like? You know,
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.200]   you were tall, you started getting tall, uncomfortable. We're using points where
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:14.800]   you're trying to get status upgrades. I, I honestly, I didn't, I didn't fly first class
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   until I was in my thirties. Were you optimizing things when you traveled thinking, okay, I'm gonna
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:26.080]   rack up a bunch of miles. Um, yeah, but also just, I just learned how to travel more efficiently and,
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:34.480]   and a little bit lighter and, um, and how to navigate airports and lines and, and, you know,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:40.080]   where the best security checkpoint is instead of the one where everyone's just being fed into
[00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:45.680]   just stuff like that. Um, I guess I learned how to, how to be a better traveler in those days,
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:51.920]   but I'd learned the value of, of frequent flyer miles through those years when, when, especially
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:59.760]   when, um, when I wasn't making very much money, but I had, did have still have to travel to go do
[00:25:59.760 --> 00:26:06.240]   stuff. Um, I collected a lot of miles. Yeah. I mean, I was a million miler on United very early
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:13.280]   on. Yeah. You know what they sent me for that luggage? That was going to be my guest. Like,
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:20.000]   it's not a very rewarding, rewarding experience. So here you go. 10 bucks. Yeah. Um, what would,
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.080]   what would some of the things, if you were telling your favorite travel hacks to how you make your
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:28.160]   life efficient when you travel, whether it's, you know, a secret neck pillow or some crazy,
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:34.480]   you know, I mask. Um, well, let's see. I just, I just flew home from New York
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:41.840]   and it was last minute. And so I'm in the bulkhead. Um, I do, I do like, I don't know. It's not,
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:47.680]   it's not some great hack, but if you want to travel with your laptop or anything else,
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:51.040]   cause you know, you have to put your backpack up in the overhead. We're getting into the weeds
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:57.280]   here. But if you're in the, if you're in the bulkhead, take your laptop out and put it right
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:02.400]   under your feet so that half of it's kind of under your, your own seat. And then the other half,
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.680]   you just kind of lightly put your heels on it. It'll hide it from the flight attendants.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:12.560]   And then you have your laptop, you don't have to go up and get it, which is like laptop sleeves.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:16.080]   I like to get like a black one. Cause then it just blends in everywhere. Yeah. I'm pretty
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.920]   good at just hiding it all together. Um, and then usually like I'll have a little bag. It's
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:29.360]   actually my toiletry kit. And then I just stuff like my headphones and my, uh, iPhone cable,
[00:27:29.360 --> 00:27:32.720]   you know, everything you need, everything I need, but just put that and then put that on
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.520]   the side of the seat. So then I'll see that either. That's my bulkhead hack for you.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:42.880]   Um, but as far as other travel, I think I learned also just to,
[00:27:44.480 --> 00:27:50.000]   you know, I I'm, it's not like I carry some big wardrobe or anything, but I do try to
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:57.680]   keep it down to a carry on in a backpack. If I can't at all costs, cause I don't want to check
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:03.520]   bags. I can't, I'll tell you that the biggest travel hacks for skateboards and, you know,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:08.480]   people, people will travel with skateboards, but you can travel with the skateboard and put it in
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:15.920]   the overhead anywhere in the U S if you're, if you're making a connection, say in Frankfurt or
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:27.360]   London, um, or, uh, even Tokyo, you, is it Tokyo? Yeah. You can't carry your skateboard on the plane
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:36.320]   through those airports. So I have been told, uh, I've, I've been told a couple of times I've
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:40.320]   actually gotten away with it once, but, um, and I learned, learned the hard way, like going through
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:46.240]   London, you're in the terminal, you're connecting, right. But you know how they have to, you have to
[00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:51.280]   go through another, um, uh, security checkpoint. You can't bring your skateboard. So you have to
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:57.360]   go outside the airport on a connecting flight and check it in. And probably miss your flight. Maybe.
[00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:01.600]   Oh yeah. Yeah. No, I've actually thrown a skateboard away because of that. Yeah. In London,
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:04.960]   they said, Oh, you got to check it out. I don't have time. They go, well, I don't know what to
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:11.840]   tell you. And then I, I put it in the trash can at the security checkpoint. Okay. I think it's a
[00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.480]   safety risk. I think it's a weapon or I assume. Yeah. I mean, also Mexico too, surprisingly,
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:23.200]   you can't carry a skateboard on the airplane in Mexico. So every time we travel with the kids,
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:28.880]   Mexico, we've got to put them all in plastic bags. So we're just this, we're a disaster coming back
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:34.400]   cause we're just a bunch of luggage. Um, so yeah, that's my, that's my advice. I don't know if it's
[00:29:34.400 --> 00:29:38.480]   a hack, it's just my advice. Like if you're going to travel through Europe, don't carry your
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:44.320]   skateboard onto the plane that is connecting. That could probably apply to other items. There
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:49.600]   are some, I can't remember, not that it's the end of the world to replace things like nail scissors,
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.120]   but there's some nail clippers. There's some country where you can't bring nail clippers on
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:58.720]   your plane. Cause I remember, or if it has that like slide out file and I've definitely gotten
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:04.880]   dinged on that. So I would say if the hack is to look up, what are the security requirements for
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:11.040]   the country you're transiting through? Uh, or, you know, I try at all costs to fly direct just
[00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:15.600]   to avoid these problems when possible. Oh yeah, absolutely. Yeah. Um, yeah,
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.920]   there used to be, I live in San Diego, but I live in North County and you used to be able to fly
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:26.560]   from Carlsbad airport to LAX. And so basically you could go anywhere from LAX. Right. So that
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:33.360]   was always like the best way to do it. But, um, many times our Carlsbad flight would be canceled
[00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:37.440]   and we just have to drive, you know, literally drive to Carlsbad airport, like a couple of flights
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:45.760]   canceled. Just keep going North to LAX. Um, but, uh, yeah, it's funny with the, with the skateboard
[00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:52.800]   thing. I remember, so my wife and I usually carry our skateboards when we go places. Cause we like
[00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:58.000]   to, we like to skate around cities, you know, just as transportation, um, if we're going by ourselves
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:06.320]   and we're coming back from, oh man, I can't remember where somewhere. Um, and I think we
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:15.040]   were coming back from Brazil maybe. And we were coming through the, um, where you hand them your
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:21.200]   customs form. And the guy, I'll never forget this. He grabbed my customs form and he saw
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.760]   my skateboard in his peripheral. And immediately it was like, go that way to secondary.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:33.120]   Cause he saw my skateboard. It was so obvious the way that his, you know what I mean? Like I
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.800]   just saw his wheelchair and like, oh, he's a problem. He's a skateboarder. And he looked up
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:42.480]   and he saw my face and he recognized it, but he'd already handed me this red card to go to secondary.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.360]   And he goes, oh, oh, you know what? Just tell them you're in a hurry. I said, oh, is that going to
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.720]   work for me? You're sending me to secondary where they're going to go through all my stuff. And I'm
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.760]   going to tell him I'm in a hurry. That's probably not the best approach. And then my wife and I
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:59.200]   got into secondary. They wouldn't let us go to the bathroom. They wouldn't, you know, we were like,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:05.840]   we were very much, um, uh, being interrogated. Yeah. I mean, you've, you've told lots of
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   stories. I'll, I'll encourage anyone here to go check out the internet for all the stories of
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.680]   you getting recognized as other people. Uh, is there a good one? You don't care.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:23.200]   Yeah. Um, yeah, I, I, it still happens all the time. And it's weird now because obviously,
[00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:31.680]   as you would know that, that, that meme kind of took off, um, or not the meme, but just me
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:38.640]   telling my story, like all the stories that tell it are absolutely true. 100%. Um, but it started
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:42.800]   happening. So it would happen pretty frequently and I was sharing it. And at some point people
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:47.040]   thought I was making it up. So I kind of stopped sharing these incidents because people were just
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:53.120]   like, come on, like, really? But now it's gotten to the point where it's like this, this vicious
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:33:00.080]   cycle where people now want to say it, even though they know who I am all the time. So I would say
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.160]   that happens probably three times a day. That, that interaction, like anyone ever tell you,
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:12.320]   you look like Tony Hawk. Yup. And you're the first today. Um, but then, but then it happens
[00:33:12.320 --> 00:33:18.160]   genuinely at least once or twice too. And the, when it happens genuinely, if people were following me
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.640]   around, they wouldn't believe it. Cause you know what I mean? Like they just, they hear about it
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:28.160]   and it's just like, all right, like enough with this non, you know, this, this whole, um, I don't
[00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:36.080]   even know what you call it. Mistaken identity thing. Yeah. But the, so yes, it still happens.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:42.640]   It happens as a joke. It happens for real. The, the, I think my favorite one as of late was that
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:50.240]   I was sitting at a gate and this guy was sitting across from me at the gate. Um, and he, he looked,
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.400]   he came over, he's a man, you know, you look just like Tony Hawk. He said, oh yeah, I know. I've
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:34:00.080]   heard that. He's like, it's crazy. And then he went and sat back down and then a group of people
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:07.200]   came who did recognize me for real and wanted autographs and pictures. And the whole time he's
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:14.800]   watching me laughing because he's in on the joke that it's not really me. Do you know what I mean?
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:20.000]   Like he and I are sharing this inside joke somehow that these people are crazy and they're mistaken,
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:24.880]   but he just thought it was hilarious. Did you ever tell him at the end? Or did he ever? No,
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.760]   I don't. I, I just, it's up to them to, you know what I mean? To either decide that or to ask me,
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:35.840]   it drives my daughter crazy because a lot of times people will say it until you look like Tony Hawk.
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:39.520]   I'm like, yeah, they, yeah. And it's, that's cool. And they walk away and my daughter's like,
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:44.320]   why didn't you tell him? I go, he didn't ask. So if someone asks, you'll say, yeah, of course. Yeah.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.880]   All right. Well, I hope whoever was sitting across from you at the airport is listening
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.800]   and they can finally come to terms with the fact that that was way more fun in his mind,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.600]   making fun of people. Yeah. Like that was, that was his thing. So I just let him run with it.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:04.560]   So to round out travel, you know, I'm sure you buy lots of things. Do you, do you play the points
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.960]   game? Do you try to rack up points or cash back on credit cards to travel for free still?
[00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:18.320]   Yes. I, I try to, well, I try to focus in on, you know, one or two airlines or their partners so
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:25.520]   that I rack up the most points on, on them which is for the most part United and Delta. But also
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:35.120]   all my credit card purchases go towards miles. And so I use those for my team. So for instance,
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:42.320]   we have the skater Felipe Nunez from Brazil. You might've seen him. He's a double amputee
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:47.040]   and he skates with he skates like kind of sitting on his board, but he's amazing.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.400]   It's crazy. I'll find a link to it and put it in the show notes.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:55.840]   Like truly deserves to be a pro skater. Like he is incredible and has only gotten better,
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.280]   but it's tricky because he lives in a really small town, a couple hours from Sao Paulo. So
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:08.240]   in Curitiba, so for me to get him flights is always really tricky and challenging, but I do it
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:16.560]   using my visa points and I can get him his flights all the time. So anybody, he has to travel with
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:21.680]   kind of a handler and it's a whole thing. But that's, and I use that for his flights. I use
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:25.760]   him for my other skaters flights if they need to get somewhere for a skate trip or whatever. And,
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:30.240]   and it's been, it's been awesome. Yeah. I'm, I'm always, everyone's always
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.160]   surprised that it seems like no matter how successful you are, no matter how famous or
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:37.840]   rich or whatever you are, everyone still wants to make sure that when they're spending money
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:41.200]   on their card, they're getting like the most they can out of their rewards.
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:48.480]   Yeah. And I, and also, I mean, just with, with me, sometimes other groups, uh, do my travel.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:52.880]   If I'm going to an event, I do a lot of speaking gigs, um, corporate gigs and whatnot and
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:58.160]   conferences. And so sometimes it's up to them to do the travel and they don't plug in my,
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.480]   my advantage number or my, you know, my mileage plus number or whatever. And
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:09.040]   it's, it's such a hassle. Like it's, it's, it all seems so frivolous, but it's important
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:13.200]   because it's like, you get in it, you can go to a different line, you know what I mean?
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:17.440]   For security or whatever it is. And, and there's just some efficiency to it. And when you travel
[00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:22.480]   as much as I do, those things count for a lot. Yeah. I know someone who's like, they're part of
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.640]   their rider for speaking is like, I will book my flights and you will reimburse me because
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.040]   I just don't usually what we do, but, but every once in a while it slips through the cracks.
[00:37:31.040 --> 00:37:35.440]   Yeah. Uh, well, if anyone's listening, if you ever take a flight and you didn't put your number in,
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:39.040]   you can actually retroactively ask for credit. So if you're ever forget, yes,
[00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:43.200]   uh, the airlines do allow you to do that. It's better to do it at a ticket counter though.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:46.960]   Yes. They can do it fast. They can do it immediately. That's the other thing is,
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:52.880]   is people like they wield such great power at the ticket counters. They could literally just
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:58.640]   put you on a flight to London first class without blinking an eye. If, if they wanted to.
[00:37:58.640 --> 00:38:03.440]   It always amazes me when someone's flight, something happened and they're yelling at this
[00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:08.800]   person. And I'm like, you realize the person that holds the keys to whatever your situation will be
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:15.440]   is that person who is not responsible for your delay or for your seat mix up.
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:19.920]   I think just being nice to the person at the desk and can pay dividends on.
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:25.520]   So absolutely. Yeah, no, I agreed. Yeah. I I've never scored this kind of mythical.
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.960]   We're just going to upgrade you for no reason kind of thing. Obviously if you have status,
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:33.920]   you can get it right. But, um, but everything else like, Oh, my flight's gone. They could decide,
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.040]   do I want to put you on that easy connection or you want to do, I want to just give you a
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:41.760]   coupon and you can get a hotel and come back tomorrow. And, uh, playing that game is,
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:45.360]   has been very helpful. And if that line's too long, I always try to call
[00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:49.120]   and see if I can get someone faster than a long line. Like when a flight's canceled and there's
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:55.440]   a hundred people lined up. Oh yeah. Yeah. Well, I, I can, I, so I have all the apps,
[00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:58.080]   you know, the flight track, like that will sometimes alert me
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:04.560]   to a problem by flight before the airline does. So I'm, I'm always kind of ahead of the curve
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:08.240]   with that where it's like, Oh, this thing's getting canceled. I'm going to go figure this
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:11.920]   out before everyone else at the gate knows that's what's happening. And you're like telling them,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:16.080]   you're like the flight's canceled. She's like, what, what? Oh yes, it is. Yeah. Yeah. You're
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:22.400]   telling them. Um, so one other area that we haven't talked a lot about is around kind of
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.280]   health and fitness and, you know, people like Laird Hamilton go nuts about everything they do
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:32.960]   with their regime for exercise, sauna, all this stuff, skateboarding. I think some people,
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:36.640]   especially when I was a kid, like didn't even see it as a physical sport. I can,
[00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:42.000]   I can assure you, I'm sure you can assure everyone that it is. How much was kind of
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:48.080]   diet exercise training outside of skating important or, or how has that evolved as you've
[00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:53.760]   gotten older? I think in the early days it, I didn't, I didn't recognize the importance
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:40:01.840]   of, of my diet and training and whatnot, but I was so obsessed with skating that that was all
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:06.880]   my exercise. And that was enough because I was skating three to four hours a day, every day,
[00:40:07.520 --> 00:40:18.000]   um, giving it a mile. So I think that over time I, and also just seeing my peers, I saw
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:22.720]   a lot of them not take care of themselves, drinking too much, partying and, and really
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:28.960]   kind of losing their skillsets. And so skating was always such a paramount importance to me
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:35.120]   that I was never going to let that happen. And I saw it by example, like, Oh man, he's not skating
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:41.280]   good. Oh, that's because he won't stop partying. And so for me, that was sort of the first lesson
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:48.080]   was, was not, not completely, but, but clean living for the most part. But as I grew older,
[00:40:48.080 --> 00:40:54.000]   then I realized the importance of, of diet and of trying to stay active when I can't skate.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.480]   And now, especially at my age and with my, my current recovery, um, I I've learned that I
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:07.200]   got to stay active. Even if I can't skate, I got to, and I need to do so much stuff to help. I I'm
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:12.080]   recovering from a broken femur from last year. I need to do so many things to help that healing.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:18.480]   Um, and it, it, it was at one point it was because it was a full-time job and I had to kind of back
[00:41:18.480 --> 00:41:23.520]   off from it. Cause I was like, maybe I just need to wait, just give it time instead of trying to
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:29.120]   do all these other things like hyperbaric chamber and laser treatment and acupuncture and peptides.
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:35.200]   And, and I was going all the way in with all those treatments. Um, and, and at some point
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:42.000]   it didn't, I actually went the wrong way with my recovery, but only because I, I couldn't stop
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:50.320]   skating. So my bone never connected to itself. It never actually became one bone again. So I had it
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:55.840]   reset, um, two months ago. And are there things that you think that you've experimented with,
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:42:01.040]   whether it's diet or, you know, different kinds of treatment that you think you'll keep in a
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:06.240]   routine or that are lasting or things like breathwork or yoga or any of those things that
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:12.400]   are part of your routine? I think, uh, swimming helped me with my strength a lot when I wasn't
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:19.520]   skating. So I'm, I'm going to lean into that more, um, going forward, including with my skating. Um,
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:29.760]   and, and just trying to, you know, it was more like, um, not eating to excess and not indulging
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:36.400]   in sweets and sodas and stuff like that. Um, I, I still, I still carry a lot of my habits from,
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:44.320]   from as a kid, then I still enjoy, you know, not the healthiest of foods, but I don't go all in
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:51.280]   on just fast food and just the, you know, more, um, stuff that's going to slow me down and, and
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:58.640]   try to make a concerted effort to take supplements, to eat greens, um, you know,
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:03.440]   less processed foods, stuff like that. What kind of supplements? Well, I take, uh, quite a few,
[00:43:03.440 --> 00:43:07.520]   but, but most importantly, I have to take a stat now because I have high cholesterol because of my
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:15.840]   family history. So I take, um, QNAL CoQ10. Um, I actually, it was funny because they were looking
[00:43:15.840 --> 00:43:20.960]   for, they reached out to me about possibly doing an endorsement. Like, do you know what this is?
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:27.120]   You know, I take it. I literally take it every day. Wow. And so, uh, I was kind of the perfect
[00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:32.480]   one for their campaign. You know what I mean? So it's stuff like that, but multivitamins too.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:40.720]   Okay. And a bevy of other ones just trying to keep my, um, you know, all my, my levels balanced.
[00:43:40.720 --> 00:43:45.280]   What about the morning routine? Are you early, early up and early after it?
[00:43:45.280 --> 00:43:49.920]   Yeah. Well, we still have a, we still have one at home. Um, usually I got to make sure my daughter
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:56.080]   is up and getting ready by 7:00 AM. So I'm usually up by six 30. I mean, that's not crazy early, but
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:06.000]   sometimes it's six. Um, and that's kind of my time to, uh, try to go through my communications
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.080]   emails and, and whatnot. Um, because as the day starts and as like she goes to school,
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:17.440]   I come here, this is my office. This is my ramp is, um, things get crazy through the day.
[00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:23.760]   And so it's hard to stay on top of communication. Yeah. I heard you say in a podcast almost five
[00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:30.000]   years ago that your kryptonite was time. I'm curious. I'm curious if in the last few years,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:35.040]   you've made any changes, whether it's to time management or anything that's made you more
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:41.280]   productive. Uh, yeah, I've learned to say no. I mean, it's hard, especially when things are,
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:47.600]   things are growing and things are successful and people are, are asking for your time and, and,
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:55.360]   and for whatever, for, for you to attend events or for you to do interviews and things like that.
[00:44:55.360 --> 00:45:02.560]   And at some point I thought, I don't need to do these things. And I don't think that they are
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:09.600]   necessarily beneficial. I don't know, you know, that they just don't seem like they should be so
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:14.080]   obligatory. Um, I'm honored that people want to talk to me and that people want me to do stuff.
[00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:21.840]   But at some point I needed for my own sanity, for my own, and also for my own family dynamic
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:27.360]   to just be available to them and not be on the, on the move all the time or just home on my phone.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:34.240]   That's, I think that's one thing that people don't necessarily recognize is that just because
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:39.280]   you are home, if your attention is elsewhere, you're not really home. Yeah. I think it's something
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:43.680]   that when you have young kids, you start to realize, wow, like the number of times I'm just
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:48.480]   a little bit distracted, uh, because they run off and you're like, whoa, I was distracted.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.680]   They're no longer trying to show you something. And you're like, uh-huh. Yep. Yep. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:55.520]   And you think that that's good enough, but they, they see that, you know, and, and, and they, that,
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:01.520]   that can be effect that can affect them. Yeah. I think in some ways it might've been much easier
[00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:06.160]   to be a parent before all of the distraction that we have. Yeah. In other ways, I think it was way
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:13.200]   harder. Yeah. So I, I, I was very young. I was 24 when my, when my first son was born and, um,
[00:46:13.920 --> 00:46:20.160]   that was, you know, there were no DVRs. We were still using VHS and he would wake up super early.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:26.640]   And sometimes before Sesame street was on the air, you know what I mean? Like, yeah, what do we get?
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:32.400]   Let's read a book or do something. Um, so yeah, it's, uh, you know, you, you learn and you learn
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   to, you learn to entertain the old fashioned way, storytelling. It's like, uh, that I find this on
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:44.320]   flights now. It's like, you're on a flight, you're on Southwest. There's no TVs. There's
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:48.560]   no device. Like you're sitting there and you're like, it's amazing how kids are like, I want to
[00:46:48.560 --> 00:46:52.400]   run around. And you're like, well, you can't run around. I want to read a book. Okay. Five minutes
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:56.880]   in. I don't want to read a book anymore. So, uh, I think flights in that kind of toddler age are
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:03.280]   really tough. Um, one thing I will, I'll tell you a hack for toddlers, since you do have young ones
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:09.440]   and this is going to be weird, but it worked for me a couple of times. My son was prone to, um,
[00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:17.680]   being carsick sometimes, um, and, and on planes too. Um, and so sometimes we would be walking
[00:47:17.680 --> 00:47:24.000]   through a terminal or something, and then he would just barf. And I learned that, um, it's very easy
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:32.160]   to remove your shoe, remove one sock, use that as a rag and just throw the sock away and deal with
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:39.440]   just wearing one sock the rest of your trip or your day to, to save from having to try to go some
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:44.800]   massive cleanup effort. The sock burp cloth. What's that? The sock burp cloth. Sock burp cloth.
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:50.720]   Yeah. Yeah. I've done, I've done it a few times. The last thing we didn't really talk on was around
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:55.280]   money. So early on in your career, you were making six figures in high school. So I'm,
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:58.960]   I'm trying to comprehend that, you know, most people in high school are making
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:03.600]   maybe a couple bucks on a side gig. What was money? What was the relationship with
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.920]   money like back then? Well, it was all a big surprise. Cause it wasn't like,
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:14.880]   it wasn't like you got into skateboarding to be rich or famous. No one had become rich or famous.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:19.200]   No one made money doing it. You just did it cause you loved it. And all of a sudden there was this
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:25.840]   fame and there was this money. And I was in my late teens. I I'd say I started making pretty
[00:48:25.840 --> 00:48:32.880]   good money around 16, 17. And it was like, Oh, this is awesome. I'm going to take all my friends
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:39.520]   to Hawaii. I'm going to sharper image and buying all the gear. And, and at some point my dad
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:44.560]   gave me the best advice. He said, I really think you should put some of that money away.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:50.640]   I was like, why? As if it's just going to keep raining down on me. And he said, well, you know,
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:54.800]   you just don't know if this is going to last. And, and, um, cause he really wanted me to go
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:49:00.000]   to college. And it's like, if you're going to do this, you should really, you should really save
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:09.760]   from what you're making here. And so when I was 17, he co-signed, uh, a, a mortgage for a home
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:15.280]   that like we, I bought a home when I was 17, it was my money, but he co-signed it just cause I was
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.800]   not 18. And cause you might not have had, had the income to qualify for a more, more. No, I did. I
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:25.680]   had the income to qualify, but I literally was not old enough to sign the paperwork by myself.
[00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:32.400]   So he co-signed on, on a house for me. So I lived in my own place as a senior in high school,
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:38.320]   as if I was in college with your parents, weren't there. So, and then I had all the high school
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:42.880]   parties. I had one roommate that was also at the same high school. We had two older roommates that
[00:49:42.880 --> 00:49:53.760]   just had jobs, but were young enough to be, um, taking advantage of the situation. And so, you
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.760]   know, when you're in high school, whoever's friends are out of town, that's where the party
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:03.120]   is. My, my, whoever's friends, uh, whoever's friends' parents were out of town, that's the
[00:50:03.120 --> 00:50:07.840]   house where the party is, right? My parents were never in town. So my house was always where the
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:14.400]   party was. And it got, it was very challenging to stay focused on school when I'm already making
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:20.960]   more than my teachers and I'm, everyone's coming over to hang out and then I'm supposed to get up
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:27.680]   early and drive to high school. Um, but I did, I mean, I, I did mostly because of how important my
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:35.360]   parents, how much they valued education. My mom was a teacher, um, at a junior college at the time.
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.880]   And so I knew they'd be really disappointed if I just left.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:42.880]   So finishing high school was like a very. Well, yeah, it was important. Yeah.
[00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:48.720]   Yeah. And then did you keep saving or was the house the kind of saving grace?
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:54.480]   The house was saving grace. Yeah. I, I, um, well, I got in kind of over my head. So a few years
[00:50:54.480 --> 00:51:00.480]   later I bought another property. I built a bunch of big ramps on it. It was, it was a four acre
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:08.480]   lot here, kind of East San Diego. And, um, at some point, not long after that, my income started
[00:51:08.480 --> 00:51:14.800]   dropping by half, by half every month because it was all royalty based. It was all based on,
[00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:21.840]   um, items or products with my name on it. Skating was taking a downturn in popularity. So suddenly
[00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:26.960]   skating is not popular. My name's not popular. My products aren't selling and I'm stuck with
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:33.360]   two mortgages, my first child on the way. And it was like, how did I get here? This is crazy. So
[00:51:33.360 --> 00:51:41.760]   I sold my house for basically, um, I had taken a second, I had taken equity out of it to start a
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:46.560]   skate company, which seems like not the smartest move at a time when your income's dropping,
[00:51:46.560 --> 00:51:51.520]   but I wanted to stay in the industry. And I wanted to, at that point, have more control
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:57.040]   over a brand because up to then I had been skating for the same sponsor for 10 years.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:03.760]   And their, their popularity was waning. So was skateboarding. And I thought, well,
[00:52:03.760 --> 00:52:07.200]   I could probably just start a brand and be behind the scenes because it seems like now
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:14.480]   my career as a skater is starting to fall apart, but I could, I could at the very least be effective
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:23.200]   as sort of a team manager, curator, marketer. And so I took, uh, the equity out of my house,
[00:52:23.200 --> 00:52:28.960]   started Birdhouse Skateboards, um, sold the house for what I owed on it, then moved back into the
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:38.080]   house I was living at as a senior in high school. And, and for probably three to four years lived
[00:52:38.080 --> 00:52:43.680]   off of Top Ramen, peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, Taco Bell, um, and just made it
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:51.360]   work. And those were the years when I started to have to travel to make ends meet like Japan
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:57.200]   and bring my son along. You know what I mean? That's, that's how that all unraveled.
[00:52:57.200 --> 00:53:02.480]   There wasn't childcare at home to help out because if you're eating Top Ramen, it's, it's tough.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:09.440]   And then things changed. Birdhouse took off. How did that evolve? Like now are you much more
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:13.920]   passionate or interested about money and saving and all of that? Or, or where, where's your
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:22.960]   relationship? Well, I have, I have a much more respect for, for saving money and, and for being,
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:27.760]   um, for making sure everyone's taken care of my, especially with our kids. Um, you know,
[00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:32.160]   I want them to all forge their own way for sure. But at the same time, we, we want to be able to
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:37.840]   know that we have a nest egg in case something goes south. So, um, my relationship is just that
[00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:45.520]   I have, I have much more reverence and respect for it. And that I also don't take every single
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.760]   opportunity. And I mean, that, that was a big, you know, that, that's a reason why I had so many
[00:53:49.760 --> 00:53:54.560]   relationships fall apart too. Cause I just kept chasing the carrot even when it was huge, even
[00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:59.520]   when I didn't need to at all. I just kept going. I, it was like, it was like, I couldn't turn it
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:06.480]   off. And then at some point I realized like, what I'm losing, I'm missing, I'm missing my, my kids
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:14.160]   formative years chasing some, some dream that I've already realized. Yeah. I think at a different
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:19.520]   scale, it's something that we all face is like, you know, you have kids and you're like, I can't
[00:54:19.520 --> 00:54:23.440]   go to the thing. I can't go to the thing. And I think if you pause and reflect for a moment,
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:30.000]   you're like, but it's okay. Like I miss the day, but it's so hard to process that. And, and like
[00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:35.360]   FOMO is definitely real. But if, if there's one thing that, you know, your kids can teach you,
[00:54:35.360 --> 00:54:39.760]   even when they're really young, it's like, you can miss the thing. Like, it's okay.
[00:54:39.760 --> 00:54:45.840]   Oh yeah. It's okay. Yeah. And, and also if you, if you, if you really devote yourself, um,
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:54.160]   to that time with your kids, you see, you just see the, the gleam in their eye. And you see that,
[00:54:54.160 --> 00:55:00.480]   that, that they appreciate it. You know, they're not going to speak it to you. Good luck getting
[00:55:00.480 --> 00:55:04.400]   your kids to say thank you, by the way, for anything, but, um, but they do appreciate it.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:09.600]   And, and they, you know, and they thrive because of it. Um, but I think it was just that I had
[00:55:09.600 --> 00:55:17.200]   gotten so used to the hustle of, of not being successful and just going all the time, trying
[00:55:17.200 --> 00:55:21.680]   to, trying to create something, trying to make something happen that when it started to happen
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:28.800]   in droves, how could I let it go? That, that seems crazy. That's impossible. Why would I not do that?
[00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:34.480]   Um, and at some point I lost myself in it. Is there something that you wish you'd known,
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:38.720]   or you'd wish someone had told you that could have gotten you out of that earlier?
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:44.080]   I don't, I don't think so. I think it was all so new and fantastical to me that,
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:48.240]   that I don't think I was going to listen to a voice of reason, you know what I mean?
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.640]   Um, and so now you've got plenty of things that could keep you busy. What,
[00:55:52.640 --> 00:55:57.360]   what's the focus now? I mean, you're still skating or you will probably after you, you heal.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:06.480]   Yeah. Um, now I, I mean, I'm just so thankful to still be in the scene and to be able to
[00:56:06.480 --> 00:56:13.120]   bear witness to skateboarding's massive, um, acceptance. I don't want to say growth. I mean,
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:20.480]   it definitely has grown hugely in the last five or 10 years, but, um, just to see it come of age and
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:28.960]   to be an activity, a sport, a lifestyle that is all inclusive, that is super diverse, that is now
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:37.200]   an Olympic sport. It's, it's something that, that, um, people like transcends boundaries,
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:42.560]   cultures, economics, you know, people that get together to skate, they don't care where you're
[00:56:42.560 --> 00:56:48.320]   from. They just care if you're, how you skate. Um, and it's low cost of entry. And so to see it
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.960]   come this far and to still be considered relevant, that's, that's the greatest joy I have. So
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:57.760]   what am I doing? I'm, I'm doing whatever I can to still be an advocate for skating
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:05.520]   and to be able to skate myself because that's still is the most fun for me. Um, but whatever,
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:10.560]   kind of whatever comes along. I mean, and like I said, I do a lot of speaking gigs now,
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:16.880]   which I never imagined would be a way of living or a source of income. I say it all the time
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.000]   because when I go to these things, it's just like, look, I never imagined anyone would pay me to
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:26.240]   skate. So I certainly never imagined that people would pay me to talk about skateboarding. Um,
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:32.480]   but here we are and it's a blast. I love it. And you think, what's the advice to someone who's
[00:57:32.480 --> 00:57:37.520]   passionate about a thing that's not necessarily a revenue source for their life right now?
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:43.360]   It's what's going to bring you the most joy and it's worth it. You know, I think it's,
[00:57:44.560 --> 00:57:49.360]   if you go to work and your work makes you happy, that's living the dream
[00:57:49.360 --> 00:57:57.040]   at any level. And, and, and if, if it's, if it's very successful financially,
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:58:01.840]   great, that's just sort of gravy, but it's more about your peace of mind.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:08.720]   And, and I think that if there is something that makes you truly happy and maybe you have to do
[00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.720]   something else to supplement your income, try to balance those things as best you can.
[00:58:12.720 --> 00:58:17.280]   Yeah. I've actually, I've turned my position on this in the past few years. I used to say,
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.240]   I'll go follow your passion, you know, find a way to make that your job.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:24.480]   But if you have a job that allows you to follow your passion, not as a job,
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:28.880]   that's okay. Yeah. That's, that's, that's enough. And for a lot of people, my,
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:33.440]   my brother-in-law went pro golfing and then hated it because it was his job.
[00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:38.720]   And then what got a job and just golfs on the weekend and loves it. And so I think for some
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:42.480]   people, even pursuing it to some extent can actually take away. I don't know if there was
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:46.960]   ever a moment in your career where it was like skating to win competitions and to win trophies
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:54.080]   was just too much and it took away the fun. Yeah, for sure. Especially in the, in the late
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:59.600]   eighties, that was the, that I, I became a machine and it was very cyclical and it was like, all
[00:58:59.600 --> 00:59:04.160]   right, there's an event coming up next weekend. I've got to learn a couple of new tricks for the
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:10.480]   event because the judges saw what I'm, you know, they, they saw my current roster of tricks. So
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:17.120]   I got to hide it from them and then unleash it in the finals. And then, but it became so formulaic
[00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:22.080]   that it really was not fun. And at some point I just pulled away and stepped away from it
[00:59:22.080 --> 00:59:28.960]   altogether because skating had become a job and it wasn't fun for me. And then when I did pull away,
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.160]   I, I got very creative with my skating and I was able to really learn
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:38.480]   a lot of different techniques and a lot of stuff that I wanted to pursue,
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   even though I wasn't making a living at it at the time. I mean, I kind of was, I still had
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:48.720]   signature skateboards and whatnot, but when you're not in those years, if you were not competing
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:54.960]   actively, you were not going to get coverage. You were not going to get career opportunities,
[00:59:56.160 --> 01:00:02.720]   but I was willing to let those go to just at least be happy with it. And so it gave me this
[01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:08.720]   sort of new energy to come back to competing and with a different approach that was more,
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:17.520]   it was more, I don't know how to explain it. I guess, I guess it was, it was less careful
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:24.800]   and it was more risky. That was it. I came, I came at it with a, with a sense of, I'm going
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.600]   to just try everything. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. I'd rather just do this and take
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:33.440]   the chances and have fun doing it. And if it works, then it's going to work awesomely.
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:39.760]   The downside to that was that when I did come back to competing, it was when skateboarding
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:44.720]   was starting to take a downturn. So I came back with this renewed energy and I was winning a lot
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.520]   of big events. And all of a sudden it was like, what happened? Where's the crowd? Where's the
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:54.240]   contest? Where's the prize money? You guys like turn the machines back on. I thought this was
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:59.280]   cool. And so I, you know, it was kind of like the wrong place at the right time.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:03.280]   But you probably wouldn't have had the career you had after that had that not happened.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:12.400]   No, no. Because in, in those dead years, I was skating more than ever. Um, having fun doing it,
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.200]   you know, learning new tricks and learning new techniques. It was just that I wasn't
[01:01:15.200 --> 01:01:19.520]   doing it in front of crowds because the crowds weren't there anymore.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:23.120]   Yeah. I think I'm very fortunate that, and I think you did the same with your podcast. Like
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:28.480]   when you start a podcast, if you can start it, not needing to be your, your job and your business,
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:32.800]   you could do whatever you want with it. You can kind of say, you know what? This podcast was not,
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:36.320]   you know, when I started it, I never thought I'd be going over countries as episodes. And then I
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.440]   was like, yeah, I'm going to London. I want to talk to someone who knows everything about London.
[01:01:39.440 --> 01:01:44.480]   Let's make an episode about London. And then we do it on Japan. So I think when you really start
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:49.920]   to do what you're passionate about in your work, it sometimes creates an even better experience.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.080]   And people love these episodes. And I never had an idea, but.
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:58.960]   Oh yeah. No, I think, well, my, my cohost, Jason Ellis and I, we have a lot of, of, uh,
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.280]   we have a lot of experience, obviously skating, but just life experience. He, he was, you know,
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:09.360]   had a totally different path than I did. And when we have guests, especially with non-skating guests,
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:14.400]   we relate to them in different ways that people would not expect, but, but in a very,
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:22.560]   in a very parallel way. Um, for instance, we had two wrestlers on, uh, that's our most recent guest
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.280]   and Darby Allen and Jamie Hader. And people were like, why would you have them on? And then when
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:32.240]   we started to talk about our experiences and our injuries, we were right in line and we were
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:36.400]   bouncing off of each other. And it was a really great conversation. It was fascinating, you know,
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:41.600]   and say what you will about, about wrestling or that it's made up or whatever it is. They are,
[01:02:41.600 --> 01:02:49.600]   those guys take as much abuse as skateboarders. Yeah. It was great. I listened to this episode.
[01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:55.200]   It was wild to kind of, I don't think I've gotten that behind the scenes look at wrestling. Uh,
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:59.360]   you know, it hasn't been a passion of mine, but it was super fascinating and you don't have to
[01:02:59.360 --> 01:03:03.280]   say who, but I know there's some cool guests coming down the pike. So if anyone's listening,
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:10.000]   yeah, we have, um, we have a, an insane roster coming up and, and, uh, I feel like now we're
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.920]   starting to hit our stride and we've been doing it a couple of years. So you're right. It wasn't
[01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:18.800]   something that we needed and, but we enjoy doing it. And we did find that we had something unique
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:24.640]   to offer. We found a groove, we found an audience. Um, it was just that we weren't doing all the,
[01:03:24.640 --> 01:03:31.360]   the right things with the algorithms and the, you know, the promotions. And so now we, we have a
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:37.680]   group, uh, Malka that is, um, is taking the reins on that and they've been doing a great job. So
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:42.720]   we get to focus more on the content. Podcast is great. I enjoy it. Uh,
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:46.880]   especially, especially cause I have my, my childhood skate skate dreams still somewhere
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.840]   buried in my head for anyone else listening. Where else can they, where else do you want to
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.560]   send them to keep on top of whatever you're doing? Oh, um, well, I'm out there on all the social
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:05.440]   media as Tony Hawk. Um, luckily, uh, I had to, I think, I think I had to buy one of someone,
[01:04:05.440 --> 01:04:11.840]   someone, um, squatted my name on some platform early on. Um, but yeah, so I'm Tony Hawk and all
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:16.400]   the social media and that's kind of where I put all of my content out there. Uh, we have the Hawk
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:23.600]   versus Wolf podcast. Um, I think if anything, my, my energy also is directed towards the skate park
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:29.200]   project, which is my foundation for public skate parks in underserved areas. Um, we have been
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:36.080]   doing it over 20 years now. We've helped to fund over a thousand skate parks, um, in the U S alone.
[01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:40.800]   Um, we have a couple of, um, international projects as well. And I think that's my proudest work
[01:04:40.800 --> 01:04:46.320]   because when I was growing up skating, the skate park was my salvation. I know I was,
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:51.280]   I was an outcast kid. I was bullied at school, but I found my tribe and my community at the
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.960]   skate park. And, and I was very lucky that, that the park that I grew up skating at was one of the
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:03.360]   last ones in the U S in the mid eighties, there were only a handful. And that was never lost on
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:10.480]   me how lucky I was to have that place to go and to have that, that, um, that crew. So when I was
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:17.360]   in a position to advocate and to possibly affect change, that's what I, that's what I focused in
[01:05:17.360 --> 01:05:22.960]   on was, was public skate parks. Yeah. I mean, I grew up kind of at the, the born in the early
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:27.840]   eighties and that I was in that kind of dearth of, of lack of skate parks, skate parks. And I
[01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:31.120]   think my community was like the guy that lived across the street that had a skateboard. Like
[01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:36.560]   that was it, right. It was the two of us. And, and also that these kids that they find something
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:40.400]   they love, right. And they, they maybe live in an area where there's not much opportunity.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:44.080]   They find something they love and they're mostly told that they can't do it because they're
[01:05:44.080 --> 01:05:48.640]   trespassing. Yeah. Or they're a nuisance. They put things to prevent you from doing it.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:52.720]   And it's like, this kid has finally found something that speaks to them.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:57.600]   And now you're discouraging them from that. Like, what, what are you doing to your community?
[01:05:57.600 --> 01:06:07.520]   Um, and so to have those parks, the kids feel like they're, they matter and that they can,
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:14.960]   they can find their, their crew. Um, and, uh, the, I think the best part about the foundations, we,
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:20.400]   we try to empower groups that are already doing it themselves or trying to do it themselves. Like,
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:24.720]   like they're trying to fundraise or they're going to city council meetings or they're petitioning.
[01:06:24.720 --> 01:06:33.440]   All those things matter. And it feels like you're in an uphill battle that will never end,
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:40.240]   especially with the red tape and the bureaucracy and city councils, but we give them the roadmap
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:46.320]   to do it the right way. And when we do give them our endorsement and possibly funding,
[01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:50.960]   that's usually the tipping point for them to get it approved officially. And so that, you know,
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:56.480]   for us, it's empowering the, those, those go-getters that were trying to do it in the first
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:00.880]   place. I love it. So you should all definitely check out the podcasts and the socials, but
[01:07:00.880 --> 01:07:05.840]   definitely check out the skate park project. It's, uh, I wish that it was around, you know,
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:11.680]   30 something years ago for me, it would have been awesome. But any, any parting advice for anyone
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:15.680]   who's looks at you, it says, gosh, when I'm in my fifties, I want to be doing the thing I love
[01:07:15.680 --> 01:07:23.280]   and, you know, performing at that level. Um, what can I say? I, I think that the, the,
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:32.880]   my approach always has been to keep improving what I do. Um, and at my age that's shifted a bit from
[01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:39.360]   trying to do these big spins and these big, big stunts to more subtle techniques, but something
[01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.680]   that I feel like is progressive. Um, and I'm talking about just in terms of physical skating,
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:48.800]   but also just my approach to life is like to not wrestle my accolades, to keep trying to
[01:07:48.800 --> 01:07:56.640]   improve what I do, keep evolving, listen to other, other input and, um, and glean what you can from
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:02.400]   them, glean what, what is appropriate to what you do. Um, you know, I love, I'm fascinated listening
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:07.680]   to people who, who are passionate about what they do, whether they're successful or not just to hear
[01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:13.760]   what drives them. And a lot of times you can, you can translate that to what you do.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:18.480]   Is there a favorite way you consume these stories, podcasts you like, books you like?
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:22.080]   Uh, for, for these days, it's actually doing my own podcast. Cause I like to invite people
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:28.720]   that I think are fascinating and really get into their story. Um, I like we interviewed, uh, this
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:36.000]   girl who's a, she's the most decorated Paralympian now. Her name's Oksana Masters. Um, who, who grew
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:42.880]   up in a Ukrainian orphanage, um, after Chernobyl and who was disfigured from Chernobyl, um, who
[01:08:42.880 --> 01:08:49.600]   came to the U S she got adopted. And her story is incredible and so inspiring. I already knew a
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:54.400]   little bit of it, but to invite her on our pack podcast and hear all of it was fascinating.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.840]   I have not listened to that. So that's my homework for the flight home today.
