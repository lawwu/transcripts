[00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:02.320]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.920]   where we discuss science and science-based tools
[00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:05.960]   for everyday life.
[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.480]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.720]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.600]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.600]   My guest today is Alex Honnold.
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.080]   Alex Honnold is a professional rock climber.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:22.480]   He's best known for successfully free soloing,
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.560]   meaning climbing with no ropes or latching on of any kind,
[00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.800]   El Capitan, also called El Cap,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.440]   which is a nearly 3,000-foot climb in Yosemite National Park.
[00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.640]   It was also, of course, the topic and focus
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.560]   of the incredible movie Free Solo,
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.740]   which if you haven't seen, you absolutely should watch.
[00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.880]   I've wanted to talk to Alex for a long time now.
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.500]   I'm not a rock climber, I've tried it a few times,
[00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.360]   but I've been extremely curious to understand
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.760]   Alex's mental frame around learning and training
[00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.840]   and his broader philosophy on life.
[00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.880]   My interest stems from the fact that Alex's Free Solo of El Cap
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.480]   and his other climbs make him one of the most accomplished
[00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.600]   and innovative athletes in all of history.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.840]   And of course, the Free Solo of El Cap is extremely high risk
[00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.400]   and high consequence.
[00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.360]   Today, we discuss how to envision and make progress
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.240]   towards your goals and how to merge the demands of daily work
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.520]   and family life with incremental training
[00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.520]   for spectacularly big or long challenges of any kind.
[00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.880]   Alex makes clear that it's essential and possible
[00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.120]   to build your capacity to exert effort
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.080]   and how to do that in a regimented way
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.400]   so as to bring seemingly impossible goals within your reach.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.440]   We also discuss how coming to terms with one's own mortality
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.760]   is actually one of the best motivators for building a great life
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.000]   and why most people hide from that reality and as a result,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.040]   end up living much smaller lives than they otherwise would.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.400]   We also discuss training, literally what to do
[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.440]   to build strength and endurance, not just for sake of rock climbing,
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.640]   but just generally.
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.800]   And that takes us into discussions about weight training,
[00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800]   body weight training, running, hiking,
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.000]   and a bunch of other things that you can apply.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.360]   Even if you have zero interest in rock climbing,
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.080]   today's conversation with Alex Honnold
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.760]   will definitely change the way that you think about your life,
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.360]   what you can make of it, and how to go about that.
[00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.880]   Before we begin, I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.520]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.560]   It is, however, part of my desire and effort
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.080]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.680]   and science-related tools to the general public.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.800]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.160]   today's episode does include sponsors.
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.160]   And now for my discussion with Alex Honnold.
[00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.800]   Alex Honnold, welcome.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.680]   - Thanks for having me.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.280]   I think "Free Solo" is remarkable for a ton of reasons,
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.200]   but as a good friend of mine,
[00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.520]   who I think you know, Michael Muller, photographer,
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.560]   he said, before I had seen the film, he said,
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.960]   "It's wild because you're terrified as an observer
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.520]   the entire time, but you also know that Alex survives
[00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.600]   from the very beginning," which is a very unusual-
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.120]   - I think some people don't know that.
[00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.040]   - Oh, really? - Some people watch the movie
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:47.440]   and they literally have no idea what it's about
[00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.080]   or what's going on and they spend the whole movie being like,
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.800]   "Oh my God, what's gonna happen?"
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.560]   - Okay, so I just spoiled it.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.400]   - Oh yeah, well at this point I'm like, nobody cares.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.280]   It's old news.
[00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.080]   - Well, it's a spectacular feat and we can go into that feat,
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.240]   but I'd actually like to drill in a little bit
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.160]   to just your process in general.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.480]   I'm sure that's changed over time
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.040]   and feel free to talk about that.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.000]   But, you know, I'm very curious about notions
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.680]   of intrinsic versus extrinsic motivation, right?
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:17.520]   And I think "Free Solo" is also remarkable
[00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.760]   because you had cameras on you, it was obviously to be recorded
[00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.880]   and you knew you had cameras on you.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.600]   And yet I always thought of climbing
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.040]   as kind of a solitary sport or things that people do
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.960]   in small groups, kind of off the grid.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.840]   Things have changed now with social media,
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.920]   the way everything can be posted very quickly
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.160]   or even run live.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.000]   But when you think about sort of the work that you're doing
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.080]   in terms of progressing and goals and, you know,
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.440]   kind of milestones for yourself, how do you envision that?
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.640]   Is this in like a, do you have a diary?
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.720]   Do you have a process where you sit back and you think, you know,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.840]   what would be awesome for me to experience?
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:57.920]   Would people like to see it?
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.120]   How do, what's the sort of balance between intrinsic
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.680]   and extrinsic motivation for you?
[00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.440]   So basically I think climbing is always intrinsically motivated.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.480]   I mean, since I've, I started climbing when I was a child,
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:07.480]   I've always loved climbing.
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.440]   I love the movement of climbing.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.240]   I love the feeling of it.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.240]   I love the whole experience, you know, just everything about it's great.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.800]   But then, you know, now as a professional climber,
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.120]   obviously there is that extrinsic motivation as well,
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.520]   where you're like, oh, that's how I make a living.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:21.000]   And so I think with the film "Free Solo", you know,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.560]   it was a really interesting balance of the two,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.600]   where it's like, this is something that I'd love to do for myself.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   And even if no one else in the world existed, I'd want to do this thing.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.800]   But then you also know that if you're, if the film turns out well,
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.760]   at which it did, you know, it's going to be great for your career.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:36.960]   It's going to be great for whatever.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.400]   And so like there is that extrinsic motivation as well.
[00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.640]   And so then you're always trying to parse out like which part is which.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.520]   And, you know, because you don't, particularly with "Free Solo",
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.200]   you don't want to be too extrinsically motivated
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:48.040]   because you don't want to get pushed into something
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:50.680]   that you're not prepared for that you shouldn't be doing.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.680]   Of course, you know, being even being extrinsically motivated,
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:57.080]   you can do something you shouldn't, you know, I don't know.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.720]   I mean, but you're just constantly thinking about those things as a climber.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:06.320]   In order to "Free Solo" El Cap, did you memorize sequences?
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.400]   Or is it more sort of like motifs where you kind of know
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.720]   that you're going to do any number of different things in a given pitch?
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.920]   It depends.
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.920]   So for the hardest parts, I memorized like for sure, memorize every aspect of it.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.320]   But that's only the hardest part.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.840]   So that's maybe like a third of the route.
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.280]   And then for the easiest third, and some of it is actually quite easy.
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:28.640]   Some of it's like even a non-climber could climb small sections of the wall.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.280]   Like there are parts that are quite easy here and there.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.360]   You know, it's like not the bulk, but, but so for the easy parts,
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   you just know that you can do it and you don't have to stress it.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:42.000]   And then the, the medium part's kind of like the remaining third of the wall.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.200]   You sort of remember kind of like you said, motifs, like you might know the hardest part
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.160]   and you just kind of know that it's going to be fine, but you don't have to memorize it per se.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.160]   But certainly I knew the route very, very well.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.200]   You know, you just, you just know all the things that you have to know.
[00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:03.280]   You recognize not just holds, but like visceral sensations, like this feels different or,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.000]   because I imagine conditions change, right?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.200]   I mean, weather conditions, heat on the rock, shadows on the rock.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:13.120]   Yeah, but not as much as you might think, because like I was only climbing in shade,
[00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.040]   like in the springtime, the, that whole west side of the wall stays in the shade until 11 or
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.920]   noonish in the morning.
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.600]   So you go at four in the morning and then you have sort of eight hours of solid shade.
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.040]   So normally the temperature and the, the conditions feel relatively stable and you
[00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.320]   spend the whole season working on it.
[00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.520]   So you kind of know that tomorrow is going to feel the same as it did today, roughly,
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:33.840]   you know?
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:37.840]   And so it's all within a relatively narrow band, particularly in the spring,
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:41.040]   which is why I did it in the springtime in the, in the fall and the autumn.
[00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.040]   It's a little bit different because the sun is lower in the sky.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.320]   So it gets sun much earlier and it actually is way hotter counterintuitively.
[00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.880]   It's like colder when it's in the shade, but then hotter when it's in the sun.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.440]   And anyways, that makes it harder for climbing, obviously.
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:55.200]   But when I free solo at El Cap, I was spending three or four months a year in Yosemite every
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.560]   year, like, you know, a month or two every spring and every, every autumn.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.880]   And so you're spending four months a year in a place.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:02.320]   You just know how it feels, you know?
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.760]   It's like, you're used to getting up that early.
[00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.760]   You're used to climbing on the wall and you're just kind of like, oh, it's,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.840]   it's going to be another beautiful day on the rock.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:11.680]   And actually the day that I did the free solo of El Cap, it was actually a little more
[00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.120]   humid and a little warmer than, than I maybe, than would have been optimal.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:18.240]   You know, like, it's not what I would have chosen, but that's just the way it was that
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:18.480]   day.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.400]   And I was kind of like, well, this is my day.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.000]   You know, you kind of just have to do the thing.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.640]   But it had been like overcast that night.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:26.800]   And you know, when it's cloudy at night, the lows don't drop as low.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.040]   And so I woke up and it was like kind of muggy-ish feeling.
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.120]   I was like, it's not, it's not great for being four in the morning.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.720]   It was like, it feels kind of gross.
[00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.680]   But I was like, this is my day.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.720]   And it was fun.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:37.120]   So you form a relationship with the rock.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.680]   You kind of like learn to recognize, um, it's different states when you did it and completed
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:43.760]   it.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:46.000]   Cause I know you set out one day and then you, you called it.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:47.120]   And that was in the autumn.
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:47.520]   Okay.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.560]   That was the season before.
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.400]   And, uh, basically the season was ending, like the storms are coming in the next week type
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:52.640]   deal.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:54.160]   And it was like, the season is winding down.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.440]   It was kind of like, well, I should at least take a shot because I'd done a lot of prep and
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:01.360]   I felt mostly ready and it turns out I just wasn't ready ready.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:05.280]   And so, so I wound up bailing, but that was kind of my end of the season.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:09.360]   Like, I think I can squeak this in knowing that if I couldn't squeak it in then, then I'd have
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.480]   to wait six more months.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.040]   And with the pressure of the film crew and all that stuff, knowing that there are all these
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.520]   people like working and waiting for you, you're kind of like, well, I'd at least try to get this
[00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.600]   done because it's like all these people are waiting on me.
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.640]   But as it turns out, I just didn't quite have it yet.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.400]   And then when I ultimately did do it in the spring, I was much better prepared, felt way better.
[00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:27.760]   The whole experience worked out better.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.960]   So now in retrospect, I'm like, I'm glad that it played out that way.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.840]   Cause you know, it was, it was better, but at the time it was, you know, I was like, oh God,
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:37.760]   I failed on this thing and all these people are watching.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:38.480]   It's embarrassing.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.200]   It's, you know, it was, you know, it was, it was all very stressful at the time.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:41.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:45.600]   The external pressures have to be, you know, pretty, pretty mighty when, you know, when,
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.400]   especially when they're your friends, I guess one could imagine that like when it's
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.200]   just business, you can just be like, well, it's just business.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:52.880]   But yeah, you had a lot of friends up there with you.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.840]   For me, the thing is, is that if I'm going to go climb the wall, you know,
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:58.240]   I start climbing at four 30 in the morning or five or something.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:01.440]   So that means some of my friends to get in position at the top of the wall are getting
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.120]   up at like one in the morning and then hiking to the top of a mountain with a heavy backpack.
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:08.320]   And if you're asking a bunch of your buddies to go hiking at one in the morning, like you
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.760]   better live up to your end of the thing, you know, like if you say you're going to do something,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.040]   you better actually do the thing.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:17.440]   I mean, because your friends, obviously no one's complaining, no one is pressuring me.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.160]   No one's, but at the same time, you don't want to bail.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.640]   Sure.
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:22.160]   Like, it's pretty embarrassing.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:24.320]   If you tell someone you're going to do something, then you just can't do it.
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.440]   Well, they certainly wanted the outcome to be only one way.
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:31.040]   And yeah, and they were all super positive and supportive and it's all great, but you
[00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:32.560]   still can't help but feel that pressure.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:33.040]   Sure.
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.400]   Well, it certainly worked out.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:40.160]   I'm curious on a scale of one to 10, 10 being a total certainty, um, along that trajectory,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:44.560]   uh, when you completed it, uh, were there any phases where, um,
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:49.360]   you felt you had to improvise against the original plan?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   You mean on the day of the actual, on the day of the actual completion of the free solo?
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.040]   No, on, on the day I was a hundred percent.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:55.840]   Everything was perfect.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:57.520]   I knew exactly what to do is all amazing.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:01.040]   Um, but it took a really long time to get, to get there.
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:05.760]   You know, it's like literally years of building up to it and then months of preparation and
[00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.640]   everything, but no, on the day it was, it was perfect.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:12.720]   I'd like to take a quick break and thank our sponsor Juve.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:16.480]   Juve makes medical grade red light therapy devices.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.920]   Now, if there's one thing that I have consistently emphasized on this podcast,
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:23.440]   it is the incredible impact that light can have on our biology.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.840]   Now, in addition to sunlight, red light and near infrared light sources have been shown to have
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:32.960]   positive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health, including faster muscle
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:38.880]   recovery, improved skin health and wound healing, improvements in acne, reduced pain and inflammation,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:42.080]   even mitochondrial function and improving vision itself.
[00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.720]   What sets Juve lights apart and why they're my preferred red light therapy device is that they use
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:51.360]   clinically proven wavelengths, meaning specific wavelengths of red light and near infrared light
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:55.280]   in combination to trigger the optimal cellar adaptations.
[00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:59.120]   Personally, I use the Juve whole body panel about three to four times a week,
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.400]   and I use the Juve handheld light both at home and when I travel.
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.080]   If you'd like to try Juve, you can go to Juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/Huberman.
[00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:15.120]   Juve is offering an exclusive discount to all Huberman Lab listeners with up to $400 off Juve products.
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:20.480]   Again, that's Juve, spelled J-O-O-V-V.com/Huberman to get up to $400 off.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:24.640]   Today's episode is also brought to us by BetterHelp.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:29.760]   BetterHelp offers professional therapy with a licensed therapist carried out entirely online.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:32.480]   I've been doing weekly therapy for well over 30 years.
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:34.080]   Initially, I didn't have a choice.
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.400]   It was a condition of being allowed to stay in school.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.280]   But pretty soon, I realized that therapy is an extremely important component to overall health.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.920]   There are essentially three things that make up great therapy.
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.840]   First of all, it provides the opportunity to have a really good rapport with somebody that you can
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:51.440]   really trust and talk to about essentially any issue that you want.
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:56.160]   Second of all, it can provide support in the form of emotional support or directed guidance,
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:57.360]   or of course, both.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:12:00.720]   And third, expert therapy should provide you useful insights.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:03.680]   Insights that can help you improve in your work life, your relationships,
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:05.440]   and in your relationship with yourself.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.440]   With BetterHelp, they make it very easy for you to find an expert therapist who you resonate with,
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.800]   and that can provide those three benefits that come from expert therapy.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.080]   Also, because BetterHelp therapy is done entirely online,
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.040]   it's very time efficient and easy to fit into a busy schedule.
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.880]   There's no commuting to a therapist's office or sitting in a waiting room looking for parking,
[00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:23.520]   any of that.
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.920]   You just hop online and you do your session.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:32.080]   If you'd like to try BetterHelp, you can go to betterhelp.com/huberman to get 10% off your first month.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.360]   Again, that's betterhelp.com/huberman.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.280]   When you climb, I'm curious where your mental horizon is.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:46.960]   I can make up a story as a non-climber that your mental horizon is always on just the next maneuver,
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.880]   just getting further up and further over.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.480]   Sometimes, of course, you have to go down and up.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:57.280]   But that your time binning and your space binning is very, very close.
[00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:01.360]   But do you ever go into states where you're in automaticity?
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.560]   I mean, we hear about flow, right?
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:09.120]   But where you find yourself maneuvering as opposed to being hyper strategic about what's happening in the next
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.320]   five seconds, 10 seconds?
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:14.400]   Well, I think the aspiration is to be in that flow state, whatever you want to call it.
[00:13:14.400 --> 00:13:20.080]   But actually, I think even in the film, there's some quotes from me saying autopilot and things like,
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.400]   I'm aspiring to be on autopilot.
[00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.720]   So I'm aspiring to not be thinking too much about it.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:30.800]   And that's, for me at least, why it required so much practice was to be able to just do something
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:36.240]   almost by rote, you know, by through repetition, just to do the thing that you've practiced without
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.080]   having to think about it.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:43.680]   Because I think once you start thinking about it too much, you're just more prone to not just make errors,
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:46.800]   but just like get to get caught up in your own mind.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:48.400]   And I don't know.
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.560]   I mean, the aspiration was just to do the thing, like no thinking about it, no hesitation, you know,
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:14:00.400]   no emotional, you know, affect around it to just do it.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.720]   Is the kinesthetic aspect of it big?
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:09.440]   In other words, are you feeling your way through it as well as using vision?
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.560]   I mean, I imagine that these things start to blend.
[00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.800]   Yeah, I've actually never been asked something quite like that.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:19.760]   And some ways, I mean, the kinesthetic aspect is maybe the whole thing.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.200]   Like, I mean, it is kind of like dancing or something where you are just flowing over stone.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.600]   I mean, obviously you're looking around and you're looking at your footholds
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   and you're sort of placing your feet correctly that way.
[00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.640]   But really, you're just doing sequences.
[00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.640]   You're just flowing like your body is moving.
[00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:36.720]   I mean, I think when you climb well and particularly when you've rehearsed something
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.280]   and you know the climb really well, it feels like jogging or swimming or sort of other elemental
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:43.840]   movement patterns where it's just like your body doing what it's meant to do.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.040]   And it feels great.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:46.080]   You know, it's like it's really nice.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:52.880]   Do you ever surprise yourself still like that in training things, you know, I'm surprised that
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.160]   worked out and then stick with that kinesthetic sense.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:14:59.600]   I've been listening to an amazing book by Twyla Tharp.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.760]   She's a choreographer.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.480]   She was a ballerina.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.520]   She's a choreographer.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.560]   And she said that what distinguishes, you know, sort of virtuosity from mastery is that when
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.800]   you start to surprise yourself, I think you're certainly in that category of virtuoso.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:16.560]   So, um, how often does surprise come about for me personally?
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:19.840]   That's maybe my favorite moment in climbing is when you surprise yourself.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:23.360]   Um, and this isn't so much with free soloing because with free soloing, you don't want to
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.080]   be surprised, but, uh, but with a, but with a rope on, you know, you have moments all the
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:31.280]   time where you're sure you're about to fall because you're, you know, up against your physical
[00:15:31.280 --> 00:15:32.160]   limits or whatever.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:35.600]   And then you stick a move that you were sure you weren't going to.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:40.480]   Um, and you know, it doesn't happen that often, but when it does, you're like, oh, I exceeded
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.280]   my own expectations.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.400]   It's like, it's like the best feeling, you know, it happens from time to time in some ways.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:50.240]   Actually, I was telling my friends, I think that that might be, uh, one of the ways in
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:54.480]   which I see aging, you know, like as I'm getting older as a climber, I think I surprise myself less
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:54.800]   often.
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.720]   You know, I think it's like a 24 year old.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:58.400]   You just don't know your own limitations that much.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.280]   And you frequently surprise yourself where I'm like, wow, I really outdid myself.
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.920]   I really did something that I was sure I couldn't do, but I managed to do it.
[00:16:03.920 --> 00:16:09.120]   And now as a recent 40 year old, you know, like that happens from time to time for sure,
[00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:14.320]   but not all the time, you know, it's like, and now occasionally I have things where I was like,
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.520]   oh, I was sure I could do that. And, and then I failed, you know, and you're kind of like,
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.000]   oh, you can blame conditions. You can blame whatever, but you're kind of like, oh,
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:22.960]   I really thought I would do that. And I, and I fell off anyway. And you're like, damn it.
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:28.320]   What is the role of aging and climbing traditionally and how you're experiencing it? Like there are fields
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:34.080]   of science, like mathematics, where the, the stereotype is, uh, you know, it's a young person's game.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:37.200]   And then there are fields like biology, which is a bit more incremental and people can have
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:43.600]   fantastic discoveries and long careers that those are academic, uh, cerebral, uh, um, endeavors.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.680]   But, you know, we have our understanding of this for every sport, uh, for climbing,
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.320]   what's the lure for, um, climbing and for free soloists in particular, that it's an old man's
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:56.720]   game. It's a young man's game, woman's game. Excuse me. I don't, I don't think anybody calls
[00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:02.560]   free soloing an old man's game, but, um, but no, but it could be, but no, I think in general,
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.280]   climbing has more longevity than most sports, just because it's relatively low impact on your body.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:13.360]   It's very technique and like movement focused. And so it's not just pure physical strength that said,
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:17.280]   I mean, climbing is in the Olympics now and the people winning the Olympics are all sort of 18 to
[00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:22.480]   23 ish, you know, sort of same as gymnastics type of range. So I think at the most elite levels of
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:27.520]   climbing performance, it's kind of similar to gymnastics probably, but then to do interesting
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:34.240]   new things on real rock outdoors, I think there's a much wider latitude, you know, it's like, and then
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:38.400]   even into your fifties and sixties, there are plenty of climbers who are leading expeditions to new
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:42.480]   places, developing new climbs, you know, you know, doing things that are noteworthy and sort of meaningful
[00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:46.080]   for the climbing community, even though they're not necessarily cutting edge physically. So I think
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:51.280]   there's a lot of, a lot of opportunity for climbing more than most sports. And, and I think
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:55.360]   actually in the other big thing with climbing is that in so many other sports, I think ball sports,
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:18:00.480]   you know, NBA, NFL, baseball, whatever, it's kind of like, if you don't make the team, then you're done
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.640]   playing forever. Like you'll literally never play football again if you're not a professional
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:09.360]   football player. Whereas with climbing, even if you're not playing at the highest level, you can
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:13.520]   still go climb all the time and you can still do cool climbs. You can still do things that matter.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:17.200]   You can help teach, you can do whatever. And so you can kind of like stay in the game much,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:21.520]   much longer. You mentioned that climbing's in the Olympics. Now we see a lot of sports like
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.960]   skateboarding and climbing now in the Olympics. And these were sports that traditionally
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.160]   were done. You know, people just go to go to where these things were done. And it wasn't
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:32.400]   always recorded because there wasn't social media back then.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:35.920]   Well, more that there weren't smartphones, there weren't cameras that, you know, it's like,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.680]   it's not even about the social, it's about the whether or not you can record it easily.
[00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:45.280]   Mm-hmm. So I'm guessing there's a big influx of, of young kids getting into this now.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:50.160]   Do you see the sport progressing faster? And I'm also curious about the culture, whether or not,
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:54.720]   you know, like anytime a sport is in the Olympics, the thing is like, oh, it's kind of quote unquote
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:59.040]   sold out. Now it's going to change. It's going to become more commercial. So what's the culture
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.480]   within climbing about, about this big expansion? What are your thoughts?
[00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:06.720]   I mean, personally, I'm way into it. I mean, I was a kid that got into climbing, into climbing gym and,
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:11.200]   and it's changed my life for the better. You know, like I love climbing. I think it's great.
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   You know, I can certainly see the sort of commercial influx from the Olympics or sort of like
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.520]   more mainstream adoption of climbing, but that's kind of great. Cause I mean,
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:24.400]   most of my friends are sort of climbing industry adjacent professionals in some ways, you know,
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.120]   like they make, they're like coaches or dietitians or setters. Like they, they make the climbs that
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:34.400]   people climb on. Um, and so basically the bigger the industry gets, the more people like that
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:39.040]   can make a living doing the thing that they love to do, even if they're not necessarily
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:41.840]   sponsored professionals at the highest level. So I'm kind of like, you know,
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:46.800]   a broadening industry is kind of good for everybody. And mostly, I mean, climbing is awesome.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:50.880]   Like if people enjoy, you know, it's like, why not get into climbing? It's like, certainly,
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:54.080]   I mean, I think it's better than most other fitness modalities. You know, it's like, oh,
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:56.240]   why do CrossFit when you go rock climbing? It's way cooler.
[00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.200]   I mean, it certainly seems way more fun. That's for sure.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.640]   And you can do indoors or outdoors. There are probably certain aspects you wouldn't want
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:06.320]   to do alone for safety reasons. But, um, I think when people ask, like, what do you worry
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:09.040]   about with climbing culture and all that kind of stuff, like with the Olympics and the,
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.880]   the mainstream appeal kind of like, you know, if somebody wants to be a climber and only go
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.640]   to the climbing gym in a, in a major city for their entire life, like, that's great. Like,
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.320]   if they just want to climb plastic the rest of their life, that's still better than going to CrossFit
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.800]   or doing whatever else. I'm like, that's cool. Like, you don't have to go climb El Cap to be a climber.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.880]   I'm kind of like, people can do whatever they want. And I think, I think that's great for the sport.
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:35.920]   And you are seeing standards rise very quickly right now, sort of as a result,
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.240]   just like better access to gyms, more kids getting into it. You just see talent rise faster.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:47.200]   I come across social media accounts of parkour kids every once in a while doing absolutely insane
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.720]   stuff in urban terrains. Usually what's the crossover, if any, between parkour and climbing of
[00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.400]   the sort that you do? There's a little bit, not that much, but, uh, but climbers often
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.760]   like competition climbing, uh, like bouldering, which is in the Olympics has definitely taken a
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.560]   slight turn towards parkour sorts of moves, like big run and jumps and like crazy swings and things like
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:12.800]   that. And so some old school climbers complain that it's like gotten a little too jumpy, that type of
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.400]   bouldering. Um, but I'm kind of into it. I mean, it's, I don't know, this is all very like inside
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:21.840]   baseball. Like how do you separate, like basically the highest level competitors are all very, very
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.640]   strong. So then how do you separate these different competitors who are all climbing at an elite
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:30.480]   level? And one of the ways is complicated movement like that, like running jumps and coordination and
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:36.880]   things like that. So I don't know. I mean, I think it's cool. Um, I've actually met like a couple of
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:42.800]   professional parkour athletes who also climb, uh, and they are really good at very particular sorts of
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:47.440]   things. Like it's, I mean, it's amazing to see. Yeah. I mean, I, I find a lot of what they do
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:52.160]   terrifying, but also awesome. I can't help myself, but watch and, uh, just the motivation to work it
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:57.440]   out too, like, you know, because some of these are, are truly make or break or make or die. Um,
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:01.840]   at least in the, in the form they, they put to social media. So I'm always curious to like what
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.600]   goes into that and, you know, having grown up skateboarding, I mean, you go around a city and
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:09.200]   you see stuff, you know, like, oh, that would be awesome. And so, I mean, just looking at a
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:14.320]   landscape, natural or, or urban landscape in a completely different way, I see a lot of parallels with
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:19.040]   climbing and core and also, you know, I think of, uh, you at, you know, certainly at the level and
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:22.720]   kind of parallel with a guy like Tony Hawk, who's been in the sport of skateboarding for a very long
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.120]   time. He's a amazing ambassador for the sport as it's gone through its various, like, you know, peaks
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.520]   and valleys now in the Olympics. So I think climbing and, and sports like skateboarding and surfing have
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:35.600]   a lot in common in this way, subculture, but then also gets popular. Yeah. Where they kind of niche
[00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:39.120]   and then they become kind of mainstream, but then even once they're mainstream, they're still kind of cool,
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:43.440]   you know, like skateboarding. It's like definitely not like full punk rock anymore, but you're like,
[00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:48.400]   it's pretty cool, you know, like skateboarding still. And it's not that common still, you know,
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:51.520]   and that's the thing with climbing is I'm kind of like, yeah, climbing is growing, it's becoming more
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.160]   mainstream. It's just never going to be soccer or something. You know what I mean? Like, it's always
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:23:01.360]   going to be slightly niche, slightly counterculture, because it's just, you know, it's just a smaller
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.160]   thing. Like it's just not playing basketball or something. Yeah. I'm intrigued by the training
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:10.480]   aspects and some of the fitness aspects. I agree that it, I'm having only done it a little bit.
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:13.520]   I mean, I've been to a climbing gym once or twice. Yeah. I was going to have, so you've gone to the gym
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.160]   and stuff. Yeah, I've gone up and down the wall a few times. I've belayed for people a few times,
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:22.400]   but I am by no means, you know, skilled at it. It'd be fun to get into, because I, happy birthday,
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:28.240]   by the way, I just turned 40. I'm turning 50 soon. And I think more about, I'm happy with my strength
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:32.240]   and endurance, but I think more about mobility now. And also climbing is great for that.
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:37.680]   Climbing is great for that. And, and there's a lot of interesting literature on brain longevity
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.760]   and just maintaining your cognition and the strength of your, of your distal body. So toes and fingers,
[00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:47.360]   believe it or not, it's a correlate. Like, yeah, isn't that, isn't that, I've always thought that's
[00:23:47.360 --> 00:23:52.080]   just a correlation. It's just a correlation. Because yeah, like, because grip strength is just a proxy
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:55.520]   for all, like it means that you use your body a lot. And so therefore you're probably,
[00:23:56.080 --> 00:23:59.680]   you know, like when I read those things about like, if you have strong grip, it means this and
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:03.040]   this and this, I'm like, no, if you have a strong grip, it means that you do stuff all the time.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:07.120]   And so as a result of doing stuff all the time, you're probably sharper than, than somebody who
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:11.520]   doesn't do stuff all the time. That's right. So it's a correlate. Um, at the same time, the,
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:15.760]   the motor neurons that control like trunk movements and contraction of the trunk muscles,
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:19.680]   like, as you go out from the midline, they are, they're in layers in the spinal cord. So they're
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:25.360]   literally like the, the muscle, the motor neurons that control like the core sit closer to the,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:30.880]   sit closer to, in the spinal cord to the midline. And then, you know, across evolution, like, you know,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:34.960]   we evolved from animals with fins and, and wings and some of the same genes are used. And eventually
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:39.760]   you get motor neurons that control like fine motor movements like this. And it is true that for some
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.360]   reason, the motor neurons that control the, the distal body, so toes and fingers, calves and forearms
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:51.520]   are more vulnerable to age related degeneration than the ones for the, for the core. So by, so it is
[00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:56.080]   possible, we don't know yet that by maintaining strength of the, of the distal body that you can
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:25:01.680]   actually, um, preserve motor neuron and cognitive function. And I'm freaking, I'm psyched.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:06.000]   And you're set. And that's why I was curious how climbers provided they don't fall and kill themselves,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.560]   how they age. Um, and there's other things here too, because like in some sports like football
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:15.040]   and rugby, people are getting their hit, head hit a lot. So you don't tend to age well, but I always
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:19.280]   thought of climbers, you know, in my time up in Yosemite, I'd see young guys like you and I'd see these
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:24.800]   like old, like these old climbers. And I was like, man, these guys are in incredible shape. They're lean,
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.440]   they're live, they, they seem cognitively fresh. So it seems like it's a sport where people hold on to
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:34.080]   their faculties pretty well. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think, um, you know, it's hard to say,
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:38.880]   cause there just aren't that many super old climbers. And then a lot of the ones that come
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:42.960]   to mind, like sort of famous old climbers, you know, I mean, they die the same ways that everybody
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:46.400]   dies, you know, like cancer or heart disease or whatever, but like in their late eighties or
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:51.920]   whatever. Um, no, I mean, I think climbing is a great way to age. I mean, I have a bunch of friends
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:56.560]   who are sort of fifties and sixties who are very fit. Like actually, uh, I mean, it comes to mind.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.680]   There's a, this friend of mine who's a philosophy professor at UNLV at the university, but he's
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:06.640]   incredibly jacked and I think he's 64 now. I think he just became the oldest person to climb a certain
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:10.320]   grade, like 514, which is like kind of an elite rock climbing grade. But I think he's maybe the
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:15.600]   oldest person to have done that now. But, um, but he once told me that he was at some hotel pool,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.120]   like in middle America, like some conference or something. And some kid asked if he could touch his
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:24.800]   abs cause he'd never seen, he was like, are they real? You know, like real cause he's like, yeah,
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:28.880]   he's like a 48 year old professor. He was like shredded. And some, some kid in the pool was like,
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:31.840]   can I touch those? Is that real? You know, like I've never seen a thing like that.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:38.320]   It says a lot about him and about the state of our country right now. We are in this crisis of obesity
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.960]   that's very serious. Uh, it goes beyond aesthetics. Um, yeah, I've, I've thought about getting into
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:48.400]   climbing. I mean, it it's, um, the problem I had is I tried to just, uh, raw strength it. I just
[00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:53.600]   tried to pull up my way a lot. Obviously that's, that's foolish. It's and you gas out really fast.
[00:26:53.600 --> 00:26:57.360]   Yeah. That's a very common thing for adults. I mean, especially men, especially somebody like
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.960]   you is already fit. And so you try to bring the tool you already have to it. And you're like,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:07.360]   no, you gotta drive with your legs, go technique, mobility. Like, you know, I like to say that anybody
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:11.600]   that tries climbing should think of it as climbing a really, really steep staircase where it's like,
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.560]   you're still walking up the stairs and you're using the handrail to for balance, but you're not pulling
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.360]   yourself up the handrail. And most of climbing is basically a steep staircase. You know, I mean,
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:24.480]   especially outdoors and in climbing gyms is a little bit different because the wall is actually
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.400]   vertical, but outdoors, the wall is almost always a little bit less than vertical. So it's like,
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:32.000]   basically you're on a very, very steep and technical staircase. And then you're using the handrail,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:35.760]   like the handholds to keep you balanced on the wall, but your legs should always be driving you.
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.560]   - I still haven't done Half Dome. - Never? You've done Clouds Rest a bunch of times?
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:42.560]   - No, I've done Clouds Rest a bunch of times, run Clouds Rest, Ruck Clouds Rest.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.520]   - That's weird. - But Half Dome has those cables.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.440]   Yeah, yeah. I never was organized enough to do the sign up early enough in the season.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:52.560]   - No, but just do it after the permits. - Oh yeah.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:58.560]   - You know, the cables stay up all year. So when it's out of season, they take the uprights down,
[00:27:58.560 --> 00:28:02.560]   but the cables just sit there and you can do it anytime. It's actually way better to do it post,
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:06.400]   like after the season, because there's no permit and there are no people and it's like super chill.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.520]   - Okay. I definitely want to do it. - Yeah. Just do it, do it off season. It's way better.
[00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:13.200]   - My biggest concern is not that I'm going to fall. It's that someone above me is going to fall.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:17.040]   - Well, you're strong enough to just glance them off, you know, just like shrug them aside.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.760]   - Possibly. I did hear about it. - Or ideally stop them.
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:24.480]   - Yeah, ideally stop them. Yeah. I'd love to do that. I've been going to Yosemite since I was in my teens.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.120]   I love it up there. It's, I wouldn't say it's my second home, but it's heaven. I mean, as you know,
[00:28:29.120 --> 00:28:34.480]   and actually one of the reasons I'm excited to talk to you among others is that I would like more
[00:28:34.480 --> 00:28:39.840]   people to get into the national parks and, and really enjoy them. Cause there, we have so many
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:44.080]   gems and Yosemite, the high country in Tuolumne Meadows to me is like, is, is heaven on earth.
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:48.320]   - No, Yosemite, I mean, is a crown jewel. I mean, it's the, I think it's the best,
[00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:53.040]   best national park in the country. - Yeah. People forget it's only about a four hour drive from the Bay Area
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:56.080]   or from Los Angeles. It's pretty quick. You go through a bunch of different landscapes and then boom,
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:59.200]   suddenly you're there. - Yeah. And it's like paradise. It's incredible.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:07.680]   - I'm curious about things in free soloing that as a uninformed spectator, we think, oh, you know,
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:13.440]   that's the hardest part. That's, that's the most difficult thing. But I imagine inside of the sport,
[00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:18.880]   like any, that there are things that are very difficult and maybe even perilous that we're not
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:24.240]   aware of. Like what's some of the non-obvious aspects of free soloing if they exist? Because I always
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:31.360]   think, okay, you know, if I can imagine, oh, that's super tough, but that might be the easier or less
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:35.520]   tough. Usually there are these kind of a hidden, I don't want to call them hidden dangers, but hidden
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:39.440]   dangers in a sport. What, what are some things that the observer wouldn't, wouldn't be aware of?
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:42.720]   - Yeah. I'm not sure. I'm not sure what the hidden dangers are. I would say though,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:48.320]   that the, the obvious visual dangers, like for a non climber, just watching free soloing,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.880]   I think they generally misperceive all the dangers and risks involved. You know,
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:55.600]   they just see and they're like, that's crazy. That's whatever, you know, and like whatever
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:30:00.880]   they're bringing to it, it's probably not the actual case. Just because it's hard to visually
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:05.040]   tell what's challenging in climbing, you know, you're like, that's a vertical wall. But if it's
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:08.480]   like a nice crack going over a vertical wall, that's actually quite easy and secure climbing.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.120]   But then some of the other stuff, you know, if they're really small holes, you're trusting your feet,
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.800]   I don't know. I mean, it's, it's just really hard to judge that stuff visually. Like you have to do it
[00:30:16.800 --> 00:30:22.240]   to, to experience it. But I think that, that honestly, the whole perception of risk around
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.880]   free soloing is maybe slightly misperceived by people. So with climbing in general, like if you go
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:31.760]   climbing with a rope, uh, like if you're traditional climbing, like you're climbing with a rope and gear,
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:35.120]   and you're going to climb half dome, let's say, when you start climbing from the ground, you go some
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:38.480]   distance before you put your first piece of gear in, because that's just kind of the nature of
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:41.680]   climbing. You go for a ways and you put in some gear, you clip your rope into it, and then you're protected.
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:46.160]   And then for whatever distance you're going, you're essentially free soloing to that point.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.760]   You know, like there's always risk involved in climbing, because even if you have a rope on,
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:53.120]   depending how far you're going above your last piece of gear and, you know, what the train is
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:57.200]   like and whether or not the rock is good and all these other factors, you know, you're more or less
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:01.120]   safe. And so I think people look at free soloing as like this binary, like if you don't have a rope,
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:05.680]   that's dangerous. And you're kind of like, well, anytime you're climbing, there are dangers,
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:09.360]   or there could be, and you're constantly evaluating those and trying to mitigate them.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:15.520]   So I think that's, that's the big misperception because easy free soloing is probably like,
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:20.080]   if I'm somebody, you know, who's like an expert rock climber or whatever, I've been climbing 30 years,
[00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:24.400]   if I'm on an easy free solo, that's almost certainly safer than a very hard,
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.600]   certain types of hard climbing with a rope on, you know, and most of my scariest experience as a
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.520]   climber actually have been with a rope on, because with a rope, you're much more willing to push
[00:31:33.520 --> 00:31:37.280]   yourself into unknown terrain. Because you're kind of like, surely there'll be something good just around the
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.440]   corner. And so you keep going around the corner and you keep not getting good gear and you're like,
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.840]   holy shit, it's getting scarier and scarier. Are we allowed to curse?
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.880]   Sure. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:47.840]   Yeah. So, you know, like even at each other, if you want to curse.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:48.800]   Yeah. Perfect.
[00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:52.640]   But so a lot of my scariest experience has been with a rope on because you're kind of like,
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.360]   I'm sure it'll get better. I'm sure it'll get better. And it keeps getting worse and worse.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.960]   And then pretty soon you're in some position where you're definitely going to die if you fall,
[00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:02.400]   but you never would have climbed into that position if you didn't have a rope on,
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   because you're just so much more conservative when you're ropeless. And when you're ropeless,
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:09.840]   you're kind of like, if something seems wrong, you just go down, you know, because you're just not
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:14.640]   going to push that far. I saw the movie Maru. I thought that was pretty intense.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:18.800]   I mean, that's an example of pushing really freaking far with a rope on, you know,
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:21.360]   it's like, because you have a rope, you're willing to just keep pushing into the unknown,
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.000]   pushing into the unknown. But then you wind up in a position where you're like,
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   this is pretty freaking extreme. You know, it's like, I mean, you saw the film, it's all totally insane.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:32.560]   Yeah, it is insane. And I feel like ice and snow bring a whole other dimension.
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:40.960]   Yeah. I think that in your sport and free soloing, like the idea from the spectator side is,
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   you know, like these guys, like one fall and they're dead. Right. I've heard you say before,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.960]   that's actually not true. I mean, yeah, it's kind of, you don't want to fall, but yeah,
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:53.680]   like, yeah, it's true that most places, if you fall off, you're going to die. But like when I started
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:59.120]   free soloing as a kid, not that I like started and then only did that, but on my first free solos,
[00:32:59.120 --> 00:33:02.880]   when I was young, in the back of my mind, it would be like, if you slip, you'll die. You know,
[00:33:02.880 --> 00:33:06.960]   and the reality is that there are tons of places where your foot can slip and nothing else moves,
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:10.400]   you know, like your hands are locked on, you're holding on tight and your foot slipped and you're
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.000]   just kind of like, oh, my foot slipped and you keep climbing. It's no big deal. I mean,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.600]   there are also some places where if your foot slips, you're going to die for sure. And the key is
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.880]   differentiating between those. But I think when I started, you know, it was like,
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:24.160]   if anything happens, you'll die. And as you do it more, you're actually like,
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:28.560]   no, I mean, a lot of things can happen and it'll be fine. You just have to make sure that
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:30.160]   the wrong thing doesn't happen at the wrong time.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:37.760]   I was surprised to hear you say that, yes, free soloists die, but oftentimes they died not free
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:43.280]   soloing. They die doing other things. I'm fascinated by this, not through a morbid fascination, but for
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.080]   a number of reasons. So maybe you could elaborate on that a little bit.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:49.920]   Yeah, there's a there's a quote in the film Free Solo where a friend of mine, Tommy Caldwell,
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:54.800]   who's a very well-known climber, says something like, all the people who are big free solos are
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:59.280]   dead now. And it kind of implies like, you know, free soling is dangerous and they all died soling.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:04.000]   But the reality is that basically none of them died soling. Like one or two solos have died soling,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:08.160]   though my preferred statistic is that no one has ever died doing something cutting edge.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:12.720]   So like no one has ever died pushing the envelope, like doing something extreme.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:16.800]   There have been a couple of free solos who have died free soling easy terrain, like just out doing
[00:34:16.800 --> 00:34:21.280]   something casual and maybe a hold breaks or maybe something happens, like it's impossible to know
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:27.600]   what because they die. But then the bulk of other people who are sort of known for free soling have
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:33.040]   died either in parachuting accidents like wingsuiting or base jumping, or one got swept out to see by a
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.120]   rogue wave. It's kind of a freak thing. One died in a car accident, you know, just like things like,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.720]   you know, it's basically just ways that people die. So all that I say, it's not clear that free
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:48.800]   soling is the most dangerous. We have a friend who unfortunately is dead now, Ken Block, who is a
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:55.040]   famous rally car driver and did with our photographer here at the podcast, Mike Blayback, and film crews
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:02.000]   with DC did, he developed, he was one of the founders of DC, like DC Shoes, DC Skateboarding, etc., rally
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.920]   car, unfortunately died in a snowmobiling accident. So something very like,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:12.400]   kind of conventional for his daily life. He lived out in Utah and, you know, obviously a huge tragedy.
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:18.560]   And then you go look at kind of people who do quote unquote extreme sports, for lack of a better term,
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:25.200]   and you find that it's fairly common for people who are at the peak of their, of a field, of a sport,
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:32.400]   to die doing something else that they really enjoy. And you kind of wonder like, are they pushing themselves,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:36.160]   or is it that they're, they're just too, a little too relaxed? Because as you said, rarely do free
[00:35:36.160 --> 00:35:41.520]   soloists die, like in the most difficult aspects of the climb. So maybe it's that letting go of the
[00:35:41.520 --> 00:35:44.800]   mental engagement. Like there's a change in the threshold of what they consider dangerous. So unless
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:49.680]   they need to be locked in, there's just some lack of attention to detail. This is my way of trying to
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.920]   save your life basically saying anything you're doing besides free soloing, be very, very careful.
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:58.400]   Reign it in. Yeah, we need you. No, I mean, I also would suspect that all the people that we're talking
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:03.200]   about are all just a little, they're just bigger risk takers in general. They're just more willing
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:09.360]   to do things like drive quickly and, you know, do whatever. Just more willing to take risk in their
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.080]   life. And, and I suppose sooner or later, those things catch up with you or they can. Yeah.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:18.400]   Though that said with free soloing, two of the world's best free soloists from the previous
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:23.440]   generations are still alive, you know, older men just living their best lives, doing their thing.
[00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:28.720]   Still free soloing. Yeah. Uh, maybe not at like a super high level, maybe not pushing themselves hard,
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:33.760]   but yeah, like certainly could. So, um, man named Peter Croft, he's a Canadian, but has lived in the
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:38.080]   US forever. He was like my childhood hero growing up and he's incredible. So actually there's a film with
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.960]   him or a scene with him in the film free solo. He's kind of like a, they kind of frame him as like a
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:46.400]   mentor figure though. Honestly, he wasn't a mentor cause I was too afraid to ever even talk to him
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.240]   cause he was like such a personal hero, but I mean, he's such a, he's incredible, but he's super nice
[00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:55.040]   guy. And so I'm, uh, we're both sponsored by the North Face now. So we're friends, we're on the same
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:59.120]   team. And so I've like hung out with him at events and things. And I was having dinner with him once.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:03.840]   I was kind of like, Oh, what point did you kind of end the cutting edge free soloing? And he was like,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.640]   Oh, actually I did a couple of my hardest solos, like in terms of grades, like not necessarily the most
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.840]   cutting edge, but kind of the hardest grades within the last several years.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:16.800]   And I was like, really? And he'd still, you know, he's still just like kind of doing stuff and fit
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:22.400]   and he's psyched and, and he's gotta be, I don't know. I don't want to offend him, but he's gotta
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:27.360]   be like mid fifties or like maybe 60. Like, you know, he's, uh, yeah. And he's just still incredible.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.720]   He's still climbing all the time. And even on his rest days, he goes down into the same climbing
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.160]   areas to hang out with his friends and chit chat and like take his dog to the cliff and stuff.
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:38.080]   So, you know, I look at somebody like him, who's basically made an entire life of free
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:42.160]   soloing. And I'm kind of like, you know, if you do it carefully, you, you know, make good decisions.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.200]   I don't think it has to be sketchy.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:49.120]   How awesome is it that you're friends and coworkers with one of your childhood heroes?
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:52.240]   Oh, that's the best. That's actually, I think one of the best things about being a professional climber
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:56.080]   is so many of the people that I was, that I looked up to as a kid, you know,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.400]   and our friends and peers and things are like, Oh, it's so great.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:37:59.040]   It's wild.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.680]   Yeah. Yeah. You get to like, hang out with your heroes and you're like, oh, it turns
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:01.680]   up.
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.240]   Never would have imagined.
[00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.920]   Yeah. No, it's amazing.
[00:38:03.920 --> 00:38:10.160]   There's some, uh, young kid out there now thinking the same. He's like, I'm too afraid to go up to Alex
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.320]   and say hello. Uh, and, uh,
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.280]   They should just say hello.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:13.760]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:14.240]   I don't know.
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:16.400]   But in the same way that, right.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.040]   Yeah, totally.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:20.640]   I mean, in the same way that I was like, so afraid to ever talk to Peter when I was young. And then
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:24.560]   ultimately now he's just another nice guy and we're friends, we climb together. It's great.
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.640]   Sort of like, yeah, anybody should just say hi. You know, it's like, if they're at the,
[00:38:28.640 --> 00:38:32.000]   if we're at the cliff, like come chat, you know, it's like, we're all doing the same thing.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:39.120]   I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1. AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:44.800]   drink that also includes prebiotics and adaptogens. As many of you know, I've been taking AG1 for more
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:50.720]   than 13 years now. I discovered it way back in 2012, long before I ever had a podcast. And I've been
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:55.920]   drinking it every day since. For the past 13 years, AG1 has been the same original flavor.
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:00.480]   They've updated the formulation, but the flavor has always remained the same. And now for the first
[00:39:00.480 --> 00:39:06.160]   time, AG1 is available in three new flavors, berry, citrus, and tropical. All the flavors include the
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.640]   highest quality ingredients in exactly the right doses to together provide support for your gut
[00:39:10.640 --> 00:39:15.600]   microbiome, support for your immune health and support for better energy and more. So now you can
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.160]   find the flavor of AG1 that you like the most. Well, I've always loved the AG1 original flavor,
[00:39:20.160 --> 00:39:23.520]   especially when I mix it with water and a little bit of lemon or lime juice. That's how I've been
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:29.200]   doing it for basically 13 years. Now I really enjoy the new berry flavor in particular. It tastes great
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:32.320]   and I don't have to add any lemon or lime juice. I just mix it up with water.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:38.720]   If you'd like to try AG1 and these new flavors, you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim a
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:44.160]   special offer. Right now, AG1 is giving away an AG1 welcome kit that includes five free travel packs and
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:51.040]   a free bottle of vitamin D3, K2. Again, go to drinkag1.com/huberman to claim the special welcome
[00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:56.800]   kit of five free travel packs and a free bottle of vitamin D3, K2. Today's episode is also brought to
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:03.200]   us by Maui Nui venison. Maui Nui venison is the most nutrient dense and delicious red meat available.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.960]   It's also ethically sourced. Maui Nui hunts and harvest wild access deer on the island of Maui.
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:14.160]   This solves the problem of managing an invasive species while also creating an extraordinary source
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:18.640]   of protein. As I've discussed on this podcast before, most people should aim for getting one
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.600]   gram of quality protein per pound of body weight each day. This allows for optimal muscle protein
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:29.040]   synthesis while also helping to reduce appetite and support proper metabolic health. Given Maui Nui's
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.640]   exceptional protein to calorie ratio, this protein target is achievable without having to eat too many
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:41.120]   calories. Their venison delivers 21 grams of protein with only 107 grams per serving, which is an ideal
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:46.080]   ratio for those of us concerned with maintaining or increasing muscle mass while supporting metabolic
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:52.000]   health. They have venison steaks, ground venison, and venison bone broth. I personally love all of them.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.480]   In fact, I probably eat a Maui Nui venison burger pretty much every day. And if I don't do that,
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.720]   I eat one of their steaks. And sometimes I also consume their bone broth. And if you're on the go,
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:06.240]   they have Maui Nui venison sticks, which have 10 grams of protein per stick with just 55 calories.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.720]   I eat at least one of those a day to meet my protein requirements. Right now, Maui Nui is offering
[00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:15.840]   Huberman podcast listeners a limited collection of my favorite cuts and products. It's perfect for anyone
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.640]   looking to improve their diet with delicious, high quality protein. Supplies are limited, so go to
[00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:29.040]   MauiNuiVenison.com/Huberman to get access to this high quality meat today. Again, that's MauiNuiVenison.com/Huberman.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:36.240]   Do most climbers as they're coming up, if they have aspirations to be, you know, great free soloists
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.040]   or other types of climbers, do they tend to work and do other things? Or is this like a, you're like all
[00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:47.120]   in your, it's lifestyle. You live in a van. I mean, you can do that also after achieving some degree of
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.040]   financial success. We know you've done that. We can talk about that, but is it the kind of thing where
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:55.920]   you have to give up other aspects of life in order to get really, really good at it? That's an interesting
[00:41:55.920 --> 00:42:01.920]   question. I'm not totally sure because in some ways, so it depends what you mean by achieving success as a
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:05.840]   climber, because if you're trying to climb the hardest grades or go to the Olympics or things like that, in
[00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:10.320]   some ways you're almost better off being a university student or something like having a structured
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:15.600]   schedule that in some ways limits the amount that you can climb. Because, you know, I don't know enough
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.760]   about other sports, but I suspect this is akin to like power lifting or something where it's like,
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:23.600]   if you're trying to be really, really strong, you kind of only need to do a little bit every couple
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:29.440]   days and then recover. And so for a sort of elite physical training for climbing, you really only need,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:33.920]   you know, say three or four hour sessions, four or five days a week. And then it's like, what do you do
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.160]   with the rest of your time? And so like, you might as well have a job or, and so a lot of my friends
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:43.680]   who like write code for a living or, you know, do things like that are very, very strong climbers because of the,
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:48.960]   the, the schedule that it allows the structure. That said, I think if you want to be a great free
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:53.440]   solist or like a big adventure climber, you're probably better off living in a van and just
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:43:00.800]   doing the thing nonstop because for that, you're not trying to have that peak muscular performance.
[00:43:00.800 --> 00:43:05.200]   You're trying to just learn a skill and do something all the time. And so then like hours of practice,
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:10.320]   I think matter more. Anyway, maybe we talk a little bit about recovery as long as we're talking about,
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.680]   you know, number of hours that one puts in. I'm sure your recovery looks different than it used to.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:22.960]   But what, what do you do to recover between sessions? Are you a big believer in sauna, cold?
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:26.880]   Is it just basically sleep? No, I like push my three-year-old on the swings, you know,
[00:43:26.880 --> 00:43:31.840]   like that's how it recovers. I like play with the kids on the swings and, and I try to, I mean,
[00:43:31.840 --> 00:43:36.320]   you know, I try to eat relatively well. I try to sleep enough. Like I do all the basics for recovery,
[00:43:36.320 --> 00:43:41.840]   but, um, but no, I mean, I basically just survive in between. I was actually just joking with somebody
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:47.840]   that I think, you know, as a, as a 24 year old living by myself in a van, I would have crazy days
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.440]   of climbing. And then on a rest day, I would like binge watch an entire season of some show while
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.440]   eating an entire flat Oreos, just like never even leave the bed of my van. And then the next day go
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:00.240]   out and like do a speed record on something and just be like, I'm so psyched, you know? And now I'm like,
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:05.280]   I'm definitely not doing that now or at least no, I haven't done that in forever. Cause I just don't
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.480]   have the time and don't have, um, yeah. So I think now it takes a little more effort to recover
[00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:15.360]   and it's just a little slower probably. But it's hard to say though, because a lot of that's just
[00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:20.480]   having kids and just having different demands of, of time in life. But it sounds like climbers are,
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:25.040]   are pretty, uh, grassroots in their, in their training and techniques. Like, you know, in a lot of other
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:30.160]   areas. Yeah. I mean, I was living in a van. I was basically like, you know, super low overhead,
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:35.280]   no, no team, no support. I'm just living in a car doing the thing nonstop for, uh, you know, a decade.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:42.080]   And so that's a pretty scrappy approach. And I think that, that in the years since then climbing
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:45.360]   is professionalized a little bit and there's a little more money, there's a little more support
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:50.960]   and there's just a higher level of competition. I think, um, it'd be harder to, to achieve things
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.280]   doing just that now. I think you'd have to have a little more of a plan.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.800]   Yeah. I can't help, but sense that hyperbaric chambers and red light and massage guns and
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:45:00.640]   all that are going to be making their way into the climate culture.
[00:45:00.640 --> 00:45:04.400]   Well, massage guns for sure are there. Yeah, massage guns are there. I tried to like roll
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:07.760]   out every once in a while, even when I was living in my van, I would stretch and roll out and those
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:10.240]   types of things. Cause you just kind of have to stay supple.
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.760]   Yeah. How do you feel? How's your body feel?
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:17.040]   Well, I mean, right now I think pretty good. I don't know. Yeah. When I'm, um, I live in Las Vegas,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.440]   when I'm at home, I try to see this body worker in town once a week, Pat, sweet Pat, he's the man.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:27.120]   And so, uh, you know, I think of that as kind of like a basic, just taking care of,
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:30.800]   uh, you know, making, it's like an oil change. It's like making sure the engine runs smoothly.
[00:45:30.800 --> 00:45:36.960]   And, and I think as a result of body work like that, I haven't had any major like overuse injuries
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:39.760]   and in years. And so like, that's, that's pretty good for me.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:44.560]   Awesome. Yeah. Maybe it's just because it's historically, it was what I knew, but I'm seeing
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:49.120]   so many parallels with skateboarding where like, there was this time when no skateboarders lifted
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:50.960]   weights or did any kind of fitness. Yeah, totally.
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.280]   Then that started to happen. Actually, Danny Wei jumped the Great Wall of China. He was kind of the
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:59.760]   first person in skateboarding to like, he would do like neck training because he had broken his neck
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:04.880]   surfing in Newport. And he was doing like these, um, you know, like the, where you like swing the
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.800]   ball above your head. He was doing core work. And I remember back then thinking, uh, I sort of left
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:09.920]   skateboarding at that point. Yeah, it was all fringe.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:14.320]   And I was thinking like, like skateboarders are just like really have a problem with this because
[00:46:14.320 --> 00:46:19.040]   it wasn't consistent with the culture. Now there are a lot of guys who, who work out and take care
[00:46:19.040 --> 00:46:25.440]   of their bodies, but there are still a lot of guys who absolutely kill it. They're incredible. And their
[00:46:25.440 --> 00:46:31.760]   energy drink is like a beer and their, uh, quote unquote, nootropic is cigarettes and, and they murder it.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:37.120]   They're super good. And, and so I, I like these sports where it's like, you can't get around just
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:42.000]   investing a massive number of hours doing it. And then there, you can either take the,
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.320]   the kind of rock and roll track into it, or you can take the kind of self-care track
[00:46:46.320 --> 00:46:50.480]   and sometimes people cross over, but yeah, you know, it works either way. It really does.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:54.160]   Climbing still has that exact same thing going on where you can kind of go either way.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:57.680]   I do think though that the self-care track will obviously went out long-term. I mean,
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:47:00.560]   that's the thing with the climbing and being in the Olympics and just the professionalism,
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:04.720]   all that. I mean, obviously self-care is better for you long-term like, you know,
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:10.320]   everybody knows that that said you still see a lot of very proficient climbers who,
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:15.040]   yeah, exactly. Just kind of party, go hard. I mean, cause so much of climbing just comes down to
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:18.880]   effort when you're doing the thing. Like if you go climbing several days a week and you try your
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.160]   absolute hardest, every time you're climbing, you're going to get pretty freaking good.
[00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:26.240]   You know, whether you do red light therapy or like any of the weird other stuff or not.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.600]   So it's like, I mean, it really just comes down to your effort doing the thing. And so,
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:33.120]   yeah, I mean, you could live. And I mean, a lot of climbers, especially in the past,
[00:47:33.120 --> 00:47:39.040]   lived on a diet of, of, you know, cigarettes and coffee and, and freaking beer. And, you know,
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:43.040]   you can, you can, you can get by that way. Yeah. The 1970s eighties approach.
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.720]   It's not ideal. It's not ideal. A friend of mine, Tom Bilyeu, he is very successful in business. He also
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:52.960]   has a podcast. He was saying to me the other day, he goes, yeah, basically, uh, when young people ask him,
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:58.240]   you know, how to get good at whatever business or anything, he just tells them, um, work as if,
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:02.480]   um, smartphones didn't exist. Meaning when you're bored, go work on the thing. When you don't have
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:07.120]   anything, like if you get rid, I'm not encouraging people get rid of their smartphone, but I'm curious
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:11.120]   about your relationship to technology, because I think nowadays, even though there are people training
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:17.600]   for the Olympics and whatnot, that it is very hard to, to, uh, disengage from pressures of sponsors,
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:22.720]   pressures of just sheer communications. Right. Um, and if you're coming up this idea that
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:26.960]   you always have to be in contact with people, you, it limits the total number of reps that you're,
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.640]   that you get physically, but also mentally. Cause I imagine there was a lot of times sitting back in
[00:48:30.640 --> 00:48:35.280]   bed and thinking about climbing. Um, just like I used to sit back in bed and think about experiments.
[00:48:35.280 --> 00:48:39.440]   And, you know, when I was in graduate school, now I'd probably, if that phones that exist,
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.720]   I'd probably be on my phone. Yeah.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.720]   I used to think about experiments and figures and what would this work and that work. So what are your
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.680]   thoughts on kind of a mental, um, uh, engagement separate from climbing?
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:54.240]   No, I think that's, that's definitely a big thing. I mean, I think I've, I've thought in the past that
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:58.880]   in some ways I feel kind of lucky that I came up when I did in climbing where it's like sort of pre
[00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.600]   smartphone, pre social pre, you know, you just live in your car and you do the thing and that's it. And
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:09.840]   that's your whole lifestyle. Um, I mean, currently, you know, I, I have all the social media, uh,
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:13.600]   accounts and things, but I don't have any of the apps on my phone. I have a friend that manages it for me.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:17.040]   Um, I like send all the content to her, but she posts stuff. And so it's a nice way to sort of
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:23.280]   disconnect myself from, from scrolling aimlessly. Um, I don't really have the time anymore. Anyway,
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:27.920]   you know, it's like, I'd rather play with my kids and then for sure scroll, uh, you know, it's like,
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:33.760]   but no, I mean, that's, that's tough. I mean, I think it'd be hard to be a kid now growing up,
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:37.200]   like thinking that that's the norm that you like have to be connected, that you have to be
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.840]   capturing everything, you know, documenting and then sharing it and posting and just all the stuff.
[00:49:42.480 --> 00:49:45.280]   I've always felt like the thing about being a professional climber is that you just have
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:48.880]   to be a good climber. Like first and foremost, the key to being a professional climber is being able
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:54.000]   to climb really well. And like the most important thing is doing the thing. And I just think when
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:58.800]   you get caught up in all the posting, sharing, streaming, all the, whatever, that's not doing
[00:49:58.800 --> 00:50:02.800]   the thing, you know, but, but it's easy to conflate them and it's, I don't know.
[00:50:03.600 --> 00:50:04.960]   Yeah, no, I think it'd be really hard.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:10.160]   Yeah, I agree completely. And the hidden secret is that if you want something interesting to show
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:14.000]   on social media, the key is to not be on social media. So you have something to bring to it.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.160]   It's just so hard to actually be good at something. And it's, and then this is goes back to what we were
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.240]   just talking about with free soling and perceived risk and all that kind of stuff is just really easy
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:27.040]   to make something look rad. So long wise, like, you know, I could climb, I could climb the outside of
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:30.320]   this building and it would like look insane. It would get tons of likes people think it's cool, but it's not
[00:50:30.320 --> 00:50:36.320]   cutting edge. It's not cool. It's not even hard. Like it's not, it's, it's whatever, but to actually
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:41.280]   do something that's cutting edge or newsworthy and climbing, it's pretty freaking hard, you know,
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:46.160]   and the challenge with, with social and with public, all that kind of stuff is that it's just so easy to,
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:50.320]   I don't want to say to fake it because it's not like people are out there like trying to be
[00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:56.640]   duplicitous or like to, to trick you, but it's just, you can get the same splash with none of the effort,
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:00.960]   you know, and through, through social stuff. I think you're like, oh, I just did something easy
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:04.640]   and people thought it was amazing. Let's call that good. And you're like, well, that's just not good
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:08.160]   because it's easy. It's freaking, you know, like it's not cutting edge. It's not rad.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:13.680]   I mean, you clearly go after big, big goals. I mean, it's, it's, it's a, it's a giant goal. I think it
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:18.080]   really stands. And I know you've been told this many times before. So, um, if it embarrasses you in a
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:24.400]   positive way, then great. Um, I mean, it, it stands as perhaps at least one of the, the most impressive
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:31.120]   physical feats in history, because the risk consequence, uh, scenario there was you fall,
[00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:34.400]   you can potentially die. There may have been moments along the, along the climb where-
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:37.440]   Brief moments where you're right above a ledge. You're like, oh wow.
[00:51:37.440 --> 00:51:41.760]   Yeah. So, okay. So, and it's, and it's so like you to, to point out those moments as
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:47.200]   opposed to all the other moments. It really speaks to your mindset. Um, but I think that going after big
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:53.520]   things, I mean, you know, uh, you know, building, um, rockets to go to the moon.
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:57.120]   I remember when I was a kid, Danny Wade decided to jump the Great Wall of China to do it live.
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:00.880]   So when it died, trying it on a mountain bike, I remember thinking, I watched it on a little screen
[00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.840]   this big and I was like, I've known that guy since, uh, we're out of touch now, but, um, for the most
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:12.080]   part, but since it was like 13 and he was always going after big things, jumping out of helicopters,
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.760]   you know, jumping the Great Wall of China, like, you know, and then there were people who just
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:21.120]   push themselves. And so what, what I wonder is on a daily basis, when you climb, um,
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:27.600]   do you ever just climb for fun? When you climb, are you always working on something? And
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:33.920]   there's this famous scene in free solo, like more or less immediately after you got down from the climb,
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.120]   you're, you're fingerboarding again, and like you're, you're training and you're enjoying your,
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:41.600]   your routine. Um, which by the way is consistent with keeping the dopamine flowing for process,
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:46.480]   as opposed to like the postpartum depression that many people experience after a big feed is completed,
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:49.680]   selling a big company, et cetera. You avoid all that by doing exactly what you're doing.
[00:52:49.680 --> 00:52:55.200]   But then how quickly did your mind pivot to like, okay, what's next? Uh, in the domain of climbing,
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:59.600]   because I realize you've had two children, you've got other aspects of your life, but like, where's your
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.360]   mind, um, in terms of where you want to take your life and your climbing?
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:07.040]   Yeah. On the one hand, I set big goals, I guess, you know, something like y'all cap.
[00:53:07.040 --> 00:53:10.800]   The thing is, I would actually say that's more of the outgrowth of setting consistent little goals,
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.800]   like all the time. Like I basically always have a running to do list of like, what am I doing
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.720]   tomorrow? What am I doing today? What am I trying to do this week? And that extends to climbing as well
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:22.480]   with like, what are all the little things I can be doing? Like, what are the little things I can take
[00:53:22.480 --> 00:53:27.280]   this week? You know, I have, uh, my climbing journal goes back to 2005 or six or something. So
[00:53:27.280 --> 00:53:32.080]   basically everything I've ever climbed is, is logged with, you know, difficulty and times and whatever.
[00:53:32.080 --> 00:53:36.240]   And so I'm constantly trying to take things as a climber, you know, just like to do new climbs that
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:41.120]   I haven't done before. And so, I mean, I think like actually my day of climbing yesterday could be a
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:46.160]   good example of this. So yesterday my wife and I dropped off our older daughter at school, went to
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:50.480]   the cliff, uh, did a day of sport climbing, um, and then picked up our daughter on the way home.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:56.000]   It's like a perfect day like that where you can kind of like make it all work. And I'm not going to be
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.160]   able to go to that cliff very often this season just because of travel and work and life basically.
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.960]   So I don't want to have any big project there because I just won't have time to do
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:08.000]   it. You know, I'm trying to set my goals appropriately where I'm like, oh, there's no
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.560]   point in trying to do something that would take me a month or two to achieve if I only have three days.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.520]   And so I had a goal for that day of trying to do this very particular little combination of
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:20.880]   routes that I hadn't done before. It's just something new, something interesting. It's not that hard.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.800]   But then we got there and it was, it was like the worst condition. It was like 86 degrees and we parked
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:29.360]   the car. And so, you know, it's like you're trying to work out and like horrendously hot. And it was
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:33.600]   also that kind of monsoony. So it was very humid. So we got to the wall and it's like disgusting. And
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.520]   I was kind of like, well, you know, it's a training day, like whatever. And so I tried to do this new
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.960]   combination of routes. Ultimately, I failed on, I felt the very freaking top of the wall. I was like
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.520]   so maxed and didn't do it. Uh, I'll probably get a chance to go back on Monday and hope and I'll
[00:54:45.520 --> 00:54:50.880]   for sure do it then. Um, but you know, it's like a very small goal. Like this isn't cutting edge,
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:54.720]   like big, this isn't, this isn't even cool at all. Like my friends won't even care. You're like,
[00:54:54.720 --> 00:55:00.160]   they'll think it's stupid, but, but it's nice for me to have a reason for me to try my hardest for that
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:05.280]   particular day of climbing. And I think that the big goals come as a result of all those little things,
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:08.480]   you know, like if day by day you're constantly doing something that's a little bit new, a little bit
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.400]   different, a little bit harder, you know, whatever seems like the appropriate challenge for that day.
[00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:18.480]   I think that looking back at 20 years of climbing outside nonstop, that the big things have just
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:22.000]   come as a natural outgrowth of all those little things. You do like enough little things all the
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:28.000]   time. And then every once in a while something big happens. And so I don't know that's, you know,
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:32.400]   but I have to do lists going back like years of like goals and all these aspirations. And you know,
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:36.080]   some years I only do half of them, some years I do a third of them. And then, you know,
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.240]   something like free selling all cap sat on a list like that literally for years. And it kept floating
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:44.080]   to the next year, to the next year. Cause you get into Yosemite, you look at the wall and you're like,
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:47.760]   nah, that's, you know, you're like, it's totally out of the question. And so you just like punt to
[00:55:47.760 --> 00:55:52.880]   the next year. And so, yeah, I mean, sometimes the goals don't happen. Sometimes they do,
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.720]   but you kind of just have to let it play out. You know, it's more like the day-to-day little challenges.
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:59.520]   I love how matter of fact you are about it. You are wired different.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:08.320]   You think, I mean, well, maybe not. I mean, because like, and this is a vastly less high
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:13.760]   risk, high consequence endeavor, but like public speaking doesn't make me, it doesn't raise my level
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:17.440]   of, of cortisol or autonomic arousal at all. Cause I've done so much of it.
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:18.720]   Yeah. Cause you're super well-practiced.
[00:56:18.720 --> 00:56:23.520]   Yeah. I just, yeah. So sometimes I'll, you know, I'll think like, oh, I'm like a little more keyed up
[00:56:23.520 --> 00:56:25.520]   than I want to be. And I'll, I know how to calm myself down.
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:28.960]   Well, I'm actually, I feel the same way with public speaking now, but that's after years of practice.
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:33.120]   It used to be, it used to be so stressful for me. Like, so yeah, no, I was, I was so shy.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.280]   Proof that your amygdala does work like everybody else's.
[00:56:35.280 --> 00:56:37.840]   Yeah. No, I mean, exactly. That's why I hate all this stuff. It's like, oh,
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.800]   you're just wired differently. Cause I'm like, no, I know that, you know, like, yeah, public,
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:45.440]   like speaking in front of a class in school was like mortifying. But now after years of doing
[00:56:45.440 --> 00:56:49.920]   keynote speeches to like giant groups, I'm sort of like, no, no, it's super chill. But you know,
[00:56:49.920 --> 00:56:50.880]   that's all learned.
[00:56:50.880 --> 00:56:54.960]   Yeah. Forgive me for saying you're wired different. I think that, you know, when you did a free solo,
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.880]   there were a number of news programs that like took advantage of the fact they put you in a brain
[00:56:58.880 --> 00:57:02.640]   scanner, you know, this is my field of neuroscience, you know, his amygdala might not be activated the
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:07.200]   same way as other people's, but I would have thought, and I think it's the case now you, you confirmed
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:11.120]   that it's really domain specific. Like you've done so much climbing of so many reps there that you're
[00:57:11.120 --> 00:57:15.200]   familiar with the contingencies. And so it's not that you can't experience fear. It's that you're not
[00:57:15.200 --> 00:57:20.240]   placing yourself into truly fearful circumstances climbing. But the fact that public speaking was an issue
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:24.640]   means that your threat sensors and the amygdala and related circuits were perfectly fine.
[00:57:24.640 --> 00:57:28.320]   With that particular, like scanning in the fMRI, you know, they show you a bunch of black and white
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:31.280]   pictures and it's like whether or not that triggers the fear response. And I was like, well, obviously
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.560]   looking at pictures isn't going to trigger my fear response. But I'm like, had they thrown a snake into
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.680]   the fMRI with me, like that would have triggered my fear response. You know, if there were like giant
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:42.800]   spiders, like crawling over me, like that would probably would too. And so I was like, no, obviously I feel fear.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:47.280]   I just, I'm just not afraid of black and white photos. I was like, that's what they used. Like
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:52.400]   angry faces and that kind of the faces. It wasn't even faces. It was like random stuff. Like, I don't
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:56.080]   know, like a gun and then like a light socket, you know, some things that are like neutral, some things
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:59.600]   that I should have designed the experiment. My lab used to work on fear. It was a standardized thing,
[00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:03.360]   I think. Yeah, I know. I'm not trying to be disparaging of the research. My lab used to work
[00:58:03.360 --> 00:58:08.240]   on fear. We use VR. That's how I met Michael Muller, our friend in common. He took me down to Guadalupe.
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:13.760]   We did two times. So we went down there in 2016 and 2017, doing cage exit diving with great whites,
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:18.080]   filming with, uh, to get the VR. And I'll tell you in, in real life, it's a hell of a lot scarier
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:23.040]   than it is. Yeah, totally than in VR. But along the lines of, you know, dying when you're doing the
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:29.120]   other thing, uh, not the main thing, the cage exit part ended up being a lot safer. I had an air failure
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:33.760]   while in the cage. I was on that hookah line and I was alone in the cage when it happened. And I'll tell you,
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:36.960]   that was a lot more terrifying than being out of the cage with the sharks. Because when you're out of the
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.800]   cage, you're on scuba and you have some degree of control over, you know, you can shoot for the
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:46.080]   surface. When you're in the cage and you run out of air and you're alone, you're just terrified and
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:51.760]   you're, you're hosed, no pun intended. You're not hosed enough. So, you know, it, it speaks to this
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.800]   thing that like when there's this big scary thing and you're really locked in, you often miss the,
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:01.040]   the more trivial seeming, but real danger that's close up.
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:04.480]   Well, this is, I think one of the things, one of the real values of climbing is I think that
[00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:08.240]   as a climber, you spend all your time thinking about risk and managing risk and mitigating risk
[00:59:08.240 --> 00:59:13.440]   and all those kinds of things. And so I think that, um, I don't want to like toot my own horn too much,
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:18.320]   but I do feel good at evaluating risks like that. You know, like what is the actual dangerous thing?
[00:59:18.320 --> 00:59:23.760]   Like what's sketchy about the situation? And it just often isn't the thing that people are looking at,
[00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:27.120]   you know? And that's what I was talking about earlier with like people watching video,
[00:59:27.120 --> 00:59:30.960]   free-soling or whatever else are like, that's sketchy. And I'm like, well, you know, might be
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:34.480]   in some ways, but probably not for all the reasons that you're thinking, you know what I mean? Like
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:39.520]   the, the obvious visual thing is probably not the, the, the big challenge.
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:44.640]   And it sounds a little cliche, but you're doing what you love. You know, it's, it's interesting.
[00:59:44.640 --> 00:59:50.640]   I think one of the biggest risks that, um, I think about now, um, as I get older is
[00:59:51.600 --> 00:59:57.280]   the non-daily lethal risk of, you know, grinding it out in a job you don't like. And then, you know,
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:01.920]   one day you wake up and you're like, wow, there's, there's no time machine. Like, I can't go back and
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:07.040]   get that vitality in that time. Yeah. And that's where I think this, this idea of, you know, doing
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:10.560]   what you love really counts. Whether or not you have to live in a van and do nothing else, or whether or
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:14.240]   not you can also go to school, you know, but doing, doing something that you love very, very much.
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.280]   Yeah. Because either way you're going to die. Either way you're going to die. And you may as
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:21.520]   well die having done a lot of things you're really excited about than die regretting all the things
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.880]   you didn't do. Totally. I mean, I think that that actually, that exact mindset really helped inform
[01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:31.600]   my whole climbing journey in a way is like my father died when, when, uh, when I was 19 and he died of a
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:37.840]   heart attack unexpectedly, just free thing running through an airport, uh, at age 55. And, you know,
[01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:42.080]   and I think for a young, for a teenager that makes an impression where you're sort of like, oh,
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:46.240]   like this could end at any moment. And actually in both my grandfathers had just died like at
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.360]   roughly the same time. So I think for an impressionable, you know, teen, you're sort of like,
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:55.600]   oh, everybody dies. Like, do you get to do all the things that you want to do before you go?
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:01:00.800]   And, and I think my father, my father was a community college professor taught language. And,
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:06.000]   uh, you know, he ostensibly lived a risk-free life, you know, like relatively sedentary. I mean,
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.280]   he traveled widely, like he was great, but, but by any risk perception thing, you'd be like,
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:15.040]   oh, he's a professor. Like he's, he's, he's fine. And yet he still died young
[01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:20.160]   and probably would have preferred to do a lot of other things before he went. I'm sort of like,
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.640]   you know, it's just a reminder that you gotta, you gotta do all those things.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:28.240]   Yeah. I want to talk to you about your philosophy on death and, and time and kind of life arc. And,
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:33.360]   and, uh, you've already started. Uh, so thank you, um, for that, because I would say
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:41.760]   most of my friends who started families young are people who, these are male friends whose dads died
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   young. And so they had this very keen sense of the finite, uh, duration of, of life. And, you know,
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.240]   Steve Jobs talked about this. So like, you're, you know, very, and he died young. He seemed to have some
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:56.480]   sense of how long he was going to live and really wanted to pack things in. And I don't know why that
[01:01:56.480 --> 01:02:00.320]   was, he was adopted. So I don't know if he even knew how long his parents lived, et cetera. But barring
[01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:05.600]   accident or injury, you know, we don't really know when we're going to die. But sometimes I think,
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:10.160]   uh, we get the sense based on relatives and, you know, I can remember a time in my life when I,
[01:02:10.160 --> 01:02:15.360]   of course I knew I was going to die, but I lived in a way that I just, I felt like I had all the time
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:19.520]   in the world despite pursuing things. And I think, um, with each passing year, I'm like, oh, wow,
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:23.040]   like the wall is coming. It's winding down. Yeah. Like we gotta get, get the show on the road and I've
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:29.040]   done things I wanted to do, but it's, it's interesting that, um, uh, you know, it's, it does seem that
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:35.600]   like having a parent die has a, has a profound impact on where you set that horizon. You realize
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:41.520]   like today is part of an arc that has an end point and we know that, but we often don't live into that
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.720]   realization. Yeah, no, I, I totally agree with that. I mean, and I, you say we know that, but I actually
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:50.720]   think that we don't talk about that enough. You know what I mean? I think most people live with a
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.320]   little too much open in it because nobody wants to talk about death. Nobody wants to talk about,
[01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:58.480]   you know, like the consequences of like, cause people think it's morbid or it's just not the
[01:02:58.480 --> 01:03:02.160]   thing is like, we're all going to frigging die. You know, it's like, are we going to be proud of
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:08.720]   what we did before we died? Like, I don't know. I mean, yeah, we'll see. It's like kind of cliche
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:11.920]   to be like, oh, better to die young and, you know, burn brightly and all that kind of stuff.
[01:03:11.920 --> 01:03:16.160]   But you know, to some extent, I think that's, I think there's a middle ground where you're like,
[01:03:16.160 --> 01:03:22.320]   it's better to try hard and do things that you're proud of. And you know, either way you're going to
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:26.640]   die. I agree. I mean, I think there is something interesting to this 27 effect. You know, there's
[01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:30.720]   so many like rock and roll musicians die at 27. It's their quarter life crisis.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:33.440]   Yeah. Quarter life crisis. I haven't heard of the quarter life crisis.
[01:03:33.440 --> 01:03:36.320]   You've never heard of quarter life? Like all my friends have gone through a quarter life crisis.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:38.560]   Oh, really? When does that happen?
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.160]   Well, like 25, you know, 27.
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:45.040]   Interesting. No, I was just so focused on becoming a neuroscientist. I didn't know
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.960]   what else I would do besides that at 25. I think it was just so locked in,
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:51.520]   but I've always been a little bit obsessive. Have you always been a little bit like,
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.600]   whatever you're into, you're into, I guess it's been climbing.
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:54.720]   Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:56.800]   Yeah. I was just lucky to get into climbing when I was 10.
[01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:58.960]   So this is something that I've just been into forever.
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.880]   So did you play Legos as a kid or do you mean?
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.160]   Yeah. And I was psycho about my Legos.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.200]   You were psycho about Legos?
[01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:07.200]   Yeah. Yeah. Psycho. Like I didn't have a bed in my room because I had Legos
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:10.480]   covered across the whole floor. Basically I slept in a corner and I just had Legos all over.
[01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:11.920]   Awesome. Kind of psycho.
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:13.920]   Do you see some of this in, in your kids?
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:20.240]   Not quite that yet, but they're pretty young. So it's hard to tell, but yeah, we'll see. We'll see.
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:25.680]   We'll see. I kind of think, you know, it's all about having personality, like do a thing,
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:30.320]   do it well, like get excited about things. I mean, there's just so many people on earth and they all
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:35.840]   do different things. Like you may as well be the person to do that one particular thing and just like
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:36.560]   really do it.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:42.800]   No, I agree. That's the juice. I mean, I mean, I think for some of us, like I just know from my own life
[01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:46.960]   experience, I like, I thought I was certainly going to just get into skateboarding. Many of my friends
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:50.320]   became professional skateboarders, got really good at or worked in the industry. And early on,
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:53.920]   I was getting hurt and I realized I'm not very good at this. And then when I finally plugged into
[01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:58.640]   academics and learning, I was like, this is the thing and I loved it. And then eventually I pivoted
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:02.960]   to this thing, which I didn't anticipate. But I do think that going all in on something is a,
[01:05:03.520 --> 01:05:09.600]   it provides a really wonderful feedback loop that one can, like you feel, it makes you feel alive.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.040]   Yeah. You're like doing a thing.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.160]   Especially when it's hard. Yeah.
[01:05:12.160 --> 01:05:13.120]   Especially when it's hard.
[01:05:13.120 --> 01:05:17.920]   I've literally spent my whole life basically like all in on climbing and, and I'm still,
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:21.840]   I just, I just love going rock climbing. You know, it's like, I mean, I think that's really the,
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.200]   the goal of parenting is to help your kid find something that they're that psyched about,
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:28.640]   like something that they can commit to and something that will drive them something they're passionate
[01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:33.440]   about. And so, you know, I mean, we'll see with, uh, with our kids, but it's like the idea is just
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:38.480]   to let them experience enough things that they can find whatever they, whatever gets them out of bed
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:43.520]   every day. They certainly are in the right environment, uh, to flourish with it. You mentioned that climbing's
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:47.840]   in the Olympics. I could see, and I've observed in other sports where the parents are kind of more
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:52.640]   obsessive than the kid. And then the kid burns out on it. If I read, uh, Andre Agassi's book.
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:56.480]   Yeah. Yeah. That's basically a story of his dad pushing him to play a game. He did not want to play.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:06:00.400]   Yeah. That's maybe the best sports memoir ever. That's like, that's a great, uh, that's a great
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:04.400]   book. Yeah. Great book. Yeah. His dad was like a boxer and basically trained him in tennis like a
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:09.360]   boxer. Yeah. Yeah. So it's sort of like the light handed approach of, of like, I think kids know,
[01:06:09.360 --> 01:06:12.800]   I think, I mean, you kind of let them forage, right? No, we're, we're, we're taking the light
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.800]   handed approach for sure. I mean, our kids will obviously know how to climb because that's what we
[01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:21.760]   do all the time. And, um, but so far we just go hiking. Like we haven't forced them to climb.
[01:06:21.760 --> 01:06:26.720]   We have a little bit of a home gym at home, like a little climbing, uh, garage. And so the girls can,
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:30.240]   you know, play on the wall whenever they want to, but there's certainly never any pressure to do
[01:06:30.240 --> 01:06:35.760]   anything. I read, um, and please correct me if this is inaccurate, but that, uh, it was during
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.840]   college that you had some family members pass away. And when you really leaned into just climbing more,
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:44.720]   um, I think it's somewhere on the internet that you were climbing on Indian rock, which is, uh,
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:49.760]   uh, interesting to me because I went to graduate school in Berkeley and lived in Berkeley for a long
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:53.360]   time. And you went to Cal, I went to Cal for my masters. And then I lived in Berkeley, even when
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:56.320]   I was a postdoc at Stanford, I love Berkeley. I was like, you went from Cal to Stanford.
[01:06:56.320 --> 01:07:00.960]   Yeah, right. The enemy, the enemy. Yeah. Born at Stanford, trained at Stanford,
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.080]   and still spent a lot of time at Berkeley. I liked the culture in Berkeley then. Um, and I liked the food.
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:10.960]   So I used to take pizzas from the cheese board up to Indian rock. And so while you were climbing Indian rock,
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:16.480]   I was eating and, uh, picnicking on Indian rock. Um, it's amazing. So would you just pull a little
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:21.120]   solo journeys out there that this is, by the way, folks, a big steep rock, but on one face, it's,
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:25.920]   it's gradual. It literally has like rock couches where, um, couples go on dates and you eat some pizza
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:29.120]   and hang out and get an amazing view overlooking the city. So you were climbing up the back of it,
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:33.040]   which is anything, but, uh, well, actually I was mostly traversing the bottom of it. Um,
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:37.120]   there's tons of like, basically you can contour the whole base of the rock. And so you can climb for,
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:40.480]   you know, a couple hundred feet basically without touching the ground. So you just go back and
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.120]   forth doing laps. And yeah, cool. I mean, from where I was living at Berkeley, there was only,
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.400]   I don't know, like a 30 minute walk to Indian rock or something. So I basically wasn't going to class.
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:52.880]   I was just strolling to Indian rock and traversing the wall back and forth. And, and then that's why
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:56.560]   I dropped out after one year at Berkeley. It's just kind of like, I don't know why I'm at university
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:01.680]   if I'm not actually, actually it's, it's more complicated than that. Cause that year I got into
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:05.840]   the youth worlds, like a international thing. And so I was going to take the semester off to
[01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:10.000]   go to worlds and travel and climb a little bit. And so now I've just taken, you know, whatever,
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.600]   like 30, 35 semesters off or something. Yeah, exactly. No, I think, I think after
[01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:18.320]   some point they were like, you're done. Yeah. Yeah. I think they closed that.
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.480]   But, um, it worked out. It certainly worked out. Yeah. The thing that we find ourselves doing when,
[01:08:22.480 --> 01:08:27.760]   um, we should be doing something else in, in the positive sense of it. Like,
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.560]   I mean, that often is the thing like it's a, that you're obsessed over. Yeah. I mean,
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:35.920]   it's just hard to know with that stuff though, because obviously for most people,
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.360]   they probably should get an education and get a job of some kind. Like even if you're a really
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:42.480]   passionate climber, I mean, most people probably aren't going to make a living as a professional
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:47.440]   climber. Cause it's just too small in industry and you know, the depends on your level and everything.
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.920]   I mean, I think I got kind of lucky. I mean, in a lot of ways I got lucky also just because I,
[01:08:51.920 --> 01:08:56.240]   I like soloing and it's like such a niche and not that many people do it. And the, and the level just
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:09:00.800]   wasn't that high. And so, you know, I sometimes joke, it's easy to be the best if you're the only
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:04.400]   one doing it, you know, it's like, it's easy to compete as the only person in the field. And
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:08.720]   you're kind of like, well, it makes it chill. And so, you know, I think I got lucky in a lot of ways
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:13.360]   like that. And so, yeah, most people probably should finish university and, and climb as they can.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:19.200]   That said, I mean, if you love doing a thing, it makes sense to maybe build your life around how you
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:23.520]   can do that thing as much as possible, just because it keeps you energized and fired up and, you know,
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:26.880]   it makes the rest of your life better. I think it was Ryan Holiday that said that
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:30.240]   if you don't know what to do with your life and you're still trying to figure it out, definitely
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:34.400]   stay in college. Because, you know, there are all these tales of like Mark Zuckerberg leaving
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:38.800]   Harvard and Steve Jobs dropping out of Reed College and Alex Honnold leaving Berkeley and
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:44.640]   and eventually becoming the person that you are now. But you had a direction. There was another
[01:09:44.640 --> 01:09:47.520]   thing to lean into. It wasn't just, oh, I don't like this. I don't want to be here.
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:51.120]   Yeah. I mean, if you have nothing, then you drop out and you just go play video games in
[01:09:51.120 --> 01:09:54.560]   your basement or something like that's obviously not, that's not better than going to school. Like,
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:58.720]   you're better off going to school and broadening your horizons and doing whatever. But yeah,
[01:09:58.720 --> 01:10:02.240]   I mean, I thought I was just taking some time off and I thought that eventually I'd become a mountain
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:06.240]   guide or something or like teach at summer camps or I don't know, you know, because especially at the
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:09.920]   time the climbing industry was so much smaller, there wasn't any money. Like, I didn't think you could make
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.880]   it a living as a professional climber. And so I thought it was just kind of a fun thing. I was doing in the van for a while
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:20.880]   before I'd like find some kind of job or something. And then thankfully the climbing industry is kind
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:26.320]   of scaled at the same rate that, that, that I did as a climber. And so it, it all worked out.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:33.520]   Is it the case that, um, you didn't have, uh, any monetary aspirations when you were doing it? Like,
[01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:39.120]   it sounds like you, you didn't, but, um, did you ever have the conversation with your mom? Like, you know,
[01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:42.800]   how are you going to make a living or? No. Well, so, I mean, I mentioned that my dad died,
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:47.680]   so my parents had just gotten divorced. And so my dad had left enough for, for my sister and me to finish college.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.680]   And so I took that money and put it in bonds. I'm just like, I don't know what that is, but, you know,
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:57.120]   so I was making like a couple hundred bucks a month in bonds. And then, uh, I stole the family minivan.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:02.560]   Like I said, my grandparent and my two grandfathers had died before. So like, basically my mom had inherited this
[01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:07.040]   little car that, so she was driving my grandpa's car. I took the family minivan. I was making a couple hundred bucks in bonds.
[01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:11.280]   And basically that just kind of covered any of the pressure, like the financial pressure,
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:14.480]   whereas like that gave me enough of a buffer that I was like, well, for several years,
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:19.200]   at least I can just kind of like live in this minivan and see what happens. And then after a
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:23.600]   couple of years I was sponsored, I was getting free product. I was getting it like a very,
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:27.440]   very small amount of money, but some amount of money, which is enough to sort of justify the
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:31.200]   whole thing. We're like, Oh, companies are paying me to do this thing. I should see how well I can do it.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:36.560]   And then, and then it all kind of took off from there. But yeah, I mean, I mean, that's one of the
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.480]   ways in which I was very lucky as a climber, you know, there was like just enough financial cushion
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.000]   that I could try to do the thing as much as I wanted for a couple of years and see how it played
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:48.720]   out. And it just happened to work out. Well, I'd like to take a quick break and acknowledge one of
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:54.240]   our sponsors function. Last year, I became a function member after searching for the most comprehensive
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:12:00.640]   approach to lab testing function provides over 100 advanced lab tests that give you a key snapshot of
[01:12:00.640 --> 01:12:05.920]   your entire bodily health. This snapshot offers you with insights on your heart health, hormone health,
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.360]   immune functioning, nutrient levels, and much more. They've also recently added tests for toxins such
[01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:17.920]   as BPA exposure from harmful plastics and tests for PFAS or forever chemicals. Function not only provides
[01:12:17.920 --> 01:12:23.040]   testing of over a hundred biomarkers key to your physical and mental health, but it also analyzes these
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:28.560]   results and provides insights from top doctors who are expert in the relevant areas. For example,
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:33.440]   in one of my first tests with function, I learned that I had elevated levels of mercury in my blood.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:38.320]   Function not only helped me detect that, but offered insights into how best to reduce my mercury levels,
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:43.280]   which included limiting my tuna consumption. I've been eating a lot of tuna while also making an effort
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:47.680]   to eat more leafy greens and supplementing with NAC and acetylcysteine, both of which can support
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:52.240]   glutathione production and detoxification. And I should say by taking a second function test,
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.800]   that approach worked. Comprehensive blood testing is vitally important. There's so
[01:12:56.800 --> 01:13:01.760]   many things related to your mental and physical health that can only be detected in a blood test.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:05.920]   The problem is blood testing has always been very expensive and complicated. In contrast,
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:11.520]   I've been super impressed by function simplicity and at the level of cost. It is very affordable.
[01:13:11.520 --> 01:13:15.680]   As a consequence, I decided to join their scientific advisory board and I'm thrilled that they're
[01:13:15.680 --> 01:13:22.000]   sponsoring the podcast. If you'd like to try function, you can go to function health.com/huberman function
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:27.920]   currently has a waitlist of over 250,000 people, but they're offering early access to Huberman podcast
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.600]   listeners. Again, that's function health.com/huberman to get early access to function.
[01:13:33.600 --> 01:13:37.840]   It's going to sound like an odd question, but I'm very curious about this. You've been in beautiful
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:44.640]   places and you get a very different view of those places than most people. There's really great YouTube
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:51.600]   shorts of you hanging by one arm during a climb, which itself is impressive to the observer. But then
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.360]   you take some moments and you look around and you're just checking out the scene. You're clearly not
[01:13:55.360 --> 01:14:02.800]   looking at the rock that I know, even as a non-expert. And so I'm wondering this, I have reasons to ask,
[01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:09.040]   do you ever snap photos with your mind, your mind's eye? Do you have clear recollection of like,
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:11.520]   "Oh, I'm going to snap a shot of this, keep this one in the memory bank?"
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:15.920]   No, I can't remember. I mean, to me, it's more the living there day in and day out. With Freestyle
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:21.680]   Soling El Cap, let's say, I mean, I spent months on the wall and it's like just every day, you know,
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:25.360]   you're going up before sunrise a lot of the time. So you're watching the sunrise over Half Dome and
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:29.520]   it's like super beautiful. And then you're going down at sunset and you're watching the moon and it's
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:34.560]   just, I mean, it's just day in and day out. It's the most beautiful place on earth and all these amazing
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:38.960]   conditions. You know, sometimes it starts snowing, sometimes it's raining. It's like there are clouds
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:42.800]   swirling and mist or whatever. And you're just like, "Oh, it's amazing." But I don't really remember any
[01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:47.200]   specific, you know, like a snapshot of that. It's more just the overall, you're like, "Oh,
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:51.280]   it's just this amazing place." It's pretty, pretty awesome. Yeah. Like the freaking,
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:57.040]   what is it with Yosemite Falls, the, have you ever seen the, the moon rainbow thing? The firelight
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:15:00.880]   thing? No, the fire falls is a different thing. That's like with the moon and that's a different
[01:15:00.880 --> 01:15:07.600]   time of year. In like May or June, if you get a full moon, oh, the moon bow, that's what it is. It's
[01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:12.480]   like when Yosemite falls, we'll cast a moon bow. Like you'll be able to see a rainbow from the
[01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:17.280]   moonlight in the waterfall when it's at peak water. It's totally insane. My, my wife and I went for a
[01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:20.880]   romantic walk to go look at the moon bow one season because you're just there and you're like, that's
[01:15:20.880 --> 01:15:24.640]   pretty cool. You know, it's like, it's a rainbow at night. Amazing. It's really cool. We're going to
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:29.680]   send a lot of people to Yosemite by virtue of clouds rest and for, for the non, uh, climbers. I
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.880]   still think it's crazy that you've climbed clouds rest more than once and never climbed half dome.
[01:15:32.880 --> 01:15:38.320]   I've run clouds rest, rucked it. I've done it. I've probably done clouds rest at least a dozen
[01:15:38.320 --> 01:15:42.720]   times. That is crazy. And you have to go past half dome and half dome is the much more famous
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:46.720]   cousin that's closer and easier and kind of more spectacular. Well, you have to drive past it. So
[01:15:46.720 --> 01:15:50.800]   to be clear, I'm, I'm starting from sunrise. Oh, you're going from Tuolumne. I'm going from Tuolumne.
[01:15:50.800 --> 01:15:54.160]   Oh, I'm way less impressed. Oh, I thought you were going from the valley floor.
[01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.600]   I was thinking to myself, like, I was like, you know, clouds rest is like 15 miles up and back.
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.320]   It's like, it's, it's not gnarly. No, but going from the valley floor is really hard.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:03.280]   Going from the valley floor is hard. Okay. I actually don't know many people who
[01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:05.200]   come up from the valley floor anymore. I've only done it from the valley floor.
[01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:10.160]   People tend to start at sunrise and then go down clouds rest, kind of go down the spine of it toward
[01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   half dome. And then I know this because then recently. Yeah, there are trails between them and it's all easy.
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:17.440]   Yeah. Yeah. That's so funny because you were talking about rucking a heavy bag up there and I was like,
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.640]   man, that is a hard walk from the valley floor. But because I'm thinking everything
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.880]   from the valley floor, because I spent so much time in Yosemite.
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:25.760]   I'm starting at about 8,000 feet, finishing at about 10,000 feet.
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:27.680]   Yeah. Okay. I'm so much less impressed.
[01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.800]   Yeah. Your daughters do this.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.160]   Yeah. Well, not quite yet.
[01:16:30.160 --> 01:16:33.040]   Your three and a half year old daughter. That's what I was saying. Like, wow, he's red. Okay.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.480]   I mean, it's tough. I mean, 2000.
[01:16:34.480 --> 01:16:35.920]   Yeah, no, no, it's still tough.
[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.960]   I mean, it's like a workout.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.960]   But going from the valley floor is really tough.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:39.520]   Yeah, that's brutal.
[01:16:39.520 --> 01:16:43.600]   Because I had one season in Yosemite where for whatever reason, I wasn't really motivated for climbing goals.
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:46.960]   And I called it, I said that I retired and I was on a trail running season.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:50.480]   Though it's funny because I actually, I supported a bunch of my
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:52.640]   friends on things and I was bouldering with all my friends.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:55.120]   And so, you know, I said that I have a climbing journal.
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:16:58.080]   And so by the end of the season, if you look through the journal, it would look like a normal
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:00.960]   season where like almost every day I was climbing with somebody, I was doing something.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.920]   And then by the end of the season, I actually did a couple of things that I was kind of proud of.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.240]   But the mindset going into it was like, I don't care.
[01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:07.120]   I'm just here having fun.
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:10.080]   I'm trail running and I'm supporting my friends on things and that's it.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:14.240]   And, uh, and one of my big things that season was that I ran clouds rest from the valley floor.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:16.800]   But to me, that was like a triumph of, of trail running, you know,
[01:17:16.800 --> 01:17:19.520]   because that's like a pretty big, it was like really, I don't know.
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:21.760]   It's like 5,000 feet over or 6,000.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.080]   I don't know.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.120]   It's like so far.
[01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:24.000]   Uh, let's see.
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.680]   Cause it, it was like the hardest thing I'd ever run.
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:25.840]   Yeah.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:31.280]   You're probably going at least three to 4,000 feet from the valley floor up to the meadows.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.920]   And then another 2000 up to when the valley floor is four and top of clouds, this is 10 something.
[01:17:35.920 --> 01:17:36.720]   So you're doing six.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:36.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.960 --> 01:17:37.360]   Yeah.
[01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:40.320]   So it's like, for me, I was like, oh, that's a, that's a lot.
[01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:41.120]   That's a trail run.
[01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.600 --> 01:17:42.960]   And you bring it and you're carrying water.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:46.720]   I just have like a little bottle and I don't know, fill in the rivers and yeah.
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:49.680]   I mean, I don't consider myself a serious trail runner or mountaineer certainly.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.520]   But I, I, ever since I got my driver's license, it was like Yosemite.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:56.240]   It's the best, you know, and Glacier is amazing.
[01:17:56.240 --> 01:18:00.880]   Um, you know, I, and I swear I'm not sent here by the national park service, but, uh,
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:04.640]   I think Glacier's got some incredible scenery that, uh, everyone should make it to.
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:05.680]   Have you done a lot of climbing in Glacier?
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:09.760]   No, actually, I don't think there is that much climbing in Glacier National Park, but,
[01:18:09.760 --> 01:18:14.960]   uh, I've actually biked past on, on the way to Alaska for this like random, random journey
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:15.960]   I did.
[01:18:15.960 --> 01:18:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.960]   But, um, but no, I haven't, I haven't done much in there.
[01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:25.040]   What are the, um, if any, uh, cultural differences of climbing in the United States versus in Europe?
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:29.840]   It, it seems like, uh, you know, like get, get guys in that train in the Alps.
[01:18:29.840 --> 01:18:33.840]   Um, I keep saying guys, but I, I want to be fair enough for politically people, I'm not
[01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:36.720]   saying this for politically correct reasons, but there's a movie out very soon.
[01:18:36.720 --> 01:18:39.120]   Actually, an IMAX movie, I saw the trailer too.
[01:18:39.120 --> 01:18:41.360]   It's a friend of yours, a woman who's, what's she climbing?
[01:18:41.360 --> 01:18:42.080]   She's climbing the El Cap.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:45.600]   She's climbing El Cap in a day, like free in a day, this route called Golden Gate.
[01:18:45.600 --> 01:18:49.200]   Um, yeah, actually, surprisingly, I'm in that film much more than I thought, uh, because I
[01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:50.880]   supported her on each of her attempts.
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:54.640]   Uh, we're talking about Emily Harrington, who's also a professional climber, um, who, yeah,
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:18:56.000]   freed this route called Golden Gate in a day.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:58.240]   And the film's, uh, called that Girl Climber.
[01:18:58.240 --> 01:18:59.120]   And I think it comes out.
[01:18:59.120 --> 01:19:00.640]   24th.
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:19:00.800 --> 01:19:01.840]   Isn't that like soon?
[01:19:01.840 --> 01:19:02.160]   Soon.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:04.640]   It's one day in an IMAX, but then presumably it'll be released.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:07.600]   And then some kind of theatrical release, but I think it'll be a relatively small theatrical
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:09.600]   release and then eventually stream and whatever.
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.360]   But anyway, this film, Girl Climber.
[01:19:11.360 --> 01:19:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:15.440]   It's funny because she worked on this goal for a long time and I'd kind of forgotten that
[01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.920]   I basically supported her on each of her attempts because when you support somebody, I mean,
[01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:22.160]   this is kind of like crewing somebody's race or something.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.400]   You know, when you support somebody, it's basically a rest day for you.
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:25.440]   You're like having a nice day.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.400]   You're supporting a friend.
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.360]   It's like no pressure.
[01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:28.400]   It's all really chill.
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:32.560]   And so the days that I supported her were all like, you know, I mean, I remember them,
[01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:35.360]   but there was one day throughout a big season where I'd be working on other climbing goals,
[01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.960]   like all the things that I'm working on.
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:38.480]   And it's just like a fun day supporting a friend.
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.120]   But then I went and watched the movie and it's like, oh, every time she drives the wall,
[01:19:41.120 --> 01:19:42.080]   I'm like, they're supporting her.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:45.120]   And I was like, oh God, I kind of forgot about all these things like a couple of years ago.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.760]   And I don't know.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.880]   That's awesome.
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:47.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:47.840]   It's funny seeing the film.
[01:19:47.840 --> 01:19:50.080]   It's really, it's really inspiring.
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:53.040]   Is the route that she took particularly difficult?
[01:19:53.040 --> 01:19:56.480]   What, what, what's the, what's the milestone that she achieves there?
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:20:00.160]   She was the first woman to do that route in a day, free in a day.
[01:20:00.160 --> 01:20:02.160]   That route's like a harder version of the free rider.
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:04.400]   The thing that, that I free soloed in the film, free solo.
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:10.480]   But yeah, I mean, honestly, I think the film does a good job of not trying to portray it
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.320]   as anything more than it is.
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:16.880]   I mean, it's, it's a very difficult climbing achievement, but it's not like it, it doesn't
[01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:19.200]   need super, it's not the hardest thing ever done.
[01:20:19.200 --> 01:20:23.440]   It's not the first time that, you know, um, but it's very hard.
[01:20:23.440 --> 01:20:27.760]   And if you watch the film, you see what makes it meaningful is the level of effort that she
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:28.480]   puts into it.
[01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:30.080]   It's like, it's hard for her.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:33.200]   She's a great climber and she puts a lot into it, a lot of herself into it.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.800]   And eventually, I don't know, you know, spoiler, but eventually overcomes like,
[01:20:36.800 --> 01:20:38.800]   managed to do this thing that's really hard for her.
[01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:42.000]   And I think that's, which in a lot of ways is, I mean, that's climbing
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:42.560]   in a nutshell.
[01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:43.920]   It's like, none of it really matters.
[01:20:43.920 --> 01:20:46.320]   Cause like, even freestyling on cap, I mean, you can walk around the back.
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.520]   Like, you know, it was like, why put the years of effort into climbing the face when you can
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:50.480]   walk around the back?
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.480]   Like all of climbing is relatively meaningless.
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:57.440]   And so ultimately it's the effort that we put into it that, that, that has value.
[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:01.520]   And so I think that's, that's what the film girl climber does a really good job of is
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.240]   sort of like, oh, wow.
[01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:06.080]   Like she puts a lot into it and therefore gets a lot out of it for herself.
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:06.480]   Awesome.
[01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:09.360]   And I haven't seen it yet, but clearly for the observer too.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:14.640]   I mean, I find it amazing that humans love to see other humans accomplish great feats.
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:16.800]   You know, I think they love to see the effort.
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:20.240]   I mean, the accomplishment of course, but it's like, but you love seeing somebody work really
[01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:24.080]   hard at something, try really hard, like face their fears, overcome, and then, you know,
[01:21:24.080 --> 01:21:25.440]   ideally achieve something.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:28.000]   But I think it's the effort that's so inspiring.
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.920]   Like, I mean, at least personally, I love to see other people try that hard because it's
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:34.160]   a reminder that I can try that hard if I want to.
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:35.840]   Yeah, no, I completely agree.
[01:21:35.840 --> 01:21:41.760]   I had made this little list before we started and I'm trying to just let my unconscious mind
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.000]   guide it more than I'm really scripting out carefully.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.880]   And it says, uh, um, uh, Evel Knievel.
[01:21:46.880 --> 01:21:48.800]   Cause when I was growing up, like everything was Evel Knievel.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.760]   It turned out there were many of them.
[01:21:49.760 --> 01:21:50.880]   It's all family.
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:51.440]   Oh yeah.
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:52.160]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:53.280]   A bunch of Evel Knievels.
[01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:53.920]   The Knievels.
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.640]   The Knievels.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:21:55.760 --> 01:22:01.120]   And, you know, jumping, you know, whatever, you know, 50, maybe not 50, length to length,
[01:22:01.120 --> 01:22:02.880]   but semi trucks.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:06.800]   And, and I think, you know, there's the element of danger.
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:07.760]   It's super impressive.
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:14.160]   Danny way growing up, cause I knew that kid, who is now a full grown man, doing all sorts
[01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:19.120]   of crazy stuff to the point where he was starting to go after things that for skateboarders felt a
[01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:23.440]   little bit kind of outside the box, like land speed records and things like that, you know,
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.680]   but jumping out of helicopters and certainly grump, jumping the great wall of China, just engineering
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.920]   it from scratch was super impressive.
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.600]   Um, and then I've got you here.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:38.160]   And then, um, uh, Hunter Thompson, you know, like the guy just was all about like how many, uh, drug
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:42.400]   experiences he could have. And then his funeral was actually, um, he loved the town of Aspen.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:46.720]   Uh, he had his ashes exploded over the town of Aspen in a, in a firework show.
[01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:51.440]   So that's, that's like going out the way, the way you lived, you know, that is fitting.
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:56.240]   Right. Um, so I think you're, I think you're absolutely right. However, that we love to
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:59.600]   touch into the amount of effort and training that's required. And that's the Rocky movies,
[01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:04.000]   that's, um, pretty much everything. And that's really where the, the work is like, that's the,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.200]   that should be the inspiring part, right? Cause that's the part that one can adopt.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:10.720]   The Rocky training montage. That's the best part of the movie. I mean, a lot of those films,
[01:23:10.720 --> 01:23:14.480]   the best part is the training montage where it's like cuts to the person working really,
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:18.720]   really hard for a long time and like getting swole. And then, then you get to the actual,
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:23.280]   them doing the thing and them doing the thing is, is cool, but it's like them getting ready to do
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:26.800]   the thing is often the part that you're like, that's so awesome. I'm all fired up. Totally.
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:31.520]   It's like chasing chickens and all the weird stuff. Speaking of which, um, for the non climber,
[01:23:31.520 --> 01:23:35.120]   what would be the strangest, um, aspect to your training? Do you train your feet?
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:38.400]   Do you train your hands in ways that are on you? But it's probably the dangling from your
[01:23:38.400 --> 01:23:43.360]   fingertips that I think a non climber would, I mean, also, I mean, I think that's the type of
[01:23:43.360 --> 01:23:47.360]   thing that a non climber just can't even interface with. Like they just can't hang from an edge,
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:51.840]   you know, it's like from a small, it's like the training your fingertip type stuff. Um, yeah,
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:56.320]   I mean, I think the, though, I mean, now there've been so many mainstream climbing things that I
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:24:00.400]   think people have a sense of that's, that's what it is. You like dangle on tiny edges and do pull-ups
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:04.080]   and all that kind of stuff. Well, I think, uh, I follow an Instagram account that's actually
[01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:11.040]   informative. Um, it's a former army guy who's, uh, he's a rock climber. And so it's mainly focused
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:15.280]   on pull-ups and things like that. And, and touching into like how you, if you change the, the speed of
[01:24:15.280 --> 01:24:20.400]   the initial one arm pull-up, like I learned to blast through the bar, like through and above the bar and
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:25.600]   let go and then catch it again, generates a completely different sort of motor neuron adapt, adaptation
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:30.400]   response than like just doing a bunch of pull-ups or, or like slow one arm pull-ups. Like the ability to be
[01:24:30.400 --> 01:24:36.400]   ballistic, but, and then also like the eccentric, like catch yourself and lower. Um, and it seems
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:40.080]   to have a lot of parallels with climbing. Maybe I should just go on a wall and climb. It sounds like,
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:44.800]   uh, do you, so I imagine that if you're bouldering, you, you end up doing all this stuff in the process
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.480]   of bouldering. Yeah, actually I was immediately like, so should I be going faster when I do pull-ups?
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:51.760]   Cause I've been like doing one arms at the end of a session, but like my one arms are pretty slow.
[01:24:51.760 --> 01:24:54.240]   You know, you just grab the bar and you just like struggle until you do it.
[01:24:54.240 --> 01:24:58.960]   Well, I mean, he talks about, you know, um, a lot of people can do a lot of pull-ups in full range,
[01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:04.480]   slow concentric and eccentric, but that, um, they rarely ever get to like muscle ups or to one arm
[01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.680]   pull-ups at the kind of level that he's pulling a ton of weight. Um, because they, there are a number
[01:25:09.680 --> 01:25:13.840]   of things that he suggests we can link to this account. Um, a lot of, there's some training of
[01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:17.760]   forearms and brachialis and hands that's required, but he said, you know, that not being able to
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:22.160]   generate enough force at the beginning is a reason. A lot of people don't get to the, the muscle up
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.240]   because, uh, with the muscle up, you actually, there's a little bit of a kip involved, at least
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:30.400]   when one's first learning it. And so people are used to kind of dragging themselves in low gear out
[01:25:30.400 --> 01:25:34.560]   of the bottom. You, it's going to be a long while before they have the strength to do a muscle up.
[01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:38.000]   Whereas if you can blast yourself out of the bum, you sort of end up almost above the bar at some
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.040]   point. I actually just started doing muscle ups again, like a couple months ago in my little home gym.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.440]   And I was like, I haven't done a muscle up since I was a teenager. You know,
[01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:49.360]   it's like, it's a kind of a gym feat when you're a kid just to see if you can. And as an adult,
[01:25:49.360 --> 01:25:52.800]   it's just also living in a van, obviously you can't do muscle ups because there's nothing to muscle
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:57.520]   pass. You're like hanging from a little bar inside the van. But, um, but yeah, I started doing it again.
[01:25:57.520 --> 01:26:01.680]   I was like, oh wow, it's so explosive. I was, I was kind of like, wow, what a dude. I was so psyched.
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:05.840]   I could still do him. Well, yeah, then you don't need his help, but I'll, I'll send you the
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:09.520]   discount so you can take a look. He's got some interesting connections. I did want to, I mean,
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:13.120]   I was like, oh, I'm going to chat with Hooper. And I was like, so what am I supposed to be doing?
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.880]   I mean, like, that's the thing is like, well, cause I've just been doing all the same training
[01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:21.200]   stuff for 30 years. I mean, and obviously I, I, I read all the books and you know, all my friends are
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:24.080]   professional climbers. So we talk about this kind of stuff all the time, but there are a lot of things
[01:26:24.080 --> 01:26:28.160]   where you're always kind of as like a self-trained self-coached athlete, to some extent, you're kind
[01:26:28.160 --> 01:26:33.520]   of like, should I be doing this more? Should I be doing this less? Like, and it, I was like training a
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.520]   bunch this summer and it was really motivated. And then I've kind of just, the pendulum has kind of just
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:42.080]   swung back to being like, do I need to do trainee stuff? Like the calisthenics, the extra workout
[01:26:42.080 --> 01:26:47.280]   stuff, or should I just go pure climbing? Because to some extent climbing, like if you want to be a
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.560]   climber, you just climb. Like if you have energy left over, you should just climb harder or climb more.
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:56.320]   You don't necessarily need to save it for workout stuff and training stuff.
[01:26:56.320 --> 01:26:59.920]   So I don't know, but yeah. What do you think?
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:04.080]   Okay. Well, I'm not going to tell Alex Honnold how to change his training, especially before you take
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:11.120]   on a big milestone. I mean, all I can say is what, and I don't have a degree in exercise physiology,
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:17.680]   what I do have a degree in is 35 years of trying to get stronger. I'm naturally pretty, I would say
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:22.160]   like medium joints. I'm not like real thick joints, like my bulldog, you know, like some of those guys
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.200]   that just have like naturally the joints. But I'm actually keeping some endurance and some degree of
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:32.240]   of explosivity, but mostly strength and endurance have been the two main things.
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.680]   To me, the thing that has just been the most beneficial is what Pavel Satsulin taught me when
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:44.480]   he came here, which is take a weight that you can maybe do six or seven, maybe eight reps with,
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:51.040]   and do three repetitions, sit down and just do many more sets and rest a long period of time.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:57.040]   If you have time to do that, that really like that really work those fast twitch motor units.
[01:27:57.040 --> 01:27:59.360]   - You mean do the reps faster?
[01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:03.280]   - Well, no, not necessarily. So if you take a weight that you could do maximum eight,
[01:28:03.280 --> 01:28:07.120]   like you'd fail somewhere between seven and eight repetitions, you take the weight,
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:10.800]   maybe even add a little bit and you just do three repetitions. You don't go to failure,
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:16.560]   but you do many more sets. So you might do, let's say some sort of push pull. So like a shoulder press
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.400]   of some sort, or, and then if you could get eight, you do three or four, but then you go do your pull-ups.
[01:28:22.400 --> 01:28:25.440]   You might do your, you know, sort of ballistic pull-ups that we were talking about before. I'm
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:29.920]   actually getting a lot of progress from those, like trying to blast through and past the bar and kind
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:30.720]   of catch it below me. - Keep your muscle up?
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:35.920]   - I'm almost there. I'm kipping too much when I do it. So I'm doing it, but I'm kind of like throwing
[01:28:35.920 --> 01:28:40.720]   myself up there. I'm not doing like a, like a super controlled muscle up yet soon. That's the goal.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:47.040]   Um, but not training to failure seems to be really beneficial if you don't want to eat into your
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:50.400]   recovery too much. There's something about hitting muscular failure that's great for generating
[01:28:50.400 --> 01:28:55.600]   hypertrophy, but it really, according to Pavel and I'm finding this too, it sort of teaches your nervous
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.480]   system to reach that static point where you can't move any longer. And it really eats into your recovery
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:04.800]   ability. So I'm able to now train muscle groups that I used to only be able to recover if I train them
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.520]   once or twice a week. I can train them like three or four days a week and I'm making much more progress
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.760]   overall, but there's no single set where I'm like grinding out that last final rep.
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:18.800]   - That's interesting. So if, so, uh, like, so bench pressing, for example, like that's actually the
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:24.400]   only weight that I move around is I, I, I bench like when I'm at home and have like my own little home gym,
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:29.440]   I, uh, bench press like twice a week, let's say. And, uh, I feel like it's like good for shoulder
[01:29:29.440 --> 01:29:32.800]   stability, health. I know it's like nice to balance. Cause as a climber, you're always pulling.
[01:29:32.800 --> 01:29:37.440]   So it's like, I do, that's my only pushing basically. And so, um, so I can do like,
[01:29:37.440 --> 01:29:42.000]   I normally do three sets of five or six. It's just kind of like a basic something.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:46.720]   So you're saying I should do like six sets or like eight, eight sets of three or something.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:50.880]   - Yeah. Maybe even maybe eight sets of, of three to four with slightly more weight,
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:54.480]   but don't go to failure and obviously have a spotter. There are these horrible instances
[01:29:54.480 --> 01:29:56.080]   where people are benching at home and they don't have a spotter.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.520]   - Well, I only have a dumbbells anyway.
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:29:59.760]   - Okay, perfect. That's, that's the best way to do it.
[01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:03.600]   - Yeah. It seems, it seems like that's the type of thing too. Also, I kind of like the dumbbells
[01:30:03.600 --> 01:30:06.800]   because it seems more like so much of what I care about is shoulder stability and whatever.
[01:30:06.800 --> 01:30:08.560]   And I'm kind of like, oh, it seems like dumbbells are good for that.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:11.760]   - Yeah. Barbell bench. I'm going to catch a lot of shit for this, but barbell bench press,
[01:30:11.760 --> 01:30:13.040]   there's a lot of ego involved.
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:14.720]   - Yeah. It's too showy. I'm like, I don't need that shit.
[01:30:14.720 --> 01:30:21.040]   - I, I've never actually done a single rep max for a barbell bench press. Never been curious enough.
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:22.720]   - Cause you don't have enough friends to help spot that weight.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.680]   - You don't have enough friends. Exactly.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.560]   - You need like six guys to go to bar.
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:28.320]   - I'm all alone. I'm studying and I'm bench pressing alone in my basement.
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:33.520]   Another reason to use dumbbells, but yet taking a weight that you could do seven or eight repetitions
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:38.160]   and doing three or four or maybe five, and then just setting it down and going, doing something
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:42.320]   else, maybe for an opposing muscle group, and then coming back to it so that your total rest is somewhere.
[01:30:42.320 --> 01:30:46.320]   - I might try that particularly for the benching, because I do actually get kind of sore from like,
[01:30:46.320 --> 01:30:51.680]   - Being sore sucks. And you get really strong. I never would have thought this because I,
[01:30:51.680 --> 01:30:57.040]   I came up in the lineage of, I learned from Mike Menser, who was like a, he was an ex-bodybuilder,
[01:30:57.040 --> 01:31:01.680]   but then he trained Dorian Yates, who won the Olympia many times. And that whole philosophy was
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:07.440]   around doing one or two sets to absolute failure with four straps and drop sets and all the,
[01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:12.800]   all the stuff that builds a lot of muscle, but makes you very sore. And so Pavel sat right where
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.720]   you're sitting. And he was just like, try this, find movements you can do safely,
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:22.720]   load up the bar and do far fewer reps, many more sets. And perhaps even divide those sets
[01:31:22.720 --> 01:31:26.560]   across two days during the week, as you're already doing, as opposed to just training a muscle group
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.960]   once per week. - Do people do that, doing seven months a week?
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:33.920]   - I only train my legs once a week and I'm getting stronger most every workout, but I sprint on a
[01:31:33.920 --> 01:31:36.560]   separate day. So that's kind of a leg workout. - Yeah, it seems like a leg workout.
[01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:40.720]   - I don't have great recovery ability, never have. So it's - And you're pushing 50.
[01:31:40.720 --> 01:31:43.840]   - What's that? And I'm pushing 50. And I didn't run from the valley floor.
[01:31:43.840 --> 01:31:44.640]   - Yeah, exactly.
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:51.280]   - You know, exactly. I definitely have found that if I avoid going to muscular,
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:55.760]   momentary muscular failure, as it's called, far less soreness, far better recovery,
[01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:59.280]   and you get really strong, which is crazy. You would think the opposite.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.800]   - Yeah. Do you think once a week is enough
[01:32:00.800 --> 01:32:06.640]   stimulus basically to like build? - If you do enough sets, but probably twice,
[01:32:06.640 --> 01:32:10.560]   you know, the, the data seem to show that the muscle protein synthesis is initiated
[01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:16.240]   after those workouts. And then it takes anywhere from 48 to 72 hours before it, you know, it subsides.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:21.280]   I just personally find if I train my legs once a week, but then I sprint four or five days later,
[01:32:21.280 --> 01:32:23.200]   that's sort of two leg workouts. - Yeah.
[01:32:23.200 --> 01:32:27.840]   - You know, so it's really twice a week. And then I do a push pull day and then I do a separate
[01:32:27.840 --> 01:32:33.760]   day for my arms and extremities. And, and, and that ends up training, you know, chest and shoulders and
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:36.560]   back again. So it's really twice per week. One is directly. - Yeah. So you're doing all your
[01:32:36.560 --> 01:32:37.680]   stuff basically twice a week. - Yeah.
[01:32:37.680 --> 01:32:42.160]   - But everything heavy, like really heavy, never going, I don't think I've done above eight reps
[01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:47.200]   this year. I'm stronger than ever. And I can run really far, which is, so the two things, I always
[01:32:47.200 --> 01:32:48.880]   thought those were. - Do you do a long run during the week or something?
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:52.800]   - I do one for me, very long run, which means an hour to an hour and a half of just running with
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:54.480]   a 10 pound weight vest. - Oh, why?
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:33:00.800]   - Just to make sure that the small stabilizing muscles are strong. And also because I want to be able to just
[01:33:00.800 --> 01:33:06.000]   show up to clouds rest and just do it. I don't want to have to train for things in life. - Yeah.
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:11.280]   - And I love, also, I love running. I mean, just that low, that slow pace at first, just, it sucks.
[01:33:11.280 --> 01:33:16.080]   And then after about 20 minutes, you're just like, I could go all day. This is awesome. I don't know.
[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:21.120]   That that's been my regimen now for almost 35 years to train each muscle group once a week, directly,
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:25.760]   indirectly, a long run. And I try and do one sprint run. But, but again, I'm not going to tell Alex,
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:31.920]   Alex Honnold had a, had a train, but, but you might find if you don't like getting sore and you want to
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:37.120]   get stronger, you're hearing it from me, but it's really Pavel Satsulin that deserves the credit for
[01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:41.360]   this. - Yeah, no, I'll try that for sure. Because particularly with something like benching, where
[01:33:41.360 --> 01:33:46.160]   it's like, I don't really care about pushing muscles, but when you're, when your pec or whatever,
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:50.240]   whatever this muscle is like the, you know, connecting your shoulders, it's like, yeah, it's like so sore.
[01:33:50.240 --> 01:33:53.280]   And then that kind of affects all your pulling as well. And so you're kind of like, oh, you just don't
[01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:57.200]   need to get that sore doing something that's like a side activity anyway.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:02.400]   - Yeah. Yeah. They, and I'm guessing you're already getting it from your climbing, but I found
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:09.200]   that, um, anytime I'm doing pushing, which is, you know, basically all the time, um, making sure
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.840]   that I train like some rear, rear deltoid type thing where you're pulling, getting that smaller muscle
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.800]   in the back of the shoulders, because a lot of people, you don't have this problem, but if you
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:20.720]   look at a lot of people lift weights, they just stand passively, their thumbs kind of point towards
[01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:23.920]   their groin. Like they're kind of internally rotated. - They're rolling in, yeah.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:28.560]   - Yeah. Whereas if you look at people who kind of do like the, the Fonzie thing, like you want your
[01:34:28.560 --> 01:34:32.400]   shoulder, you want your thumbs, like if you were just stand or sit naturally, your thumb's pointing
[01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:36.880]   straight forward. So you're looking like, like I've met Mike Tyson and like, he's like this, but like he's
[01:34:36.880 --> 01:34:41.680]   spent his whole life in that peekaboo stance, right? Then you meet people like you or people who
[01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:46.640]   practice yoga regularly or the really like most impressive postures and physiques are
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:51.200]   the dancers, right? Like Eric Jarvis was on this podcast. He's a neuroscientist, but he used to,
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:56.800]   um, he was accepted into the Allen, uh, uh, is it Allen Evely dance company? It was like, you know,
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:01.760]   elite dance company, or you see like a Twyla Tharp who's in her eighties and like in, she doesn't
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:07.200]   look like she's rigidly upright. She's just upright. And that's how I want to be when I'm in my eighties.
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.840]   So hard. Well, it's just, she spends two hours a day in the gym, seven days a week.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:12.160]   Wow.
[01:35:12.160 --> 01:35:19.360]   5:00 AM to 7:00 AM. And she's in her eighties. And then three hard boiled eggs. And then she gets
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:25.040]   to work like, yeah, she's, I'm like, that's a healthy lifestyle. She's and cognitively, she's
[01:35:25.040 --> 01:35:30.640]   just so strong, you know? Yeah. Yeah. No climbers definitely have issues with posture like that,
[01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:34.320]   because if you spend your whole life just pulling, like, you know, climbing, if you just climb,
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:38.000]   you're just doing pulling things. And so you wind up kind of like, well, actually you kind of wind
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:41.840]   punch. I think it's because like, you still use some of these muscles for, for pulling. And so
[01:35:41.840 --> 01:35:45.760]   you just wind up kind of tight in different ways. Yeah. But yeah. So things like that put you in a
[01:35:45.760 --> 01:35:51.920]   bridge pose and like in, in like spinal extension, um, those seem to be, uh, very useful. Yeah. As I,
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:57.280]   again, I'm not a elite athlete or even a competitive athlete, but I find that doing things that just
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:03.520]   like a long, slow run, a sprint day, um, training heavy with weights, but being able to, you know, run for
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:08.080]   30 minutes. I mean, it's just, I don't think I need a degree in exercise physiology to just,
[01:36:08.080 --> 01:36:14.320]   it didn't make sense. You're just, I'm trying to be upper end of average, um, at everything,
[01:36:14.320 --> 01:36:17.520]   but that's very different than what you're trying to do. Obviously you're an elite athlete.
[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:22.240]   Yeah. But some of the stuff like running, like, uh, like I went for a one hour run yesterday. I've
[01:36:22.240 --> 01:36:26.960]   been trying to run one day a week, just like great for an hour once a week. And, and then I try to do one
[01:36:26.960 --> 01:36:30.080]   kind of cardio adventure once a week, which is like climb a mountain or do something, you know,
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:34.400]   awesome anywhere from like two to four hours, let's say, but hopefully with like 3000 plus feet
[01:36:34.400 --> 01:36:38.560]   of bird or something, just like go up a thing to kind of trot down. And that's kind of enough to
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.120]   maintain cardio. I mean, this is kind of like family lifestyle. Cause the thing is like when I was living
[01:36:43.120 --> 01:36:46.400]   in a van by myself, you're just doing that stuff on rest days all the time. Cause you're kind of like,
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   Oh, I'm going to sum up this new peak or like check out this hike or do whatever. But now that I'm living
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:53.680]   in a place and, you know, taking kids to school and all that, it's like, I kind of have to be a little
[01:36:53.680 --> 01:36:58.880]   more structured with, with just like, I'm going to go and, but so yeah, now I'm definitely thinking
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:02.880]   about all this a little more. It's like, is this enough cardio? Is this, you know, is this work?
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:06.480]   But I think that that lays a good foundation to be able to do things. Like I'm going to be in Yosemite
[01:37:06.480 --> 01:37:11.680]   this season and, uh, you know, I'm aspiring to climb stuff on all cap, not free saling necessarily,
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:16.080]   or not free saling at all, but maybe some like rope saling, maybe some speed stuff, maybe whatever.
[01:37:16.080 --> 01:37:20.400]   But either way, I just want to be able to climb 3000 feet relatively quickly without being that tired.
[01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:24.480]   And so it seems like for running or for mountain climbing, it's like, oh, you just have to be able
[01:37:24.480 --> 01:37:29.760]   to do that kind of vertical without getting too fatigued. Yeah. I think the one day a week long run,
[01:37:29.760 --> 01:37:35.360]   one day, uh, one day a week, like 30 minute run at a faster clip. And then one day a week sprint training.
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.880]   Um, I mean, you're covering all bases there. Um, that's three days a week of running though.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.160]   I'm like, I don't like one of them is like 12 minutes long. You warm up for three minutes.
[01:37:44.160 --> 01:37:48.640]   It's sprint training 12 minutes. Yeah. Cause you're, you know, you, you warm up and then you run a 400,
[01:37:48.640 --> 01:37:54.080]   you know, and then you, you walk a lap, you do a 200, you walk a lap, you do a 100. And like,
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:58.800]   you're going not all out, all out, but close. Yeah. You can hurt yourself sprinting all out,
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:04.000]   all out. We, um, uh, had Stu McMillan, who's an elite sprint coach, trained a lot of Olympians and
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:10.240]   gold medalists. And, um, yeah, running full speed is like how you hurt yourself. You pop a hand string
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:14.480]   or something like you, but are you at a track? I prefer to attract. Sometimes I'll do it in the
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:19.760]   soft sand. And when I use a vest, I should say, and I have no, I have no sponsorship relationship to them.
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:24.000]   A more foe makes these vests that are like, like it looks, it's kind of funny to call it this, but it
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:29.040]   looks more like a kind of vest that, you know, you, you know, like a dress vest and it's got ball bearings
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:35.600]   in it. So it's not like, like one of those, like, uh, police type vests. Yeah. And so that eight or 10
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:40.240]   pounds that they make up to 12 pounds, I think it's just enough to give you some extra work on that long
[01:38:40.240 --> 01:38:46.800]   run. And then on the day when you sprint, you feel like you have, you know, uh, jet propulsion, you know,
[01:38:46.800 --> 01:38:52.720]   you've, I feel like that. I realize I don't, but yeah, and then all the little stabilizer things,
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:57.280]   like you don't have any, like, like aching, like you're not really, you seem like a very balanced
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:00.800]   in terms of your overall structure. That's one thing that I've really noticed about climbers.
[01:39:00.800 --> 01:39:04.640]   Like you see guys that are in the gym. I've spent a fair amount of time in gyms and there's this
[01:39:04.640 --> 01:39:08.480]   phenotype where they've got these big wide shoulders, wide back and the whole thing.
[01:39:08.480 --> 01:39:12.800]   And then they got like this little head and a little neck and you go with their upper spot,
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:16.000]   and they're not training their neck. And it looks crazy. I mean, I don't know if anyone has told them
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:20.400]   this, but they're like, you know, I walked by and I'm like, don't skip neck day, you know, but, um,
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:25.120]   but you know, when a body is out of balance like that, like if you saw a giant dog with a tiny head and neck,
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.800]   you'd be like, that dog is crazy looking.
[01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:29.440]   There are a lot of dog breeds like that where you're like that dog, you're like,
[01:39:29.440 --> 01:39:30.560]   hard to believe it came from a wolf.
[01:39:30.560 --> 01:39:34.960]   Exactly. You're so inbred. So right. The, the healthiest version of something that can move
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:37.920]   best is always fairly balanced. It seems like climbers are very balanced.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:42.080]   No, I think, I think climbing is, is one of the healthiest sports and like lifestyles and,
[01:39:42.080 --> 01:39:46.160]   and also just, it's so fun. Like going to a gym, you hang out with your friends. It's like,
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:49.680]   it's mostly really chill. You mostly hang out and chit chat. And like, if you do a gym session,
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:54.640]   you feel like you just went and hung out with your friends all the time, but then you also wind up fit and mobile and,
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:58.240]   you know, pretty strong and, and so much of climbing is strength to weight. And so you just
[01:39:58.240 --> 01:40:02.960]   wind up kind of like lean and not like a big gym, gym bro kind of thing.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:07.440]   Which I think is healthier as one ages too. Like you, you want to maintain muscle and hold on to
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.840]   muscle, but there's all sorts of things associated with being heavily muscled where people end up with
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:16.880]   some kind of sleep apnea or pseudo sleep apnea because the neck is thick and it blocks the airwaves.
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:21.360]   And, you know, sleep apnea is one of the biggest health risks. It, you know, people, not just heart
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.160]   attacks during sleep, but I mean, you're basically clogging all the, the blood flow and cleaning out of
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:30.880]   your brain that happens during sleep. It's very, very common in bigger people, either because they're fat or
[01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:33.680]   heavily muscled, but it's one of the reasons a lot of bodybuilders.
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:35.360]   Oh my goodness. I've never put on that much muscle.
[01:40:35.360 --> 01:40:39.200]   Yeah. Well, well, you can clearly generate a lot of force doing what you're doing. I'm curious how
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:43.120]   you deal with cramps when you're, when you're on the rock, like, no, you don't, you just don't,
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:44.640]   you just don't really cramp. You don't cramp.
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:49.680]   Yeah, not really. I've never, I mean, sometimes, you know, if you're trying to climb El Cap in a day,
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:54.960]   like a, like an 18 hour ascent or something, uh, like climbing with a rope, uh, but free ascent.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:40:58.800]   So like basically if you're doing a really long climbs, some of my friends sometimes will cramp because you're like
[01:40:58.800 --> 01:41:04.480]   late into a, you know, post 12 hours into an athletic activity or just a little more likely,
[01:41:04.480 --> 01:41:09.120]   but I never, I never have pretty much in general, all my athletic performance is always a steady
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:14.560]   decline where I start and I'm doing great. And then over the next, you know, 10 to 48 hours,
[01:41:14.560 --> 01:41:21.200]   I just slowly get worse at a relatively linear rate, except that normally before sunrise of the next day,
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:24.560]   it starts to drop quite a bit more, you know, like as you start getting close to 24 hours,
[01:41:24.560 --> 01:41:28.080]   you're like, I'm pretty fucking tired. Yeah. It's like, but then when the sun comes up,
[01:41:28.080 --> 01:41:31.280]   you've really like boost back up again. And so then you're pretty good again.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.560]   You just keep on the linear decline. So these are all night climbs.
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:35.440]   Yeah. I mean, I've done a lot,
[01:41:35.440 --> 01:41:40.240]   I've done quite a number of things now that are like more than 24 hour outings, you know?
[01:41:40.240 --> 01:41:44.240]   I mean, that's typically like climbing or mountain. So you're like hiking and climbing and
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:49.040]   then hiking some more and climbing some more doing whatever. But yeah, generally, you know,
[01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:53.920]   by 24 to 36 hours, you're just, you're just a worse version of what you used to be. You know,
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:58.080]   you're just, you're just tired and risk goes up when you're sleep deprived. I mean, that's, uh,
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:42:03.360]   well, like where, yeah, judgment gets worse. Uh, uh, reflexes get worse. Like everything is worse.
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.480]   Sleep is, is key, but yeah, that circadian clock phenomenon where like you've been up all night,
[01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:12.160]   but then you start waking up again. It's, uh, yeah, it's pretty incredible.
[01:42:12.160 --> 01:42:16.480]   I mean, also some of it with outdoor stuff is that, uh, just when you can see again, you know,
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:19.600]   it's like you've been going by headlamp for so long. And typically by that point,
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:22.960]   your headlamp is kind of dying and you just don't see that well. And then the sun comes up and you're
[01:42:22.960 --> 01:42:27.520]   like, thank God. And it's not cold anymore. You're just like this sun. So you get this like breath of
[01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:35.360]   fresh air and then you just keep grinding. Have you, um, ever had, or do you have any kind of like
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:40.560]   leaning towards this, like mystical experiences? Like, do you, do you believe in any of that?
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:46.240]   No, I've, I've always been a fierce atheist. Uh, technically I was raised Catholic. So like,
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:50.160]   I know religion a bit. Um, and I've just never, I've always been like, you know,
[01:42:50.160 --> 01:42:54.560]   it just doesn't make any sense to me. I'm like, yeah, I'm strongly unreligious though. I mean,
[01:42:54.560 --> 01:42:59.920]   I've been in so many beautiful places on earth and had so many, you know, what some would characterize
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:03.360]   as spiritual experiences, like feeling a oneness with nature, like a connection, you know,
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:06.400]   or just awe inspiring beauty. You know, when you're somewhere and you look out and you're like,
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:11.680]   God, the universe is so incredible. This is like the world is magical place. So, you know,
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:18.720]   I'm certainly open to general spiritualism, I suppose, or, you know, but no, I'm, I'm very
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:24.000]   opposed to organized religion. Basically. Biology is awe inspiring. Yeah. That's the thing is I'm like,
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:28.160]   I think there's enough wonder in the world and in the universe without adding all the layers of dogma,
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:31.600]   basically like all the weird things that you don't really need to believe.
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:37.520]   I can't help but tell you this cause I, I find it fascinating and I think you might find it
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:44.080]   interesting. If, if not then forgive me. Speaking of Berkeley, there was a laboratory at Berkeley that
[01:43:44.080 --> 01:43:48.720]   wanted to understand how geckos could walk up walls. And for a long time, it was thought that it was like
[01:43:48.720 --> 01:43:54.800]   suction of some sort, but then it turns out they could do it in a vacuum. So it means that it can't be
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:44:01.760]   suction. It turns out they have these little pedals on their, on their fingertips and they can push those
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:07.360]   pedals. They're fed, they're like feather, organized like sort of like feathers. They can push them so
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:11.680]   close to the surface that they're climbing that they use what are called van der Waal forces,
[01:44:11.680 --> 01:44:16.480]   which is the exchange of molecules between the surface and those pedals. And they're making and
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:21.120]   breaking those van der Waal forces as they climb. Really? It's like Spiderman. It's like magical.
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.520]   Yes. So as they climb, they're exchanging molecules with the surface they're climbing,
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:29.760]   which I find absolutely amazing. I realize that's not how you're climbing. Well, I'm sweating all over the
[01:44:29.760 --> 01:44:34.800]   wall. So it's kind of the same idea. And I'm leaving skin behind. You're like, oh, my tips,
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.360]   it hurts.
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:39.600]   Well, you may not feel a kinship to them, but I have a feeling they feel a kinship to you because
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:45.040]   they're, they are world-class climbers. I just find it amazing that they've evolved some way to
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:49.680]   literally exchange molecules. So you spent a lot of time on the rock. I'm sure that you're carrying some,
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:51.360]   some granite in you by now.
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:56.400]   Yeah, yeah, for sure. For sure. No, that's cool. I mean, you see a lot of creatures on, on walls
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:44:59.440]   like that. You know, you see like little frogs wandering up and down. I mean, even something like
[01:44:59.440 --> 01:45:03.440]   El Cap that looks like a 3000 foot solid cliff. I mean, they're, they're rodents running up and down
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:07.200]   the cracks. They're, they're frogs in there. There are all kinds of birds. They're bats. So you see all
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:10.480]   these creatures roaming around. You're just kind of like, oh, they're just living. They're just up here
[01:45:10.480 --> 01:45:14.960]   doing their thing. And you know, I mean, climbing is so relatively hard for humans. And then, yeah,
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:18.640]   and then you're up there and like, it's just, it's just all part of the natural environment for all the
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:22.960]   other creatures. I didn't realize there are frogs up there. I didn't, I've seen birds go by. I think
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:26.320]   there are a couple of clips in free solo birds go by. Yeah. They live in all the cracks off. And when
[01:45:26.320 --> 01:45:29.440]   you put your hands in birds, they'll like run down your arm and fly out of the crack and things like
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:34.240]   that. And you're like, whoa, it's startling. Yeah. It's startling. Yeah. Well, I mean, it's, or it's very startling
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:38.560]   the first time and then, you know, less startling the subsequent times, but you're always kind of like,
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:41.360]   oh wow, a swift just ran down my arm. That's wild. I was like, it's cool.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:48.560]   Well, Alex, you've inspired and continue to inspire so many people. And I think you hit the nail on the
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:54.240]   head when you said it's the effort involved. You know, I think that many people might think it's the
[01:45:54.240 --> 01:45:58.880]   summiting and like standing on top of the rock and that those are moments that thanks to you,
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:05.440]   we've been fortunate enough to share and experience, you know, indirectly, but clearly it's the effort
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:09.120]   involved. And I actually think that's why people are so intrigued by what you do.
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:14.240]   In addition to the fact that it's in beautiful places and incredibly high risk, high consequence,
[01:46:14.240 --> 01:46:19.600]   it's like you, it's so clear that you're regimented and you're, and that you love what you do and that
[01:46:19.600 --> 01:46:25.200]   you put a ton of effort into it. And the way you describe climbing with your friends, I think is the
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:30.480]   best hook sales pitch for climbing ever. Like hanging out with your friends, talking and getting better and
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:36.080]   physically healthier. And it puts you in a place to go have bigger adventures and experience life
[01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:41.120]   more richly. Let's also get you back some time after this next big feat. We can't talk too much
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:45.680]   about it. It'll be amazing. Awesome. All right. Well, we'll see you after that climb. Cool. Thank you.

[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:30.000]   you that haven't heard, I have a new book coming out. It's my very first book. It's entitled Protocols:
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:34.480]   An Operating Manual for the Human Body. This is a book that I've been working on for more than five years,
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:40.240]   and that's based on more than 30 years of research and experience. And it covers protocols for everything
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:47.120]   from sleep to exercise to stress control, protocols related to focus and motivation. And of course,
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:52.400]   I provide the scientific substantiation for the protocols that are included. The book is now
[01:47:52.400 --> 01:47:58.560]   available by presale at protocolsbook.com. There you can find links to various vendors. You can pick the
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:48:04.320]   one that you like best. Again, the book is called Protocols: An Operating Manual for the Human Body.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:09.360]   And if you're not already following me on social media, I am Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:14.480]   So that's Instagram, X, Threads, Facebook, and LinkedIn. And on all those platforms,
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:18.720]   I discuss science and science-related tools, some of which overlaps with the content of the Huberman
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:23.600]   Lab podcast, but much of which is distinct from the information on the Huberman Lab podcast. Again,
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:28.400]   it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms. And if you haven't already subscribed to our Neural
[01:48:28.400 --> 01:48:33.680]   Network newsletter, the Neural Network newsletter is a zero-cost monthly newsletter that includes podcast
[01:48:33.680 --> 01:48:39.040]   summaries as well as what we call protocols in the form of one to three-page PDFs that cover everything
[01:48:39.040 --> 01:48:43.680]   from how to optimize your sleep, how to optimize dopamine, deliberate cold exposure. We have a
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:48.160]   foundational fitness protocol that covers cardiovascular training and resistance training.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:53.360]   All of that is available completely zero cost. You simply go to Hubermanlab.com, go to the menu tab in
