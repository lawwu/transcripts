[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:04.940]   - Hey, everyone.
[00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.620]   Welcome to the Latent Space Podcast.
[00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.220]   This is Alessio, partner and CTO at Decibel Partners,
[00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.040]   and I'm joined by my co-host, Swiggs, founder of Small AI.
[00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.840]   - Hey, and today we're still in our sort of makeshift
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.360]   in-between studio, but we're very delighted
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.640]   to have a former returning guest host, Itamar.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.600]   Welcome back.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.360]   - Great to be here after a year or more.
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.640]   - Yeah, a year and a half.
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.920]   You're one of our earliest guests on Agents.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.760]   Now you're CEO co-founder of Kodo.
[00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.600]   - Right.
[00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   - Which has been, it's just been renamed.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.240]   You also raised a $30 million Series A.
[00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.320]   - Series A was 40.
[00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.000]   - 40, $40 million Series A,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.160]   and we can get caught up on everything,
[00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.940]   but we're also delighted to have our new guest, Eric.
[00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.780]   Welcome.
[00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.800]   - Thank you. Excited to be here.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.280]   - Should I say Bolt or StackBlitz?
[00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.600]   Like, is it like its own company now or?
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.280]   - Yeah, Bolt's definitely Bolt.new.
[00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.520]   That's the thing that we're probably the most known for,
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.480]   I imagine, at this point.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.520]   - Which is ridiculous to say
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.800]   because you were working at StackBlitz for so long.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.720]   - Yeah, I mean, it was within a week,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.780]   we were doing like double the amount of traffic.
[00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.480]   And StackBlitz had been online for seven years,
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.320]   and we were like, what?
[00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.600]   But anyways, yeah, so we're StackBlitz,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.440]   the company behind Bolt.new.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.720]   If you've heard of Bolt.new, that's our stuff, so.
[00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.000]   - Yeah, yeah, excellent.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.400]   - I see, by the way, that the founder mode,
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.160]   you need to know to capture opportunities.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.720]   So, like, kudos on doing that, right?
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.080]   Like, you're working on some technology,
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.760]   and then suddenly you can exploit that to a new world.
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.840]   - Totally, yeah, I mean, you know, I think,
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.600]   well, not to jump, but at least 100%.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:31.960]   I mean, that's, I mean, kind of a couple of months ago,
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.400]   we had the idea for Bolt earlier this year,
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.560]   you know, we haven't really shared this too much publicly,
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.000]   but like, you know, we actually had tried to build it
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.720]   with some of the state-of-the-art models
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.320]   back in January, you know, February,
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.640]   you can kind of imagine which,
[00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.520]   and they just like weren't good enough
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.600]   to actually do the code generation
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.840]   where the code was accurate and, you know,
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.000]   it was fast and whatever have you,
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.120]   without a ton of like rag,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.500]   but then there was like issues with that.
[00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.420]   So we put it on the shelf,
[00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.760]   and then we got kind of a sneak peek of, you know,
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.560]   some of the new models that have come out,
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.640]   you know, in the past couple of months now.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.760]   And so once we saw that,
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.360]   once we actually saw the code gen from it,
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.000]   we were like, oh my God, like, okay,
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.040]   then we can build a product around this.
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.240]   And so that was really the impetus of us,
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.360]   of us building the thing.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.200]   But with that, it was, you know, StackBlitz,
[00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.080]   the core StackBlitz product the past seven years
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.840]   has been an IDE for developers.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.860]   So the entire user experience flow we've built up
[00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.920]   just didn't make sense.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.480]   And so when we kind of went out to build Bolt,
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.040]   we just thought, you know,
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.880]   if we were inventing our product today,
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.560]   what would the interface look like,
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.920]   given what is now possible with the AI code gen?
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.960]   And so there's definitely a lot of conversations
[00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.480]   we had internally, but you know,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.080]   just kind of when we logically laid it out,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.640]   we were like, yeah, I think it makes sense
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.920]   to just greenfield a new thing and let's see what happens.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.440]   If it works great, then, you know, we'll figure it out.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.280]   If it doesn't work great,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.140]   then it'll get deleted at some point, right?
[00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.720]   But yeah, anyway, so that's kind of the,
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.920]   how it actually came to be.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.640]   - I'll mention your background a little bit.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.400]   You were also founder of Thinkster
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.040]   before you started StackBlitz.
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.160]   So both of you are second time founders.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.560]   Both of you have sort of re-founded your company recently.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.000]   Yours was more of a rename.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.520]   I think a slightly different direction as well.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.640]   And then we can talk about Bolt.
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.760]   Maybe just chronologically,
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.880]   should we get caught up on where Codo is first?
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.760]   And then, you know, just like what people should know
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.440]   since the last pod?
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.160]   - Sure, like the last part was two months
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.280]   after we launched and we basically had the vision
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.520]   that we talked about.
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.720]   The idea that software development is about specification,
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.800]   test and code, et cetera.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.320]   We are more on the testing part as in essence,
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.020]   we think that if you solve testing,
[00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.400]   you solve software development.
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.040]   - The beautiful chart that we'll put up on screen.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.120]   - And testing is a really big field.
[00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.920]   Like there are as many dimension, unit testing,
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.440]   the level of the component, how big it is, how large it is.
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.480]   And then there is like different type of testing.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.380]   Is it regression or smoke or whatever?
[00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.360]   So back then we only had like a one ID extension
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.920]   with unit tests as in focus.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.440]   So one and a half year later, first ID extension
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.720]   supports more type of testing.
[00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:01.880]   As a context of where we index local repos,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.280]   but also 10,000s of repos for Fortune 500 companies.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.560]   We have another agent, another tool that is called,
[00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.920]   the peer agent is the open source
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.520]   and the commercial one is Codo Merge.
[00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:18.200]   And then we have another open source called the cover agent,
[00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.800]   which is not yet commercial product coming very soon.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:23.120]   It's very impressive.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.200]   It could be that already people are approving
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.520]   automated pull requests that they don't even aware
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.080]   in really big open sources.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.840]   So once we have enough of these,
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.960]   we will also launch another agent.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:40.200]   In one and a half year, what we did is grew in our offering
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.280]   and mostly on the side of does this code actually works?
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.160]   Testing, code review, et cetera.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.680]   And we believe that's the critical milestone
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.920]   that needs to be achieved to actually have
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.960]   the AI engineer for enterprise software.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.760]   So, and then like for the first year was everything
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.600]   bottom up getting to 1 million installation.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.560]   2024, that was 2023, 2024 was starting to monetize,
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.840]   to feel like how it is to make the first buck.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.160]   So we did the teams offering,
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.560]   it went well with a thousand of teams, et cetera.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.840]   And then we started like just a few months ago
[00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.280]   to do enterprise with everything you need,
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:23.520]   which is a lot of things that discussed in the last post
[00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:26.960]   that was just released by Codium.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.040]   That's how we call it at Codium.
[00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.320]   Just opening the brackets,
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:36.680]   our company name was Codium AI and we renamed to Codo
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.400]   and we call our models Codium.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.840]   So back to my point, so we started an enterprise motion
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.200]   and already have like multiple like fortune 100 companies.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.080]   And then with that, we raised a series say of $40 million.
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.840]   And what's exciting about it is that enables us
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.240]   to develop more agents.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.080]   That's our focus.
[00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.880]   Like, I think it's very different.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.080]   We're not coming very soon with an ID or something like that.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.840]   - You don't want to fork this code?
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:03.680]   (laughing)
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:06.480]   - Yeah, maybe we'll fork JetBrains or something
[00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:07.400]   just to be different.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:08.480]   (laughing)
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.280]   - I noticed that, you know, I think the promise
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.360]   of general purpose agents has kind of died.
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.760]   Like everyone is doing kind of what you're doing.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:16.560]   There's CodoGen, CodoMerge and then there's a third one.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.400]   What's the name of it?
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:18.600]   - Yeah, CodoCover.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.440]   - CodoCover.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.240]   - Which is like a commercial version of a cover agent.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.080]   It's coming soon.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:25.400]   - Yeah, I see something similar with factory AI
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.200]   also doing like droids.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.680]   They all have special purpose doing things,
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.280]   but people don't really want general purpose agents, right?
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.160]   The last time you were here, we talked about AutoGBT,
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:35.960]   the biggest thing of 2023.
[00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.560]   This year, not really relevant anymore.
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:39.560]   And I think it's mostly just 'cause like,
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.160]   when you give me a general purpose agent,
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.480]   I don't know what to do with it.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.400]   - Yeah, I totally agree with that.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:45.440]   We're seeing it for a while
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.240]   and I think it will stay like that
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:49.000]   despite the computer use, et cetera,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.520]   that supposedly can just replace us
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.640]   and you can just like prompt it to be,
[00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:57.520]   hey, now be a QA or be a QA person or a developer.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.760]   I still think that there's a few reasons
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.120]   why you see like a dedicated agent.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:03.920]   Again, I'm a bit more focused,
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:07.600]   like my head is more on complex software
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:10.080]   for big teams and enterprise, et cetera.
[00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:13.280]   And even think about permissions
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.080]   and what are the data sources
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.760]   just the same way you manage permissions for users,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.000]   like developers, you probably want
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.640]   to have dedicated guardrails
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.120]   and dedicated approvals for agents.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.960]   I intentionally like touched a point
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.960]   on not many people think about.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.320]   And of course, then what you can think of,
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.480]   like maybe there's a different tools, tool use, et cetera.
[00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.480]   But just the first point by itself
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:40.120]   is a good reason why you wanna have different agents.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.520]   - Just to compare that with Pod.new,
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.600]   you're almost focused on like,
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.280]   the application is very complex
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.400]   and now you need better tools to kind of manage it
[00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:49.560]   and build on top of it.
[00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.520]   On Bolt, it's almost like,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:52.200]   like I was using it the other day.
[00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.480]   There's basically like, hey, look,
[00:07:53.480 --> 00:07:55.080]   I'm just trying to get started.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:56.320]   I'm not very opinionated
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:57.960]   on like how you're gonna implement this,
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:07:59.720]   like this is what I wanna do.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.920]   And you build a beautiful with it.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.160]   What people ask as the next step,
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:06.880]   going back to like the general versus like specific,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.200]   have you had people say, hey, this is great to start,
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.760]   but then I want a specific Bolt.new.whatever else
[00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.880]   to do a more vertical integration
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.000]   and kind of like development or what do people say?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.480]   - Yeah, I think you kind of hit the head on,
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:21.760]   which is kind of the way
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.480]   that we've kind of talked about internally
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:25.240]   is it's like people are using Bolt
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.760]   to go from like 0.0 to 1.0.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.120]   Like that's like kind of the biggest unlock that Bolt has
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:32.400]   versus most other things out there.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.520]   I mean, I think that's kind of,
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.480]   you know, what's very unique about Bolt.
[00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:37.200]   I think the, you know,
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:40.440]   the working on like existing enterprise applications is,
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.240]   I mean, it's crazy important because, you know,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.440]   there's, when you look at the Fortune 500,
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.280]   I mean, these code bases,
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.600]   some of these have been around for, you know,
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.480]   20, 30 plus years.
[00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.960]   And so it's important to be going from, you know,
[00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:53.160]   101.3 to 101.4, et cetera.
[00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:54.000]   I think for us,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.600]   so what's been actually pretty interesting
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:59.240]   is we see there's kind of two different users for us
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.000]   that are coming in and it's very distinct.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.160]   It's like people that are developers already.
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.000]   And then there's people
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.520]   that have never really written software.
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:08.000]   And more if they have, it's been very, very minimal.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.160]   And so in the first camp,
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.160]   what these developers are doing,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:11.440]   like to go from zero to one,
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.280]   they're coming to Bolt
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.000]   and then they're ejecting the thing to get up
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:15.200]   or just downloading and, you know,
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.880]   opening cursor, like whatever,
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:18.520]   to keep iterating on the thing.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.760]   And sometimes they'll bring it back to Bolt
[00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.080]   to like add in a huge piece of functionality
[00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:22.960]   or something, right?
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.360]   But for the people that don't know how to code,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.560]   they're actually just, they live in this thing.
[00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.360]   And that was one of the weird things when we launched is,
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:31.160]   you know, within a day of us being online,
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:32.800]   one of the most popular YouTube videos,
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.720]   and there's been a ton since,
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:34.600]   which was, you know, there's like,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.120]   oh, Bolt is the cursor killer.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.440]   And I originally saw the headlines and I was like,
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.440]   thanks for the views.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:41.640]   I mean, I don't know, this doesn't make sense to me.
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:43.680]   That's not what we kind of thought.
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.120]   - It's how YouTubers talk to each other.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.560]   Everything kills everything else.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.400]   - Totally, but what blew my mind
[00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.400]   was that there was any comparison.
[00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.880]   'Cause it's like cursor is a local IDE product.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:55.920]   But when we actually kind of dug into it
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.600]   and we have people that are using our product saying this,
[00:09:58.600 --> 00:09:59.440]   I'm not using cursor.
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.280]   And we're like, what?
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.080]   And it turns out there are hundreds of thousands of people
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.840]   that we have seen that we're using cursor
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.520]   and we're trying to build apps with that
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:09.880]   where they're not traditional software to us,
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.200]   but we're heavily leaning on the AI.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:13.120]   And as you can imagine,
[00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:16.400]   it is very complicated, right, to do that with cursor.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.400]   So when Bolt came out, they're like,
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.920]   wow, this thing's amazing
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:21.800]   because it kind of inverts the complexity
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.840]   where it's like, you know, it's not an IDE,
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:27.000]   it's a chat-based sort of interface that we have.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.240]   So yeah, so that's kind of the split,
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:29.080]   which is rather interesting.
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.800]   We've had like the first startups now launch
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:33.000]   off of Bolt entirely, where this, you know,
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.520]   tomorrow I'm doing a live stream with this guy named Paul,
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:38.680]   who he's built an entire CRM using this thing
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:40.320]   and with backend, et cetera.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.160]   And people have made their first money on the internet,
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:45.160]   period, you know, launching this with Stripe
[00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:46.000]   or whatever have you.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.120]   So anyways, that's kind of the two main categories
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.000]   of folks that we see using Bolt though.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.760]   - I agree that I don't understand the comparison.
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.600]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.320]   I think like we have like two type of families of tools.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.720]   One is like we re-imagine the software development.
[00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.560]   I think Bolt is there.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.920]   And I think like a cursor is more like a evolution
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:06.560]   of what we already have.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.680]   It's like taking the IDE and it's amazing.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:13.680]   And it's okay, let's adapt the IDE to an era
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.640]   where LLMs can do a lot for us.
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.520]   And Bolt is more like, okay,
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.800]   let's rethink everything totally.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.960]   And I think we see a few tools there,
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:26.720]   like maybe Vercel, Veo, and maybe Repl.it in that area.
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:31.440]   And then in the area of let's expedite, let's change,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:33.720]   let's progress with what we already have.
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:36.040]   You can see Cursor and Codo.
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:39.080]   We're different between ourself, Cursor and Codo,
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:42.120]   but definitely I think like comparison doesn't make sense.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.440]   - And just to set the context, this is not a Twitter demo.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.640]   You've made 4 million of revenue in four weeks.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.760]   So this is actually working, you know, it's not a...
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:52.800]   What do you think that is?
[00:11:52.800 --> 00:11:55.840]   Like there's been so many people demoing coding agents
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.920]   on Twitter and then it doesn't really work.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.840]   And then you guys were just like, here you go, it's live,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   go use it, pay us for it, you know?
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.200]   Is there anything in the development
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.400]   that was like interesting and maybe how that compares
[00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:07.960]   to building your own agents?
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:09.520]   - We had no idea, honestly.
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:11.520]   Like we've been pretty blown away
[00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.760]   and then things have just kind of continued
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.640]   to grow faster since then.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.440]   We're like, oh, today is week six.
[00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.680]   So I kind of came back to the point you just made, right?
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.560]   Where it's, you kind of outlined,
[00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.400]   it's like there's kind of this new market
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:25.240]   of like kind of rethinking the software development.
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.000]   And then there's heavily augmenting existing developers.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.200]   I think that, you know, both of which are, you know,
[00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.880]   AI code gen being extremely good,
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.840]   it's allowed existing developers,
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:39.080]   it's allowing existing developers to hammer out software
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.040]   far faster than they could have ever before, right?
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.640]   It's like the ultimate power tool for an existing developer.
[00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:45.720]   But this code gen stuff is now so good.
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:47.600]   And we saw this over the past, you know,
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.480]   from the beginning of the year,
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.280]   when we tried to first build Bolt,
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:52.760]   it's actually lowered the barrier to people
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:55.120]   that aren't traditionally software engineers.
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:56.440]   But the kind of the key thing is,
[00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.480]   if you kind of think about it from,
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:00.520]   imagine you've never written software before, right?
[00:13:00.520 --> 00:13:01.400]   My co-founder and I,
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.280]   he and I grew up down the street from each other in Chicago.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.640]   We learned how to code when we were 13 together,
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.520]   and we've been building stuff ever since.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:09.840]   And this is back in like the mid 2000s or whatever,
[00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:12.080]   you know, there was nothing for free to learn from online
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.240]   on the internet and how to code.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.960]   So like we, for our 13th birthdays,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:17.040]   we asked our parents for, you know, O'Reilly books,
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.000]   'cause you couldn't get this at the library, right?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:20.960]   And so instead of like an Xbox, we got, you know,
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.480]   programming books.
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.680]   But the hardest part for everyone learning to code
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:26.960]   was getting an environment set up locally, you know?
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.760]   And so when we built StackBlitz,
[00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.000]   like kind of the key thesis, like seven years ago,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.880]   the insight we had was that,
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.760]   hey, it seems like the browser has a lot of new APIs,
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.240]   like WebAssembly and Service Workers, et cetera,
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:41.200]   where you could actually write an operating system
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:42.520]   that ran inside the browser,
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:44.080]   that could boot in milliseconds.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.080]   And you, you know, basically there's this missing capability
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.560]   of the web, like the web should be able
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.720]   to build apps for the web, right?
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:52.520]   You should be able to build the web on the web.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:55.560]   Every other platform has that, Visual Studio for Windows,
[00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:58.880]   Xcode for Mac, the web has no built-in primitive for this.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.520]   And so just like our built-in kind of like nerd instinct
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.680]   on this was like, that seems like a huge hole
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.400]   and it's, you know, it will be very valuable
[00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:07.080]   or like, you have a very valuable problem to solve.
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.040]   So if you want to set up dev environments, you know,
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:11.120]   this is what we spent the past seven years doing.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:14.800]   And the reality is existing developers running locally,
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.120]   they already know how to set up dev environments,
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.920]   so the problem isn't as acute for them.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:19.040]   When we put Bolt online,
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:21.560]   we took that technology called WebContainer
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.680]   and married it with these, you know,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:24.640]   state-of-the-art frontier models.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.760]   And the people that have the most pain
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:28.760]   with getting stuff set up locally
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   is people that don't code.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.000]   I think that's been, you know,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.480]   really the big explosive reason is
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:36.760]   no one else has been trying to make dev environments work
[00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.840]   inside of a browser tab, you know, for the past,
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:42.200]   if since ever, other than basically our company,
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:44.680]   largely because there wasn't an immediate demand or need.
[00:14:44.680 --> 00:14:45.800]   So I think we kind of find ourselves
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.560]   at the right place at the right time.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.720]   And again, for this market of people
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:50.800]   that don't know how to write software,
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:51.640]   you would kind of expect
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.280]   that you should be able to do this
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:54.960]   without downloading something to your computer
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.040]   in the same way that,
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:14:57.840]   hey, I don't have to download Photoshop now
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.280]   to make designs 'cause there's Figma.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:00.120]   I don't have to download Word
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.800]   because there's, you know, Google Docs.
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.600]   They're kind of looking at this as that sort of thing, right?
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.040]   Which was kind of the, you know,
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.320]   our impetus and kind of vision from the get-go.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:10.200]   But, you know, the code gen,
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:11.560]   the AI code gen stuff that's come out
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.080]   has just been, you know,
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.440]   an order of magnitude multiplier on how magic that is, right?
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.240]   So it was that kind of my best distillation
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.360]   of like what is going on here, you know?
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:22.280]   - Yeah, and you're going to deploy too, right?
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.120]   - Yes.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:23.960]   - In TechBlitz, yeah.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.200]   - Yeah, and so that's what's really cool is it's, you know,
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.560]   we have deployment built in with Netlify,
[00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:30.360]   and this is actually, I think Sean,
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:33.440]   you actually built this at Netlify when you were there.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:35.920]   One of the most brilliant integrations, actually,
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.280]   because, you know, effectively the API that Sean built,
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.360]   maybe you can speak to it,
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:40.680]   but like as a provider,
[00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.400]   we can just effectively give files to Netlify
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.800]   without the user even logging in,
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.200]   and they have a live website.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.880]   And if they want to hold onto it,
[00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.240]   they can click a link and claim it
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.640]   to their Netlify account.
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:53.800]   But it basically is just this really magic experience.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:55.480]   'Cause when you come to Bolt, you say, "I want a website."
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.040]   Like my mom, 71 years old,
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:58.480]   made her first website, you know,
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.400]   on the internet two weeks ago, right?
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.920]   It was about her nursing days.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.040]   And so it had made up--
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:04.520]   - Oh, that's fantastic, though.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.800]   It wouldn't have been made.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.160]   - 100%, 'cause even in, you know,
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:10.560]   when we had a lot of people building personal,
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:11.720]   like deeply personal stuff,
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.560]   like in the first week we launched this,
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.720]   the sales guy from the East Coast, you know,
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.360]   replied to a tweet of mine, and he said,
[00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:18.760]   "Thank you so much for building this."
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:20.240]   You know, to your team,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.920]   his daughter has a medical condition.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:23.080]   And so for her to travel,
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.520]   she has to like line up donors or something,
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:26.880]   you know, so ahead of time.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:30.000]   And so he actually used Bolt to make a website to do that,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.480]   to actually go and send it to folks
[00:16:31.480 --> 00:16:33.880]   in the region she was gonna travel to ahead of time.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.120]   I was really touched by it.
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.240]   And I also thought like, why, you know,
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:38.120]   why didn't he use like Wix or Squarespace, right?
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:41.320]   I mean, this is a solved problem, quote unquote, right?
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:43.080]   And then when I thought, I actually used Squarespace
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.880]   for my, the wedding website for my wife and I,
[00:16:45.880 --> 00:16:46.720]   like back in 2021.
[00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.200]   So I'm familiar, you know,
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.120]   it was faster.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.800]   I know how to code, but I was like, this is faster, right?
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:51.960]   And I thought back and I was like,
[00:16:51.960 --> 00:16:53.600]   there's a whole interface you have to learn how to use.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:55.320]   And it's actually not that simple.
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.280]   There's like a million things
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:16:57.440]   you can configure in that thing.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.400]   When you come to Bolt, there's a text box.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.720]   You just say, I need a wedding website.
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.120]   Here's the date, here's where it is.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.200]   And here's a photo of me and my wife.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.240]   Put it somewhere relevant.
[00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:08.320]   It's actually the simplest way.
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.520]   And that's what, when my mom came, she said,
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.720]   I'm Pat Simons.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:14.200]   I was a nurse in the '70s, you know,
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.120]   and like, here's the things I did.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.160]   And a website came out.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.920]   So coming back to why is this such a,
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.600]   I think, why are we seeing this sort of growth?
[00:17:21.600 --> 00:17:23.720]   It's, this is the simplest interface
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.080]   I think maybe ever created
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:27.440]   to actually build and deploy a website.
[00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.520]   'Cause, and then that website my mom made,
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:31.000]   she's like, okay, this looks great.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.480]   And there's one button.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:34.080]   You just click it, deploy, and it's live.
[00:17:34.080 --> 00:17:36.920]   And you can buy a domain name, attach it to it.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:38.240]   And you know, it's as simple as it gets.
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.240]   It's getting even simpler
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.320]   with some of the stuff we're working on.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.760]   But anyways, so that's,
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.320]   it's been really interesting
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:45.840]   to see some of the usage like that.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:47.280]   - I can offer my perspective.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:49.880]   So I, you know, I probably should have disclosed
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.800]   a little bit that I'm a Slacklist investor.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:53.640]   - Cancel the episode.
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:54.480]   - I know, I know.
[00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.840]   - Don't play it, no.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.680]   Pause.
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:58.440]   - Eric actually reached out to show me Bolt
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.280]   before the launch.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.560]   And we, you know, we talked a lot about like
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:04.160]   the framing of what we're gonna talk,
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.000]   how we marketed the thing,
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.560]   but also like what Bolt was going to need,
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:10.360]   like a whole sort of infrastructure.
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.280]   Netlify, I was a maintainer of the CLI,
[00:18:12.280 --> 00:18:14.840]   but I won't take claim for the anonymous upload.
[00:18:14.840 --> 00:18:16.240]   That's actually the origin story of Netlify.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.800]   You can have Matt Billman talk about it,
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.560]   but he, like that was how Netlify started.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:24.000]   You could drag and drop your zip file or folder
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.280]   from your desktop onto a website.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.800]   It would have a live URL with no sign-in.
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:29.600]   And so that was the origin story of Netlify.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:31.360]   And it just persisted to today.
[00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:33.800]   And it's just like, it's really nice, interesting
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:36.520]   that both Bolt and CognitionDevIn
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:38.360]   and a bunch of other sort of agent type startups,
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:42.240]   they all use Netlify to deploy because of this one feature.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:45.160]   They don't really care about the other features of Netlify.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:47.560]   But just because it's easy for computers to use
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:49.920]   and talk to, like if you build an interface
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:53.000]   for computers specifically that is easy for them to navigate,
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.480]   then they will be used in agents.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.760]   And I think that's a learning
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:58.480]   that a lot of developer tools companies are having.
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:19:00.600]   That's my Bolt launch story and Netlify CLI stuff.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:01.560]   And then I just wanted to come back
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.760]   to like the web containers things, right?
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.920]   Like I think you put a lot of weight on the technical modes.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.680]   I think you also are just like very good at product.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.680]   So you've like built a better agent than a lot of people,
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:14.520]   the rest of us, including myself,
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:15.720]   who have tried to build these things
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.360]   and we didn't get as far as you did.
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:18.920]   Don't shortchange yourself on products.
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:22.000]   But I think specifically on infra, on like the sandboxing,
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:23.960]   like this is a thing that people really want.
[00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:26.160]   Alessio has backed e2b, which we'll have on at some point
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.280]   talking about like the sort of the server full side,
[00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:31.720]   but yours is, you know, inside of the browser, serverless,
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:33.960]   that it doesn't cost you anything to serve one person
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.160]   versus a million people, it doesn't cost you anything.
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.440]   I think that's interesting.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.040]   I think in theory, we should be able to like run tests
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.840]   'cause you can run the full backend.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:44.160]   Like you can run Git, you can run Node,
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:47.040]   you can run maybe Python someday.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.120]   We talked about this.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:51.080]   But ideally you should be able to have a full agentic loop,
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.320]   running code and seeing the errors, correcting code
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:56.040]   and just kind of self healing, right?
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:19:57.800]   Like, I mean, isn't that the dream?
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:58.720]   - Totally. - Yeah.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:19:59.560]   - Totally.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.120]   At least in bulk, we've got a good amount of that today.
[00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:03.720]   I mean, there's a lot more for us to do,
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.160]   but one of the nice things, 'cause like in web container,
[00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.960]   you know, there's a lot of kind of stuff you go Google,
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:11.480]   like, you know, turn Docker container into wasm.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.720]   Like there's, you'll find a lot of stuff out there
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:14.600]   that will do that.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:16.440]   The problem is it's very big, it's slow,
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.160]   and then that ruins the experience.
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:19.200]   And so what we ended up doing
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.040]   is just writing an operating system from scratch
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.960]   that was just purpose-built to, you know,
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.600]   run in a browser tab.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.680]   And the reason being is, you know,
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:28.360]   these Docker to wasm things will give you an image
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.960]   that's like out 60 to 100 meg, you know, maybe more,
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:34.080]   you know, and our OS, you know, kind of clocks in,
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:37.280]   I think we're in like a, maybe a megabyte or less
[00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.120]   or something like that.
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.560]   I mean, it's, you know, really, really, you know,
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.400]   stripped down.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.920]   - Basically the task involved, as I understand it,
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.360]   it's mapping every single Linux syscall
[00:20:47.360 --> 00:20:49.680]   to some kind of WebAssembly implementation.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.520]   - But more or less.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:52.240]   And then there's a lot of things actually,
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.280]   like when you're looking at a dev environment,
[00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.520]   there's a lot of things that you don't need
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:58.800]   that a traditional OS is gonna have, right?
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.720]   Like, you know, audio drivers,
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   or you're like, there's just like,
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:03.400]   there's just tons of things, right?
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:05.080]   You can kind of toss them,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:08.240]   or alternatively what you can do is you can actually be,
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.960]   the nice thing, and this kind of comes back
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.920]   to the origins of browsers,
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.400]   which is, at the beginning of the web in the late '90s,
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:19.000]   there was two very different kind of visions for the web
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.640]   where Alan Kay vehemently disagreed with the idea
[00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:22.840]   that it should be document-based,
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:25.240]   which is, you know, Tim Berners-Lee,
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:26.680]   and that's kind of what ended up winning
[00:21:26.680 --> 00:21:28.760]   was this document-based kind of browsing documents
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.800]   on the web thing.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:32.120]   Alan Kay, he's got this like very famous quote
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:34.480]   where he said, "You know, you want web browsers
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.160]   "to be mini operating systems.
[00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.000]   "They should download little mini binaries
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.080]   "and execute with like a little mini
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.160]   "virtualized operating system in there."
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:43.760]   And what's kind of interesting about the history,
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:45.080]   not to geek out on this estimate,
[00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.120]   what's kind of interesting about the history
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:47.920]   is both of those folks ended up being right.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:50.560]   Documents were actually the pragmatic way
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.080]   that the web became the most ubiquitous platform
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.760]   in the world, to the degree now
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:57.320]   that this is why WebAssembly has been invented,
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:59.720]   is that we need to do more low-level things in a browser,
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.560]   same thing with WebGPU, et cetera.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:03.400]   And so all these APIs, you know,
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.480]   to build an operating system came to the browser,
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:07.880]   and that was actually the realization we had in 2017
[00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:10.560]   was, holy heck, like you can actually, you know,
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:12.480]   service workers, which were designed
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:14.520]   for allowing your app to work offline,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.880]   that was the kind of the key one
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:17.360]   where it was like, wait a second,
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:20.960]   you can actually now run web servers within a browser.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   Like you can run a server that you open up, that's wild.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.080]   - Like full Node.js.
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.760]   - Full Node.js, like that capability,
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:29.680]   like I can have a URL that's programmatically controlled
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.280]   by a web application itself, boom.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:34.920]   Like the web can build the web, the primitive is there.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.280]   Everyone at the time, like we talked to people
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:38.280]   that like worked on, you know, Chrome and V8,
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:41.200]   and they were like, oh, you know, like, I don't know.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:42.040]   But it's one of those things,
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.680]   you just kind of have to go do it to find out.
[00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.880]   So we spent a couple of years, you know,
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.000]   working on it and got it to work.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.400]   And back in 2021 is when we kind of put the first like data
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.680]   of WebContainer online, but-
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.800]   - In partnership with Google, right?
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:55.280]   Like Google actually had to help you
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:56.600]   get over the finish line with some stuff.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.880]   - Yeah, 100%, because what, you know,
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.480]   over the years of when we were doing the R&D on the thing,
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:03.000]   kind of the biggest challenge,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:04.720]   the two ways that you can kind of test
[00:23:04.720 --> 00:23:07.560]   how powerful and capable a platform are,
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:10.680]   the two types of applications are one, video games, right?
[00:23:10.680 --> 00:23:12.520]   'Cause they're just very compute intensive,
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:15.520]   a lot of calculations that have to happen, right?
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:17.080]   The second one are IDEs,
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:20.880]   because you're talking about actually virtualizing
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.040]   the actual runtime environment you are in
[00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.560]   to actually build apps on top of it,
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.800]   which requires sophisticated capabilities,
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:29.920]   a lot of access to, you know,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.400]   a good amount of compute power, right?
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:34.400]   To effectively, you know, building app in app sort of thing.
[00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:35.840]   So those are the stress tests.
[00:23:35.840 --> 00:23:38.080]   So if your platform is missing stuff,
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.760]   those are the things where you find out.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:42.120]   Those are the people building games and IDEs,
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.520]   they're the ones filing bugs on operating system level stuff,
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:46.720]   and for us, browser level stuff.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.960]   And so, yeah, what ended up happening
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.240]   is we were just hammering, you know,
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:50.760]   the Chromium bug tracker,
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:52.440]   and they're like, "Who are these guys?"
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:54.280]   - Yeah. (laughs)
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:56.200]   - And they were amazing, 'cause I mean,
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.360]   just making Chrome DevTools be able to debug,
[00:23:58.360 --> 00:24:01.120]   I mean, it wasn't originally built right
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:04.040]   for debugging an operating system, right?
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.640]   They've been phenomenal working with us
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:07.480]   and just kind of really pushing the limits.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.800]   But it's a rising tide that's kind of lifted all boats,
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   because now there's a lot of different types
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.360]   of applications that you can debug with Chrome DevTools
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.600]   that are running a browser that runs more reliably,
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:19.160]   because just the stress testing that we,
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.360]   and, you know, games that are coming to the web
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:23.040]   are kind of pushing as well, but.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:23.880]   - That's awesome.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.320]   About the testing, it seems like most,
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.480]   let's say, coding assistants from different kinds
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.520]   will need this loop of testing,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.480]   and even I would add code review
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.480]   to some extent that you mentioned.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.840]   - How is testing different from code review?
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:36.680]   - Code review could be, for example--
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.760]   - Just PR review?
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:40.200]   - PR review is like a code review that is done
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.920]   at the point of when you want to merge code branches.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:46.200]   But I would say that code review, for example,
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:49.400]   checks best practices, maintainability, et cetera.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.680]   - It's not just like CI, but it's more than CI.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:54.440]   - And testing is more like checking functionality,
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.000]   et cetera, so it's different.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:58.520]   We call, by the way, all of these together code integrity,
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:24:59.360]   but that's a different story.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.760]   Just to go back to the testing and--
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.840]   - Still here? - Specifically.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:07.080]   - Yeah, since the first slide.
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.200]   - Yeah, we're consistent.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:10.400]   So if we go back to the testing,
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   I think it's not surprising that for us,
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.720]   testing is important, and for Bolt,
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:16.680]   it's testing is important, but I want to shed some light
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.040]   on a different perspective of it.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:20.760]   Let's think about autonomous driving.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.600]   Those startups that are doing autonomous driving
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:27.120]   for highway and autonomous driving for the city,
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:31.360]   and I think we saw the autonomous of the highway
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:35.200]   much faster and reaching to level, I don't know,
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.680]   four or so, much faster than those in the city.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:41.200]   Now, in both cases, you need testing,
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.960]   and quote-unquote testing, verifying validation
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.720]   that you're doing the right thing on the road
[00:25:46.720 --> 00:25:48.720]   and you're reading and et cetera,
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.720]   but it's probably so different in the city
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.840]   that it could be actually different technology,
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:56.360]   and I claim that we're seeing something similar here.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.480]   So when you're building the next Wix,
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.880]   and if I was them, I was looking at you
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:02.480]   and being a bit scared.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.800]   That's what you're disrupting, what you just said.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:07.160]   Then basically, I would say that, for example,
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:10.160]   that UX/UI is freaking important,
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:14.520]   and because you're more aiming for the end user.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:16.280]   In this case, maybe it's an end user
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:17.760]   that doesn't know how to develop.
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:19.600]   For developers, it's also important,
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:21.640]   but let alone those that do not know how to develop.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:25.160]   They need a slick UI/UX, and I think that's one reason,
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:27.960]   for example, I think Cursor have really good technology.
[00:26:27.960 --> 00:26:30.160]   I don't know the underlying, what's under their hood,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.680]   but at least what they're saying,
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.000]   but I think also their UX/UI is great.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:37.560]   It's a lot because they did their own ID,
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.680]   while if you're aiming for the city AI,
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.320]   suddenly there's a lot of testing and code review technology
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:50.000]   that's not necessarily that important.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:53.160]   For example, let's talk about integration tests.
[00:26:53.160 --> 00:26:57.240]   Probably a lot of what you're building in Bolt at the moment
[00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:01.240]   is isolated applications.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.640]   Maybe the vision or the end game
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.760]   is maybe having one solution for everything.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:12.480]   It could be that eventually the highway AI companies
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:15.080]   will go into the city and the other way around,
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.400]   but at the beginning, there is a difference,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.240]   and integration tests are a good example.
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:21.400]   I guess they're a bit less important,
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:23.640]   and when you think about enterprise software,
[00:27:23.640 --> 00:27:24.720]   they're really important.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.440]   So to recap, I think the idea of looping and verifying your test
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:31.840]   and verifying your code in different ways,
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:33.720]   testing or code review, et cetera,
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.920]   seems to be important in the highway AI and the city AI,
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.040]   but in different ways, and critical for the city,
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:42.560]   even more and more variety.
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.080]   Actually, I was looking to ask you,
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:47.880]   what kind of loops you guys are doing?
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.720]   For example, when I'm using Bolt and I'm enjoying it a lot,
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:53.880]   then I do see sometimes you're trying
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:55.480]   to catch errors and fix them.
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:58.520]   And also, I notice that you're breaking down tasks
[00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.360]   into smaller ones, et cetera, which
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.600]   is already a common notion from a year ago,
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:05.560]   but it seems like you're doing it really well.
[00:28:05.560 --> 00:28:07.840]   So if you're willing to share anything about that.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.960]   Yeah, yeah, totally.
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.280]   I realize I never actually hit the punchline of what
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   I was saying before.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:14.120]   I mentioned the point about us writing an operating
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.880]   system from scratch, because what ended up
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.600]   being important about that is that, to your point,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:19.880]   it's actually a very--
[00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:23.560]   compared to a-- if you're running a cursor on anyone's
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.160]   machine, you kind of don't know what
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.820]   you're dealing with with the OS you're running on.
[00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.280]   There could be an error happens.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.680]   It could be like a million different things, right?
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.840]   There could be some config.
[00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:33.440]   It could be god knows what, right?
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.800]   The thing with WebConnector is because we wrote the entire
[00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:36.600]   thing from scratch.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:39.640]   It's actually a unified image, basically.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:42.280]   And we can instrument it at any level
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.080]   that we think is going to be useful, which
[00:28:44.080 --> 00:28:46.720]   is exactly what we did when we started building Bolt,
[00:28:46.720 --> 00:28:49.400]   is we instrumented stuff at the process level,
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.040]   at the runtime level, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.960]   Stuff that would just be not impossible to do on local,
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.440]   but to do that in a way that works across any operating
[00:28:57.440 --> 00:29:01.640]   system, whatever, I mean, would just be insanely difficult
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:03.360]   to do right and reliably.
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:05.860]   And that's what you saw when you've used Bolt,
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:07.600]   is that when an error actually will occur,
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:08.980]   whether it's in the build process
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:11.120]   or the actual web application itself is failing
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.200]   or anything kind of in between, you can actually
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.240]   capture those errors.
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.280]   And today, it's a very primitive way
[00:29:16.280 --> 00:29:18.920]   of how we've implemented it, largely because the product just
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.000]   didn't exist 90 days ago.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.360]   So we got some work out of us, and we got to hire some more
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:23.920]   a little bit.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.480]   But basically, we present it.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:28.200]   We say, hey, here's kind of the things that went wrong.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.360]   There's a Fix It button and then an Ignore button.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:31.720]   And then you can just hit Fix It,
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:35.680]   and then we take all that telemetry through our agent
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:37.800]   and say, here's the state of the application.
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:41.360]   Here's the errors that we got from Node.js or the browser
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:42.800]   or whatever, and da, da, da, da.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:44.760]   And it can take a crack at actually solving it.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.560]   And it's actually pretty darn good at being able to do that.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:48.600]   That's kind of been a--
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:52.360]   closing the loop and having it be a reliable kind of base
[00:29:52.360 --> 00:29:56.000]   has seemed to be a pretty big upgrade over doing stuff
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.920]   locally, just because I think that's
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.480]   a pretty key ingredient of it.
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.920]   And yeah, I think breaking things down into smaller tasks,
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.640]   that's kind of a key part of our agent.
[00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:06.560]   And I think Claude did a really good job with artifacts.
[00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:08.400]   And I think us and kind of everyone else
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.640]   has kind of taken their approach of actually breaking out
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:14.960]   certain tasks in a certain order into a concrete way.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:16.840]   And so actually, the core of Bolt.io,
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:18.360]   we actually made open source.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.960]   So you can actually go and check out the system prompts
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:23.040]   and et cetera, and you can run it locally
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.160]   and whatever have you.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.900]   So anyone that's interested in this stuff,
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.440]   I'd highly recommend taking a look at.
[00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:30.360]   There's not a lot of stuff that's
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.520]   open source in this realm.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.720]   That was one of the fun things that we thought
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.380]   would be cool to do, and people seem to like it.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.380]   I mean, there's a lot of forks and people adding
[00:30:38.380 --> 00:30:40.560]   different models and stuff, so it's been cool to see.
[00:30:40.560 --> 00:30:42.120]   Yeah, I'm happy to add--
[00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:45.440]   I added real-time voice for my opening Dev Day demo,
[00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:46.960]   and it was really fun to hack with.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:48.200]   So thank you for doing that.
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:48.960]   You didn't have to.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.400]   I'm going to steal your code back.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.360]   It's our fault, because I want that note.
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:54.920]   It's funny, because I built on top of the fork of Bolt.io
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:56.880]   that already has the multi-LLM thing.
[00:30:56.880 --> 00:30:58.320]   And so you just told me you're going to merge that in,
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.360]   so then you're going to merge two layers of forks
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:01.680]   down into this thing.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.640]   So it'll be fun.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.560]   Heck yeah.
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:05.200]   Just to touch on the environment,
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.280]   Eramar, you maybe go into the most complicated environments
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:10.440]   that even the people that work there don't know how to run.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:15.040]   How much of an impact does that have on your performance?
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:17.280]   Like, you know, is most of the work you're doing actually
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.120]   figuring out environment and, like, the libraries?
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.040]   Because I'm sure they're using outdated version of languages.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.600]   They're using outdated libraries.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.440]   They're using forks that have not been on the public internet
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.120]   before.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.720]   How much of the work that you're doing
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:31.440]   is, like, there versus, like, at the LLM level?
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:34.880]   One of the reasons I was asking about, you know,
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:36.960]   what are the steps to break things down,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:40.760]   because it really matters, like, what's the tech stack,
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.600]   how complicated the software is.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.200]   It's hard to figure it out when you're
[00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:48.520]   dealing with the real world, any environment of enterprise.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.720]   It's a city, what I'm--
[00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:52.640]   like, while maybe sometimes, like, I
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:56.240]   think you do enable, like, and bolt, like, to install stuff,
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:58.800]   but it's quite a, like, controlled environment.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:02.280]   And that's a good thing to do, because then you narrow it down
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:05.000]   and it's easier to make things work.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:06.840]   So definitely there are two dimensions.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.720]   I think, actually, spaces.
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:12.320]   One is the fact, just, like, installing our software
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.280]   without yet, like, making it work, just installing it.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.440]   Because we work with enterprise and Fortune 500, et cetera,
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.440]   many of them want on-prem solution.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:22.000]   So--
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.560]   You have how many deployment options?
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.760]   Basically, we did a metrics, let's say, 96 options.
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:31.000]   Because, you know, there are different dimensions.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.840]   Like, for example, one dimension,
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:35.800]   we connect to your code management system,
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.640]   to your Git, so you're having, like, GitHub, GitLab--
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:40.760]   Subversion.
[00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:44.320]   Is it, like, on cloud, or deployed on-prem?
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   Just an example.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   Which model agree to use its APIs, or ours?
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:49.560]   Like, we have our own models--
[00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:50.720]   Is it TestGPT, or is it--
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:52.480]   Yeah, we started with TestGPT.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:54.920]   It was a huge mistake, the name.
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.480]   It was cool at the beginning, but I
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.440]   don't think it's a good idea to name a model
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.120]   after someone else's model.
[00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:02.080]   Anyway, that's my opinion, so we--
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.080]   I'm interested in these learnings, like, things
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:05.560]   that you change your mind on.
[00:33:05.560 --> 00:33:07.320]   Eventually, when you're building a company,
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:08.280]   you're building a brand.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.920]   And you want to create your own brand.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:12.760]   By the way, when I thought about Bolt.new,
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.600]   I also thought about if it's not a problem.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.040]   Because when I think about Bolt, I
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:17.880]   do think about, like, a couple of companies
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.200]   I already called as well.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.280]   Curse companies.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:23.960]   You could call it Codium, just to--
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:25.200]   OK, thank you.
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:27.000]   Touche, touche.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.840]   Yeah, you've got to imagine, the board
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:31.200]   meeting before we launched Bolt, one of our investors--
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:33.360]   you can imagine, they were like, are you sure?
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.800]   Because from the investment side,
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.640]   it was kind of a famous, very notorious Bolt.
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.240]   And they're like, are you sure you want to go with that name?
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:42.200]   Oh, yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.040]   At this point, we have actually four models.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:46.320]   There is a model for autocomplete.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.600]   There is a model for the chat.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:50.200]   There is a model dedicated for more for code review.
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.280]   And there is a model that is for code embedding.
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:57.120]   Actually, you might notice that there isn't a good code
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   embedding model out there.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:03.080]   Can you name one that would dedicate it for code?
[00:34:03.080 --> 00:34:04.480]   Yeah, I can share more than that.
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:05.440]   There's code indexing.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:08.680]   And then you can do sort of like the hide for code.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:12.000]   And then you can embed the descriptions of the code.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.840]   Yeah, but you do see a lot of type
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:17.240]   of models that are dedicated for embedding
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:21.240]   and for different spaces, different fields, et cetera.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.360]   And I'm not aware.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.040]   And I know that if you go to the bedrock,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.280]   try to find there is a few code embedding models.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:31.040]   But none of them are specialized for code.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:32.560]   Is there a benchmark that you would
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:33.960]   tell us to pay attention to?
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   Yeah, so it's coming.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:36.500]   Wait for that.
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.600]   Anyway, we have our models.
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:43.440]   And just to go back to the '96 option of deployment--
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.720]   Yeah, sorry, I can't hear you.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.160]   Yeah, so I'm closing the brackets for us.
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:51.600]   So one is dimensional, like what Git deployment you have.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:53.920]   What models do you agree to use?
[00:34:53.920 --> 00:34:56.880]   Dotter could be like if it's air-gapped completely,
[00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:57.960]   or you want VPC.
[00:34:57.960 --> 00:35:02.560]   And then you have Azure GCP and AWS, which is different.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:04.520]   Do you use Kubernetes or do not?
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:06.480]   Because we want to exploit that.
[00:35:06.480 --> 00:35:09.000]   There are companies that do not do that, et cetera.
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.240]   I guess you know what I mean.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.040]   So that's one thing.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.560]   And considering that we are dealing
[00:35:12.560 --> 00:35:17.000]   with one of all four enterprise, we needed to deal with that.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:19.080]   So you asked me about how complicated
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:20.640]   it is to solve that complex code.
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:22.680]   I said, it's just the deployment part.
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:26.680]   And then now to the software, we see
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:28.760]   a lot of different challenges.
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:31.680]   For example, some companies, they
[00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.200]   did actually a good job to build a lot of microservices.
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:38.320]   Let's not get to if it's good or not.
[00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:41.360]   But let's for a second assume that it is a good thing.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.040]   A lot of microservices, each one of them has their own repo.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:47.040]   And now you have tens of thousands of repos.
[00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:49.400]   And you, as a developer, want to develop something.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:53.440]   And I remember me coming to a corporate for the first time.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:56.880]   And I don't know where to look at, where to find things.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:36:02.200]   So just doing a good indexing for that is a challenge.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.640]   And moreover, the regular indexing,
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:06.840]   the one that you can find-- well, we wrote a few blogs
[00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.640]   on that, by the way.
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:10.320]   We also have some open source, different than yours,
[00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   but actually three and growing.
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:13.480]   Then it doesn't work.
[00:36:13.480 --> 00:36:15.480]   You need to let the tech leads in the companies
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.960]   influence your indexing.
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:22.600]   For example, Mark with different repos with different colors.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:23.920]   This is a high-quality repo.
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.680]   This is a lower-quality repo.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:27.720]   This is a repo that we want to deprecate.
[00:36:27.720 --> 00:36:30.520]   This is a repo we want to grow, et cetera.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.320]   And let that be part of your indexing.
[00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:36.720]   And only then things actually work for enterprise.
[00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.720]   And they don't get to a fatige of, oh, this is awesome.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:42.680]   Oh, but I'm starting-- it's annoying me.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.480]   I think Copilot is an amazing tool.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:47.640]   But I'm quoting others, meaning GitHub Copilot,
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:51.400]   that they see not so good retention of GitHub Copilot
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.600]   in enterprise.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.560]   Ooh, spicy.
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:55.920]   I saw snapshots of people--
[00:36:55.920 --> 00:36:59.240]   and we have customers that are Copilot users as well.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:02.200]   And also, I saw research--
[00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:03.840]   some of them is public, by the way--
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.600]   between 38% to 50% retention for users using Copilot
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:09.960]   in enterprise.
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:11.560]   So it's not so good, right?
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.320]   By the way, I don't think it's that bad.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:14.680]   But it's not so good.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.920]   So I think that's a reason.
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:18.000]   Because, yeah, it helps you auto-complete.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.080]   But then, and especially if you're
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:22.840]   working on your repo alone, but if it
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:26.680]   needs that context of remote repos that are code-based,
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.240]   that's hard.
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.000]   So to make things work, there's a lot of work on that,
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:34.360]   like giving the controllability for the tech leads,
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:38.000]   for the developer platform, or developer experience
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.600]   department in the organization to influence
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.480]   how things are working.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:44.680]   A short example, because already on,
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:48.360]   if you have really old legacy code, probably some of it
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:50.320]   is not so good anymore.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:53.080]   If you just fine-tune on these code base,
[00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   then there is a bias to repeat those mistakes,
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:57.640]   or old practices, et cetera.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.680]   So you need, for example, as I mentioned,
[00:38:01.680 --> 00:38:02.440]   to influence that.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.040]   For example, in Coda, you can have a markdown
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:07.400]   of best practices by the tech leads.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   And Coda will include that, and relate to that,
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.080]   and will not offer suggestions that are not
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:16.000]   according to the best practices, just as an example.
[00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:18.720]   So that's just a short list of things
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:21.880]   that you need to do in order to deal with, like you mentioned,
[00:38:21.880 --> 00:38:28.200]   the 100.1 to 100.2 version of software.
[00:38:28.200 --> 00:38:30.920]   I just want to say, what you're doing is extremely impressive,
[00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.480]   because it's very difficult. I mean,
[00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:35.000]   the business of StackPulse, kind of before bulk came online,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.160]   we sold a version of our IDE that went on-prem.
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:39.680]   So I understand what you're saying
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.920]   about the difficulty of getting stuff just working on-prem.
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:43.640]   Holy heck.
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.760]   I mean, that is extremely hard.
[00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:47.400]   I guess the question I have for you is,
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:50.040]   I mean, we were just doing that with Kubernetes-based stuff.
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.760]   But the spread of Fortune 500 companies
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:52.880]   that you're working with, how are they
[00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:54.080]   doing the inference for this?
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.040]   Are you kind of plugging into Azure's OpenAI stuff,
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:00.920]   and AWS's Bedrock, you know, Cloud stuff?
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:02.920]   Or are they just running stuff on GPUs?
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.920]   Like, what is that?
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:05.520]   How are these folks approaching that?
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.960]   Because, man, from what we saw on the enterprise side,
[00:39:07.960 --> 00:39:10.920]   I mean, I got to imagine that that's a huge challenge.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:13.760]   Everything you said, and more.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.720]   For example, someone could be in a--
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.960]   I don't think any of these is bad.
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.280]   They made their decision.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:22.760]   For example, some people, they're,
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:27.320]   I want only AWS and VPC on AWS, no matter what.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.680]   And then some of them, there is a subset, I would say,
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:35.640]   I'm willing to take models only from Bedrock and not ours.
[00:39:35.640 --> 00:39:38.880]   And we have a problem, because there is no good code embedding
[00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:40.200]   model on Bedrock.
[00:39:40.200 --> 00:39:43.560]   And that's part of what we're doing now with AWS to solve that.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:44.560]   We solve it in a different way.
[00:39:44.560 --> 00:39:47.400]   But if you are willing to run on AWS VPC,
[00:39:47.400 --> 00:39:52.520]   but run your run models on GPUs or Inferentia,
[00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.800]   like the new version, the more coming out,
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.400]   then our models can run on that.
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.040]   But everything you said is right.
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.480]   Like, we see on-prem deployment where
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:03.120]   they have their own GPUs.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:06.680]   We see Azure where they're using OpenAI Azure.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.040]   We see cases where you're running on GCP,
[00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:13.640]   and they want OpenAI, like this cross case.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.200]   Although there is Gemini, or even Sonnet, I think,
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:18.320]   is available on GCP, just an example.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:22.120]   So all the options, that's part of the challenge.
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:23.520]   I admit that we thought about it,
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.160]   but it was even more complicated.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.600]   And it took us a few months to actually,
[00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:30.320]   that metrics that I mentioned, to start clicking
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.280]   each one of the blocks there.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.400]   A few months is impressive.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.800]   I mean, honestly, it just, that's okay.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.680]   And every one of these enterprises is,
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:40.160]   their networking is different, just everything's different.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:41.160]   Every single one is different.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.560]   - As you understand.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.840]   - Yeah, so that just cannot be understated.
[00:40:44.840 --> 00:40:48.160]   Like, that it is, that's extremely impressive.
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.000]   Hats off.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.480]   - It could be, by the way, like, for example,
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:55.480]   oh, we're only AWS, but our GitHub enterprise is on-prem.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:56.920]   Oh, we forgot.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:58.760]   So we need, like, a private link, or whatever.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.800]   Every time, like, it's not.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.000]   And you do need to think about it
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.160]   if you want to work with enterprise.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.000]   And it's important.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:05.840]   - Yeah, I understand.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:08.240]   Like, I respect their point of view.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.400]   - And this primarily impacts your architecture,
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:11.360]   your tech choices.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:13.920]   Like, you have to, you can't choose some vendors because--
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.760]   - Yeah, definitely.
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.560]   To be frank, it makes us hard for a startup
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:20.000]   because it means that we want everyone
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.640]   to enjoy all the variety of models.
[00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:25.320]   By the way, it was hard for us with our technology.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:28.680]   I want to open a bracket, like a window.
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.120]   I guess you're familiar with our Alpha Codium,
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.200]   which is an open source--
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   - We got to go over that.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:34.960]   - Yeah, so I'll do that quickly.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.160]   - A pin in that, yeah.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:39.880]   - Actually, we didn't have it in the last episode, so okay.
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.840]   - Okay, we'll come back to that later,
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:41.920]   but let's talk about--
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.400]   - Yeah, so just, like, shortly,
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:45.320]   and then we can double-click on Alpha Codium.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.080]   But Alpha Codium is an open source tool.
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:48.120]   You can go and try it,
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.800]   and it lets you compete on CodeForce.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:53.120]   This is a website and a competition.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:56.760]   And actually reach a master level, like 95%,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:57.720]   with a click of a button.
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:59.160]   You don't need to do anything.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.360]   And part of what we did there is taking a problem
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:05.920]   and breaking it to different, like, smaller blocks.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:09.600]   And then the models are doing a much better job,
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:11.040]   like we all know it by now,
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:13.600]   that taking small tasks and solving them.
[00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.680]   By the way, even O1,
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:18.920]   which is supposed to be able to do system two thinking,
[00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.320]   like Greg from OpenAI, like, hinted,
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.520]   is doing better on these kind of problems.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.960]   But still, it's very useful to break it down for O1,
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:31.520]   despite O1 being able to think by itself.
[00:42:31.520 --> 00:42:33.560]   And that's what we presented, like, just a month ago.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.600]   OpenAI released it now.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:40.600]   They are doing 93 percentile with O1 IOI left,
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:44.920]   and International Olympiad of Formation.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:45.760]   Sorry, I forgot.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.600]   Exactly.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   I told you I forgot.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:51.400]   And we took their O1 preview with Alpha Codium
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   and did better.
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:53.800]   Like, it just shows, like,
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:55.720]   and there is a big difference between the preview
[00:42:55.720 --> 00:42:57.440]   and the IOI.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.920]   It shows, like, that these models
[00:42:58.920 --> 00:43:01.040]   are not still system two thinkers,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:02.320]   and there is a big difference.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.320]   Yeah, maybe they're not complete system two.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.280]   Yeah, they need some guidance.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.080]   I call them system 1.5.
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:08.400]   We can dive into that.
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:09.240]   I thought about it.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:11.560]   Like, you know, I care about this philosophy stuff,
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.560]   and I think, like, we didn't see it
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:15.160]   even close to a system two thinking.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.280]   I can elaborate later.
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.520]   But closing the bracket, it's like,
[00:43:17.520 --> 00:43:21.960]   we take Alpha Codium, and as our principle of thinking,
[00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:25.800]   we take tasks and break them down to smaller tasks.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   And then we want to exploit the best model to solve them.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:33.800]   So I want to enable anyone to enjoy O1 and Sonnet
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:36.520]   and Gemini 1.5, et cetera.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:37.920]   But at the same time,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.840]   I need to develop my own models as well,
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:42.280]   because some of the Fortune 500
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.320]   want to have all air-gapped or whatever.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.000]   So that's a challenge.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.920]   Now, you need to support so many models.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:53.840]   And to some extent, I would say that the flow engineering,
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:57.320]   the breaking down to different blocks
[00:43:57.320 --> 00:43:58.520]   is a necessity for us.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.360]   Why?
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.680]   Because when you take a big block, a big problem,
[00:44:02.680 --> 00:44:04.720]   you need a very different prompt
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:07.280]   for each one of the models to actually work.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.640]   But when you take, like, a big problem
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:11.920]   and break it into small tasks,
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:13.640]   we can talk how we do that.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.120]   Then the prompt matters less.
[00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:18.720]   What I want to say, like, all this, like,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.400]   as a startup trying to do different deployment,
[00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:23.680]   getting all the juice that you can get from models,
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.440]   et cetera, is a big problem.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:27.200]   And one need to think about it.
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:30.520]   And one of our mitigation is that process
[00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:32.360]   of taking tasks and breaking them down.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.120]   That's why I'm really interested to know
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   how you guys are doing it.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:38.160]   And part of what we do is also open source, so you can see.
[00:44:38.160 --> 00:44:39.160]   - There's a lot in there.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.480]   But yeah, flow over prompt,
[00:44:40.480 --> 00:44:43.360]   I do believe that that does make sense.
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.520]   I feel like there's a lot that both of you
[00:44:45.520 --> 00:44:48.560]   can sort of exchange notes on breaking down problems.
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:50.840]   And I just want you guys to just go for it.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:52.800]   Whatever, like, this is fun to watch.
[00:44:52.800 --> 00:44:55.680]   - Yeah, I mean, what's super interesting is
[00:44:55.680 --> 00:44:57.920]   the context you're working in is,
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.840]   'cause for us too with Bolt,
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:00.800]   we've started thinking,
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:03.360]   because our kind of existing business line
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.600]   was going behind the firewall, right?
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:07.280]   We were like, how do we do this?
[00:45:07.280 --> 00:45:09.840]   Adding the inference aspect on, we're like, okay, how does,
[00:45:09.840 --> 00:45:11.520]   'cause I mean, there's not a lot of prior art, right?
[00:45:11.520 --> 00:45:13.840]   I mean, like, this is all new, you know, this is all new.
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:16.040]   So I definitely am going to have a lot of questions for you.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.080]   - I'm here.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.000]   We're very open, by the way.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.760]   We have a paper on it, a blog, like, whatever.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:22.040]   - The Alphacodeum, GitHub,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:23.760]   and we'll put all this in the show notes.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:28.160]   - Yeah, and even the new results of '01, we published it.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:29.000]   - I love that.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:30.360]   I also just, I think spiritually,
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:34.600]   I like your approach of being transparent and, you know,
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:38.320]   'cause I think there's a lot of hype-ium around AI stuff.
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.080]   And a lot of it is, it's just like,
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:40.920]   you have these companies
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.080]   that are just kind of keep their stuff closed source
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.760]   and then just max hype it,
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.920]   but then it's kind of nothing.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:46.680]   And I think it kind of gives a bad rep
[00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:49.120]   to the incredible stuff that's actually happening here.
[00:45:49.120 --> 00:45:51.200]   And so I think it's stuff like what you're doing where,
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   I mean, true merit and you're cracking open actual code
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.040]   for others to learn from and use, you know,
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.240]   that strikes me as the right approach.
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.000]   And it's great to hear that you're making such incredible.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.400]   - I have something to share about open source.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.240]   Like, most of our tools are,
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.800]   we have like an open source version
[00:46:05.800 --> 00:46:07.760]   and then like a premium pro version,
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:09.800]   but it's not an easy decision to do that.
[00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:11.440]   I actually wanted to ask you about your strategy,
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:12.800]   but I think like, in your case,
[00:46:12.800 --> 00:46:15.840]   there is, in my opinion, relatively a good strategy
[00:46:15.840 --> 00:46:18.320]   where a lot of parts of open source,
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:20.720]   but then you have the deployment and the environment,
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.640]   which is not, right, if I get it correctly.
[00:46:22.640 --> 00:46:24.280]   And then there's a clear, like,
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.920]   almost hugging face, like model, like,
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:27.080]   "Yeah, you can do that,
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:29.680]   but why should you try to deploy it yourself,
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:30.880]   deploy it with us?"
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:33.360]   But in our case, and I'm not sure you're not going to hit
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:36.480]   also some competitors, and I guess you are.
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.600]   I wanted to ask you, for example, on some of them.
[00:46:38.600 --> 00:46:40.200]   In our case, like one day,
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.040]   we looked on one of our competitors
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.600]   that is doing code review.
[00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:45.520]   We are a platform, we have like the code review,
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:48.360]   the testing, et cetera, spread over the ID to get,
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:50.960]   and in each agent, we have a few startups
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:54.960]   or a big, big, like incumbents that are doing only that.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.920]   So we noticed one of our competitors
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:01.760]   having not only a very similar UI of our open source,
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:03.400]   but actually even our typo.
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:05.000]   (laughing)
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.640]   And you know, you sit there and you kind of like,
[00:47:07.640 --> 00:47:09.480]   "Yeah, we're not that good.
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:12.040]   Like, we don't use enough, like, grammarly or whatever."
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:16.560]   And we had like a couple of these and we saw it there.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.640]   And then it's a challenge.
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.760]   Like, and I want to ask you, like, you know,
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:23.200]   Bald is doing so well, and then you open-sourced it.
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.400]   So I think I know what that, my answer was,
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.600]   I gave it before, but still interesting
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:29.440]   to hear what you think.
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:33.440]   - Geohot said back, I think it was when he was,
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.120]   I don't know what he was up to at this exact moment,
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:36.400]   but yeah, I think when on comma AI,
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:37.640]   you know, all that stuff's open source.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:40.120]   And someone had asked him like, "Why is this open source?"
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.080]   And he's like, "If you're not actually confident
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:45.720]   that you can go and crush it and build the best thing,
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:46.560]   then yeah, you should probably
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:47.920]   keep your stuff closed source."
[00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:48.760]   Right?
[00:47:48.760 --> 00:47:49.600]   Like, he said something akin to that,
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:50.680]   I'm probably kind of butchering it,
[00:47:50.680 --> 00:47:51.520]   but I thought that was a really,
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:52.480]   it was kind of a really good point.
[00:47:52.480 --> 00:47:53.440]   And that's not to say that you should just
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:55.360]   open source everything, 'cause for obvious reasons,
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.880]   there's like kind of strategic things
[00:47:56.880 --> 00:47:57.920]   you have to kind of take in mind.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.360]   But I actually think a pretty liberal approach,
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.080]   as liberal as you kind of can be,
[00:48:01.080 --> 00:48:02.080]   it can really make a lot of sense.
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.200]   'Cause I mean, that is so validating
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:05.920]   that like one of your competitors is taking your stuff
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:08.160]   and they're like, "Yeah, like, let's just, you know,
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:09.480]   kind of tweak the styles."
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.560]   And you know, I mean, clearly, right?
[00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.160]   I think it's kind of healthy 'cause it keeps,
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:15.240]   I'm sure back at HQ that day when you saw that,
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:16.360]   you're like, "Oh, all right.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:19.480]   Well, let's, we gotta, we have to grind even harder, right?
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.600]   To make sure we stay ahead."
[00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.960]   And so I think it's actually a very useful,
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.680]   motivating thing for the teams.
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.240]   'Cause you might feel this period of comfort.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:28.000]   I think a lot of companies will have this period of comfort
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:30.480]   where, you know, they're not feeling the competition,
[00:48:30.480 --> 00:48:31.800]   then one day they get disrupted.
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:33.520]   So kind of putting stuff out there
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.320]   and letting people push it,
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:37.640]   forces you to face reality soon, right?
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:40.600]   And actually feel that incrementally
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.880]   so you can kind of adjust course.
[00:48:41.880 --> 00:48:44.520]   And that's, for us, the open-source version of Bolt
[00:48:44.520 --> 00:48:45.800]   has had a lot of features.
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:47.280]   People have been begging us for like,
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.720]   persisting chat messages and checkpoints and stuff.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.560]   Within the first week,
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:52.400]   that stuff was landed in the open-source versions.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.720]   And they're like, "Why can't you ship this?
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.600]   It's in the open," so people have forked it.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.680]   And we're like, "We're trying to keep our servers
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:00.520]   and GPUs online."
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:02.120]   Like we're, you know, like we're just,
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.880]   but it's been great 'cause it's, you know,
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:06.120]   like the folks in the community did a great job,
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.120]   kept us on our toes.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:10.120]   And we've got to know most of these folks too,
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:12.480]   at this point, that have been building these things.
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.040]   And so it actually was very instructive.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.120]   Like, okay, well, if we're gonna go kind of land this,
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:17.800]   there's some UX patterns we can kind of look at
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:19.680]   and the code is open-source to this stuff.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:21.000]   You know, what's great about these, what's not.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:22.920]   So anyway, so I think that's,
[00:49:22.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   yeah, anyways, NetNet, I think it's awesome.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.880]   I think from a competitive point of view for us,
[00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:28.840]   for us, I think in particular, what's interesting
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:33.600]   is the kind of the core technology of web container going.
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:36.040]   And I think that right now,
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.560]   there's really nothing that's kind of on par with that.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:40.320]   And we also like, we have a business of,
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:42.080]   'cause, you know, web container runs in your browser,
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.000]   but to make it work, you have to install stuff from NPM.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.920]   You have to like make cores bypass requests,
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:48.320]   like connected databases,
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.200]   which all require server-side, you know,
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:51.760]   proxying or acceleration.
[00:49:51.760 --> 00:49:54.560]   And so we actually sell web container as a service.
[00:49:54.560 --> 00:49:57.000]   The original, one of the core reasons we open-sourced
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.480]   kind of the core components of Bolt when we launched
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:02.080]   was that, you know, we think that
[00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:04.600]   there's gonna be a lot more of these AI,
[00:50:04.600 --> 00:50:07.120]   in-your-browser AI co-gen experiences,
[00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:10.000]   kind of like what Anthropic did with Artifacts and Clod.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.200]   - By the way, Artifacts uses web containers, not yet.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.880]   - No, yeah. - Should I strike that?
[00:50:14.880 --> 00:50:16.760]   - I think that they've got their own thing at the moment,
[00:50:16.760 --> 00:50:18.800]   but there's been a lot of interest in web containers
[00:50:18.800 --> 00:50:21.320]   from folks doing things in that sort of realm
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:24.960]   and in the AI labs and startups and everything in between,
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.440]   you know, and so I think, no, there'll be,
[00:50:26.440 --> 00:50:28.440]   I imagine a good, you know, over the coming months,
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:30.560]   there'll be lots of things to being announced
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:31.640]   to folks kind of adopting it.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.040]   But yeah, I think effectively.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:34.880]   - Okay, I'll say this.
[00:50:34.880 --> 00:50:37.520]   If you're a large model lab and you want, you know,
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.320]   to build, you know, sandbox environments
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:41.360]   inside of your chat app, you should call Eric.
[00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:43.520]   - But wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:50:43.520 --> 00:50:45.640]   Like, I have a question about that.
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:46.480]   - What? - Yeah.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:48.640]   - Like, I think like OpenAI, you know,
[00:50:48.640 --> 00:50:52.160]   they felt that people are not using their model
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:56.760]   as they would want to, so they built ChatGPT,
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:00.880]   but I would say that ChatGPT now defines OpenAI.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:04.880]   I know they're doing a lot of business from their APIs,
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.520]   but still, is this like how you think?
[00:51:06.520 --> 00:51:10.680]   Like, isn't Bolt.new your business now?
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:14.240]   Like, why don't you like focus on that instead of the--
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:15.560]   - What's your advice as a founder?
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:17.360]   - Well, you're right.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.280]   And so going into it, we, candidly, we were like,
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:22.240]   okay, Bolt.new, this thing is super cool.
[00:51:22.240 --> 00:51:23.800]   I'm like, we think people are stoked.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.000]   Well, we think people will be stoked,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.480]   but we were like, maybe that's allowed, you know,
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:29.120]   at best case scenario, after month one,
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.600]   we'd be mind blown if we added a couple hundred K of error
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:32.760]   or something, you know?
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.040]   And we were like, but we think there's probably gonna be,
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:36.760]   you know, an immediate huge business,
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:40.000]   'cause there was some early poll on, you know,
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.760]   folks wanting to put WebContainer
[00:51:41.760 --> 00:51:43.080]   into their product offerings, you know,
[00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:45.800]   kind of similar to what Bolt is doing or whatever.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:48.920]   We were actually prepared for the inverse outcome here,
[00:51:48.920 --> 00:51:50.800]   but I mean, well, I guess we've seen poll on both,
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:52.800]   but I mean, what's happened with Bolt,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.360]   and you're right, it's actually the same strategy
[00:51:54.360 --> 00:51:57.120]   as like OpenAI or Anthropic, where, you know,
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:52:01.320]   we have a, our chat GPT to OpenAI's APIs is,
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.360]   you know, Bolt to WebContainer.
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:05.560]   And so that's, we've kind of taken that same approach,
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:07.880]   and we're seeing, I guess, kind of some of the similar
[00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:10.640]   results, except our, right now the revenue side
[00:52:10.640 --> 00:52:14.880]   is extremely lopsided to Bolt, right?
[00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:16.840]   - I think like, if you ask me what's my advice,
[00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:18.400]   I think you have three options.
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.840]   One is to focus on Bolt.
[00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.080]   The other is to focus on the WebContainer.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:27.320]   The third is to raise $1 billion or whatever,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.360]   and do them both.
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:29.960]   I'm serious, like, I think like,
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.280]   otherwise you need to choose.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.560]   And if you raise enough money, like,
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.720]   and I think it's big bucks,
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:38.560]   because you're going to be chased by competitors,
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:40.720]   and it's, I think it will be challenging, like,
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.040]   to do both, like, and maybe, maybe you can.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.680]   I don't know, like, we do see these numbers right now,
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:49.320]   raising above $100 million, even without having a product.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:50.520]   You can see these.
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.400]   - It's excellent advice.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.320]   And I think what's been amazing,
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.920]   but also kind of challenging is you, you know,
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:57.840]   we're like trying to forecast, you know,
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:59.440]   okay, well, what, where are these things going?
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:00.880]   'Cause I mean, in the initial weeks,
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:02.440]   I think us and all the, you know,
[00:53:02.440 --> 00:53:03.640]   investors in the company that we're kind of
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:05.040]   sharing this with, we were, it was like,
[00:53:05.040 --> 00:53:07.320]   this is cool, okay, we added 500K.
[00:53:07.320 --> 00:53:08.160]   Wow, that's crazy.
[00:53:08.160 --> 00:53:09.000]   Wow, we're at a million now, okay.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.160]   And you kind of, you know, most things,
[00:53:11.160 --> 00:53:13.640]   you have this kind of the tech crunch launch of initiation,
[00:53:13.640 --> 00:53:15.280]   and then the thing of sorrow.
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.080]   And this is, this is just, you know,
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:19.200]   we haven't, if there's going to be a downturn,
[00:53:19.200 --> 00:53:21.160]   it just, it's just not coming yet.
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:22.640]   Now that we're kind of looking ahead,
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.600]   we're six weeks in.
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:25.880]   So now we're getting enough confidence in our convictions
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:28.280]   to go, okay, this, this kind of seems to be,
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:29.720]   this seems to be the trend line.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.000]   - I'll tell you what other reason why I think like,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.640]   where is Jasper?
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.960]   - They actually just announced some new numbers recently.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:37.880]   Like they, you know, they're still surviving.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:38.720]   They have gone down a lot.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.920]   I think that the peak that I heard was 100 billion ARR.
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.760]   - Right.
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.600]   - And then they died.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:45.520]   - And now, you know, there's like tens of these.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:49.920]   So I think like, and their success was phenomenal.
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.840]   Like what I see at Bolt.
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:54.920]   And I think like, if you want to keep that probably,
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.760]   who am I?
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.080]   Like, I'm just like giving my two cents.
[00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:57.920]   - No, I think you're right though.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:59.520]   - You need to focus because you are like,
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:01.920]   you are going to see like weeks.
[00:54:01.920 --> 00:54:03.800]   I think that you're disrupting their market
[00:54:03.800 --> 00:54:06.000]   and you open sourced some of it
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:08.200]   and they have containers, I believe.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.040]   - Yeah.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:09.880]   - And you need to fight.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:11.240]   Like, I can tell you that when we open,
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:13.560]   so like I share with you like a small competitor,
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.280]   but I can tell you, I have a friend
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:19.400]   who has built a billion dollar company and more.
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:21.000]   Like when we released Alpha Codium,
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:23.400]   he like sent me a private email asking,
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:25.160]   what the fuck did you just do?
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:26.360]   Like, why did you release that?
[00:54:26.360 --> 00:54:27.280]   - You should have kept it.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.960]   - Yeah, like you released that open source.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.760]   Like, you know, I'm thinking build some stuff
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.400]   and now I can do that much more easily.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:35.480]   I can tell you my answer.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:37.520]   And I think, I thought that maybe you will answer as well.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.280]   Although like, I think Bolt already very promising.
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:43.760]   For us, like Alpha Codium one is like GPT one.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:46.440]   I agree with you, like being open and open source,
[00:54:46.440 --> 00:54:48.840]   et cetera, really helps to improve the product community,
[00:54:48.840 --> 00:54:49.680]   et cetera.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.000]   But at some point opening,
[00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   I closed their GPT 3.5 or whatever.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.960]   And that was part of my answer.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:59.760]   Like Alpha Codium is the agent that is compatible
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.200]   with GPT one.
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:03.480]   And there is a lot to do for these agents
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.000]   to actually get that like moment that we had
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.720]   with GPT 3.5, et cetera, as agents.
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:10.600]   - Yeah, I think you did right.
[00:55:10.600 --> 00:55:12.600]   And I think it just comes back to,
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:14.360]   it kind of comes back to what GeoHot said, right?
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:16.200]   It's like, you know, if you want to win,
[00:55:16.200 --> 00:55:18.520]   there's no other option than out hustling everyone else.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:20.200]   You know, and so I think that's kind of,
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.560]   and then out hustling in the sense,
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:23.520]   really meaning building the best product,
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:24.840]   building the best experiences.
[00:55:24.840 --> 00:55:27.240]   And so, and I think that's the only way
[00:55:27.240 --> 00:55:30.040]   kind of almost any route and, you know,
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:31.480]   kind of open source and some of the stuff
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:33.320]   just kind of burns the ships in a sense, right?
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.840]   And then maybe that's the simplest way of saying it,
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:36.040]   just you're burning the ships,
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.160]   but also it builds a lot of goodwill.
[00:55:38.160 --> 00:55:40.160]   Yeah, I mean, there's a lot, tons of benefits to it.
[00:55:40.160 --> 00:55:41.440]   - Salesforce are doing that, right?
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:44.120]   They're now going to be agent force or whatever.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:45.600]   So you can also.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:48.040]   - We're going to try to get Mark on the podcast
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:51.200]   and Decibel is good friends with Salesforce.
[00:55:51.200 --> 00:55:52.720]   Any parting thoughts, any, you know,
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:54.720]   trends that you're like super excited about?
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:56.160]   - If we're talking about trends,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.400]   I go back to our original podcast
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.720]   where we talked about like the idea
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:03.840]   that the software world is like built
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:06.400]   from specs, tests, and code.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   And I think like you can see that like one dimension
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:13.440]   are company startups that are rethinking
[00:56:13.440 --> 00:56:16.840]   the entire like development environment.
[00:56:16.840 --> 00:56:19.040]   Like I think like Bolt, et cetera.
[00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:21.640]   And another dimension is like, where's their focus?
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.800]   Is it like on the spec, is on the test and on the code?
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.640]   And I think like, it's interesting to see that
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.960]   from that view.
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.640]   We'll see more startup and more amazing announcement
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.080]   like of new directions, new philosophy.
[00:56:34.080 --> 00:56:36.280]   So I think we'll see startup like focusing,
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:38.600]   let's build everything from the spec.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:41.440]   To some extent, I would say that like Bolt is,
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.080]   from my understanding, you can say better,
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.120]   somewhere in the line between the spec and the code,
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:47.080]   because you start, like I saw your demos,
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:48.680]   you're trying to describe like things,
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:50.000]   like not just in one row,
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:52.080]   because you wanna like to look like you want in it.
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:54.960]   So it's on that edge between connecting
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.400]   between spec and code.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.080]   And you see others like, I think like all the IDs,
[00:56:59.080 --> 00:57:02.760]   most of them are the new IDs or the fork are there.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:05.160]   We are like more focused from the test
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:07.840]   and to the code and to the spec, et cetera.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:10.680]   So these are trends, I think like we will see that.
[00:57:10.680 --> 00:57:14.360]   And I think like another dimension to consider is like,
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:18.160]   is it more for the highway AI, for the developers,
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.240]   maybe not even like the technical person
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.880]   or is it for the enterprise?
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.200]   And that also like gives you like different products.
[00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:28.840]   If they are aiming for different ICP,
[00:57:28.840 --> 00:57:30.880]   different ideal client profile,
[00:57:30.880 --> 00:57:34.440]   they will approach this triangle of spec and test and code.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:36.200]   And that's like how I see the world.
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.600]   And what I'm noticing is that we're seeing more and more
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:42.640]   of those new startups, new interfaces
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.000]   that are not focused on code.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.400]   For example, talking more about the spec,
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.160]   talking more about the testing.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.360]   Eventually I think that that's where the world is going to.
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.000]   Like the code is going to be there
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.200]   and there will be developers, et cetera.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:58:03.000]   But as agent improves and capabilities of the LLMs
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.640]   and integrations to different parts of the environment,
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.800]   development environment, we're going to see more and more
[00:58:08.800 --> 00:58:11.360]   like focusing on the spec and the test.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:13.440]   Basically, like these two might unite,
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:14.280]   the spec and the test,
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:18.680]   because you can say that tests are runnable specs,
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   right, to some extent.
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:21.720]   So like that's another way to look at it.
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:23.680]   - Literally on the slide here,
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:25.120]   runnable tests right here.
[00:58:25.120 --> 00:58:25.960]   - Yeah, I'm consistent.
[00:58:25.960 --> 00:58:26.800]   - It's all consistent.
[00:58:26.800 --> 00:58:29.560]   - Yeah, look, I talked about system one and system two,
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.960]   like more than a year ago.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.800]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:36.200]   - And now with O1, people are talking about system one.
[00:58:36.200 --> 00:58:37.320]   But I think we'll talk about it again
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:39.720]   because I think they're totally, totally wrong
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.040]   about O1 being a system two.
[00:58:42.040 --> 00:58:44.760]   So like, it is now like in the hype
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.480]   or whatever talking about that.
[00:58:46.480 --> 00:58:48.680]   But I think like the agents are the one
[00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:51.600]   that will take us towards system two.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.440]   And the more they are aware of their environment
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:58:58.080]   and aware of that sometimes they don't know
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:59.360]   what they don't know,
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:01.320]   then we'll really get to system two.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:02.800]   But that's like a deeper discussion.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:04.200]   - It's a deeper discussion.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:06.680]   Love the philosophy talk that we had last time as well.
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:08.600]   All right, so we're back onto Bolt
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.680]   and it's more hard to leave for another interview,
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:12.960]   but we were just talking about like the,
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.480]   what happened post-launch, right?
[00:59:14.480 --> 00:59:19.480]   And I held this sort of emergency council of advisors
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:22.520]   for you because we had never seen this before.
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:23.480]   And I was like, okay, I'm going to call
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.960]   all the smartest people I know to join this thing.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.040]   - Which was extremely helpful.
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:28.320]   I'm so appreciative.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:29.760]   There's been a handful of me.
[00:59:29.760 --> 00:59:32.840]   - You made a couple, you made one hire out of that.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.120]   - Yeah, 'cause it was like,
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:37.320]   I think I can't remember where we were at kind of ARR wise
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:38.640]   when I had messaged you.
[00:59:38.640 --> 00:59:41.440]   - It was like, you messaged me at like two or three.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:42.280]   - Okay.
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:43.640]   - And then by the time we got everything together,
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:44.840]   it was four.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:46.800]   And then, yeah, now it's at.
[00:59:46.800 --> 00:59:48.800]   - Since Eric sat down five minutes.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.400]   (both laughing)
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.600]   - But I mean, it sounds like you've accelerated
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   'cause you told me it was like 100K, 200K a day.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.840]   And now it's accelerated.
[00:59:56.840 --> 00:59:59.440]   - Yeah, this past, I mean,
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:03.000]   every week has been kind of a blowout week as far as.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:03.840]   - Is it TikTok?
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.560]   - We're digging into the degree that we can.
[01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:08.480]   Kind of just like where all this stuff's coming from.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:10.480]   I mean, there's a ton of word of mouth, right?
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.320]   So that you can't,
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.400]   which you can't just like look by refer, right?
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:14.480]   So there's a ton of direct.
[01:00:14.480 --> 01:00:16.720]   But yeah, I mean, there's a lot of TikTok.
[01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.360]   There's a ton of YouTube.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360]   It's kind of, I think, been a sensation
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.920]   in the sort of like, you know, entrepreneurial,
[01:00:22.920 --> 01:00:24.920]   build your own SaaS, indie hacker,
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:26.920]   you know, even developer circles.
[01:00:26.920 --> 01:00:28.360]   And I think too, like our team's been doing
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:29.320]   a really good job.
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:30.960]   Our folks just kind of like flipped a switch.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:31.960]   And like, we, you know,
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:33.520]   people were just working through the weekends
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:34.640]   or whatever to get stuff fixed.
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:35.760]   And so the product,
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.120]   and you'll see people say this online.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:39.040]   Like today, there was a tweet.
[01:00:39.040 --> 01:00:40.920]   Someone was like, yeah, I tried this like the first week
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:42.240]   and like couldn't get whatever to work.
[01:00:42.240 --> 01:00:45.640]   Came back today, you know, six weeks later,
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.960]   and this is ridiculous.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.320]   Like, this is so good, right?
[01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:50.080]   And so I think there's been an incredible amount
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.360]   of improvement to the product, to the agent,
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.240]   also to like the underlying models too, like Sonnet,
[01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:57.360]   you know, that just happened to do an update on,
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:59.880]   you know, with their release like a couple of weeks ago.
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:00.720]   And so, you know,
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:03.080]   when we put our new agent online and the new Sonnet,
[01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:06.440]   we saw a huge bump in conversion just based on that.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:08.560]   And so, yeah, like, you know, we've gone at that.
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:11.200]   When we were chatting, that must have been three weeks ago,
[01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.960]   you know, maybe an average of 100K ARR per day.
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.360]   And, you know, this week I will see,
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.920]   so I've said this every week, but we'll see if it holds.
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:19.120]   You know, it's like kind of, we've,
[01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:20.520]   the past couple of days have been like, you know,
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:22.240]   half a million of ARR per day.
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.720]   Just, I mean, which, you know, insane.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:26.640]   I mean, you know, I think today we had our peak,
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:27.800]   we've had peak traffic, you know,
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:29.280]   just kind of set the previous, you know,
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.880]   and that's kind of been, you know, every day this week.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:32.800]   But anyways, yeah, I think things just continue
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.080]   to accelerate, which is kind of blowing my mind, you know,
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:37.200]   'cause it's just the sheer numbers of this stuff
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:38.840]   are just like mind boggling.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:43.160]   - I think you almost suffered from like the Twitter demo
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.360]   issues that other people had.
[01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:45.880]   Like the first time I saw Bolt,
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:47.760]   I saw the demo and I was like, oh, that's cool.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.400]   Like I didn't go to try it because I was like,
[01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:51.320]   I've seen so many of these that it's like,
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:52.920]   I don't know if it's actually gonna work.
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:55.800]   And then two days ago, I signed up to use it.
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:58.080]   I was building a Luma replacement.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.520]   I'm done with Luma.
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:02.160]   And I was like, man, this thing really works.
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:04.600]   I was like, and I already knew you, of course.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:06.240]   And I was like, man, this thing really works.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.080]   What the fuck?
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:08.840]   I was like, it's actually,
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:10.080]   I don't know if it's like the model,
[01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.520]   if it's like how you prompt it,
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.120]   but it's so good at coming up with like
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:15.320]   the simplest thing to implement.
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:16.840]   So the Luma example, right?
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:19.760]   So first I was like, create a RSVP page for an event
[01:02:19.760 --> 01:02:21.240]   and it created a wedding RSVP.
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:23.040]   I don't know if it's your fault.
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:25.680]   I don't know if you Bolted it of the model.
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:27.520]   And then I was like, well, now I need to have a way
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.400]   to create more events and added that.
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:30.480]   And then I was like, now it needs a way
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.080]   to like have an admin page to modify event.
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.080]   And maybe what I would have done as a developer,
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.520]   it's like, well, I'll create a different like admin view,
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.480]   you know, with all the events.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.080]   And then I'll have like the front end thing.
[01:02:40.080 --> 01:02:41.200]   And instead what it did is like,
[01:02:41.200 --> 01:02:43.800]   it created like a admin view toggle on top.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.280]   And then like just a pencil button on every page
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.080]   to edit them in line, you know?
[01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:48.920]   And that was it.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.160]   And I was like, yeah, that works just as well.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:52.520]   And like for the model,
[01:02:52.520 --> 01:02:54.120]   that's probably the simplest way to do it
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:02:56.800]   because it like limits the amount of files that are there.
[01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.100]   Can you talk just more about how much of this is like
[01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.120]   the model coming out with it,
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:02.440]   how much you're prompting it to kind of like be
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.120]   very like compressed and concise?
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.320]   - A ton of it is the model,
[01:03:06.320 --> 01:03:08.520]   but I think what's interesting though is,
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:09.800]   you know, kind of the baseline model,
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:12.080]   if I just like, if it's kind of like,
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:13.520]   try and put it into like a, you know,
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:17.320]   way if you had to quantify, you know, the effect is obvious.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.800]   The model is like this sort of like 10X multiplier.
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:22.800]   How good the bottom line model is, huge, huge swing.
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:24.800]   And then kind of what you can do on top of that,
[01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:28.240]   you can squeeze out three, four X kind of more.
[01:03:28.240 --> 01:03:29.740]   And so that's kind of where the realm of, you know,
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:32.420]   prompt engineering and multi-agent approaches, et cetera,
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.380]   kind of kick in.
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.860]   And so I think with us, you know, our folks,
[01:03:35.860 --> 01:03:38.540]   like the guy on our side that, you know,
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:40.020]   led the web engineering,
[01:03:40.020 --> 01:03:42.220]   like that kind of our core technology for the past,
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:43.660]   you know, seven years here, you know,
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:45.820]   his name is Dominic Elm, based out of Germany,
[01:03:45.820 --> 01:03:48.300]   and he was one of the founding engineers of the company.
[01:03:48.300 --> 01:03:49.140]   Previous to StackBlitz,
[01:03:49.140 --> 01:03:51.420]   he actually was doing machine learning.
[01:03:51.420 --> 01:03:54.220]   And he basically had built a StackBlitz,
[01:03:54.220 --> 01:03:56.320]   like online IDE for machine learning.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.500]   So think like a kind of like Google Colab sort of thing,
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:00.700]   or like Hugging Face has their kind of version of this.
[01:04:00.700 --> 01:04:04.780]   Back in 2016, it wasn't as much of a market for this stuff.
[01:04:04.780 --> 01:04:06.900]   But he had been doing a lot of, you know,
[01:04:06.900 --> 01:04:08.960]   training, you know, ML models and that sort of thing.
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:11.500]   So I guess, you know, as we began, you know,
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:13.660]   kind of digging into AI stuff over the past year,
[01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.500]   he's been kind of leading that off.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:17.780]   And so a lot of it, I really attribute
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:20.540]   to Dom's specific angle,
[01:04:20.540 --> 01:04:23.020]   'cause he has deep understanding of our technology
[01:04:23.020 --> 01:04:24.180]   and how it works 'cause he's, you know,
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:26.020]   led the engineering on WebContainer.
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:29.260]   But has a deep understanding of how these models work.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:32.140]   Going and actually kind of writing out these, you know,
[01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:34.580]   whether it's like the prompt engineering aspect of it,
[01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.780]   or multi-agent or whatever have you, you know,
[01:04:36.780 --> 01:04:39.140]   that's sort of like that much context.
[01:04:39.140 --> 01:04:41.260]   And the other folks on the team are, you know,
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.960]   in the same sort of spot.
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.540]   They've been working on this stuff.
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:46.500]   I think we've been able to squeeze out a lot more
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:48.660]   than I've seen almost anything else out there,
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:50.920]   at least in the term of building web apps, at least.
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:52.900]   But I think it's kind of just because
[01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:57.060]   we have more context on a fewer number of heads
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:04:57.900]   at the company.
[01:04:57.900 --> 01:05:00.100]   So we can kind of connect the dots of it faster, you know?
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:01.140]   - Yeah, that's part of the issue
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.680]   with the whole raise a billion dollars thing.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.980]   Like you actually run very lean
[01:05:04.980 --> 01:05:06.900]   and that's actually been to your advantage.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:09.660]   - Totally, and I think we have to staff up
[01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:12.940]   'cause we went from, you know, call it zero customers
[01:05:12.940 --> 01:05:17.060]   to, you know, 20, 30,000 kind of, you know, in six weeks.
[01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.020]   We have to have certainly more customer support,
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:21.700]   customer success stuff, et cetera.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:23.740]   But you know, also just on non-engineering,
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:24.580]   we have to ramp up.
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:26.740]   But I do think that there's a,
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.700]   we saw this in the 2021 cycle, right?
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.540]   Where, you know, adding tons more people
[01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.540]   can be a thing that really hurts, you know, the company,
[01:05:34.540 --> 01:05:36.980]   because you can, it's just harder.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.540]   It's really hard to manage lots of people.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.340]   And that's, if you're a big enough company
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:42.180]   to warrant a certain headcount, 100%,
[01:05:42.180 --> 01:05:43.660]   you kind of have to do it, right?
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:46.660]   But I think for us, it's worked just to really,
[01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:49.420]   you know, grow the team slowly and intentionally.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:51.060]   And so I think we're gonna take the same approach here
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:53.220]   at a bit of a faster clip than we were previously.
[01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:56.100]   But to me, that would just be general advice to startups
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:05:57.860]   is like slowly, intentionally,
[01:05:57.860 --> 01:06:00.980]   as fast as you can to meet demand or whatever.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:03.260]   - Part of what I felt,
[01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:05.220]   like you're in a unique position to talk about,
[01:06:05.220 --> 01:06:08.940]   but also kind of what we went through in our call was,
[01:06:08.940 --> 01:06:10.260]   I have PMF, now what?
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:13.060]   Is kind of what I've been saying.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:15.340]   And so like, I think the first answer
[01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:16.780]   is hire a data scientist.
[01:06:16.780 --> 01:06:19.900]   Because we have to sort of figure out like from our data,
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:22.340]   you're now sitting on a ton of different customers
[01:06:22.340 --> 01:06:25.460]   and we don't really know the different customer segments.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:27.060]   You're starting to get an idea of churn.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:29.020]   You're starting to get an idea of like segmentation.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.700]   You already had data enrichment.
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.140]   One of my most interesting quotes from you
[01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:34.460]   from that session was that
[01:06:34.460 --> 01:06:36.700]   because you were selling to enterprise for so long,
[01:06:36.700 --> 01:06:38.860]   you had already set up all that stuff
[01:06:38.860 --> 01:06:40.700]   and it just like wasn't useful
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.820]   for a more sort of developer, bottom-up centric approach.
[01:06:43.820 --> 01:06:45.420]   - Yeah, and particularly because
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.860]   for the first time in the company's history,
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:49.700]   we're selling primarily to almost non-developers.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.340]   And so everything that we've ever,
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.020]   all the playbooks we had, not relevant here, basically.
[01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:55.860]   Right?
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:59.420]   So one of our investors I talked with earlier this week,
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.660]   basically brought up a really great point,
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:03.780]   which is like, you are now a B2C company
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:06.860]   and how you operate needs to reflect that.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:07.900]   - Which is what?
[01:07:07.900 --> 01:07:08.740]   I don't know.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.660]   - Which is basically from an analytics perspective,
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.860]   like you're tracking everything, right?
[01:07:13.860 --> 01:07:17.660]   And to your point, you have people kind of around the clock
[01:07:17.660 --> 01:07:20.220]   slicing and dicing data to understand
[01:07:20.220 --> 01:07:21.820]   who are these people coming in,
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:23.700]   who are the types of people you actually want to retain
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:25.620]   versus people that you know are just gonna churn out.
[01:07:25.620 --> 01:07:28.780]   And that's okay 'cause they're not the actual like ICP
[01:07:28.780 --> 01:07:30.340]   that you're going for, right?
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:32.140]   When you're building stuff for enterprise software,
[01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:33.380]   the bar is a lot lower.
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.100]   And so kind of from the conversation before,
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:36.940]   one of the biggest,
[01:07:36.940 --> 01:07:38.060]   and this is kind of what we found with StackBlitz,
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.340]   which is kind of interesting.
[01:07:39.340 --> 01:07:41.340]   You mentioned it's like, as a startup,
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:44.700]   it's very hard to sell on prem, extremely true.
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:46.300]   But if you can do it, it's like the promised land
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:49.340]   because these companies, they're Fortune 500s,
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:51.180]   they can write really large checks.
[01:07:51.180 --> 01:07:52.700]   And so when you're going and selling to them,
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:54.300]   it doesn't matter so much like on your website.
[01:07:54.300 --> 01:07:55.940]   Sure, you want to track the conversion
[01:07:55.940 --> 01:07:58.580]   to the enterprise contact form or whatever, right?
[01:07:58.580 --> 01:08:00.340]   But what actually really matters
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.540]   is like a lot of human touch points of,
[01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:06.340]   hey, we want to have a quarterly call after,
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:07.620]   just getting installed and stuff.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.660]   There's a whole playbook for that.
[01:08:08.660 --> 01:08:09.780]   And you need to hire sales engineers
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:10.980]   that can be on the ground floor
[01:08:10.980 --> 01:08:12.100]   and helping people install it.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:13.740]   Then after that, you got to, okay,
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.660]   how do we make sure they're kind of constantly successful?
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:17.820]   Because you can't access,
[01:08:17.820 --> 01:08:20.460]   like we can, our enterprise customer instances,
[01:08:20.460 --> 01:08:22.220]   we have no idea how often they're using them.
[01:08:22.220 --> 01:08:23.040]   Why?
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:23.880]   Because the whole point is that
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:27.740]   we can't see what they're up to for a good reason, right?
[01:08:27.740 --> 01:08:29.700]   Like they need to own their data.
[01:08:29.700 --> 01:08:30.540]   And so the way,
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:32.540]   it's actually much a very complicated problem
[01:08:32.540 --> 01:08:34.540]   of how do you have like build relationships
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.780]   where everyone's getting on calls,
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.980]   they can share kind of the telemetry
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:38.860]   that they can see within their instance,
[01:08:38.860 --> 01:08:40.380]   and you can kind of extrapolate that,
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.020]   make sure they're happy and successful.
[01:08:42.020 --> 01:08:44.380]   So there's a whole art of that,
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:46.140]   of doing enterprise well,
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:49.700]   that we've gone and done and closed these folks,
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:51.380]   totally unrelated to doing B2C,
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:53.620]   completely unrelated for the most part.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:55.940]   So anyway, so that, as a company,
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:57.740]   we're kind of reorienting, you know,
[01:08:57.740 --> 01:08:59.180]   our focus on, okay,
[01:08:59.180 --> 01:09:01.620]   going and actually really leaning in on analytics,
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.460]   whatever have you.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:04.100]   And fortunately, like my co-founder and I,
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.860]   the enterprise business at StatWoods
[01:09:05.860 --> 01:09:08.460]   was the first time we had ever done enterprise.
[01:09:08.460 --> 01:09:10.140]   Primarily, like thanks to the company we did before,
[01:09:10.140 --> 01:09:10.980]   was B2C.
[01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.340]   Like we were selling people courses
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.540]   on how to do web development, basically, right?
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:17.340]   So a lot of the skillset that, you know,
[01:09:17.340 --> 01:09:18.420]   I had built up there,
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:20.780]   I'm able to pull that back off the shelf,
[01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:22.100]   dust it off, sharpen the blade,
[01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:24.700]   and you know, we're doing email marketing,
[01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:26.500]   we're doing live streams, you know?
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.180]   So anyway, so that's, it's kind of cool to, you know,
[01:09:29.180 --> 01:09:30.940]   be shifting back to some of the,
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:32.500]   where we cut our teeth on back in the day.
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:33.980]   - How did you pick the pricing?
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.180]   - Because I had to pay.
[01:09:35.180 --> 01:09:37.220]   (laughing)
[01:09:37.220 --> 01:09:38.860]   - That's fantastic, that's fantastic.
[01:09:38.860 --> 01:09:40.620]   - Yeah, you want to like, slightly like,
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:41.460]   "Ugh, ugh."
[01:09:41.460 --> 01:09:44.900]   - It's like, you're running out of tokens, dude.
[01:09:44.900 --> 01:09:46.780]   I was like, "Fuck, I'm running out of tokens?"
[01:09:46.780 --> 01:09:48.460]   It's like, "I don't want to run out of tokens."
[01:09:48.460 --> 01:09:50.780]   But there's like five different tiers, right?
[01:09:50.780 --> 01:09:53.700]   Which are kind of like token-based and capacity-based.
[01:09:53.700 --> 01:09:56.380]   How do you reconcile that and the consumer side,
[01:09:56.380 --> 01:09:58.860]   where maybe the consumer doesn't even really need to know
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.140]   what a token is, right?
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.620]   Like on that, like your mom probably doesn't really care
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.740]   what an AI token is.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:05.220]   How did you structure it to start?
[01:10:05.220 --> 01:10:06.140]   How did you come up with that?
[01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:08.980]   And then maybe ideas that you have to like improve
[01:10:08.980 --> 01:10:10.020]   or like modify that.
[01:10:10.020 --> 01:10:10.860]   - Totally, yeah.
[01:10:10.860 --> 01:10:13.140]   So when we first launched with StackBlitz is like,
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:14.860]   we were an enterprise play, right?
[01:10:14.860 --> 01:10:17.220]   And so when we launched in 2017,
[01:10:17.220 --> 01:10:19.060]   I think we tried pricing 2018 or 2019,
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:20.180]   like it was free for a long time.
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.020]   And then we had a $9 plan and that was just the way it was.
[01:10:23.020 --> 01:10:25.820]   It was kind of like our $1.50 hotdog at Costco.
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.580]   It's kind of like this, you know, just low price,
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.020]   just, you know, it wasn't the primary rev driver.
[01:10:31.020 --> 01:10:32.140]   And we just wanted to, you know, say,
[01:10:32.140 --> 01:10:33.460]   "Hey, pay for some more storage
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:35.060]   and private projects or whatever."
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.180]   And so we went to launch bolt again,
[01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:37.620]   like our expectation was,
[01:10:37.620 --> 01:10:39.460]   "Hey, we'll probably get a good number of people
[01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:41.140]   that'll sign up and be excited about it.
[01:10:41.140 --> 01:10:42.780]   And, you know, we're not too concerned."
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:44.060]   You know, we're just, we're just not,
[01:10:44.060 --> 01:10:46.540]   we were unprepared for the tsunami that hit.
[01:10:46.540 --> 01:10:48.500]   And so after going online the first week,
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:49.500]   we were like, "Wow, this is cool."
[01:10:49.500 --> 01:10:51.420]   There's, I mean, it just kept growing.
[01:10:51.420 --> 01:10:54.100]   And then once we hit week two, I mean, we were just,
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:55.140]   nine bucks was, I mean,
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.820]   it's like the cheapest AI coding thing you can get,
[01:10:57.820 --> 01:10:58.700]   maybe other than copilot,
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.180]   but like we were overrun by support tickets
[01:11:02.180 --> 01:11:04.620]   and just the sheer volume of people coming in.
[01:11:04.620 --> 01:11:06.020]   It's just laws of supply and demand.
[01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:07.900]   We were like, "Okay, this isn't,
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.420]   there's no way we can scale to meet this."
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.700]   Also, the people coming in
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.340]   are burning through their tokens
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:16.660]   and there's no way to actually like buy more of these things.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:17.580]   And nine bucks is just,
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:20.140]   you can't get that much inference out of that.
[01:11:20.140 --> 01:11:22.220]   And so here's the other thing that's interesting about bolt
[01:11:22.220 --> 01:11:24.580]   compared to like something like copilot or whatever.
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:26.020]   And this kind of tied this,
[01:11:26.020 --> 01:11:27.820]   sorry, a little bit of a roundabout way
[01:11:27.820 --> 01:11:28.660]   to answer your question.
[01:11:28.660 --> 01:11:31.220]   But basically what we ended up at that moment,
[01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.180]   we ended up realizing is that when you use copilot,
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.020]   what it's sending up,
[01:11:35.020 --> 01:11:37.260]   it doesn't provide a lot of context of your code base.
[01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:39.740]   They try and reduce the amount of context
[01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.180]   as much as they can.
[01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:44.140]   And I think the origins of this stuff is they,
[01:11:44.140 --> 01:11:45.820]   everyone kind of wants this like low price point
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:46.780]   where it's like all you can eat.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:48.420]   So it just kind of, it kind of feels like,
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.460]   'cause it's like, it almost like Netflix.
[01:11:50.460 --> 01:11:51.380]   It's like, I'll pay a thing
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:54.500]   and then I can just do as much of the movie watching
[01:11:54.500 --> 01:11:55.340]   as I want.
[01:11:55.340 --> 01:11:57.860]   And I think that kind of mentality
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:59.740]   when these first AI products came, it kind of makes sense.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:01.300]   They're like, "Okay, well, we don't want to meter it
[01:12:01.300 --> 01:12:02.820]   'cause that doesn't feel good."
[01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.500]   But the problem is that then they're incentivized
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.740]   to not have it be able to keep,
[01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:09.620]   the more context you give it, the more it can do.
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.860]   And that's the magic of what we're doing with Bolt
[01:12:11.860 --> 01:12:15.060]   is we're giving it all the context we possibly can.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.340]   And that's why you can go to it and say,
[01:12:17.340 --> 01:12:19.100]   "Make me an RSVP site."
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:21.060]   And it does it because it has context
[01:12:21.060 --> 01:12:24.380]   in the entire state of the application, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.780]   And that's what makes it so accurate
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:28.700]   versus if you go to copilot and say that it'll be,
[01:12:28.700 --> 01:12:30.580]   it might punch out a React component
[01:12:30.580 --> 01:12:32.460]   that's the button to create the thing,
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.060]   but not actually more than that.
[01:12:34.060 --> 01:12:36.460]   So anyway, so, you know, and at the time
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:38.420]   when people had bought the $9 plan,
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.620]   they were like, "I want to give you more money.
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:41.820]   I want you to buy more tokens.
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:42.660]   How do I do that?"
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:44.300]   And so our team scrambled that weekend.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:46.380]   We just turned it around and just, you know, we said,
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:47.940]   "Okay, well, what do we think is reasonable?"
[01:12:47.940 --> 01:12:49.780]   And we said, "Okay, so let's go."
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.140]   You immediately double the prices of the base tier
[01:12:52.140 --> 01:12:53.740]   because it's just not enough
[01:12:53.740 --> 01:12:55.860]   what people are getting on for nine bucks.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:12:57.100]   So that'll be, that seems reasonable.
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:12:58.420]   It's kind of in line with everyone else.
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.660]   And then we added 50, 100 and $200 plans
[01:13:00.660 --> 01:13:02.020]   'cause we're like, "That should be enough."
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:04.540]   And so, yeah, so that's kind of the origins of it.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:08.300]   And it was people that use it, fall in love with it,
[01:13:08.300 --> 01:13:09.780]   and they want to use more of it.
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:11.340]   And the problem is the inference is expensive.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.780]   And so we're not actually taking, you know,
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:14.180]   to date on the revenue we've done,
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:16.340]   we have not really taken a margin at all on this stuff
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.020]   'cause we're just trying to put all the value back
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.020]   into the folks that are using the tool
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.100]   and just getting the D maximum amount of value out of it.
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:24.580]   But it's really key to kind of the magic of the experience.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:26.140]   And so the other thing kind of worth mentioning
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.460]   is there's kind of the ARR number,
[01:13:27.460 --> 01:13:30.460]   but then you can also buy additional tokens, you know,
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:32.740]   just with usage-based billing effectively.
[01:13:32.740 --> 01:13:35.300]   And that's accounting for an additional 20, 30%
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:37.460]   of revenue that's coming to the company.
[01:13:37.460 --> 01:13:40.580]   People are actually using this to do their jobs.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:43.220]   Like, think about a web development agency
[01:13:43.220 --> 01:13:44.420]   before this thing.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.580]   They're going in using Figma to make a design.
[01:13:46.580 --> 01:13:47.620]   They have to pay the designer.
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:49.260]   They have to like punch that out into code, kind of,
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:50.700]   maybe like Copilot can help a little bit
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.940]   with punching out this thing, that.
[01:13:51.940 --> 01:13:53.100]   They're coming to this thing.
[01:13:53.100 --> 01:13:56.100]   There's just wild stories online where it's like,
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:58.700]   guy, a local bakery is like, "We need a website."
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:14:00.980]   He's like, "Okay, I'm going to charge you a thousand bucks."
[01:14:00.980 --> 01:14:02.620]   They're like, "Okay, that sounds great.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:03.700]   Reasonable price."
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.820]   30 minutes later, he's like,
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:06.660]   "Here's a deploy preview of your thing.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.500]   How does that look?"
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.260]   They're like, "Wow, holy crap."
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:10.820]   - I'm not giving you a thousand bucks.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:12.420]   (all laughing)
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:13.260]   - But they did.
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:15.060]   They were mind blown because they were like,
[01:14:15.060 --> 01:14:16.380]   "This usually takes months."
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.380]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - You know?
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:19.300]   So some of the biggest power users are people
[01:14:19.300 --> 01:14:20.780]   that build websites for a living
[01:14:20.780 --> 01:14:23.940]   because this is the alpha on this is insane.
[01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:25.420]   - That's almost like the gap, right?
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:28.460]   It's like, it used to be that if I ask you,
[01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:30.180]   before this, to do a website,
[01:14:30.180 --> 01:14:31.780]   and in 30 minutes you return to me
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:33.940]   and you give me something, I'm like,
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:35.660]   you know, you're probably just copying something else
[01:14:35.660 --> 01:14:37.140]   you've done before, you know?
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.180]   Versus now, it's almost like,
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:39.980]   it doesn't really matter how much time it takes you
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:42.220]   because everybody's going to be so fast with these things.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:43.500]   It's more like the value.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:44.740]   And that's why in your pricing, Tiara,
[01:14:44.740 --> 01:14:47.420]   was almost like, there's only really going to be like,
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:51.620]   either $20 a month users or like $1,000 a month users.
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.700]   You know, it's almost like,
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:54.940]   who's going to use the $50 a month?
[01:14:54.940 --> 01:14:56.180]   Because it's kind of like in between,
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.020]   between being infrequent user
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:14:59.980]   and being like a power user, you know?
[01:14:59.980 --> 01:15:02.180]   So yeah, it makes sense that you have like a big part
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:04.740]   of like on-demand on top of the tiers.
[01:15:04.740 --> 01:15:06.180]   - Yeah, and on the 50,
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.500]   there's actually a lot of people on the one.
[01:15:07.500 --> 01:15:09.300]   I think it's 'cause it's like enough to actually,
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:10.700]   like for developers that are using this
[01:15:10.700 --> 01:15:12.260]   to just kind of like punch out components
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:13.380]   or designs or whatever,
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:14.860]   kind of gets them enough for, you know,
[01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:16.620]   kind of in a given month or whatever.
[01:15:16.620 --> 01:15:18.900]   And so it's been interesting to just kind of see the,
[01:15:18.900 --> 01:15:21.140]   you know, the upgrades that happen.
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:23.420]   But what's been kind of cool about the product is it's,
[01:15:23.420 --> 01:15:25.380]   and again, I think this is kind of novel
[01:15:25.380 --> 01:15:26.500]   and this is, you know,
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:28.100]   us being maybe a little more transparent
[01:15:28.100 --> 01:15:29.260]   than we should be or something.
[01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:30.660]   But like, I suspect we're gonna,
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.340]   I think we're gonna see a lot more of this
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:34.420]   because we're hitting an inflection point.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:36.220]   Coming back to the co-pilot thing,
[01:15:36.220 --> 01:15:38.380]   part of the problem before is that it didn't matter
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:39.540]   if you provided more context,
[01:15:39.540 --> 01:15:40.500]   the models just weren't good enough
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:41.700]   to know what to even do with it.
[01:15:41.700 --> 01:15:42.900]   That's not the case now.
[01:15:42.900 --> 01:15:45.460]   You know, just one, you know,
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:47.340]   story of like one of the first people,
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.420]   one of the first power users that adopted Bolt
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.980]   was this gal in Thailand
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:53.020]   who's a PM at a software banking company.
[01:15:53.020 --> 01:15:55.580]   And she had an idea for this app called ViralHooks.ai,
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:57.660]   which is basically, it's a tool that
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.380]   if you wanna make viral TikToks and stuff,
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.460]   it's like, what's the hook of the video
[01:16:00.460 --> 01:16:01.380]   to make people watch, right?
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.260]   And so basically she, you know,
[01:16:03.260 --> 01:16:04.340]   you can go and like see,
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:07.260]   it goes and extracts hooks from other people's videos
[01:16:07.260 --> 01:16:10.460]   and helps you with like, you know, AI to write your own.
[01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:12.940]   And she had originally, the week before Bolt launched,
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:14.580]   she put that on Upwork.
[01:16:14.580 --> 01:16:17.740]   And, you know, some, I think a developer in like Ukraine
[01:16:17.740 --> 01:16:19.420]   had quoted her, you know, $5,000.
[01:16:19.420 --> 01:16:20.500]   And it's gonna take like three months
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:21.540]   or something like that.
[01:16:21.540 --> 01:16:22.620]   Reasonable timeframe, right?
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.180]   For an app like that, reasonable price.
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.140]   The week after that, Bolt came out,
[01:16:26.140 --> 01:16:27.820]   she bought the $50 plan
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.940]   and she had the app built within a week or two.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:30.780]   And so you're talking about like-
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.980]   - This is Bolt. - That's it.
[01:16:31.980 --> 01:16:33.300]   And it's beautiful.
[01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:34.940]   She did an incredible job, right?
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.940]   And so the numbers are wild.
[01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:42.940]   $5,000, three months to $50 in like a week.
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.220]   - Yeah, you gotta charge more, right?
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:47.260]   (all laughing)
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:49.220]   - But so it's kind of like, so, you know,
[01:16:49.220 --> 01:16:51.500]   there's people like when we've had a lot of people go,
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:52.580]   this pricing's insane.
[01:16:52.580 --> 01:16:55.260]   And we're like, well, we're not even taking really a margin
[01:16:55.260 --> 01:16:56.340]   at the moment on it, you know?
[01:16:56.340 --> 01:16:58.180]   But also, but when you compare that to the price
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.900]   of actually going and building,
[01:16:59.900 --> 01:17:01.620]   the cost of building quality software today,
[01:17:01.620 --> 01:17:03.980]   anyone who knows the price of building quality software,
[01:17:03.980 --> 01:17:05.700]   the alpha is obvious, right?
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.900]   It's a 99% cost production and 5X faster, you know,
[01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.780]   delivery time, you know?
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:14.140]   So anyway, so that's, I think we're one of the first products
[01:17:14.140 --> 01:17:17.500]   that have actually come out kind of proving that,
[01:17:17.500 --> 01:17:19.140]   you know, in a revenue way.
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:21.580]   To kind of underscore the point, as you can imagine,
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:23.740]   we've had, you know, kind of venture capital firms
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.940]   kind of reach out and kind of, you know,
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:27.180]   curious to kind of, you know, what we're up to or whatever.
[01:17:27.180 --> 01:17:28.860]   And so, you know, one of the most, you know,
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.300]   there's kind of, one of the most notable ones
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.180]   or whatever reached out, so we kind of sent them,
[01:17:34.180 --> 01:17:36.060]   you know, kind of our numbers.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.820]   Actually, it was the investor update, Sean,
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:40.340]   that I think, you know, the one you saw,
[01:17:40.340 --> 01:17:41.500]   kind of gave them a snapshot of it.
[01:17:41.500 --> 01:17:44.300]   And one of their analysts accidentally replied all
[01:17:44.300 --> 01:17:46.860]   on what we had sent them with the analysis.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:50.060]   And so on this part there, one of the things they said was,
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:52.660]   we haven't seen anything that's kind of eye-opening
[01:17:52.660 --> 01:17:56.100]   to see people going to $200 tier on this sort of thing.
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:58.020]   Haven't seen anything else like that in the space.
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:17:59.420]   'Cause I think this is very new
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:01.260]   because of the new model capabilities, right?
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:02.940]   Where people, you know, it makes sense.
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:05.100]   Like you're willing to pay more money for this stuff, so.
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.860]   - This is something I've talked about before
[01:18:06.860 --> 01:18:10.340]   in terms of matching the dollar amount of spend
[01:18:10.340 --> 01:18:12.300]   to the capabilities of the AIs.
[01:18:12.300 --> 01:18:14.900]   The chart that I published in the past was, you know,
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:17.860]   OpenAI has like five levels of AGI-ness
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:20.460]   and level one is sort of like a chat boss.
[01:18:20.460 --> 01:18:22.020]   Level two is reasoning.
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:23.140]   Level three is agents.
[01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.540]   Four is organizations.
[01:18:24.540 --> 01:18:27.220]   Five is something super, super human.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.900]   I don't remember what the exact levels are,
[01:18:28.900 --> 01:18:32.060]   but you can sort of each match each of them with like tiers.
[01:18:32.060 --> 01:18:34.380]   Like $20 is like the ChatGPT tier.
[01:18:34.380 --> 01:18:35.980]   $200 is where you're at.
[01:18:35.980 --> 01:18:39.580]   $2,000 is higher, 20,000, 200,000, right?
[01:18:39.580 --> 01:18:42.380]   You can see levels where it makes sense.
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:43.820]   I think BrightWave is also there, by the way.
[01:18:43.820 --> 01:18:45.220]   Like, I don't know what BrightWave charges,
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.940]   but it's higher, right, than a ChatGPT.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:51.180]   And like, you have to deliver more value for that,
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.020]   but you can do it now.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:53.860]   So then why not?
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:54.780]   I mean, everyone should do it.
[01:18:54.780 --> 01:18:56.140]   (laughing)
[01:18:56.140 --> 01:18:57.700]   - I think we're going to see a lot more of this.
[01:18:57.700 --> 01:18:58.540]   I think we're going to see,
[01:18:58.540 --> 01:19:01.740]   and I think, you know, for AI, Cogen specifically,
[01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:04.220]   this is the first moment where I think that
[01:19:04.220 --> 01:19:07.300]   there's been that moment where it goes from zero to one,
[01:19:07.300 --> 01:19:09.420]   where it's like, yep, the price point, you know,
[01:19:09.420 --> 01:19:12.020]   the value, the value is so,
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:13.340]   like of what you can get out of these things
[01:19:13.380 --> 01:19:16.220]   is so much higher than it was, you know,
[01:19:16.220 --> 01:19:19.700]   three, six months ago that I think we're going to see,
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:20.940]   I think we're going to see a lot more of this.
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:23.420]   Like we might, you know, Bolt is, I think,
[01:19:23.420 --> 01:19:27.460]   one of the first things, but yeah, I mean, it's just,
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:29.940]   to me, it's inevitable that we're going to see
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.620]   many more things kind of leveraging this sort of use case
[01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:35.180]   and the amount of efficiency you can get
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:36.700]   out of using these systems, right?
[01:19:36.700 --> 01:19:37.940]   So, yeah.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:39.620]   - Yeah, because, I mean, the Bolt arbitrage
[01:19:39.620 --> 01:19:42.060]   would be, quote, the price based on the query.
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:43.700]   - Yeah, you're selling high value tokens.
[01:19:43.700 --> 01:19:45.900]   - Yeah, it's like, hey, it's like your mom is like,
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.420]   you wouldn't charge your mom $2,000 to tell her stories,
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:50.740]   but like, you know, this person doing an app
[01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:54.380]   and like a product on it, you gotta pay more, you know?
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.580]   But it's hard right now.
[01:19:55.580 --> 01:19:58.100]   I understand it's like, it's really hard to figure out
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:19:59.580]   how much you can push it,
[01:19:59.580 --> 01:20:02.980]   how much value the person will get out of the thing.
[01:20:02.980 --> 01:20:05.500]   - So I want to riff a little bit on stuff like this, right?
[01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:07.420]   I think you nailed a lot with the design system.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:09.700]   You know, one of the differences between open source Bolt
[01:20:09.700 --> 01:20:11.900]   and the one that you have is actually like,
[01:20:11.900 --> 01:20:15.820]   you spend a lot of time on the design system, I think, right?
[01:20:15.820 --> 01:20:17.820]   Most things just look great when they come out,
[01:20:17.820 --> 01:20:19.700]   but then there's also a whole backend portion
[01:20:19.700 --> 01:20:20.540]   that they need.
[01:20:20.540 --> 01:20:21.420]   Was that a challenge?
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:23.180]   Is there anything that you sort of like figuring out
[01:20:23.180 --> 01:20:24.260]   that you want to riff on?
[01:20:24.260 --> 01:20:26.140]   - Yeah, so I think one of the main things,
[01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:27.420]   I think you hit the nail on the head,
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:28.460]   which is, you know,
[01:20:28.460 --> 01:20:30.380]   and kind of going into putting Bolt online,
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:32.340]   we originally, again, we've been selling to developers.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:34.220]   And so we were kind of like, this is a tool for prototyping
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:35.820]   and they'll download their code.
[01:20:35.820 --> 01:20:37.820]   But what we ended up finding in the early user testing
[01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:39.500]   was how important the deployment story was
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:42.380]   and how, and this is something you said to me specifically,
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:44.660]   you're like, backend, this needs to like,
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.780]   backend needs to be part of this,
[01:20:45.780 --> 01:20:47.620]   like logging in, like off.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:50.460]   Just to triple confirm, you're dead right.
[01:20:50.460 --> 01:20:54.220]   That has been the absolute number one thing
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:56.500]   that folks coming to Bolt, you know, are looking to do
[01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:58.420]   is build a real app with a backend, with billing.
[01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:00.660]   And so one of this guy, Mauricio,
[01:21:00.660 --> 01:21:02.060]   he's one of our power users.
[01:21:02.060 --> 01:21:04.740]   He's like, there's three things that like every app
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.980]   that I'll ever want to build in Bolt
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:08.060]   and any of these other people in this community,
[01:21:08.060 --> 01:21:11.940]   there's three things, a database, auth, and payments.
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:12.940]   Those three things, right?
[01:21:12.940 --> 01:21:14.500]   And so that's-
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.620]   - Admin dashboard.
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:18.220]   - We can do that pretty decently, pretty decently.
[01:21:18.220 --> 01:21:21.500]   - As in every database needs a WP admin.
[01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:22.380]   - Yes, yes, correct.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:23.500]   Totally, totally.
[01:21:23.500 --> 01:21:26.060]   And so, yeah, today I think like Viral Hooks, for example,
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:28.940]   I think she's using Firebase for auth and database
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.100]   and that sort of thing.
[01:21:30.100 --> 01:21:31.740]   You know, so I think Firebase and Superbase,
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:35.140]   those are the two things that just work incredibly well.
[01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:36.940]   And so that's actually the point where we're at now,
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:38.860]   where, you know, right now it's, you know,
[01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:41.100]   folks have to still, you know, kind of go to Superbase,
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:43.100]   manually spin up a thing, come back to Bolt,
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.500]   but the thing that, you know, it's like
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:46.820]   that sort of processing thing with Firebase.
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:47.900]   Each of those products are gonna have
[01:21:47.900 --> 01:21:48.740]   their own little quirks.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.580]   You have to, there's like kind of steps, right?
[01:21:50.580 --> 01:21:51.580]   And so-
[01:21:51.580 --> 01:21:52.420]   - Boltbase.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:55.420]   - Yeah, Boltbase, yeah.
[01:21:55.420 --> 01:21:58.020]   I think, yeah, I think initially we're like,
[01:21:58.020 --> 01:22:00.820]   okay, there should just be a way to like,
[01:22:00.820 --> 01:22:03.300]   for Bolt to just go and spin up these things
[01:22:03.300 --> 01:22:05.620]   on their behalf and just, you know,
[01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.580]   both of them have APIs to do so.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:11.100]   - I'll go even further, like have like pre-warm instances
[01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:14.060]   that you just assign, like it's already spun up, right?
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.420]   So it's like a kind of serverless feeling,
[01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.780]   even though it's like not really, but like, yeah,
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:20.460]   just pre-warm and then just kind of assign it
[01:22:20.460 --> 01:22:21.780]   whenever someone like spins up an app.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.620]   - That's a really great point.
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:25.540]   Yeah, just keep one Firebase in the hopper, basically.
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.540]   - One, 10, 100, I don't know.
[01:22:27.540 --> 01:22:29.780]   More generally, this is what I felt
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:31.700]   that I wanted to do on our call,
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:33.340]   which is like when you have PMF,
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:35.180]   yes, you want to invest some time in like
[01:22:35.180 --> 01:22:37.580]   understanding your customers and do a data analytics
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:39.220]   and like tighten things up in general,
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.620]   like tighten up the pricing,
[01:22:40.620 --> 01:22:42.460]   tighten up the cost and all that.
[01:22:42.460 --> 01:22:44.060]   But then like, you also have to work on like,
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:46.900]   what is next, like the next level in growth,
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:48.780]   like you can still inflect.
[01:22:48.780 --> 01:22:50.540]   I don't know what that is, but you know,
[01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.060]   I wanted to keep pushing you and I don't know if I did,
[01:22:54.060 --> 01:22:57.540]   mostly 'cause I was serving as facilitator on that call.
[01:22:57.540 --> 01:22:58.380]   That's what I think.
[01:22:58.380 --> 01:23:00.380]   Like, I think you got to still keep pushing the frontier
[01:23:00.380 --> 01:23:02.580]   and I don't know what it is, but like, you know,
[01:23:02.580 --> 01:23:05.060]   I want to hear what you got thinking about.
[01:23:05.060 --> 01:23:06.580]   - I think there's, you know,
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:09.300]   we've addressed just a lot of the low-hanging P0 stuff
[01:23:09.300 --> 01:23:11.940]   then and we've actually seen, we've kind of the,
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:14.300]   yeah, there's key moments where it's just kind of like
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.420]   been going like that, which has been cool.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:18.500]   'Cause it's like, okay, well, we're just getting started.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.620]   This is just the fixing obvious things part.
[01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.060]   Fundamentally, I think what a lot of people
[01:23:23.060 --> 01:23:24.340]   are coming here to do is just,
[01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:27.300]   how can we just make it faster to go from idea to production?
[01:23:27.300 --> 01:23:29.900]   And a lot of it is like when I have to go
[01:23:29.900 --> 01:23:31.740]   to Firebase Superbase, spin something up,
[01:23:31.740 --> 01:23:33.420]   run a migrate, you know, like add a table,
[01:23:33.420 --> 01:23:35.340]   it's like the agent can do that, you know?
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:36.780]   So that stuff should be baked in.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.580]   Yeah, and same thing with the deployment side.
[01:23:38.580 --> 01:23:39.900]   It's like, right now it's going to Netlify,
[01:23:39.900 --> 01:23:41.180]   but people have to create a Netlify account
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:43.020]   and go and do that, right?
[01:23:43.020 --> 01:23:44.740]   And so I think one of the things we're gonna end up doing
[01:23:44.740 --> 01:23:46.740]   here is just having the hosting be baked in.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:49.580]   And so I've been talking with Matt over at Netlify
[01:23:49.580 --> 01:23:51.180]   about this, 'cause they actually have a way to kind of-
[01:23:51.180 --> 01:23:52.020]   - Yeah, the white label stuff.
[01:23:52.020 --> 01:23:52.940]   - Yep, the white label stuff.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:55.380]   And so, 'cause people are just going to make a website,
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.940]   you know, and so it's-
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:57.940]   - I mean, that means also
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.860]   you take over domain registration.
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.940]   - Can you imagine, right?
[01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.660]   A couple of months from now, you come to this thing,
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.660]   you're like, "I want to make an RSVP site," right?
[01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.780]   And it's like, "Great, do you have a name for it?
[01:24:08.780 --> 01:24:09.980]   Do you want a domain?"
[01:24:09.980 --> 01:24:11.060]   You're like, "I don't know a name."
[01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:12.220]   It's like, "Well, here's like 10 options
[01:24:12.220 --> 01:24:13.420]   and the dot coms are available.
[01:24:13.420 --> 01:24:14.380]   Does any of them look good?
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:15.340]   Yep, that one does.
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.660]   Okay, do you want to buy it?
[01:24:16.660 --> 01:24:17.500]   Okay, great.
[01:24:17.500 --> 01:24:20.140]   It bought, the DNS is pointed at the thing.
[01:24:20.140 --> 01:24:21.180]   Should we start building this?
[01:24:21.180 --> 01:24:22.420]   Okay, does this look good?
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:23.540]   Yep, okay.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.100]   Am I okay to push this to prod?
[01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.300]   Yep, that looks good."
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:29.260]   You know, like that's without leaving the product, right?
[01:24:29.260 --> 01:24:31.580]   - So to me, like Itamar was the first to actually say like,
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:32.660]   "You are the new Wix."
[01:24:32.660 --> 01:24:34.780]   I never, I personally never thought about it that way.
[01:24:34.780 --> 01:24:36.580]   Wix is a $10 billion company.
[01:24:36.580 --> 01:24:37.860]   Where you want to go, you know?
[01:24:37.860 --> 01:24:39.300]   'Cause you still have a choice here.
[01:24:39.300 --> 01:24:41.660]   - From what we're hearing from the folks using the product,
[01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.780]   I think, I don't even think Wix is even able
[01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.300]   to solve their need, you know?
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.140]   - Yeah.
[01:24:47.140 --> 01:24:48.700]   - But not to say that we don't want to, you know,
[01:24:48.700 --> 01:24:50.340]   that that, what you're saying is now what we want,
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:51.580]   but I mean, yeah, like,
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:53.220]   I think we want to solve folks' problems.
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.540]   And I think that there's a huge gap in the market
[01:24:55.540 --> 01:24:56.900]   of being able to build, you know,
[01:24:56.900 --> 01:25:00.420]   kind of more sophisticated, high quality software,
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:02.580]   like websites in a way that,
[01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:04.340]   for someone who's a non-engineer.
[01:25:04.340 --> 01:25:05.900]   And so I think there's a huge market for that.
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:07.020]   And obviously, even if you're trying to build
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:10.780]   a wedding website, yeah, this is easier and faster, right?
[01:25:10.780 --> 01:25:12.180]   So I love it.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.780]   You know, again, coming to the origins of why Albert,
[01:25:14.780 --> 01:25:16.500]   my co-founder and I are doing this is,
[01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:18.500]   we've always just loved building stuff on the web.
[01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:20.180]   It's like this, this is the tool,
[01:25:20.180 --> 01:25:22.860]   from what, even when Stack was just the IDE interface
[01:25:22.860 --> 01:25:23.860]   to the technology.
[01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:25.620]   It's like, this is the thing we wish we had
[01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.060]   when we were 13 years old, you know?
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:28.380]   And with Bolt, oh my God,
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:30.620]   if this is the thing I wish we had when we were 13 years old,
[01:25:30.620 --> 01:25:32.660]   I'm so glad that my daughter's gonna have this thing,
[01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:33.500]   you know?
[01:25:33.500 --> 01:25:36.300]   So anyways, yeah, I think it makes me pretty, pretty stoked
[01:25:36.300 --> 01:25:38.700]   that people are gonna be able to actually build
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:41.300]   amazing web applications
[01:25:41.300 --> 01:25:43.900]   that can do really sophisticated things, you know?
[01:25:43.900 --> 01:25:45.860]   So yes, I think the short answer is heck yeah.
[01:25:45.860 --> 01:25:47.700]   I mean, if that's sort of market,
[01:25:47.700 --> 01:25:49.180]   totally right up our alley.
[01:25:49.180 --> 01:25:51.020]   - One other angle that I wanted to pursue
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:53.460]   was also the other languages.
[01:25:53.460 --> 01:25:55.020]   You know, you're very JavaScript centric.
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.260]   We've talked about Python forever,
[01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:58.540]   Ruby maybe, is that important?
[01:25:58.540 --> 01:26:01.620]   You know, like the previous generation of site builders
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.860]   were mostly Ruby shops and then some PHP.
[01:26:04.860 --> 01:26:06.380]   Do we want to capture that?
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:08.380]   Or are we just like, you know, always been on JavaScript
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:10.500]   and just let JavaScript take over the world?
[01:26:10.500 --> 01:26:13.740]   - You know, I think we're certainly with great interest,
[01:26:13.740 --> 01:26:14.980]   interested in other languages.
[01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:17.420]   And we have like minimal support of Python
[01:26:17.420 --> 01:26:19.700]   and some C++ stuff in web container
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:21.220]   that you can like run or whatever.
[01:26:21.220 --> 01:26:23.180]   I think especially with the stuff we're seeing though,
[01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:27.300]   it's the language is kind of ancillary to the thing.
[01:26:27.300 --> 01:26:29.140]   - Well, there's the ecosystem of like,
[01:26:29.140 --> 01:26:30.620]   I want to end up with a code base
[01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.180]   that I can hire humans on
[01:26:32.180 --> 01:26:33.900]   to do the stuff that Bolt cannot do.
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:34.740]   - Yeah, true.
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:35.580]   And I think in that sense,
[01:26:35.580 --> 01:26:37.980]   like the JavaScript Node.js ecosystem
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:39.780]   is huge and well-established.
[01:26:39.780 --> 01:26:41.620]   So I think you'll certainly be able to get people
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.460]   to work on this stuff.
[01:26:42.460 --> 01:26:43.580]   And I think the only thing that would be missing
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.460]   is it's like, are you building web apps
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:47.580]   where a lot of the functionality
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:50.700]   is only in libraries that are in Python or something, right?
[01:26:50.700 --> 01:26:52.860]   And I think just kind of seeing the applications
[01:26:52.860 --> 01:26:54.540]   that are being built here,
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:55.820]   I think that'd be like data science
[01:26:55.820 --> 01:26:57.260]   and like ML and that sort of thing.
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.180]   And so that's, we're not seeing a lot of that stuff.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.780]   And then, but I think that's like worth like
[01:27:01.780 --> 01:27:02.900]   kind of a more generic approach
[01:27:02.900 --> 01:27:03.860]   is like what Repl.it's doing,
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:05.700]   where they're spinning up real VMs.
[01:27:05.700 --> 01:27:07.260]   You can kind of run anything.
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:09.180]   And I think they started off with like doing Python service.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:12.220]   Actually, I haven't tried their new agent stuff
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:13.300]   that's based on--
[01:27:13.300 --> 01:27:14.540]   - Repl.it agent, yeah.
[01:27:14.540 --> 01:27:15.820]   We're close friends.
[01:27:15.820 --> 01:27:20.300]   Repl.it has the database, the sort of live hosting,
[01:27:20.300 --> 01:27:23.460]   everything integrated that you're going to want to build.
[01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:25.620]   And I think you're on a collision course with them,
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:26.660]   to be honest.
[01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:27.500]   - We'll see.
[01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:28.340]   'Cause I'm curious,
[01:27:28.340 --> 01:27:31.300]   and you're not the first person to say that.
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.060]   I'm curious to see how it shakes out.
[01:27:33.060 --> 01:27:36.820]   'Cause I think the challenge is focus.
[01:27:36.820 --> 01:27:38.980]   You know, when you are,
[01:27:38.980 --> 01:27:40.620]   what's kind of the end goal that you're shooting?
[01:27:40.620 --> 01:27:42.500]   - Yeah, Repl.it's firmly for developers.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.380]   You're positioning it for non-developers.
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:45.380]   Like that's--
[01:27:45.380 --> 01:27:46.980]   - Yeah, and even getting,
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:50.100]   even if focusing on a language or an ecosystem as well,
[01:27:50.100 --> 01:27:52.020]   'cause again, the problem is that these things
[01:27:52.020 --> 01:27:53.500]   can just break in a million ways.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:54.700]   And so part of the,
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.300]   a lot of the work in making the experience better,
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.140]   like how do you get,
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:27:58.980]   like how to make it,
[01:27:58.980 --> 01:28:00.660]   someone get an idea into their fingertips
[01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:02.660]   and live on prod, right?
[01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:04.100]   There's so much stuff in between there,
[01:28:04.100 --> 01:28:05.820]   and a lot of it is just errors that happen,
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:07.340]   and how do you handle those?
[01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:09.260]   And a lot of that comes down to
[01:28:09.260 --> 01:28:12.820]   having a giant database of common errors
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:15.540]   that you can maybe even fine tune stuff on
[01:28:15.540 --> 01:28:16.700]   at some point, right?
[01:28:16.700 --> 01:28:19.340]   So doing that on one ecosystem,
[01:28:19.340 --> 01:28:20.380]   you can move a lot faster
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:21.220]   than if you're trying to support
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:22.660]   a lot of different languages.
[01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:24.420]   However, it's to the point of,
[01:28:24.420 --> 01:28:25.780]   if you're kind of targeting developers,
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:28.180]   they may not need that level of kind of streamline,
[01:28:28.180 --> 01:28:29.380]   you know, thing.
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.260]   I think that's kind of where I see the main divergence
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:35.140]   is that we are unabashedly focused on this ecosystem
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:36.380]   for building web apps.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:37.220]   - Got it.
[01:28:37.220 --> 01:28:38.620]   Yeah, you supported Vite forever.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:40.140]   - Yeah, and so I'm very curious to see
[01:28:40.140 --> 01:28:41.060]   just how it all shakes out.
[01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:42.980]   'Cause it's, I think what they're doing is actually,
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:45.580]   I mean, I'm very curious to see what Microsoft does.
[01:28:45.580 --> 01:28:48.700]   Because if anyone is good at giving out VMs,
[01:28:48.700 --> 01:28:51.500]   tying it to a coder, and putting AI in it,
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:52.900]   it sucks.
[01:28:52.900 --> 01:28:55.020]   He's got a cloud, he's got VS Code,
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:57.460]   they got code spaces, they're in open AI.
[01:28:57.460 --> 01:29:00.500]   Now they've got Anthropic in Copilot.
[01:29:00.500 --> 01:29:02.180]   I mean, I must imagine,
[01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:04.580]   I must imagine that they're cooking stuff over there.
[01:29:04.580 --> 01:29:05.700]   - We'll make sure to ask him.
[01:29:05.700 --> 01:29:06.820]   (laughing)
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:08.020]   Yeah, we have many friends from Microsoft
[01:29:08.020 --> 01:29:08.940]   listening to the pod.
[01:29:08.940 --> 01:29:10.660]   - So just to wrap, I don't know,
[01:29:10.660 --> 01:29:13.220]   is there anything else both related?
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:16.180]   I just have one personal question before we wrap the pod.
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.460]   - Maybe like just advice,
[01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:18.980]   now that you've been through this journey, right?
[01:29:18.980 --> 01:29:20.740]   Advice to your former self.
[01:29:20.740 --> 01:29:21.580]   - Okay.
[01:29:21.580 --> 01:29:24.060]   Yeah, at which point?
[01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:25.940]   - Yeah, advice to yourself.
[01:29:25.940 --> 01:29:28.260]   Thinking about, there are many founders out there
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:30.300]   with a business where they're like,
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:32.580]   they're working really hard at it, it's interesting,
[01:29:32.580 --> 01:29:34.740]   but it's not an AI business.
[01:29:34.740 --> 01:29:37.620]   And you kind of took the plunge to invest in this,
[01:29:37.620 --> 01:29:39.140]   and it worked out for you.
[01:29:39.140 --> 01:29:40.380]   Maybe a lot of people are like,
[01:29:40.380 --> 01:29:42.220]   okay, this guy got lucky.
[01:29:42.220 --> 01:29:44.100]   Obviously there's a little bit of luck in everything,
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:46.260]   but how do you improve your chances?
[01:29:46.260 --> 01:29:47.100]   Would you say go for it?
[01:29:47.100 --> 01:29:48.660]   Would you say everyone should go for it?
[01:29:48.660 --> 01:29:51.020]   How would you advise someone who was in your shoes
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:54.460]   and thinking about, maybe I should have a second product.
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:55.900]   Maybe I should take this experiment
[01:29:55.900 --> 01:29:56.780]   or maybe it doesn't work out.
[01:29:56.780 --> 01:29:59.300]   Like what's the calculus here?
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:01.060]   - Yeah, we were deeply skeptical going.
[01:30:01.060 --> 01:30:03.380]   I remember the conversation you and I had.
[01:30:03.380 --> 01:30:05.820]   You know, I was like this, I think there's something here.
[01:30:05.820 --> 01:30:07.020]   At that point we had built some amount,
[01:30:07.020 --> 01:30:09.500]   but I had waited a long time to give you the call.
[01:30:09.500 --> 01:30:10.580]   - I said, this is your moment.
[01:30:10.580 --> 01:30:11.420]   - Well, it was.
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:12.260]   - This is the fucking moment.
[01:30:12.260 --> 01:30:13.100]   - I remember specifically though,
[01:30:13.100 --> 01:30:15.580]   at the beginning of the conversation with Sean,
[01:30:15.580 --> 01:30:16.980]   he and I sat down at a coffee shop
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:20.740]   in SF and so I was kind of giving him the pitch of like,
[01:30:20.740 --> 01:30:21.700]   you know, I think we have,
[01:30:21.700 --> 01:30:24.460]   I think that I can't remember the exact framing I said,
[01:30:24.460 --> 01:30:26.700]   but it was obvious that Sean had heard
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.300]   a lot of people say this exact thing to him
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:29.740]   over the past year or two, which is like,
[01:30:29.740 --> 01:30:31.260]   hey man, we've got an AI play.
[01:30:31.260 --> 01:30:33.860]   Like this is our thing plus AI equals this.
[01:30:33.860 --> 01:30:34.700]   This could be crazy.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:36.540]   And Sean, you gave me this like skeptical look.
[01:30:36.540 --> 01:30:38.620]   And I was like, I really think so.
[01:30:38.620 --> 01:30:39.900]   Okay, here's why, right?
[01:30:39.900 --> 01:30:42.620]   And I think that's, it's actually,
[01:30:42.620 --> 01:30:46.380]   I think that is internally being skeptical
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:50.340]   of just kind of going and jumping on hype trains is good.
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:51.980]   'Cause it's like, I think you, you know,
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:53.180]   your focus and your time
[01:30:53.180 --> 01:30:54.700]   and what you're putting your weight into
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:57.020]   is the most important thing when you're a founder.
[01:30:57.020 --> 01:30:58.340]   I think for us, like we actually, again,
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:30:59.900]   like I had mentioned at the beginning of this, you know,
[01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.180]   we had tried Bolt and didn't see the results
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:03.300]   and that was like a two week sprint
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:04.460]   and we rolled it back, right?
[01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:07.100]   This isn't viable at this point.
[01:31:07.100 --> 01:31:10.780]   But then once we saw real tangible results
[01:31:10.780 --> 01:31:12.700]   of some of the new stuff, we're like, okay,
[01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:14.100]   that changes things.
[01:31:14.100 --> 01:31:16.060]   And I think a lot of it is, too,
[01:31:16.060 --> 01:31:17.940]   is going and finding that out for yourself
[01:31:17.940 --> 01:31:19.660]   and then going and talking to the smartest people you know
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:22.260]   with more domain knowledge on that stuff than you have
[01:31:22.260 --> 01:31:23.820]   and going, here's kind of what we found.
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.060]   Does this track?
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:28.300]   So when Sean and I met and he and I kind of,
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:29.940]   he saw it, we talked through it and he said,
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.100]   this is your moment.
[01:31:31.100 --> 01:31:32.340]   I specifically remember that.
[01:31:32.340 --> 01:31:34.380]   'Cause I walked away from that and I was like,
[01:31:34.380 --> 01:31:36.100]   holy shit, this is it.
[01:31:36.100 --> 01:31:39.100]   Like this, you know, like Sean's at the intersection
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:41.740]   of web and AI and as like, you know,
[01:31:41.740 --> 01:31:44.020]   has one of the best perspectives on this stuff
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:45.340]   of anyone I know.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:48.500]   That put a huge, you know, wind in our sails, honestly,
[01:31:48.500 --> 01:31:51.340]   of just like, okay, let's go and really,
[01:31:51.340 --> 01:31:53.860]   let's go and double down here because, you know,
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:55.700]   we had conviction before, but having someone
[01:31:55.700 --> 01:31:57.900]   who's in the space independently kind of verify
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:31:58.860]   meant a lot, you know?
[01:31:58.860 --> 01:31:59.700]   So.
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:01.660]   - It makes me uncomfortable, but thank you.
[01:32:01.660 --> 01:32:03.380]   - I mean it, I mean it, you know?
[01:32:03.380 --> 01:32:06.020]   And I waited, I waited until I was pretty darn sure
[01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:09.660]   it was not gonna be a waste of time to, you know?
[01:32:09.660 --> 01:32:11.300]   - Cool, well, that's all I have.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:12.780]   - Yeah, and then on the personal side,
[01:32:12.780 --> 01:32:16.220]   you had a baby in April, you ran an Ironman in October.
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:18.020]   Now it's November.
[01:32:18.020 --> 01:32:19.980]   - He did Ironman while launching bolt.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:22.340]   - Yeah, exactly. - I was trying to schedule
[01:32:22.340 --> 01:32:24.780]   the call for him and he goes like, nope, I'm running.
[01:32:24.780 --> 01:32:25.620]   - Sorry, I'm swimming.
[01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:27.780]   He's like, hey, I'm on the swimming session.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:29.620]   - And for those who don't know, actually, I did not know,
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:31.380]   I don't even know the distance of an Ironman.
[01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:32.820]   - Yeah. - 13 hours.
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:35.420]   Your time was 12, 12, 12, 12, 12, 15.
[01:32:35.420 --> 01:32:37.420]   - Yeah, 12, 12, 12, 15. - Okay, oh.
[01:32:37.420 --> 01:32:41.020]   - You're like, give me my minutes, give me my minutes.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:45.020]   - No, no, it completely depends on the course
[01:32:45.020 --> 01:32:47.660]   and just the person or whatever, right?
[01:32:47.660 --> 01:32:49.340]   But yeah, I mean, it's-
[01:32:49.340 --> 01:32:51.780]   - 2.4 KM open water swim. - That mile.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:53.660]   Yeah, 2.4 miles. - Open water swim.
[01:32:53.660 --> 01:32:56.700]   100 KM, 100 mile, 100 KM cycle.
[01:32:56.700 --> 01:33:00.020]   - I think it's 112 mile bike.
[01:33:00.020 --> 01:33:00.860]   - And then marathon.
[01:33:00.860 --> 01:33:03.300]   - Yeah, full 26.2 mile marathon, yeah.
[01:33:03.300 --> 01:33:04.140]   - Crazy. - It was-
[01:33:04.140 --> 01:33:05.300]   - Why?
[01:33:05.300 --> 01:33:06.140]   - Yeah.
[01:33:06.140 --> 01:33:08.900]   - And you were not like a super endurance athlete before,
[01:33:08.900 --> 01:33:10.380]   right, let's make this clear.
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:12.260]   - Yeah, kind of a wild thing.
[01:33:12.260 --> 01:33:16.180]   So back when we had our daughter in April,
[01:33:16.180 --> 01:33:19.260]   and at that time, the future of the company was,
[01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:21.500]   we were figuring out what are we going to do here?
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.300]   At that time, it was just prior to Bolt
[01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.700]   kind of getting kicked into the rebirth of it
[01:33:26.700 --> 01:33:28.100]   with the new models and stuff.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:30.180]   And so I knew that it was going to be,
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.780]   having a child is,
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:33.780]   if you talk to anyone that's done that,
[01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.700]   you don't have a lot of sleep.
[01:33:35.700 --> 01:33:39.460]   There's a lot of, to be a great parent is a ton of work.
[01:33:39.460 --> 01:33:40.860]   And then also being a startup CEO
[01:33:40.860 --> 01:33:43.260]   where there's a lot of uncertainty or whatever.
[01:33:43.260 --> 01:33:44.780]   The way I've always found like when I have to go
[01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:47.100]   and kind of knock it out of the park
[01:33:47.100 --> 01:33:50.780]   in all aspects of my life is go and,
[01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:53.180]   yeah, just to make it all aspects of my life.
[01:33:53.180 --> 01:33:55.420]   And so I was, I just won, yeah, I woke up one day,
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:57.540]   I was like, all right, I'm going to do an Ironman this year.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:00.420]   And I burned the ships, bought the,
[01:34:00.420 --> 01:34:03.740]   it costs a thousand bucks to do these, didn't know that.
[01:34:03.740 --> 01:34:06.780]   And just started, I never ran a marathon at that point.
[01:34:06.780 --> 01:34:09.740]   And so I think it was like 45 or 60 days after that,
[01:34:09.740 --> 01:34:10.700]   I ran a marathon.
[01:34:10.700 --> 01:34:13.140]   My brother-in-law, he's, that was even more insane.
[01:34:13.140 --> 01:34:14.580]   Two weeks before the marathon, I was like,
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:16.220]   hey, do you want to run a marathon in two weeks?
[01:34:16.220 --> 01:34:17.220]   He's like, sure.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.500]   And just did it with me.
[01:34:19.500 --> 01:34:22.220]   He did not an endurance athlete either, right?
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.940]   But anyway, so yeah, so I was training,
[01:34:24.940 --> 01:34:27.020]   ended up getting a coach who's,
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.420]   you just go, you're kind of online, he's up in Marin.
[01:34:29.420 --> 01:34:32.660]   Great guy, was on the US Olympic team for triathlons.
[01:34:32.660 --> 01:34:33.820]   And when I told him, okay,
[01:34:34.020 --> 01:34:36.820]   I'm doing Ironman California in three months,
[01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:37.660]   he was like,
[01:34:37.660 --> 01:34:41.340]   are you insane?
[01:34:41.340 --> 01:34:42.620]   You know, like, what are you, you know,
[01:34:42.620 --> 01:34:44.860]   you'd ask for my opinion, but like, I just want you to know,
[01:34:44.860 --> 01:34:46.460]   I don't think this is a good idea.
[01:34:46.460 --> 01:34:49.580]   I think, you know, like you shouldn't do this, et cetera.
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.780]   And I ended up doing it, you know,
[01:34:50.780 --> 01:34:51.780]   I ended up getting it done.
[01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:53.540]   And so he was like, okay, like that's pretty bad.
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:34:56.020]   - But what makes you ignore expert advice here?
[01:34:56.020 --> 01:34:59.460]   Like most sane people would be like, okay,
[01:34:59.460 --> 01:35:00.300]   I mean, you know what you're doing,
[01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.980]   like I'll maybe wait a year.
[01:35:01.980 --> 01:35:03.820]   - So I think, and this is kind of the,
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:05.860]   and being a founder, right, it's all about like,
[01:35:05.860 --> 01:35:07.540]   if you, like I mentioned earlier, it's like,
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:09.380]   when we talk to people that worked on browser engines,
[01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:11.780]   they're like, you can't build what you're talking about.
[01:35:11.780 --> 01:35:15.060]   I think the job of a founder is to solicit that advice.
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:16.620]   And what my coach actually said,
[01:35:16.620 --> 01:35:18.020]   he was right about certain things.
[01:35:18.020 --> 01:35:20.220]   There are certain areas where I was under indexed on.
[01:35:20.220 --> 01:35:21.540]   Like I was not, you know,
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.540]   spending nearly enough time on my bike, for example.
[01:35:23.540 --> 01:35:27.900]   Like after that, I was on my bike six hours a day
[01:35:27.900 --> 01:35:28.740]   on the weekends.
[01:35:28.740 --> 01:35:30.060]   That's a lot of time to spend in the saddle,
[01:35:30.060 --> 01:35:31.300]   just like, just kind of, you know,
[01:35:31.300 --> 01:35:32.140]   and that was like, you know,
[01:35:32.140 --> 01:35:33.540]   for a couple of months leading up to it.
[01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:35.860]   He was right on certain aspects of it.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:37.420]   And, but I kind of had to look internally and go, okay,
[01:35:37.420 --> 01:35:40.260]   like, what is he kind of missing about who I am
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:43.140]   and like what I kind of know I'm capable of at this point.
[01:35:43.140 --> 01:35:44.060]   I mean, it was a nail biter.
[01:35:44.060 --> 01:35:45.860]   I mean, going into the thing, you know, it's, you get,
[01:35:45.860 --> 01:35:47.260]   and this is the same thing with launching Bolt.
[01:35:47.260 --> 01:35:50.980]   It's like, or launching anything, launch day, race day,
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:53.820]   you kind of go in, you're like, all right, here we go.
[01:35:53.820 --> 01:35:55.060]   Like, we're going to find out,
[01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:56.140]   we're going to find out, you know,
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:35:59.140]   how based in reality I was about all the decisions
[01:35:59.140 --> 01:36:00.180]   that led to this moment.
[01:36:00.180 --> 01:36:01.860]   And so he was going and doing the Ironman
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:02.700]   in like six months.
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:05.060]   Most people spend, you know, the folks he trains,
[01:36:05.060 --> 01:36:07.900]   usually it's, you know, one to two years on this stuff
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:09.620]   before you do try and do a full.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:10.860]   You know, it's like going and kind of doing it
[01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:11.820]   in that sort of timeframe.
[01:36:11.820 --> 01:36:15.180]   It's very similar to the same sort of skill set
[01:36:15.180 --> 01:36:17.020]   of going and building products.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.780]   You have to really kind of look at the base reality
[01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:22.220]   and go make your own assessment on it, right?
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:23.180]   So.
[01:36:23.180 --> 01:36:24.020]   - Cool.
[01:36:24.020 --> 01:36:25.100]   - Great story to wrap.
[01:36:25.100 --> 01:36:26.180]   Thank you so much, Harry.
[01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:27.100]   - Thanks. - Thanks for your time.
[01:36:27.100 --> 01:36:27.940]   - Heck yeah.
[01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:31.180]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:31.180 --> 01:36:33.780]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:36.380]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:36.500 --> 01:36:39.100]   (upbeat music)
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:49.100]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
