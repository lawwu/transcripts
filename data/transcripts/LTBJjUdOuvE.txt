[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.860]   Well, this morning we come to Ephesians 5 and the subject of marriage.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.820]   This is going to be a very politically incorrect experience for all of you.
[00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.480]   Some of you need a seat belt because at some point you're going to feel like you need to
[00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.620]   get out of here and avoid any more of this offense.
[00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:34.540]   But it's critical that we continue to move through the book of Ephesians and understand
[00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:41.300]   exactly what our Lord is conveying to us with regard to living the Christian life.
[00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:51.980]   So let me begin reading this portion of Scripture at verse 18, Ephesians 5:18, and I'll read
[00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.540]   down to the end of the chapter: "And do not get drunk with wine, for that is dissipation
[00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.060]   but be filled with the Spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual
[00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:10.300]   songs, singing and making melody with your heart to the Lord, always giving thanks for
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:18.020]   all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even the Father, and be subject to
[00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.260]   one another in the fear of Christ.
[00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.960]   Wives, be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord, for the husband is the head of
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.460]   the wife.
[00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.820]   As Christ also is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.
[00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:41.560]   But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.900]   in everything.
[00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.620]   Husbands love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.900]   for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with
[00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.380]   the Word, that He might present to Himself the church in all her glory.
[00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.340]   Having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she would be holy and blameless.
[00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.800]   So husbands ought to also love their own wives as their own bodies.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.360]   He who loves his own wife loves himself.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.860]   For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ also does
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.160]   the church, because we are members of His body.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.300]   For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother, and shall be joined to his wife,
[00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.200]   and the two shall become one flesh.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.240]   This mystery is great, but I am speaking with reference to Christ and the church.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:43.760]   Nevertheless, each individual among you also is to love his own wife even as himself, and
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.300]   the wife must see to it that she respects her husband."
[00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:57.260]   Now, I understand in the culture in which we live the outright offense of a portion
[00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.220]   of Scripture like this.
[00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.560]   And there are many others that I will take you to this morning before we are finished.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.920]   We are living in a culture that is making a complete effort to destroy men, to destroy
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.320]   women, to destroy children, to destroy families, to destroy marriage.
[00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.700]   This is an all-out, massive assault.
[00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.140]   An illustration of this happened just very recently.
[00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.020]   At the University of Wisconsin, where Matt Walsh, who produced a documentary called What
[00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.020]   is a Woman?
[00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:42.460]   A pretty easy question to answer, but amazingly one that engendered tremendous hostility.
[00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:51.200]   He went to the University of Wisconsin to speak to the students and to show the documentary.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.300]   The protests against him were significant.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.060]   Students came out defacing monuments, defacing buildings.
[00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:05.140]   "Chanting obscenities, illogical rhymes," says one writer, "and harassing all those
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.840]   who expressed Christian values."
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:15.080]   Some of the protestors began to harass a young man who had a Bible there.
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.800]   They stole his Bible, and they began tearing the pages out of his Bible.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.980]   At least, the journalist says, "At least one rotund protestor."
[00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:33.680]   "The woman was so enticed by the pages of Scripture that she chose to use them as a
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.360]   mid-afternoon snack."
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:45.860]   This unnamed female stuffed the pages of Scripture into her mouth as part of her protest.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.960]   The mangled Bible, in my mind, is metaphoric for just how this culture feels about the
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   Word of God.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.900]   It might not stoop to such overt blasphemy against the Word of God.
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:04.300]   It's the Scripture, but it is the common approach of this society to reject what the Bible has
[00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.980]   to say.
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:11.200]   The young man who had the Bible had some interesting things to say.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:19.360]   First of all, he said it was a legacy standard Bible.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.900]   And he said, "I use it every day at church, at Bible study, to preach."
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:27.820]   He said, "I brought it to this event.
[00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.160]   I brought it to this event so that I could guide sinners who love their sin and hate
[00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:34.220]   God to abandon their sin and turn to Jesus instead."
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:43.640]   Well, he and anybody who agreed with him were basically labeled sexist, racist, anti-gay,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.940]   Christian fascists and told to go away.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:57.020]   This kind of animosity toward the Scripture is a virulent element in this culture.
[00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.740]   They want nothing to do with the Bible.
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.480]   They want nothing to do with the Word of God, or they wouldn't be advocating the things
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:03.220]   that they advocate.
[00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:07.040]   I've never seen anything even close to this.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.920]   I can think back 25, 30 years ago when I was preaching on marriage, and even then it was
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:17.620]   controversial because the world was taking steps to undermine everything God says about
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.560]   men, women, children, family, and marriage.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.740]   But now it is far, far beyond that.
[00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.660]   So this is going to sound like it came from an angel.
[00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:30.060]   It came from an alien universe.
[00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.600]   And in fact, it did.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.720]   It comes from heaven to us.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:41.080]   And I want to set the text in its context, so I want you to understand that we begin
[00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.480]   in our study of Ephesians in the first three chapters, and we've done all of that.
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.100]   I just want to remind you that laid out the gospel.
[00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:54.180]   Chapters 1, 2, and 3 essentially laid out elements of the gospel.
[00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.580]   And then if you'll go back to chapter 4.
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:03.920]   Chapter 4, you come to a therefore, which is the transition from the doctrinal section
[00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:12.360]   of this epistle to the practical, based upon all of these marvelous doctrines that are
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.300]   celebrated in a doxology at the end of chapter 3.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:22.220]   "Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all we can ask or think, according
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.500]   to the power that works within us, to Him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus
[00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.000]   to all generations forever and ever.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   Amen."
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.400]   That doxology is the capstone to the doctrinal section of Ephesians.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.160]   And then we move into the practical therefore, and we come face to face with based upon our
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:50.680]   identity in Christ, based upon regeneration, based upon our new life, we live differently.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:53.960]   When you come to Christ, you're not adding religion to your life.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.420]   Your life is being totally transformed.
[00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:04.860]   The language that is used in the Bible to describe it is new birth, regeneration.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:07.580]   You become a new creation.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.100]   Old things pass away; everything is new.
[00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:17.700]   So coming to Christ is not simply adding Christ to your life or adding religion to your life.
[00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:24.780]   It is the complete, radical, top-to-bottom, side-to-side transformation of your life.
[00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:27.340]   And all aspects of your life are transformed.
[00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.860]   All aspects of your life are changed.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:34.700]   And that's why chapter 4 begins by saying you need to walk in a manner worthy of the
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.340]   calling with which you have been called.
[00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:39.680]   You have been called out of darkness into light.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:42.020]   You have been called into the kingdom of God.
[00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.840]   You have been adopted as a child of God.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:53.620]   You belong eternally to the family of God, and it calls for a completely different life
[00:08:53.620 --> 00:08:57.260]   on every level, at every point.
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:08.240]   You walk with humility, verse 2, and gentleness and patience and showing tolerance for one
[00:09:08.240 --> 00:09:09.240]   another.
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.100]   You're marked by love.
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:16.060]   You're marked by our desire to preserve the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace.
[00:09:16.060 --> 00:09:21.080]   And this is all defining our new life, and it has to all be defined.
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:25.380]   Our attitudes are being talked about there, and our actions will be subsequently talked
[00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.380]   about.
[00:09:26.380 --> 00:09:27.180]   Because it affects absolutely everything.
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:30.600]   We are different.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:38.640]   If you go down to verse 17 of chapter 4, Paul says, "You no longer walk as the Gentiles
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:40.560]   or the pagans walk.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:41.880]   You don't live that way.
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:44.840]   You don't do that anymore."
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:48.560]   That life was marked by futility of mind, verse 17.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:54.040]   Verse 18, "darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:57.100]   ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart."
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:10:02.040]   Verse 19, "They, having become callous, have given themselves over to sensuality for the
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.520]   practice of every kind of impurity with greediness."
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:14.480]   So you, on the one hand, are marked by humility, gentleness, patience, tolerance, love, unity,
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:17.160]   peace, etc.
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:23.520]   And you used to be marked by futility of mind, darkened understanding, exclusion from the
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.020]   life of God, ignorance, hardness of heart, callousness.
[00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:30.740]   Sensuality, impurity, and greediness.
[00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:32.320]   Verse 20 marks the distinction.
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.260]   You did not learn Christ in this way.
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:42.220]   If you have been taught by Christ and received the truth, verse 21 says, "You have left behind
[00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.720]   your old manner of life," verse 22.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.380]   You laid aside the old self.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:51.340]   Verse 23, "You've been renewed in the spirit of your mind.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:52.640]   You put on the new self.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.940]   You are a different person, completely red."
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:00.200]   You've radically changed.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:03.880]   And the elements of that difference are marked.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.680]   For one, the sum of it all would be chapter 5, verse 1: "Be imitators of God as beloved
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.180]   children."
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.220]   So now, instead of imitating your father the devil, you imitate God.
[00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:21.700]   Nothing could be a more dramatic exchange.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:26.780]   As imitators of God, as His beloved children, you walk in love.
[00:11:26.780 --> 00:11:29.460]   You walk in love.
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:37.360]   Your life is completely different: immorality, impurity, greed, never to be named among you
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.020]   as is proper among saints.
[00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.020]   "No, filthy talk."
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:46.400]   And he goes on and on with this, because verse 8 says, "You were formerly darkness.
[00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:48.600]   Now you're light in the Lord.
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:53.440]   Walk as children of light."
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:56.700]   And children of light, verse 11, "Don't participate in the unfruitfulness of God."
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:58.320]   They're unfruitful deeds of darkness.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.440]   They expose them.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:07.400]   And then you come down to verse 15 of chapter 5, and he says, "Walk not as unwise, but as
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:09.600]   wise."
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.060]   So everything changes.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:14.660]   We are different.
[00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:17.960]   And the impetus for this is our regeneration.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:24.000]   But the present, ever-present power to live this life is found in verse 18: "Be filled
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.620]   with the Spirit."
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:27.620]   "Be filled with the Spirit."
[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.460]   Let the Spirit of God control your life.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:33.140]   Spirit lives within you as a believer.
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:42.420]   He will control your life down the path of righteousness and godliness and virtue.
[00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:45.520]   And there will be some immediate effects of this.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.660]   The first is personal.
[00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:49.740]   We saw that, didn't we, in verse 19?
[00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:56.480]   You become a joyful worshiper when your life has been completely transformed through salvation.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:03.040]   You become a joyful worshiper speaking in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.800]   and making melody with your heart to the Lord.
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:09.000]   Secondly, you become thankful.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:15.420]   Your life, instead of being cynical and instead of being dissatisfied, you become thankful
[00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:21.160]   to the degree that you give thanks for everything in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to God,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.160]   even the Father.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.400]   Those two are personal effects of a Spirit-filled life.
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:35.400]   You are joyfully a worshiper, full of gratitude to God for everything He has provided for
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:36.920]   you in Christ.
[00:13:36.920 --> 00:13:40.580]   And then verse 21 moves to relationships.
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:46.620]   Verses 19 and 20 are about your personal life, your personal attitudes.
[00:13:46.620 --> 00:13:54.660]   Verse 21: "This is the summation of your relationships to others, and be subject to one another in
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.320]   the fear of Christ."
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:04.540]   That is the foundational expectation of the believer's life if he is genuinely converted
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:06.980]   and transformed.
[00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:11.500]   You're going to subject yourselves to each other in the fear of Christ.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:18.740]   And fear there has the idea of honor, worship, adoration, praise.
[00:14:18.740 --> 00:14:21.800]   What does it mean to submit to one another?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:26.240]   Well, look to Philippians, chapter 2, in that wonderfully familiar verse.
[00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:27.700]   It's a familiar portion of Scripture.
[00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:34.100]   Philippians 2, verse 3: "Do nothing" - and here's a description of what it means to subject
[00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:41.500]   yourselves to others - "do nothing from selfishness or empty conceit, but with humility of mind
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:47.300]   regard one another as more important than yourselves."
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.620]   That's the first thing he says.
[00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:55.440]   If you're going to subject yourselves to others, you're going to have to humble yourself, you're
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:56.160]   going to have to do something.
[00:14:56.160 --> 00:15:00.640]   You're going to have to distance yourself from selfishness and conceit, and you're going
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:04.280]   to have to regard others as more important than yourselves.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:10.560]   Verse 4: "Do not merely look out for your own personal interests, but also for the interests
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   of others."
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.440]   And then he gives an illustration of Christ.
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:21.660]   This kind of subjection to one another is the spirit described in Philippians 2.
[00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:23.220]   It's a humble spirit.
[00:15:23.220 --> 00:15:26.080]   It's a selfless spirit.
[00:15:26.080 --> 00:15:34.400]   It lacks the marked conceit of the unregenerate, and willingly considers others better than
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.560]   itself and serves others before it even serves itself.
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:44.800]   This is defining of all Christian relationships.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.400]   So when you think about how you relate to other believers, it's all summed up in "be
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.320]   subject to one another in the fear of Christ."
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:56.000]   For the sake of Christ, for the honor of Christ, for the name of Christ.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.540]   For the glory of Christ, we all submit.
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:04.960]   Now that is a spiritual command.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.620]   Spiritually speaking, we're not talking about roles and functions.
[00:16:08.620 --> 00:16:15.460]   We're talking about the essential nature of believers in their relationships.
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:17.440]   We submit to each other.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:19.300]   We subject ourselves to each other.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:23.460]   The wife, we'll find out, subjects herself to her husband.
[00:16:23.460 --> 00:16:25.920]   She recognizes his headship in the home.
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:34.860]   On the other hand, the husband subjects himself to the wife by recognizing her needs and self-sacrificing
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:37.660]   to make sure they are met.
[00:16:37.660 --> 00:16:44.480]   The children submit to the parents in obedient behavior, but the parents also submit to the
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:54.220]   children by not provoking them, not provoking them to anger, as chapter 6 will point out.
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.220]   The slave.
[00:16:55.220 --> 00:16:56.760]   Verse 22 and chapter 6.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:17:04.200]   Submits to the master in faithful service, but the master submits to the slave in kindness
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.040]   and fair treatment.
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:10.240]   So the idea of verse 21 is we all submit to each other.
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   We're all concerned more about others than we are ourselves.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:22.400]   This is the humble submissiveness that defines what it is to walk in a worthy manner.
[00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:25.140]   Now this does not obliterate the idea of the slave.
[00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:30.080]   The idea of authority and order by God's design.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.840]   That is function.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:39.320]   But in the essence of relationships, subjecting ourselves to all those around us is the spiritual
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   standard.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:43.680]   Still, as I said, there is authority and submission.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.060]   There has to be.
[00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:46.060]   We've seen it.
[00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:48.900]   "Wives, subject yourselves to your husbands.
[00:17:48.900 --> 00:17:50.180]   Children, obey your parents."
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:52.260]   Chapter 6, verse 1.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:55.060]   We see it, don't we, in the church.
[00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:59.820]   Where we are to submit ourselves to those who are over us in the Lord, the elders.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:02.160]   We're to follow their faith.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:06.320]   And we who are preachers and teachers are to teach with all authority.
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.860]   Titus 2:15 says, "And don't let anyone evade that."
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:18.840]   Don't let anyone think that they are not accountable for obeying biblical authority as brought to
[00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:22.280]   them by their shepherds and pastors.
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.980]   Peter points out in 1 Peter 5 that we don't lord it over.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:26.780]   We don't lord it over people.
[00:18:26.780 --> 00:18:34.460]   We don't do this to dominate people, but we serve them as loving shepherds.
[00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:39.260]   So there will be authority, and there will be submission in function.
[00:18:39.260 --> 00:18:40.600]   There has to be.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:47.800]   Children to their parents, wives to their husbands, congregations to the elders, citizens
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.520]   to the government, etc., for order in human society.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.900]   But we're going to talk.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:57.980]   Paul, right where Paul begins with the wives.
[00:18:57.980 --> 00:19:03.920]   So ladies, this is your Sunday, and I won't get to your husbands, so make sure he shows
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:11.460]   up next week because he needs equal attention on this subject.
[00:19:11.460 --> 00:19:18.180]   The duty of the wives is described in verses 22 to 24: "Wives, be subject to your own husbands
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:22.140]   as to the Lord, for the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ also is the head of
[00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.820]   the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.
[00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:29.820]   But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands
[00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:30.820]   in everything."
[00:19:30.820 --> 00:19:33.660]   There's nothing vague about that, nothing hard to understand.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:37.280]   You don't need to know Greek words to figure that out.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:39.240]   It's very clear.
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:45.600]   So I want to talk about the duty of the wife, and let's begin with the matter of submission,
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.360]   the matter of submission.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.940]   Notice it doesn't say, "Wives, obey your husbands."
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.940]   That's for children.
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:54.740]   Chapter 6, verse 1.
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:58.220]   That's for slaves.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:20:02.920]   Chapter 6, verse 5, obedience.
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:09.380]   This is a softer word: "Be subject to your own husbands."
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:15.880]   And to soften it even further, "Subject to your own husbands."
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.740]   There's a sense in which you own your husband.
[00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:24.660]   He belongs to you, which then…
[00:20:24.660 --> 00:20:31.960]   Obviously, connects the fact that it benefits you to treat your husband the way God wants
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:39.500]   you to treat your husband, because there will be divine blessing following that.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.720]   So this is more intimate than obedience.
[00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:51.380]   This is more personal, more tender, more inward, more vital, more loving, your own husband.
[00:20:51.380 --> 00:20:54.580]   This is not about inferiority in any sense.
[00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:58.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:20:58.060 --> 00:21:00.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:21:00.060 --> 00:21:02.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:06.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.

[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:16.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:18.060 --> 00:40:20.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:20.060 --> 00:40:22.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:22.060 --> 00:40:24.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:24.060 --> 00:40:26.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:26.060 --> 00:40:28.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:28.060 --> 00:40:30.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:34.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:36.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:38.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:40.060 --> 00:40:42.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:44.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:44.060 --> 00:40:46.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:48.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:52.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:54.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:56.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:58.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:40:58.060 --> 00:41:00.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:06.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:10.060 --> 00:41:12.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:14.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:14.060 --> 00:41:16.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:20.060 --> 00:41:22.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:24.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:26.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:30.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:32.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.

[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:44.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:46.060 --> 00:41:48.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:50.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:50.060 --> 00:41:52.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:54.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:42:00.060 --> 00:42:02.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:04.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:08.060]   This is about the fact that you're not subject to your own husbands.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:23.060]   The fallout of that is tragic. It's terribly tragic because you have children who don't have a sense of love and affection and security and protection.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:32.060]   And they are left to be the victims of whatever media corruption can take over their young minds.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:38.060]   But you're to be a worker at home. This is the only place this appears in Scripture.
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.060]   Workers at home. Do your work at home.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:42.060]   Workers at home. Do your work at home.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.060]   Oikos is the part of the word that means the house, the home.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:48.060]   A woman's place is the home.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:53.060]   And, you know, it doesn't limit you because like the woman in Proverbs 31, she had a lot of things going on.
[00:42:53.060 --> 00:42:57.060]   And like Dorcas, she had a lot of things going on in the book of Acts, chapter 9.
[00:42:57.060 --> 00:43:04.060]   And making garments for all kinds of people, so much so that they wept when she died because she had been so kind to them.
[00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:07.060]   And certainly in the world in which we live today, there are lots of ways that you can work at home.
[00:43:07.060 --> 00:43:08.060]   And certainly in the world in which we live today, there are lots of ways that you can work at home.
[00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:10.060]   And certainly in the world in which we live today, there are lots of ways that you can work at home.
[00:43:10.060 --> 00:43:14.060]   More and more, seemingly, since things like COVID have come in,
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:18.060]   you can do that, not to the detriment of your time with family,
[00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:28.060]   but whatever it is that you do, the home is to be the center of your world,
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:34.060]   where you love your husband and you love your children.
[00:43:34.060 --> 00:43:37.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:39.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:40.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:41.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:41.060 --> 00:43:42.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:42.060 --> 00:43:43.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:44.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:45.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:46.060]   This gets a different look if you turn just quickly to Philippians.
[00:43:46.060 --> 00:43:47.060]   This is about widows.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:48.060]   And it talks about widows here, but just to give you one perspective.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:51.560]   And it talks about widows here, but just to give you one perspective.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   There were widows in the church, and they needed to be cared for.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.560]   They needed to be honored.
[00:43:59.560 --> 00:44:02.200]   And in verse 3, 1 Timothy 5:3, "Honor widows."
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:06.980]   That word "honor" can mean support, money, finance.
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.740]   Widows are to be cared for.
[00:44:08.740 --> 00:44:11.160]   Widows shouldn't have to go into the workplace.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:13.400]   They should be cared for.
[00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:19.060]   If any widow has children, this is the first line of care, "children and grandchildren.
[00:44:19.060 --> 00:44:22.220]   You learn to practice piety in regard to your own family.
[00:44:22.220 --> 00:44:24.200]   Make some return to your parents.
[00:44:24.200 --> 00:44:25.200]   Take care of that widow.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:27.760]   This is acceptable in the sight of God."
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.560]   That's what children and grandchildren should do.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:29.560]   Take care of that widow.
[00:44:29.560 --> 00:44:30.560]   This is acceptable in the sight of God."
[00:44:30.560 --> 00:44:31.560]   This is acceptable in the sight of God."
[00:44:31.560 --> 00:44:36.180]   Just because a woman lost a husband doesn't mean she should be thrown into the workforce
[00:44:36.180 --> 00:44:38.760]   and taken out of the home.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:44.160]   And a woman who is a widow indeed, in verse 5, that means maybe there's nobody immediately
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:47.140]   around her in a family who can care for her.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.140]   What does she do?
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:54.380]   Well, she fixes her hope on God and continues in entreaties and prayers night and day.
[00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:58.380]   She turns to prayer for the needs to be met.
[00:44:58.380 --> 00:44:59.560]   And somebody steps up.
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.800]   Maybe it's extended family down in verse 8.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.700]   "If anyone doesn't provide for his own, especially for those of his household, he has denied
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.820]   the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:12.960]   So his own could mean the household, or it could mean somebody outside the household
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:13.960]   who knows you have need.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.820]   Again, there's nothing here that says the widow is on her own, throw her out there and
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.060]   hope she can make a living.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:24.760]   Everybody steps up to care for her.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:27.300]   And even the church is to do that.
[00:45:27.300 --> 00:45:28.300]   Verse 9.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:29.560]   "A widow is to be put on the list."
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:35.700]   The church has had a list of special widows who needed care.
[00:45:35.700 --> 00:45:41.140]   If they were over 60 years of age and had been - this is the virtue that basically qualified
[00:45:41.140 --> 00:45:44.280]   them to be given special care.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:52.380]   A one-man woman, that's what that is, a reputation for good works, brought up children, shown
[00:45:52.380 --> 00:45:58.320]   hospitality, that's in the home to strangers, washed the saints' feet, assisted those in
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.320]   distress.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:03.040]   Devoted herself to every good work.
[00:46:03.040 --> 00:46:11.100]   So at the end of life, when you come to the age of 60 or beyond, the Word of God says,
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.440]   "Now this is the time for the church to evaluate the care of this widow."
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:17.620]   Obviously, we take care of widows and orphans.
[00:46:17.620 --> 00:46:19.000]   James says that.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:25.660]   But there's a special list of concern and care for those who have faithfully fulfilled
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.080]   their God-designed duty.
[00:46:29.080 --> 00:46:33.700]   That's described there in verse 10.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:39.120]   So all the Scripture, whether you're looking at the front end of life from the beginning
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:44.660]   of the marriage or at the back end of life from the time of widowhood, conveys the same
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:47.340]   message, the same message.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:54.360]   God's design for women is to submit and to love their husbands and love their children
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:46:58.840]   and be workers at home.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:05.440]   Now with that in mind, let's go back to Ephesians, chapter 5, and we'll wrap it up.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:09.600]   So I've tried to show you from a number of passages the matter of submission.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:18.780]   Secondly, the manner of submission, verse 22: "As to the Lord, as to the Lord."
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:24.040]   It's a sense in which you would treat your husband as you would treat the Lord, because
[00:47:24.040 --> 00:47:28.600]   the Lord has designed this function.
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:29.840]   "As to the Lord."
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.240]   It's always the perspective in all submission, "As to the Lord."
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:39.600]   Back in verse 21: "Be subject to one another in the fear of Christ."
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:46.720]   Verse 25, when we get to husbands: "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church."
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:51.180]   Chapter 6, verse 1: "Children, obey your parents in the Lord."
[00:47:51.180 --> 00:47:56.360]   Chapter 6, verse 5: "Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters."
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:58.360]   And at the end of the verse it says: "As to Christ."
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.080]   "As to Christ."
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:05.680]   And masters, in verse 9, do the same thing, knowing that both their master and yours is
[00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.440]   in heaven, and there's no partiality with Him.
[00:48:09.440 --> 00:48:16.920]   Every duty in every relationship assumes that we're treating someone else as if they were
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:20.500]   Christ, as if they were Christ.
[00:48:20.500 --> 00:48:22.360]   This is holy living.
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:28.120]   This is why you submit, because Christ has asked us to do that, and in a sense, when
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.560]   you do that, you are honoring Him.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:34.820]   So the manner as to the Lord, the motive.
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:39.900]   What is the motive for women to be submissive?
[00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:44.080]   Verse 23: "The husband is the head of the wife."
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:45.080]   That's the motive.
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.260]   That's by God's design.
[00:48:46.260 --> 00:48:48.560]   You do it because it is right.
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:52.360]   It is what God has designed.
[00:48:52.360 --> 00:48:57.880]   And then he rounds out this part discussing the wives with the model.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:04.520]   The matter, the manner, the motive, and the model of submission.
[00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:06.120]   Who is the model?
[00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:13.680]   Christ, who is the head of the church, He Himself being the Savior of the body.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:19.420]   But as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands
