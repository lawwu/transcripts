[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.040]   - Man, I really love this question today.
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:07.880]   Here it is.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.720]   "Hello, Pastor John.
[00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.860]   "My name is Alex and I live in Alabama.
[00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:12.940]   "I was just thinking today about all the things
[00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.320]   "that run out.
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.940]   "Money runs out, food runs out, sex runs out,
[00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.820]   "cars run out, time runs out,
[00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.040]   "people run out of time and die.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.700]   "But God never runs out.
[00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.180]   "Can you elaborate on that subject for me?
[00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.080]   "It seems like a reminder not to rely on things
[00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.340]   "but on the eternal God.
[00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.960]   "Pastor John, what would you say to Alex?"
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.260]   - I am so eager for this question.
[00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.260]   I am so thankful that Alex simply threw open the door
[00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.340]   for me to talk about the inexhaustibility of God.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.640]   Couple of reasons why I'm so excited to talk about this.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.640]   One is that my introduction to Reformed theology,
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.840]   50 years ago, was not mainly through
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.260]   secondary theological sources,
[00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.740]   but through texts of the Bible
[00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.940]   that elevated the self-sufficiency,
[00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.140]   the inexhaustibility of God
[00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.540]   as high as it possibly could be elevated.
[00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.140]   In other words, what struck me
[00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.540]   is that the very godness of God
[00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.800]   was that he is absolutely free,
[00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.620]   absolutely self-sufficient.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:34.620]   He has no needs from outside himself,
[00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.620]   but he's completely and eternally sufficient in himself,
[00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.940]   and not just sufficient, but a Vesuvius of joy
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.820]   in the fellowship of the Trinity
[00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.820]   so that he has absolutely no need of me whatsoever,
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.340]   but he's so full that he is prone to overflow
[00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.840]   with a river of pleasures towards those
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.800]   who will have him as their supreme treasure.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.800]   That picture of God years ago from the Bible
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.300]   was ravishing to me.
[00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.260]   The second reason this is such a golden invitation to me
[00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.600]   is that just the day before yesterday,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.800]   I received an email from a friend
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   who has gone through years of very, very hard times,
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.800]   and he wanted to thank me,
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.080]   even though I was part of the hard times,
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.720]   for something from a message years ago,
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.880]   and the gist of it was,
[00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.280]   well, I'll just quote what he sent me, quote,
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   "Grace is the overflow of God's self-sufficiency,
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.080]   so you can't have grace if you don't have
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   an utterly, infinitely, gloriously, self-satisfied,
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.000]   all-sufficient, overflowing God
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   who does not need you at all," close quote.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.440]   That's the picture of God that he was sustained by.
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.180]   That's the meaning of grace that held him
[00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.760]   and kept him from making shipwreck of his faith.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.560]   Grace is the overflow of the self-sufficiency
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.440]   of a God who doesn't need him.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.520]   That's what grace is.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.280]   It's the overflow from an inexhaustible fountain,
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.000]   which means that the only way we can relate to God
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.240]   so that he's pleased and so that it glorifies him
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   is not by hauling buckets of human labor up the mountain
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.220]   and pouring our supply
[00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.040]   into the pure, inexhaustible mountain spring of God,
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.140]   but rather by falling on our face,
[00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.140]   exhausted and putting our faith and our face in the water,
[00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.820]   and coming up and saying, "Ah, that's so good.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.820]   Thank you, God, for the overflow that you are for me."
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.800]   Now I've eaten up half my time telling you
[00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.400]   why I'm so excited to talk about this question.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.280]   So let's consider in the time that remains
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.820]   just a few passages of scripture
[00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.720]   that celebrate the fullness of God
[00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.980]   to the point where he doesn't need us at all
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.420]   and where it would be an offense to him
[00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.020]   if we tried to become his benefactors.
[00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.540]   For example, Acts 17.25,
[00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.340]   God is not served by human hands
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.920]   as though he needed anything
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.960]   since he himself gives to all mankind
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.260]   life and breath and everything.
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.500]   And that's not just true of God the Father.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.780]   It's true of Christ as he comes into the world.
[00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.140]   Mark 10.45, the Son of Man
[00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.700]   came not to be served,
[00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.740]   but to serve and to give his life a ransom for many.
[00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.580]   We don't serve him, he serves us or we die.
[00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:20.780]   Romans 11.34, who has known the mind of the Lord
[00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.020]   or who has been his counselor?
[00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.980]   Nobody, you can't give God counsel.
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.780]   Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?
[00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.260]   Nobody, you can't loan God anything
[00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:34.840]   to put him in your debt.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.780]   Why?
[00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.440]   Next phrase, for from him and through him and to him
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.640]   are all things to him be glory forever, amen.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.460]   Or Psalm 50, verse nine,
[00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.260]   Spurgeon called this Robinson Crusoe's text
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.040]   because if you read that novel,
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.220]   you realize Crusoe used these verses to get himself through.
[00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:58.860]   Psalm 50, verses nine to 15.
[00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:02.080]   Every beast of the forest is mine, God says.
[00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.880]   The cattle on a thousand hills.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.940]   If I were hungry, I would not tell you.
[00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.820]   For the world and its fullness are mine.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:15.980]   Do I eat the flesh of bulls and drink the blood of goats?
[00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.820]   No, offer to God a sacrifice of thanksgiving
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.580]   and perform your vows to the most high.
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.660]   Call on me in the day of trouble
[00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.660]   and I will deliver you and you will glorify me.
[00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.680]   That's amazing.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.680]   So how do we glorify a God who has absolutely no needs
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:42.260]   and has all resources in himself?
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:47.260]   Answer, by not being his benefactors,
[00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:52.220]   but his supplicants, by calling on him for help,
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.680]   then we get deliverance, he gets the glory.
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:59.820]   Or as the Psalm says, I will deliver you
[00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.300]   and you will glorify me.
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:05.500]   You get the deliverance, I get the glory.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:08.280]   This is what stunned me years ago.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:13.280]   The bigger God gets, the more self-sufficient he becomes,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.940]   the less he needs me, then the more resourceful
[00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.280]   he can be for me and the more riches of glory
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.840]   he has to pour out freely on me
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:30.480]   and the more glorious he looks when we find our joy in him.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.320]   What a God.
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.760]   That's exactly the way God wants us to experience
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:39.200]   his absolute fullness and self-sufficiency.
[00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.800]   He wants us to experience it
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.520]   as the source of inexhaustible grace.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:49.640]   Listen to the way Isaiah 40, 28 makes the connection.
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.020]   The Lord is the everlasting God,
[00:07:52.020 --> 00:07:53.960]   the creator of the ends of the earth.
[00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:58.120]   He does not faint or grow weary.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.140]   His understanding is unsearchable.
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.680]   What's the consequence of all that self-sufficiency?
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.480]   He gives power to the faint
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:12.120]   and to him who has no might, he increases strength.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.760]   They shall mount up with wings like eagles.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.540]   They shall run and not be weary.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:18.840]   They shall walk and not faint.
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:22.560]   So the inexhaustible hand of God
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.760]   is good news for the exhausted.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.600]   I remember in those early days
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.680]   when I was first being amazed
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.560]   by this kind of self-sufficient,
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.720]   inexhaustible, overflowing God,
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:38.920]   that two of my passages were 2 Chronicles 16, 9,
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.640]   "The eyes of the Lord run to and fro
[00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.960]   throughout the whole earth to show himself strong
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.160]   on behalf of those whose heart is blameless toward him."
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.200]   In other words, he's on the lookout.
[00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.640]   He is actually on the lookout
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.520]   for anyone who is humble enough
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.560]   and weak enough to let him be strong for them.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:04.720]   And Isaiah 64, 4, "From of old no one has heard
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.620]   or perceived by the ear.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:10.160]   No eye has seen a God besides you
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   who works for those who wait for him."
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.680]   Can you believe that?
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.440]   In other words, God's uniqueness,
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:21.240]   nobody's seen a God like this.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.800]   God's uniqueness is that in his overflowing fullness,
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.960]   he delights to work for us
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:31.840]   rather than have us work for him.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.420]   The giver gets the glory.
[00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:37.280]   So not surprisingly,
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:40.160]   this kind of absolutely self-sufficient,
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.040]   inexhaustible, overflowing God
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:45.240]   is where the gospel comes from,
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:47.360]   the gospel of our salvation.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:51.840]   "For those who have absolutely no way to save themselves,"
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.400]   he says, "ho, everyone who thirsts,
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.160]   come to the waters.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:01.440]   He who has no money, come buy and eat.
[00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:06.440]   Come buy wine and milk without money and without price."
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.400]   Isaiah 55, 1.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:14.040]   It's like the machine shop that I jogged by for years
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:15.960]   until it closed recently.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.280]   It had a permanent help wanted sign
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:21.880]   nailed to the wall on the side of the building.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.520]   So every time I go by,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.120]   almost big permanent help wanted sign,
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:32.120]   but some days there was a big red diagonal line
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.000]   through the sign with a big no in the middle of it.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.440]   No help wanted.
[00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:41.800]   And I used to leap for joy while I was jogging saying,
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.440]   "That's my God."
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:44.260 --> 00:10:45.240]   "That's my gospel."
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:50.240]   No help wanted, no help needed, no help demanded.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.720]   I exist to be inexhaustible
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.120]   and to help those who will trust me.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.240]   That's my glory.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.860]   That's the glory of the gospel.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.160]   So, amen, Alex.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.840]   Everything else runs out like you said,
[00:11:06.840 --> 00:11:09.400]   but God never runs out.
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.040]   He will be giving and giving and giving to all eternity
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.040]   as we receive and receive and receive
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.640]   like little children with joy.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:20.080]   So important.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.120]   And if anything in this episode does not make sense,
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.360]   go back and listen to it over and over until you get it.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.720]   These are glorious and crucial truths here at DeGrasse.
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:29.660]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:30.720]   And thank you for joining us today.

[00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:46.840]   and Pastor John and I will be back on Monday, Lord willing.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:47.680]   Thanks for listening.

[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:51.080]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:53.660]   (upbeat music)
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:12:03.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
