[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.360]   - Welcome friends to this episode
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.040]   of the "Everyday Educator" podcast.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.840]   I'm your host, Lisa Bailey,
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.400]   and I'm excited to spend some time with you today
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.040]   as we encourage one another, learn together,
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.000]   and ponder the delights and challenges
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.400]   that make homeschooling the adventure of a lifetime.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.680]   Whether you're just considering
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.280]   this homeschooling possibility or deep into
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.180]   the daily delight of family learning,
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.460]   I believe you'll enjoy thinking along with us.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.320]   But don't forget, although this online community is awesome,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.320]   you'll find even closer support in a local CC community.
[00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.180]   So go to classicalconversations.com
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.940]   and find a community near you today.
[00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.980]   Well, listeners, I'm excited to say to you
[00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.980]   that it's almost time for community to start back.
[00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.540]   Actually, some of you who have challenged students
[00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.780]   may have begun community as early as this week.
[00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.980]   But those of us with foundations and essential students
[00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.220]   still at home enjoying the last long days of summer
[00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.820]   are looking ahead to what's coming.
[00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.020]   And all of us, I don't know,
[00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.460]   even though my kids are grown and gone
[00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.180]   and they're not waiting for me every morning
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.300]   at the school table looking at me expectantly,
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.740]   at this time of the year,
[00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.540]   my heart still turns toward the lessons of homeschooling.
[00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.540]   Now, not so much the lessons I'm getting ready to share
[00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.460]   as the lessons that I have learned.
[00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.700]   And I really believe that one of the biggest joys
[00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.680]   of my heart and my homeschooling journey
[00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.200]   has been sharing the lessons I've learned,
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.780]   oftentimes the hard way, with young moms and dads
[00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.580]   or people who are not as far along on the journey
[00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.060]   as I am now.
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.040]   And I've got one of my best CC buddies
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.580]   who's also maybe farther along on the journey than you are
[00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.760]   with me today for this podcast.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.860]   Kelly, I'm so happy to have you.
[00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.620]   - Oh, Lisa, I am so excited to talk to you
[00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.580]   about these things today,
[00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.500]   because when we first had the conversation
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.580]   about this podcast, I thought,
[00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.940]   wait, looking in the rear view mirror
[00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.980]   to see where I've come from,
[00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.780]   I didn't realize I was that far down the road.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.360]   But truly, we are, as a family,
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.800]   much closer to the end of our family's homeschool journey
[00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.160]   now than we were even just a couple of years ago.
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.880]   So I'm excited to talk about these things with you
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.840]   and with our listeners today, too.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.600]   - Yeah, I think it is really encouraging.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.000]   One of the things that I found most encouraging
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.880]   while we were homeschooling is knowing that I wasn't alone.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.920]   I wasn't alone in my joys,
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.720]   and that made the joys more joyous,
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.780]   and I wasn't alone in my struggles,
[00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.940]   and that made my struggles doable, livable.
[00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:24.600]   And so Kelly and I, Kelly Wilt is with me today.
[00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.680]   She's one of our curriculum developers with CCMM.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:35.800]   And we love to talk to and mentor younger moms and dads
[00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.640]   who are still on this journey.
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:41.880]   And so we really want to talk about lessons we've learned,
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.000]   lessons from the rear view mirror.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.680]   I was telling Kelly just a little bit ago
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.400]   that I feel like I could be a great homeschool mom
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.280]   for my grandchildren, way better.
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.320]   I could do a way better job with my little grandson,
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.000]   who's just two years old,
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.020]   than I probably did with my girls
[00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:04.080]   when they were two years old,
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.000]   because there was a lot of stuff I stressed over
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.120]   and a lot of stuff I had not learned myself.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.400]   The Lord was still molding me.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.680]   I mean, He still is, but He was seriously molding me
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.560]   when my girls were two and four years old.
[00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:21.880]   And so I'm excited to talk to you,
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.880]   and I'm excited to just be real, raw, and honest
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.040]   with our listeners about what's been going on.
[00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.500]   I know, Kelly, that your homeschool
[00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.060]   is not all the way in the rear view mirror yet,
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.740]   but 2/3 of your journey is in the rear view mirror.
[00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.180]   So let me ask you this.
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.940]   Do you feel like an experienced driver
[00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:50.020]   on the road of homeschooling?
[00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.560]   - At moments, yes, and at moments, no.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.500]   I love thinking about the rear view mirror,
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.220]   because now that we're close to the end,
[00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:03.540]   it's good to reflect.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:09.540]   But it's also good to think about the part that's left
[00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.860]   and how to redeem those last moments to finish well
[00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.140]   based on what you've experienced.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.340]   And you know, Lisa, I think the closer we get to the end,
[00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.340]   I, like you, think quite a bit about our earlier days
[00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.020]   when my children were young and what my thoughts were
[00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.300]   and what my hopes and my goals were for our family.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.500]   And I just am so incredibly thankful
[00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.900]   for the experience that we've had,
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.540]   because as you've already alluded to,
[00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.820]   it was a refining time, continues to be a refining time
[00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:51.400]   for me, not only as a homeschooler,
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.900]   but as a parent, as a Christian,
[00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.940]   as a friend in so many roles in my life
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:01.740]   that I, at the beginning, had no idea
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:05.820]   would be so greatly affected by our homeschool experience.
[00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.260]   - It is a great truth that when we start off
[00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:10.820]   on the homeschool journey,
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.660]   we are doing it to be a blessing to our children.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.660]   And we begin the journey thinking it is all about
[00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.760]   giving our children the best start in life
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.580]   and the right view of education
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:30.660]   and the closest relationship they can have
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.500]   with the Father God.
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.960]   And all of those things are true except for the all.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.460]   It's not all about that.
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.780]   What you said is really true.
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:43.440]   Homeschooling is incredibly refining
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.340]   if we allow it to be for the parents.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.460]   And I think lots of times I look back,
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.020]   and when I was a young mom,
[00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:57.460]   I thought I was the artist making something
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:01.040]   out of the clay that was my precious little girls.
[00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:07.140]   And now I realize I was a tool in the hands of the Lord
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.540]   who was the artist making something
[00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.900]   out of the clay of my dear little girls.
[00:07:13.900 --> 00:07:18.100]   And so I'm grateful that He used me
[00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.580]   to teach them and to love them
[00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:22.820]   and to make mistakes in front of them
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:24.900]   that hopefully they won't make.
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.420]   And a lot of mistakes that we learned from together.
[00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.740]   So we're gonna get to all of that.
[00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.460]   I want you, 'cause I feel like probably
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.980]   a lot of the moms and dads listening today
[00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:41.620]   are not as far along in the journey as we are.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.700]   They are quite likely younger than both me and you,
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:47.620]   and you're greatly younger than me.
[00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.860]   But I want you to look back
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.940]   and describe yourself as a young homeschool mom
[00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:57.220]   when you were just starting out, okay?
[00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.780]   I'm gonna give you parameters.
[00:07:58.780 --> 00:08:02.300]   I want three adjectives to describe you.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.540]   And I want you to also tell us what your goals were.
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:08.060]   - Okay, so let's see.
[00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.940]   In typical CC tradition, I will choose three adjectives
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.780]   that all begin with the letter C.
[00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.620]   - All right.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:16.540]   - So let's see.
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:19.540]   I think my first adjective would be creative.
[00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:20.820]   - Right. - I wanted to do
[00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:25.820]   all the things and just be able to inspire my children.
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.580]   - Yes. - To love learning.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:31.580]   Because in a former life before homeschooling,
[00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:34.780]   I was a public school kindergarten teacher.
[00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:38.540]   And so in my mind, I just had this extensive library
[00:08:38.540 --> 00:08:41.700]   of all the things that children should be doing,
[00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.820]   which it was a blessing and a curse.
[00:08:44.820 --> 00:08:47.620]   And we'll talk probably about that a little bit more later.
[00:08:47.620 --> 00:08:52.060]   But I think my second adjective would be committed.
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:56.860]   From the very beginning, I knew this was not going to be easy.
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:57.700]   I knew it wasn't.
[00:08:57.700 --> 00:09:01.100]   Now, did I have any idea the extent of difficulty?
[00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.980]   No, but I knew this was going to be a hard thing
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.220]   that we were choosing to do as a family.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:10.220]   I knew it would be difficult for us at that time
[00:09:10.220 --> 00:09:12.780]   to choose to be a one-income family
[00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:14.700]   for the benefit of our children
[00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:17.380]   so that I could be home with them
[00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:19.740]   and not in a classroom teaching other children
[00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:20.580]   at that moment,
[00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:24.140]   because that was what we felt called to do.
[00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.940]   So we were, I was creative, I was committed,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.820]   but Lisa, in all honesty, my last C adjective is clumsy.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:33.380]   (both laughing)
[00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.700]   - Yay, honestly, come on.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:38.380]   - Yes, you said you wanted the real, real, so here it is.
[00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.780]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.340]   - You know, I just did not really have a good idea
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:46.740]   of what homeschooling would look like.
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:50.220]   You know, I, at that point, you know,
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.300]   homeschoolers had a, you know, rap for being
[00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:56.540]   kind of weird. - Kind of weird, yes.
[00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:58.820]   My daughter used to describe it as,
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:01.860]   "Mm, they were painfully homeschooled."
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.020]   And I said, "That is really judgmental,
[00:10:04.020 --> 00:10:05.980]   "but I sort of understand what you mean."
[00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:07.260]   Yes. - Yes, yes.
[00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:08.260]   I was clumsy.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.500]   I didn't really know what to expect.
[00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:13.460]   I was trying to, in my mind,
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:17.940]   divorce what I knew of education in a classroom
[00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:22.460]   from what I was learning homeschooling to be in our home.
[00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:26.020]   And I didn't always do it well, Lisa, to be honest,
[00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:31.020]   but I learned a lot of lessons from thinking incorrectly,
[00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.140]   because the Lord used those mistakes
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.380]   to refine our family's vision
[00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:38.220]   for what we wanted homeschooling to be
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:41.140]   and what we also did not want it to be.
[00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:46.140]   So there was blessing, even in that time of clumsiness
[00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:50.220]   and stumbling a little bit to try to find
[00:10:50.220 --> 00:10:52.420]   what would be the right rhythm for our family.
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:54.880]   So those are my three, my three adjectives.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:59.740]   Creative, committed, but still clumsy.
[00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.580]   - Yes.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:04.220]   What were your goals when you and Ken started out?
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:06.420]   What were your goals?
[00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.340]   - Well, I'm not sure that all of our goals-
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.820]   - And say they might not be.
[00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.020]   Okay, that's the other thing.
[00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:14.140]   I was hoping that you would be really honest.
[00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.100]   The goals that I had when I first started out,
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.600]   I'm like sort of embarrassed to say them now,
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:25.020]   because the Lord refined me and I learned.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.180]   So I want to hear yours.
[00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:28.100]   So I'm not embarrassed by myself.
[00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.220]   - Oh, well, let us not be embarrassed together
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:33.060]   because my goals changed too.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:38.060]   I think, you know, initially my goals were very prideful.
[00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.740]   My children will all be members of MENSA
[00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:43.780]   because they will be so well-educated.
[00:11:43.780 --> 00:11:45.980]   They will know all the things.
[00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.100]   You know, my children will all be admitted to Harvard
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.580]   because they just will be so outstanding
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:55.740]   and they'll all read at two and a half years old
[00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.420]   and they'll do all the things.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.900]   And you know, Lisa, I think unfortunately at that time,
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.340]   the goal that should have been primary
[00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:08.420]   was secondary or tertiary.
[00:12:08.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   And that goal that became our later defining goal
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.500]   was we want to see our children walk rightly in this world,
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.660]   knowing they are a citizen of this world,
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:22.740]   but being prepared to be a citizen of the world
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:24.620]   that is to come.
[00:12:24.620 --> 00:12:29.320]   And I think that after those first clumsy steps,
[00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:33.700]   we started to realize that our mission field was in our home
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:37.060]   and that we needed to redeem this time
[00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:40.780]   that God had given to us to feed into our children,
[00:12:40.780 --> 00:12:45.780]   not only mentally, but spiritually and emotionally.
[00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:50.140]   And the Lord used that refining of our goals
[00:12:50.140 --> 00:12:52.580]   to be able to refresh our vision
[00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:54.620]   for what homeschooling could be.
[00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:57.380]   But not to say that we didn't have academic goals.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.400]   - Of course not.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:01.940]   - We wanted our children to be able to have the skills
[00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.620]   to learn any subject.
[00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:08.620]   That was something that was upfront, very tangible for us.
[00:13:08.620 --> 00:13:11.900]   Because we knew pretty quickly
[00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:13.500]   that within the course of 12 years,
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.760]   we were not going to be able to teach them everything.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:19.300]   I laugh in looking in the rear view mirror at that goal.
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:21.460]   I could have kept them awake for 12 years
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.700]   and not taught them everything.
[00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:27.860]   But we wanted to be able to have them acquire the skills
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:30.500]   that when they did graduate,
[00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.300]   no matter what path the Lord called them to in their lives,
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.220]   they would have the ability to adapt
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:37.500]   and to learn and to excel
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:41.660]   because they had skills to help them on that path.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:43.340]   And so that goal,
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:45.100]   even though others may have shifted
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:47.300]   through our course of homeschooling,
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:49.520]   that one was one that we kept upfront.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:51.100]   What about you?
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:53.900]   Real, real, how did your goals change too?
[00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:56.340]   - On the real, real, I was a lot like you.
[00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.660]   I really, I wanted to homeschool my girls
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:02.740]   because, well, my older girl,
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:07.740]   my older daughter was a really precocious learner.
[00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:12.300]   She read early and she knew a lot of things.
[00:14:12.300 --> 00:14:14.460]   She was just a curious little child
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.380]   and she asked a lot of questions
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.900]   and her daddy and I were both natural born teachers.
[00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.820]   And so we gave her a lot of information.
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:25.060]   So I decided, we decided to homeschool her
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:28.900]   because A, we thought she would be bored in regular school
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:31.620]   and B, we thought that her constant questions
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:34.780]   would be disruptive in regular school.
[00:14:34.780 --> 00:14:38.840]   And we didn't want her little spirit squelched.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.060]   She had never been punished
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:43.780]   for being curious and inquisitive
[00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:45.900]   and we didn't want that to start with school
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:48.580]   so that she began to hate learning.
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.960]   So my initial goals were to, like you said,
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:56.980]   raise really smart students who read early
[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.340]   and could study anything they want
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.460]   and could be really smart and would be leaders.
[00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.600]   And it didn't, I realized pretty quickly
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:11.480]   that that was not the most important thing.
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:13.760]   As she began to read quickly,
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.720]   she also developed some attitudes that were not as lovely.
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   And so we realized that the Lord had given us
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:28.580]   a unique time with our girls
[00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:31.540]   to shape their character
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.380]   and to teach them how to love their neighbor
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.220]   first by loving their family, right?
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:43.980]   And then loving their community and loving their church.
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:50.600]   And so our goals for homeschooling shifted as well.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:55.300]   We still wanted them to be as bright
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.140]   as the Lord led them to be,
[00:15:58.140 --> 00:16:01.700]   but we also wanted them to be curious
[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:06.700]   and loving and merciful
[00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.060]   and thoughtful and kind.
[00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:15.660]   And so while we did keep our eyes
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:21.500]   on the academic prize of learning
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:26.020]   and exploring and memorizing some things,
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:30.940]   we also really moved to developing their character,
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.020]   making them virtuous humans.
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:38.020]   And so it was really, it was eye-opening.
[00:16:39.220 --> 00:16:41.460]   Like you have said, it was very eye-opening
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:46.060]   and God did a lot as He redeemed our hearts
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:48.720]   and our spirits and our understanding.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.420]   There were lots of things that when I started homeschooling,
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:56.680]   I just knew, you know, and here's the really funny thing.
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:16:59.420]   Stephanie was a really early reader
[00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.740]   and I would teach her things about phonics
[00:17:01.740 --> 00:17:03.960]   and she would get this kind of unfocused,
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:05.620]   far away look in her eye.
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:09.620]   Like I was reminding her of something she already knew.
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:12.460]   And then like the next day she's reading all these words
[00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:13.660]   that I never taught her.
[00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.940]   And I thought, I am the best reading teacher ever.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:20.180]   Oh my gosh, I am so amazing.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:22.820]   And then, you know, as God does,
[00:17:22.820 --> 00:17:24.480]   He sends us our second child
[00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:27.980]   who is nothing like the first child
[00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:30.900]   and they don't learn in any of the same ways.
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:33.840]   And the far away look in my younger daughter's eyes
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:36.000]   was for a completely different reason.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:41.180]   And so she had strengths that it took me a while to discover
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.900]   because I was looking in the wrong place.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.500]   And so one of the assumptions that I made
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:51.360]   was that all the progress that my children made
[00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.780]   were because I was such a good teacher.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:59.340]   And then one of the assumptions that I made,
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.620]   one of the things that I knew
[00:18:00.620 --> 00:18:03.640]   was if you have a good way to teach reading
[00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:04.780]   or fill in the blank,
[00:18:04.780 --> 00:18:09.780]   to teach math or to be a good science person,
[00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:12.660]   that it would work the same with all the children.
[00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.620]   That was also false, okay?
[00:18:14.620 --> 00:18:15.940]   So that was not a thing.
[00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:19.300]   What are some of the things that you just knew
[00:18:19.300 --> 00:18:20.800]   when you started out
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.340]   that you discovered were not true at all?
[00:18:23.340 --> 00:18:24.340]   - Oh, heavens.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.460]   Well, the first thing I knew I've already,
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:28.900]   I knew in quotation marks
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:31.900]   was that all of my children would read really early
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:33.820]   because I read really early.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:35.640]   And if I was teaching them,
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:38.420]   then they would basically become clones of me.
[00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:39.860]   That was not true.
[00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:40.900]   - Okay.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:45.900]   - And I also knew that my sweet, sweet little children
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:50.500]   would want to do their schoolwork every single day.
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:51.620]   - Oh, gosh.
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:55.260]   And that you would want to teach them every single day.
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.140]   - Yes.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.020]   And, you know, Lisa, I look back and I laugh
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:02.060]   because I had very grandiose ideas
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.300]   of what we could accomplish within the course of a day,
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.940]   because I completely did not factor in
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:09.940]   the fact that my children are children.
[00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:10.900]   - Oh, my gosh.
[00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.540]   And your house is your house,
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:15.380]   and things will break,
[00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:17.060]   and the power will go off,
[00:19:17.060 --> 00:19:18.580]   or somebody will be sick,
[00:19:18.580 --> 00:19:21.180]   or 10 people will come to the door.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:22.020]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:22.980]   - Yes, yes.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:25.820]   Another thing that I knew
[00:19:25.820 --> 00:19:28.180]   was that even though we were homeschooling
[00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:29.860]   and a greater portion of our day
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.100]   would be spent in those endeavors,
[00:19:32.100 --> 00:19:35.020]   my house was still going to run like clockwork,
[00:19:35.020 --> 00:19:38.740]   and it would be perfectly clean all of the time.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.620]   And so I had ideas that, you know,
[00:19:41.620 --> 00:19:43.820]   at any time, if anyone dropped into our house,
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.300]   they would see us, you know,
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:46.580]   just sitting in a circle,
[00:19:46.580 --> 00:19:49.220]   basically singing, singing songs,
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:50.620]   and just joyful.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:55.620]   And I had two very energetic little boys
[00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.020]   and a sleeping baby.
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.620]   And let me tell you,
[00:19:59.620 --> 00:20:03.580]   I learned very quickly to prioritize well,
[00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:07.180]   because some days my husband would come home from work,
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:09.300]   and I would have a meal in the crock pot,
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:10.740]   and I would be smiling.
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:14.900]   And some days he would come home from work,
[00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:17.580]   and the house looked like, you know,
[00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.860]   a school just exploded.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:22.020]   - A crock pot came through it.
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:22.860]   - Yes.
[00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:26.340]   And there were books and crayons and all the Play-Doh,
[00:20:26.340 --> 00:20:28.300]   all the things all over the place.
[00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.100]   So we learned quickly to have a basically
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:34.260]   get out of jail free card that was the pizza card.
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:36.340]   So each week I would have one, you know,
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:37.940]   I would say, okay, it's pizza night.
[00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:40.340]   And he would know that his responsibility
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:41.540]   was to give me a big hug,
[00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:43.740]   because it had been one of those days,
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:47.060]   and to get Papa John's or Pizza Hut on speed dial,
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:48.620]   so that we could eat supper
[00:20:48.620 --> 00:20:51.060]   and then send our children to bed with full tummies
[00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.460]   so that we could try again the next day.
[00:20:53.460 --> 00:20:55.500]   And we learned very quickly
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.260]   that grace needed to be extended,
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:00.780]   not only to our children, but to ourselves,
[00:21:00.780 --> 00:21:05.220]   because we were learning this dance called homeschooling.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:08.260]   And, you know, when we knew better than we did better,
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.380]   but there was a lot of learning along the way
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:14.900]   in order to know to be able to do.
[00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:17.020]   So, you know, those are some of the things
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:18.700]   that I thought I knew.
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:20.780]   And it's interestingly, so like now,
[00:21:20.780 --> 00:21:23.220]   with where our family is in our journey,
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.820]   my two energetic little boys
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.500]   have graduated through challenge four.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.620]   One of them has graduated from college as well.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:33.100]   And my baby, who was sleeping peacefully in her crib,
[00:21:33.100 --> 00:21:36.420]   still sleeps through, I mean, basically a hurricane,
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:41.340]   because she became so accustomed to the noise levels.
[00:21:41.340 --> 00:21:44.500]   But she just entered challenge two.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.700]   And so, you know, I look at where we are now,
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:49.700]   our house is quiet.
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.140]   Our house is orderly.
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.700]   Supper is not difficult for me to make,
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:59.020]   but man, do I miss those busy days.
[00:21:59.020 --> 00:21:59.860]   - Yes.
[00:21:59.860 --> 00:22:03.020]   That's another thing.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:06.500]   Stages of life are real.
[00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.340]   And so I used to think once I got in a groove
[00:22:11.340 --> 00:22:14.820]   and got quote unquote good at the schedule
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:18.140]   and good at all the things I wanted to teach my kids
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:20.740]   and good at managing,
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.420]   that it would always run smoothly.
[00:22:23.420 --> 00:22:26.460]   But what I discovered is just when I got good
[00:22:26.460 --> 00:22:28.780]   at this one thing, it would change.
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:31.380]   And then I felt like I was not good at it anymore.
[00:22:31.380 --> 00:22:34.100]   Or as the girls got older,
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.340]   the things that they were studying
[00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.900]   or texts that they were using to study kept changing.
[00:22:40.900 --> 00:22:45.140]   And I had to keep adapting to different ways of learning.
[00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:48.980]   And so that, and there were times,
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:51.700]   admittedly, you know, at the end of the day,
[00:22:51.700 --> 00:22:55.060]   I can remember, especially when they were younger
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:57.500]   in the Foundations and Essentials years,
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.340]   and when some of them were not old enough
[00:22:59.340 --> 00:23:01.540]   for the programs yet.
[00:23:01.540 --> 00:23:04.460]   I can remember getting to the end of the day
[00:23:04.460 --> 00:23:08.620]   and thinking back and being so discouraged to think,
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.380]   okay, so what do we really do?
[00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:14.460]   I mean, did we even finish a math lesson?
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:18.580]   You know, can this child read one more word than they read?
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.420]   You know, I don't even think we said the Pledge of Allegiance
[00:23:21.420 --> 00:23:25.540]   or, you know, I never even, you know, I had this,
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.740]   we didn't memorize the poem today.
[00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:30.380]   And there were times when I was so discouraged.
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.620]   And I will be really honest with you, Kelly,
[00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:35.220]   when I was writing Scribblers,
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:39.500]   that's where my heart yearned toward young families
[00:23:39.500 --> 00:23:43.220]   who would get to the end of the day and say,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:47.460]   gosh, God can't, I don't even see
[00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:49.260]   how God can redeem that day.
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:52.500]   And so what I want to say to young families
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.700]   who are jumping in and maybe have multiple children at home
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.460]   and all these delightful goals
[00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.980]   and all this amazing child energy,
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:07.340]   look, if you can get to the end of the day,
[00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.700]   and what we say in the Scribblers resources,
[00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:15.500]   if you get to the end of the day and you prayed together
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:20.500]   and you played together and you read together
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:26.340]   and you explored together and you served together,
[00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:31.340]   it has been a good day.
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:35.180]   And there's so much more that we learn
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:39.580]   alongside our children than what comes out of a book
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:42.620]   that I think, if I look in the rear view mirror,
[00:24:42.620 --> 00:24:47.620]   I wish I had known that in a more deep seated heart way
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:51.980]   when my girls were little.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:55.300]   We've both learned a lot of lessons.
[00:24:55.300 --> 00:24:58.660]   And when I look back, I see all kinds of lessons.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:25:01.140]   I want to get to a few specifics
[00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:03.100]   'cause we could talk about this for a long time
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:06.420]   because we both feel it so keenly.
[00:25:06.420 --> 00:25:10.060]   And we're so eager to share it with families
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:13.780]   who are at an earlier section of the journey than we are.
[00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:17.460]   Okay, what did you learn about your kids
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:19.460]   as littlest learners
[00:25:19.460 --> 00:25:22.380]   that would have made it easier back then?
[00:25:22.380 --> 00:25:25.660]   What has time and perspective taught you
[00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:28.260]   about the way little children learn?
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.420]   - I think looking back on that time period
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:34.780]   when we were so busy,
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.580]   those busy days where I felt like
[00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.100]   I needed to have hands and minds occupied
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:40.500]   unless they were sleeping.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:44.180]   I think that it would have been wonderful
[00:25:44.180 --> 00:25:48.380]   if I had been more mindful to be sensitive to their needs
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:51.020]   and to my relationship with them.
[00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:57.020]   Sometimes I allowed the bulldozer of the schedule
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:59.420]   to completely steamroll over
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.020]   my precious children's curiosity.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:04.180]   They could have been building
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.060]   the most intricate Play-Doh snake or snowman
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.700]   or fill in the blank here
[00:26:08.700 --> 00:26:13.140]   and wanting to tell me with joy and enthusiasm all about it.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.180]   And I sadly remember times where I looked at my watch
[00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:19.540]   and said, "Well, it's 9.30.
[00:26:19.540 --> 00:26:21.300]   "We need to go ahead and put this away."
[00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:23.220]   - Right, we don't have time for that now.
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:26.540]   - Yes, and oh, Lisa, I wish if I had a time machine,
[00:26:26.540 --> 00:26:28.460]   I would go back in time
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:31.380]   and I would just hit pause on those plans
[00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:33.380]   for just a little bit longer
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.980]   so that my children could have delighted more
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.140]   in the act of play.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:42.020]   I think if I could, in the rear view mirror,
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.820]   I think I would have played with them more.
[00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:47.140]   Now, granted, we played a lot.
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:48.780]   - Right, but you know what?
[00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:51.740]   The play is, Einstein said that,
[00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:54.700]   play is the work of childhood.
[00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.420]   - Yes, yes, I think I would have made fun
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:26:59.940]   more of a priority.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.580]   Having fun with them, going outside, going for walks,
[00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.180]   kicking a ball, just doing things,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.700]   having conversations with them,
[00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:10.780]   even when they were little, like, "Oh, do you see this?
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:12.180]   "Do you notice this?"
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.740]   I think we used the core habits, naming and attending
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:19.620]   and memorizing, expressing and storytelling.
[00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.380]   But oh, I wish I could go back with the knowledge
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:25.860]   and of the connections that I have now
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:27.820]   as a seasoned homeschooler.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:30.220]   And I wish that I could redeem those moments
[00:27:30.220 --> 00:27:35.220]   where I allowed schedule to be the tyrant of our days.
[00:27:35.220 --> 00:27:40.500]   I just really think that would have made a difference.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:43.900]   And also, I think I would have taken them more places.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.980]   I think when they were young,
[00:27:44.980 --> 00:27:49.980]   because they were so excited to see and do all the things,
[00:27:49.980 --> 00:27:54.380]   I shied away from taking them certain places
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:57.980]   because I was fearful that they would be disruptive.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:28:02.380]   And looking back, I wish that when they were younger,
[00:28:02.380 --> 00:28:05.300]   we had done more things like go to a museum
[00:28:05.300 --> 00:28:10.180]   and practice, how do we behave in this place?
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:13.380]   And granted, they did learn those lessons later on,
[00:28:13.380 --> 00:28:17.980]   but I think just for their own experience
[00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:19.300]   and our experience in a family,
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.060]   I would have taken advantage of more of those opportunities
[00:28:22.060 --> 00:28:25.940]   to go together and experience things when they were young
[00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:27.620]   and not hold off on all those things
[00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.620]   until they were a little bit older.
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:32.940]   - Oh, what a good encouragement.
[00:28:32.940 --> 00:28:35.500]   I really, really love that.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:41.700]   What did you learn about rhythms versus schedules?
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:47.740]   And what did you learn about interruptions and consistency?
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:51.580]   'Cause I know that's a thing that lots of us struggle with
[00:28:51.580 --> 00:28:53.620]   when we're first starting homeschooling
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:55.780]   and when our children are young.
[00:28:55.780 --> 00:29:00.260]   I also tended to be a very plan heavy person.
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:03.500]   And so I did, when you said,
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.500]   you would look at your watch and say,
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.300]   well, now it's time for so-and-so,
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:10.180]   I could, I mean, I so can relate to that.
[00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:15.180]   And I feel like I probably squelched some teachable moments
[00:29:15.180 --> 00:29:17.340]   or I didn't recognize them
[00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:20.580]   because I was on my way to the teachable moment
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:23.140]   that I had designed in my head.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:25.580]   And I didn't recognize the teachable moment
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:28.260]   that was appearing in front of me.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.860]   - Right, right.
[00:29:29.860 --> 00:29:33.540]   I think thinking about rhythms and schedules,
[00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:38.140]   this is the pithy saying that I probably would,
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.620]   put in a phylactery on my forehead
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:44.860]   like the priests of ancient Israel,
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.300]   vigor trumps rigor.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.500]   I really, I think that if I had invested
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.340]   in that life giving experience to them,
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:59.580]   instead of being held to the tyranny of the urgent,
[00:29:59.580 --> 00:30:01.140]   I think that it would have been
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:04.540]   a better educational experience for my children
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:05.380]   at that moment.
[00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:06.860]   And I will say this,
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.940]   there will always be something to distract you
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.300]   from your purpose.
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.060]   Sometimes the thing that distracts you from your purpose
[00:30:14.060 --> 00:30:17.860]   is the schedule that you're trying to keep.
[00:30:17.860 --> 00:30:19.900]   And pretty early on,
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:23.620]   I remember printing out a schedule
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.180]   and keeping it on our refrigerator,
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:26.500]   right next to where we would do
[00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:28.820]   our little activities at the table.
[00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:31.700]   And it would say something along the lines of,
[00:30:31.700 --> 00:30:33.300]   eight to 8.30 this,
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.060]   8.30 to nine this,
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:36.220]   nine to 9.30 that.
[00:30:36.220 --> 00:30:38.780]   And I would list off these things
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.540]   as if learning had parameters.
[00:30:41.540 --> 00:30:43.580]   (laughs)
[00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.780]   And as if we could not do math,
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:50.180]   five minutes after what time the schedule said.
[00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.660]   And I think that the Lord pretty quickly taught me
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:56.500]   that I was thinking inside a box
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.820]   and homeschooling is definitely outside the box.
[00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:02.020]   I didn't realize at that point
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:04.180]   that everything was interconnected
[00:31:04.180 --> 00:31:07.580]   because it's created by one God
[00:31:07.580 --> 00:31:10.980]   who has wisdom beyond what we can comprehend.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:12.180]   All these things are connected
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.180]   because they echo at one another and they glorify Him.
[00:31:16.180 --> 00:31:18.780]   And I think at that moment when my children were small,
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:22.420]   if I had had that vision for our homeschool,
[00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.260]   I think it would have made an incredible difference
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:29.340]   in how we had "scheduled time".
[00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:31.460]   And I think I would have emphasized
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:35.180]   just routines over schedules.
[00:31:35.180 --> 00:31:37.140]   I think it would have been kinder to my children
[00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.060]   to not forsake order altogether
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:41.740]   because God is a God of order.
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.580]   But also to understand that some days
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.260]   there might be ebb and flow to that
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.460]   based on where my children were
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.860]   with a particular activity or if they had questions
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:54.740]   or they wanted to read a certain book just one more time,
[00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:59.020]   that my answer could have been yes and that was okay.
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.180]   And I think it took me a long time
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:05.860]   to learn how to bend and not break
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.020]   in regard to our schedule as a family.
[00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:12.580]   Like I said, there will always be things to distract you.
[00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:15.580]   And as a homeschooling, as a young homeschooling mom,
[00:32:15.580 --> 00:32:18.460]   when my friends found out that we were homeschooling,
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:20.140]   they thought that it was open season
[00:32:20.140 --> 00:32:21.660]   for us to go and do everything.
[00:32:21.660 --> 00:32:23.540]   - Yes, absolutely.
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:27.500]   - I just really had to learn to give my best yes
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:31.140]   to my friends and to make wise decisions for our family
[00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:34.540]   and just be consistent with the decisions that were made.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.300]   If we weren't going to the zoo with friends,
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.420]   then I needed to be kind enough to say,
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.100]   we can't do that today because we have this planned.
[00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:44.860]   However, we can do this.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:48.500]   Exactly, and to just navigate friendship
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:50.940]   a little differently because of our family's priorities
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:51.940]   for homeschooling.
[00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:55.500]   - Yeah, you know what, my favorite thing that you said,
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.140]   'cause there were lots of things and so I have to pick one.
[00:32:58.140 --> 00:33:02.740]   I love routines over schedules
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:05.500]   'cause I tend to be a very scheduled person.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:08.220]   And I will say this, children,
[00:33:08.220 --> 00:33:13.180]   especially young children need routines
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:17.900]   and they need because they need to know what to expect.
[00:33:17.900 --> 00:33:21.460]   It is easier, transitions are really, really hard
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:23.220]   for littlest learners.
[00:33:23.220 --> 00:33:26.540]   And so if they know what to expect,
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:30.500]   they have less trouble with the transitions.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   But it doesn't mean that you have to be a 910 to 950 person.
[00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:38.580]   It might mean that they can expect
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:43.580]   that every morning starts with prayer and a Bible story.
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:48.580]   And before lunch, it ends with map time and memory work.
[00:33:48.580 --> 00:33:54.660]   So it may be, like Kelly said, a routine.
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:58.140]   We always do math before reading.
[00:33:58.140 --> 00:34:01.900]   We always do reading before geography.
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.060]   We always do geography before lunch.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:09.060]   We always have stories after lunch, that kind of routine.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.100]   I think that's really, really wise.
[00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:17.060]   And consistency, if you begin to build that
[00:34:17.060 --> 00:34:22.060]   as a family habit, then when your children are in challenge,
[00:34:22.060 --> 00:34:26.660]   planning more of their day and learning to take more
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.540]   and more responsibility for their assignments
[00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:34.220]   and their learning, that consistency of effort
[00:34:34.220 --> 00:34:37.340]   is what will bring them results.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:39.420]   So that's really good.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:41.620]   What did you learn about, okay,
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:45.740]   I know listeners that you have all done this.
[00:34:45.740 --> 00:34:48.580]   I know it's not just me and Kelly, okay.
[00:34:48.580 --> 00:34:53.300]   Kelly, what did you learn about comparisons to others?
[00:34:53.300 --> 00:34:55.660]   You know, comparing your homeschool
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:57.340]   to somebody else's homeschool
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.420]   or your child's memory prowess to somebody else's.
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:03.220]   What did you learn about comparisons
[00:35:03.220 --> 00:35:04.940]   and how do you learn that
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.940]   and what has it meant to your children?
[00:35:06.940 --> 00:35:10.580]   Well, I've learned that comparison,
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:13.460]   while a very helpful tool in challenge,
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:20.100]   can also be a tool that doesn't sharpen, but it dulls.
[00:35:20.100 --> 00:35:23.700]   Because it can be, as we have said so often,
[00:35:23.700 --> 00:35:24.900]   a thief of joy.
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:29.100]   Comparison to others can be an encouragement,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:31.180]   but it can also steal your joy.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:34.540]   Because when you look at others and what they're doing,
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.100]   quite often, unfortunately, because of social media,
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:41.700]   we're looking at someone else's highlight reel
[00:35:41.700 --> 00:35:45.460]   and thinking, wow, their life is like fantastic
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.780]   every single day.
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:50.220]   And I bet their kids never complain about having to do math
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:52.660]   and look at their homeschool area.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.060]   It's so neat and tidy.
[00:35:54.060 --> 00:35:57.860]   And we fill in all of these supposed inadequacies
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   that we have based on what we see that others have.
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:06.340]   And we don't see their struggles.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:11.060]   We don't hear the questions that they're asking themselves
[00:36:11.060 --> 00:36:13.580]   or what their children are saying,
[00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:17.940]   as they're comparing their homeschool to others.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:21.940]   And I learned quickly that I could not motivate my children
[00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:26.940]   by saying, why don't you fill in the blank here,
[00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:29.460]   like your friend, so and so.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:33.700]   That was, I think that came out of my mouth one time
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.900]   before I listened to myself and thought,
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:40.260]   I wouldn't wanna be motivated that way as an adult.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:43.180]   - Well, and you know what, Kelly?
[00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:46.340]   We don't wanna teach our children to do that.
[00:36:46.340 --> 00:36:48.060]   We don't wanna model that for your children.
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:50.500]   Do you really want your children to go through life
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.220]   comparing themselves either favorably
[00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.500]   or unfavorably to other people?
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:59.340]   You're either gonna raise a prideful child
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:03.380]   or somebody with real self-esteem issues
[00:37:03.380 --> 00:37:05.260]   who's not taking their worth
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.340]   from what the Lord Jesus thinks about them.
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.780]   - Yes, exactly.
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:12.980]   And so pretty early on, we made it a priority
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.820]   to celebrate what we saw in others.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:20.820]   If a friend tested or proved rather for memory master
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:25.900]   and was able to be a memory master for a particular cycle,
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:28.860]   if one of my children chose not to do that,
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:31.020]   rather than saying, well, why didn't you do that?
[00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:32.780]   What's wrong with you?
[00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:35.700]   We would say, aren't you excited for your friend?
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:38.300]   What a fantastic accomplishment.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:43.060]   And I would help them to reason through
[00:37:43.060 --> 00:37:45.500]   so that there was not an element of jealousy
[00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.620]   in the comparison, but there was true joy
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:51.460]   at what others in our community were doing.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:54.780]   And I think this spilled over into challenge
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.980]   when my children were participating in mock trial
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:01.500]   and they were involved in debate,
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:04.220]   just helping them to look at their friends,
[00:38:04.220 --> 00:38:05.820]   to look at others in our community
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.340]   and see how they modeled Christ
[00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.100]   or to see those attributes of them,
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:14.620]   which glorified God and to celebrate those things
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:16.660]   and to tell that person,
[00:38:16.660 --> 00:38:19.420]   I see the way that you do this thing
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:23.420]   and how you are like Jesus in the way you do this thing.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.140]   And that makes me joyful.
[00:38:25.140 --> 00:38:28.540]   And to give that compliment is so much more wonderful
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:30.100]   than your child saying,
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.780]   well, you know, congratulations on memory master,
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:37.300]   congratulations on mock trial
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:42.300]   or whatever accomplishment that that person had achieved
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:45.860]   to show them how they were being like Christ
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.580]   is a much more noble goal.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:51.980]   And so I think that was how we took comparison
[00:38:51.980 --> 00:38:53.860]   instead of making it a thief.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.940]   Instead, we decided to make it a giver
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.900]   so that our children could give
[00:38:58.900 --> 00:39:01.780]   to those people around them that they saw
[00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:05.020]   who were doing good things in the name of Jesus.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:06.340]   - That is so wise.
[00:39:06.340 --> 00:39:07.340]   You are really right.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:10.300]   Comparison does rob us of our joy.
[00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.220]   And when we, in our day,
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:14.620]   and it's so easy to get sucked into it
[00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.620]   down in the weeds and the details,
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.460]   we compare child two to child one.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.980]   And well, I don't understand why you're not reading yet.
[00:39:23.980 --> 00:39:26.020]   Or I don't understand why we're not ready to move
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:27.740]   to the yellow series yet.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:30.740]   You know, your sister did, or your brother did,
[00:39:30.740 --> 00:39:33.980]   or I, you know, your handwriting is so much
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:39.540]   less refined than your siblings, you know,
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:42.940]   or, well, so-and-so never made a mess like that,
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.900]   or, you know, so-and-so did their report
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:48.460]   or got their experiment done on time.
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:53.460]   And so it robs us of the joy that is learning together
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:40:00.620]   because it makes the presentation or the final product
[00:40:00.620 --> 00:40:05.900]   the only thing that we measure
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:10.900]   instead of valuing the conversations
[00:40:10.900 --> 00:40:12.980]   that we have along the way,
[00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:15.860]   the discoveries that we make together,
[00:40:15.860 --> 00:40:20.860]   the just sitting in wonder of it all as a family.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.820]   Those are the things, I'm here to tell you,
[00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:26.380]   those are the things that your children
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.220]   are going to look back and remember.
[00:40:29.220 --> 00:40:30.580]   They are not gonna remember
[00:40:30.580 --> 00:40:33.580]   how fast they finished the math lesson.
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.980]   They're not gonna remember how many weeks it took them
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:41.180]   to see the difference between there, there, and there.
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:43.580]   You know, they're not gonna remember those details,
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.660]   but they are gonna remember if mama was willing
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:51.660]   to get her hands dirty in the creek and stuff like that.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.620]   So those are the kinds of things.
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:41:00.220]   What I want to ask you is we're not gonna,
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:03.220]   okay, listeners, we're not gonna have time
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.300]   to get into all the specifics.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:08.420]   So I might have Kelly back and we might talk about
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:11.260]   what we learned about teaching math to our children.
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.900]   'Cause some of you are thinking this is all so encouraging.
[00:41:14.900 --> 00:41:15.820]   Oh, I'm so glad,
[00:41:15.820 --> 00:41:18.620]   but how am I supposed to teach math to three children?
[00:41:18.620 --> 00:41:22.140]   Or how do you teach somebody to write a keyword outline
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.740]   while this person is sounding out B-A-T?
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:28.020]   We'll do that, a different podcast.
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:31.500]   But these are big picture things
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:35.220]   because I'm telling you the big picture attitudes
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:38.540]   affect your little day-to-day decisions
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:39.980]   and the success that you're gonna feel.
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:42.780]   So this is the next question I want to ask you.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.300]   What did you learn, Ms. Kelly Wilt,
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:48.060]   about your own learning style
[00:41:48.060 --> 00:41:53.060]   and your response to learning new things?
[00:41:53.060 --> 00:41:57.180]   And how am I learning that about that earlier?
[00:41:57.180 --> 00:41:58.820]   Have blessed your homeschool.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.780]   - Oh my goodness.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:05.220]   Well, my own learning style is visual, very visual.
[00:42:05.220 --> 00:42:09.820]   I am still the person that goes to Office Depot or Staples
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:12.180]   and buys all the colors of highlighters
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:13.780]   and all the sticky notes
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:16.860]   and all the school supplies in particular colors.
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:20.260]   And I would put particular subjects
[00:42:20.260 --> 00:42:22.780]   in particular color-coded notebooks.
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:26.900]   Oh, Lisa, that just made my heart sing.
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:29.820]   And so I would do these things for myself
[00:42:29.820 --> 00:42:32.580]   and I naturally thought if I was a visual learner,
[00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:36.860]   then of course all of my children would be too, ha ha ha.
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:39.180]   And so my firstborn was,
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:42.740]   so very much like you described with Stephanie,
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:45.140]   your firstborn, you thought,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.060]   oh, I'm the best reading teacher ever.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:49.980]   And I thought because I was teaching
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:53.260]   in a way that echoed with my child's heart song,
[00:42:53.260 --> 00:42:54.740]   you know, my firstborn,
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:57.340]   I thought I am the best homeschool teacher
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:02.340]   there ever will be until my secondborn came along.
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:05.580]   And so he is not a visual learner.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:09.540]   He is hands-on, we would call him kinesthetic.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:14.140]   He wants to manage and model and take things apart
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:18.380]   and put them back together, very hands-on.
[00:43:18.380 --> 00:43:22.580]   And it is a wonderful way that God has created his brain
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.540]   because I will say this,
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:25.820]   when we have furniture delivered,
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:28.620]   he can put it together without looking at the directions.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:30.540]   - Oh my gosh, I have one daughter
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.980]   that is the putter together.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:34.860]   She and her daddy put the stuff together
[00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:37.060]   and me and my other daughter just like,
[00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:39.700]   yep, we see you doing it.
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:40.980]   I don't know how you got there
[00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:43.300]   from what you had to work with, but go for it.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:45.780]   - Exactly, he was a square peg
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.340]   and I was trying to fit him in a round hole.
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:51.580]   Now my thirdborn is also a visual learner.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.180]   So now that she's the remaining student in our homeschool,
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:58.740]   we delight in going and buying all the school supplies
[00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:00.660]   so that we can revel in our post-it
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.940]   and highlighter glory together.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.580]   But I think, looking back,
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.980]   I wish that I had been more sensitive to the fact
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:09.580]   that not all of my children were going to learn
[00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:10.900]   in the same way that I did.
[00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:15.180]   And I think I would have very early on
[00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:19.620]   given our middle child more manipulative opportunities.
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.900]   And I don't mean that like in a manipulative
[00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:23.100]   in a negative way.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:23.940]   - Right, right, right.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.100]   - That I would have given him things to do with his hands
[00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.100]   while we were chanting memory work.
[00:44:29.100 --> 00:44:34.100]   And we would have reviewed different pieces of curriculum
[00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:39.380]   or information while he was jumping outside
[00:44:39.380 --> 00:44:41.660]   or he was building with Legos
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.220]   or he was playing with,
[00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:47.740]   we had fabulous sets of Playmobil guys that were Romans.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:52.740]   And if I had integrated those things more
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:55.300]   into learning opportunities for him
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:56.700]   and been sensitive to the fact
[00:44:56.700 --> 00:44:59.580]   that that was what his brain latched on to,
[00:44:59.580 --> 00:45:02.900]   I think it would have made his education easier
[00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:03.740]   at the beginning.
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.180]   Now later, we did do some of those things
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.580]   because I started to realize
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:09.460]   after his younger sister came along,
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:13.300]   "Whoa, wait a minute, this isn't just a him thing.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.020]   Everyone's different."
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:17.660]   And I think it would have helped tremendously
[00:45:17.660 --> 00:45:21.620]   because he just was a sponge.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.500]   But I was trying to get him to soak up information
[00:45:24.500 --> 00:45:26.020]   in the wrong way.
[00:45:26.020 --> 00:45:28.300]   So when we latched on to that,
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.420]   that completely revolutionized school for him.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.460]   And he enjoyed it, he didn't,
[00:45:33.460 --> 00:45:36.500]   I think we got to a place where he would come
[00:45:36.500 --> 00:45:39.100]   and he would sit and he would do the things,
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:41.580]   but there wasn't joy for him.
[00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:46.580]   And when we started to include activities that,
[00:45:46.580 --> 00:45:50.180]   like I said, just plucked the strings of his heart song,
[00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:53.140]   he really began to enjoy
[00:45:53.140 --> 00:45:55.020]   what we were doing together as a family.
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:57.860]   And that was a blessing to me as his mom,
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:01.740]   to see him loving the very active learning,
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:05.060]   not feeling like it was drudgery, it was a joy.
[00:46:05.060 --> 00:46:06.460]   And that gave me joy. - What a great thing.
[00:46:06.460 --> 00:46:09.540]   What a great thing to learn so that you can,
[00:46:09.540 --> 00:46:14.180]   parents, if your child just seems to "hate school"
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.820]   or not like learning,
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:18.860]   it's so easy to get discouraged
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:21.100]   and to feel badly about yourself
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:25.740]   or have dark feelings about your child's willingness
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:27.300]   to learn things.
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:30.980]   But really maybe it's what Kelly was describing.
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.300]   You haven't found your child's learning style yet.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:38.740]   You've not connected with the way that they need to
[00:46:38.740 --> 00:46:40.340]   and want to take in information.
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:43.620]   So don't be discouraged and don't decide
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:45.740]   that learning is not for that child
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:48.740]   or homeschooling is not for your family.
[00:46:48.740 --> 00:46:51.580]   You just haven't learned all the things yet
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:56.260]   and you are going to continue to grow as a lead learner,
[00:46:56.260 --> 00:46:59.180]   just like your child is gonna continue to grow
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.980]   as an at-home learner.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.020]   Well, Kelly, I'm thinking that you're not gonna be shocked
[00:47:04.020 --> 00:47:06.260]   when I tell you that we're really out of time
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.820]   because we've had so much fun talking together.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.900]   But as we bring it all to a close,
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.580]   I wanna ask, what are your three
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.100]   biggest rear view mirror takeaways?
[00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:23.060]   There's so many good things to think about.
[00:47:23.060 --> 00:47:24.540]   I think the first is something
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.900]   that you've already alluded to,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:29.100]   and that is do not isolate yourself.
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.660]   Homeschool is meant to be done with a friend,
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:34.420]   so surround yourself with your people
[00:47:34.420 --> 00:47:37.540]   and delight in doing this together.
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:40.380]   I think that would be my first takeaway.
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.780]   I think the second would be don't give up
[00:47:43.780 --> 00:47:45.060]   just because it's hard.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.580]   I tell people all the time,
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:50.460]   homeschooling is the best, hardest thing
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.700]   that our family has ever done together.
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:57.700]   And that is still true after 17 years together,
[00:47:57.700 --> 00:48:00.580]   homeschooling as a family.
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:02.460]   - And I will say this,
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:07.140]   there are hard seasons and you may hit a hard,
[00:48:07.140 --> 00:48:10.220]   maybe all your children will hit the hard season
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.940]   in the same year or in the same level,
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:14.300]   but maybe not.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.900]   And so don't give up
[00:48:16.900 --> 00:48:19.820]   just because you have hit a hard patch.
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:24.820]   There is so much fruit and so much joy
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:28.100]   and so much redemption to be had
[00:48:28.100 --> 00:48:30.020]   on the other side of hard.
[00:48:30.020 --> 00:48:31.180]   - For sure.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:34.460]   I think the last takeaway that I would give
[00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.660]   is to trust that the Holy Spirit is at work
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.180]   in your life and in the life of your family,
[00:48:40.180 --> 00:48:43.060]   because you are always going to question,
[00:48:43.060 --> 00:48:45.220]   am I enough for this task?
[00:48:45.220 --> 00:48:47.700]   And really and truly the answer to that is no.
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:49.820]   In isolation by yourself,
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:52.060]   you're not enough,
[00:48:52.060 --> 00:48:54.340]   but He is enough.
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.140]   And He will give you the strength
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:59.260]   to accomplish what He has called you to do.
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.620]   So trust in Him
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:05.020]   and enjoy reaping the rewards
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.300]   when someday you too are able to look
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:08.740]   in the rear view mirror.
[00:49:08.740 --> 00:49:09.580]   - Yes.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:12.620]   - Just like Lisa and myself.
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:13.980]   - Yes, I was gonna say,
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.060]   would you do it all again?
[00:49:15.060 --> 00:49:16.820]   But I know the answer to that.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.860]   - Yes, yes.
[00:49:17.860 --> 00:49:18.980]   - I would too.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.860]   And parents, that is,
[00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.260]   for parents who are just starting out
[00:49:25.260 --> 00:49:27.820]   or all your children are young,
[00:49:27.820 --> 00:49:29.780]   they're like all in foundations
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:31.500]   and essentials or diapers.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:35.140]   You will have days when you will think,
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.620]   I do not think I can do this for 15
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.460]   or 18 or 20 years.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:42.180]   This is not going to be,
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:44.980]   I'm not gonna look back on this as joy.
[00:49:44.980 --> 00:49:46.220]   I think you will.
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:47.060]   - Yes.
[00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:51.540]   - There's hardly a week that goes by
[00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.740]   that I don't look at my husband and say,
[00:49:53.740 --> 00:49:57.140]   I sort of wish they were little again.
[00:49:57.140 --> 00:50:00.500]   I would do all of that again
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:05.060]   because it brought me great joy.
[00:50:05.060 --> 00:50:08.700]   And I think that I look back now and think,
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:11.540]   oh, I wish I could fix that little messy spot.
[00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:15.460]   I wish I could erase and draw that.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:18.300]   I wish I could have a do-over for that year
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:21.260]   or for that instance.
[00:50:21.260 --> 00:50:22.580]   But we can't.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:23.420]   - Right, right.
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.620]   - But the Lord will redeem it.
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:28.260]   And the Lord does redeem it.
[00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:29.580]   And I loved what you said.
[00:50:29.580 --> 00:50:31.460]   It is a joy.
[00:50:31.460 --> 00:50:36.460]   And it will be the hardest job you'll ever love.
[00:50:36.460 --> 00:50:39.780]   - Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:50:39.780 --> 00:50:41.980]   When I look back over our years,
[00:50:41.980 --> 00:50:44.500]   I think the one thing that resonates with me
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.740]   is that we have been changed
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:48.420]   through our experience homeschooling,
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:50.820]   but we've been changed for our good
[00:50:50.820 --> 00:50:52.740]   and we've been changed for God's glory.
[00:50:52.740 --> 00:50:54.740]   And what more could you ask
[00:50:54.740 --> 00:50:56.500]   from your family's homeschooling journey?
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:50:59.740]   - Amen and amen, my friend.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:03.540]   Well, listeners, I hope that you have
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:06.980]   gotten some encouraging encouragement
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:09.660]   and some inspiration from the things
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:11.020]   that we've shared today.
[00:51:11.020 --> 00:51:13.820]   I want you to know that Kellie and I are praying for you.
[00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:17.380]   We pray for young homeschooling families
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:22.380]   that you will have reassurance and encouragement
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:25.900]   and peace and joy for the journey
[00:51:25.900 --> 00:51:29.180]   and fun with your family.
[00:51:29.180 --> 00:51:31.100]   I have one thing I want to,
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:34.260]   one thing that we sort of talked about,
[00:51:34.260 --> 00:51:38.860]   part of the fun of homeschooling is doing things together.
[00:51:38.860 --> 00:51:41.820]   One of the most fun things that our family did
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.180]   when our children were small and that we still do
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:47.100]   now that our girls are grown and are married even,
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:49.580]   is read aloud as a family.
[00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.820]   Books have always been really important to us.
[00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.940]   And so I want to mention to you guys
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:56.460]   the Copper Lodge Library.
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:00.940]   If you are looking to build a library for your family
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:03.740]   at the very beginning of your educational journey,
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:05.540]   or maybe you're just looking for books
[00:52:05.540 --> 00:52:07.700]   to read aloud together,
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.620]   the Copper Lodge Library collection
[00:52:10.620 --> 00:52:15.020]   has lots of good material to start with.
[00:52:15.020 --> 00:52:20.020]   And one of our newest titles is a book that
[00:52:20.020 --> 00:52:23.220]   actually our Challenge A students read,
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.260]   but it is a perfect book to read together
[00:52:26.260 --> 00:52:27.580]   as a family.
[00:52:27.580 --> 00:52:29.660]   It's called The Secret Garden.
[00:52:29.660 --> 00:52:34.260]   The Secret Garden is a delightful story
[00:52:34.260 --> 00:52:39.260]   of redemption and reclamation and hope,
[00:52:39.260 --> 00:52:43.540]   but your kids will just see it as a really fun story
[00:52:43.540 --> 00:52:48.100]   about children who bring a neglected secret garden
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:49.100]   back to life.
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:54.100]   So go look and learn more about the Copper Lodge Library
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.980]   at copperlodgelibrary.com.
[00:52:58.980 --> 00:53:03.980]   It's collections of stories and beautiful bindings.
[00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:06.100]   It's a beautiful series of books,
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.980]   and you can build family culture of reading
[00:53:08.980 --> 00:53:10.940]   and family culture of learning
[00:53:10.940 --> 00:53:12.660]   by reading these stories together.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:17.300]   So you guys go and enjoy some time with your family
[00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.220]   as the days of summer wane,
[00:53:19.220 --> 00:53:21.540]   and you begin thinking about
[00:53:21.540 --> 00:53:23.660]   learning intentionally together.
[00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:25.100]   Kelly, thanks for being with me.
[00:53:25.100 --> 00:53:26.420]   Absolutely, anytime.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:28.460]   All right, bye guys.
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:32.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:53:32.020 --> 00:53:34.080]   you
[00:53:34.080 --> 00:53:36.140]   you
