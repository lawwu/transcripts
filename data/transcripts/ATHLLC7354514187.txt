[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680]   A quick word from our sponsor today.
[00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.040]   I love helping you answer all the toughest questions about life, money, and so much
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.860]   more, but sometimes it's helpful to talk to other people in your situation, which
[00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.920]   actually gets harder as you build your wealth.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.200]   So I want to introduce you to today's sponsor, Longangle.
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.220]   Longangle is a community of high net worth individuals with backgrounds in
[00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.040]   everything from technology, finance, medicine, to real estate, law,
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.600]   manufacturing, and more.
[00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.440]   I'm a member of Longangle.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.040]   I've loved being a part of the community, and I've even had one of the founders,
[00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.200]   Tad Fallows, join me on All The Hacks in episode 87 to talk about alternative
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.920]   investments.
[00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.660]   Now, the majority of Longangle members are first generation wealth, young, highly
[00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.400]   successful individuals who join the community to share knowledge and learn
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.600]   from each other in a confidential, unbiased setting.
[00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.400]   On top of that, members also get access to some unique private market investment
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.200]   opportunities.
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.120]   Like I said, I'm a member and I've gotten so much value from the community
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.320]   because you're getting advice and feedback from people in a similar
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.280]   situation to you on everything from your investment portfolio, to your
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.240]   children's education, to finding a concierge doctor.
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.160]   So many of these conversations aren't happening anywhere else online.
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.440]   So if you have more than 2.2 million in investable assets, which is their
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.000]   minimum for membership, I encourage you to check out Longangle and it's totally
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.800]   free to join.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.160]   Just go to longangle.com to learn more.
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.040]   And if you choose to apply, be sure to let them know you heard about it here.
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.680]   Again, that's longangle.com.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:41.520]   Hello, and welcome to another bonus episode of All The Hacks, a show about
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.800]   upgrading your life, money, and travel.
[00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.480]   A few days ago, I had a conversation with Ali Abdaal, who's one of the creators I
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.520]   follow the most when it comes to learning about productivity hacks and different
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.400]   tools and systems that someone uses to make their life more efficient.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.760]   And I had hoped maybe we'd get more time in the conversation to go through all of
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.960]   the apps we use, but we just didn't get there.
[00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.080]   However, I did think it would be worth sharing with all of you what I'm using to
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080]   make my life more efficient, more optimal.
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.680]   I figured I'll talk about Chrome extensions, sending emails, scheduling,
[00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.880]   storing information, accessing stuff quickly on your computer.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.920]   I might even jump into some other apps I use for different things to make life
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.640]   more efficient and some of the gear and hardware I use technology-wise just to
[00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.680]   make the whole house in our life function well.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.200]   So I'm going to start with email because I think it's probably one of
[00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.720]   the things that we do the most.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.600]   I've been a longtime Gmail user, and for many years, I was just using it all on
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.120]   Gmail.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.320]   And so my tips for that are you've got to turn on your keyboard shortcuts.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.680]   I think email is 10 times faster when you master the Gmail keyboard shortcuts.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.680]   There's a few other things I use.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.320]   I make sure to turn on in the advanced settings, auto-advance, because as soon
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.520]   as you finish an email, it jumps to the next one.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.520]   I like the unread message icon because if you pin the tab for Chrome, it'll
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.920]   change the icon with a number of how many emails there are.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.840]   So if you're one of those people that's like, I want to know if I have any
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.400]   emails, you could just check without having to go.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.760]   I like compact view because it just lets you see more at once.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.640]   And when I was using Gmail as the interface, I used a system that I'll link
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.240]   to in the show notes for organizing all of the emails I had into a handful of
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.000]   buckets that when you use split inbox and labels, you can kind of move things
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.560]   around.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.160]   So I had everything that came in.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.640]   I had things I was awaiting a reply for.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.800]   I had really priority urgent things I needed to tackle, stuff that I could get
[00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.160]   to in the next week and just stuff I wanted to save for later.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.400]   Now, ever since I switched to superhuman, I've stopped doing that.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.600]   But the two other things I did with Gmail were it drove me crazy when everyone's
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.280]   email signature would just get stacked five, 10 signatures all the way at the
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.680]   bottom.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.800]   So there's this setting that's like insert signature before quoted text and
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.360]   removing that dash before it.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:07.200]   So I love that.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.520]   And then I used undo send a lot.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.000]   For some reason, I would fire off an email, send it and very regularly be like,
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   Oh, I forgot something.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.040]   So I love that.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.280]   The only other big thing I use in Gmail is aliases.
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.240]   So I have chris@allthehacks.com, which I bring up in every show.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.160]   I've got some personal email addresses.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:29.680]   I forward all those emails to my core Gmail account and I use the aliases so
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.560]   that I can send from all those aliases.
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.600]   So I operate everything from one email account, even though there might be five
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.480]   or six email addresses out there.
[00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.560]   And for the last, I don't know, five, 10 years almost, I'd heard of this app
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.320]   superhuman.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.560]   And for some reason, I'd never really brought myself to try it out because in
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.280]   my mind, paying for an email client on top of Gmail, which was free, seemed
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.920]   crazy.
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:54.520]   So I never used it.
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.680]   And I remember signing up for one of their onboarding sessions once, but I
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.800]   never ended up going.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   And then there was one feature in the past few months that I'd really wanted to
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.280]   try to get working in Gmail.
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   And it didn't, and it was that I wanted to be able to see all the emails that
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.600]   have come from a person so that I kind of could go back quickly and get the
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.640]   context of all the conversations I've had.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.280]   You know, I get emails from listeners all the time, you guys, and I want to make
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.520]   sure that I know that we've already talked about this thing and you know,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.680]   there's just a lot of email.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.160]   And so Gmail actually had a feature that made this possible, but it didn't work
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   with aliases.
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:31.440]   So if someone emailed me at chris@allthehacks.com, it wouldn't find it
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.800]   because it was only looking at my core Gmail account.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.680]   So when I saw superhuman had that feature, I was like, okay, let's just give
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.240]   it a try.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.200]   And I can't believe I waited this long.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:42.320]   It's really changed the way I use email.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.480]   It's so fast.
[00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.400]   It's so efficient.
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.480]   The UI is great.
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.240]   I can't endorse it enough.
[00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.960]   A few of the things that I love.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.160]   So you can use keyboard shortcuts for everything.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.240]   So they have this great instant intro feature that I'd always wished I had
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:59.920]   with Gmail, which I could just in one keyboard shortcut, take the person who
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:04.640]   sent the email, put them to BCC, add text with their first name automatically
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.360]   that says, thanks bill to BCC and moves the person that was CC'd into the to
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.920]   field.
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.320]   And you can immediately respond to an introduction.
[00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.120]   When you use undo send, it delays sending emails, but they have a send
[00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:18.200]   instantly shortcut.
[00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.160]   So when you actually want to get it out there, maybe you're testing something
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.600]   and you want to check it on another email.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.360]   You can do that.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.840]   It also pulls up social profiles of everyone that you're emailing.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:30.160]   So you can find them and learn a bit more about them, especially if it's an
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.640]   email from someone you don't know.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.000]   There are snippets, so you can come up with these pre-programmed pieces of text
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.440]   that you can throw into an email.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:43.480]   So I have one that is a common intro I make to people that I just pull up and
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:47.240]   it automatically fills in their name and the subject and the two and all that
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:47.840]   kind of stuff.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.120]   And CC's everything.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.120]   It's really great for sending outreach multiple times.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.800]   You can also just program a set of recipients.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.280]   So if there's like five people you email a lot, instead of typing in all five
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.640]   email addresses, you can just instantly have them all populate.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.680]   The mobile apps, good reminders are good.
[00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:05.160]   I mean, like it is so good.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.280]   I really think that you should check it out.
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:11.320]   You can get one month free at all the hacks.com/superhuman, but this is not a
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.800]   product I'm getting for free and telling you about that's awesome.
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.240]   I actually pay every month to use this product and I love it.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:19.920]   You can also use superhuman to actually schedule events right in email.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:24.600]   So if you say let's meet on Thursday, it pops up a little side calendar and shows
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:29.080]   you Thursday and you can go in and schedule an event and send the invite right away.
[00:07:29.080 --> 00:07:32.040]   You can even pull in all the people that are in the email thread and
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.240]   automatically add them.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.880]   Like I can't, if you use Gmail and you want it to be more efficient, or I
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.920]   actually think it works with Outlook, it's definitely worth checking out.
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.480]   Like I said, one month free, all the hacks.com/superhuman.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:46.040]   For scheduling, I love Calendly.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.440]   I've used it for years.
[00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:51.360]   Nick Gray, who I had on to talk about cocktail parties actually has a post on
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.560]   his site that I loved that went into all the details of how he set up his Calendly
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.200]   to both be a little bit more friendly.
[00:07:57.200 --> 00:07:58.720]   I'll link to that in the show notes.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:02.240]   And one thing I know there's a lot of talk about, it's like, Oh, just assume
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.680]   someone else has to put time on my calendar.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:08.360]   So, you know, I do try to say, feel free to send some times that work for you.
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.880]   Or if it's easier, you can pick something on my calendar.
[00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.800]   I'm not just assuming that everyone needs to operate around my schedule, but
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   that line of text of giving someone that option, that's a snippet I have in
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.440]   superhuman.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.560]   So anytime I'm scheduling something, boom, click a keyboard shortcut and instantly
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.360]   that gets thrown into the email.
[00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.200]   Let's see what else as for where I store information.
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:30.840]   So I use the same things a lot of you use.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:33.880]   For some reason I use Dropbox, Google drive and iCloud.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:38.120]   I think because iCloud for me is where I put all my photos.
[00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:39.720]   I use the photos app on my phone.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:43.000]   I use the photos app on my computer and I store lots of videos.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.200]   I've even taken old VHS tapes of my childhood, converted them to videos on my
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.080]   computer and put them into my iCloud library.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.480]   So everything's in there.
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:56.920]   I was approaching the cap of, you know, two terabytes at one point.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:59.560]   So I was like, well, I'm not going to use that for everything else.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.120]   So then Google drive is where I actually back things up.
[00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:05.760]   So stuff that's way bigger than that.
[00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:09.800]   So if I have some really big files that I need to back up that are really just
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   random things or backups of old computers, I put that there.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.040]   And then obviously I use Google docs for so much document writing.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.880]   It's really replaced office for almost everything I do.
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:25.400]   I think I might from time to time use Excel just for like a local scratch pad,
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:30.600]   but I don't think I've used Word or PowerPoint for really a long time.
[00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:32.920]   And I use Dropbox for storing lots of files.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.480]   For the most part, it's where I store everything for all the hacks,
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.960]   all the audio files from the interviews, the video files from the interviews,
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:43.600]   the photos from guests that I upload to be the cover art, all that stuff goes there.
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:45.520]   But I also use it for personal stuff.
[00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:50.640]   Amy and I have a shared folder and in there you can find everything from like
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:55.680]   our old credit card statements if we wanted to keep them somewhere to health
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:00.080]   records, dog records, things that are like PDFs that I want to put somewhere.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.760]   Mortgage closing statements where there's tons and tons of documents there
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.720]   that you don't know if you'll need, but you want to put them somewhere.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.040]   I just throw it in Dropbox.
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.800]   It's not the most organized, but for the most part, the reason I have Dropbox
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.760]   is that I use it for everything, all the hacks I could put clips for an episode
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:18.480]   that I can share to a guest and everything goes in there.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:22.920]   But the big place that I'm storing almost everything these days is in Notion.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:27.280]   So it's basically become my second brain for two big projects.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.760]   One, my family, and one, the podcast.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:35.880]   And so for the family, there's an entire Notion board for our family where Amy
[00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   and I do everything from planning an upcoming trip, organizing tables of
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:43.960]   info, where we're looking for a dog walker, an au pair, and we create a table.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:44.520]   And we put it there.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.560]   We made a table of all the classes that our daughter could take dance
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.720]   classes or swim classes.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.360]   Where are they?
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:50.920]   What are they?
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:51.880]   How much do they cost?
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.560]   We just organize it all in one place so we can share it.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.360]   We can comment.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.840]   We save resources there.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.680]   So when we were starting out with solid foods for Quinn, we thought, okay, let's
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:05.160]   share some links to some great meal plans and guides on how to handle that
[00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:05.960]   circumstance.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.320]   We even have a page where we write down all the questions to ask our pediatrician
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.440]   at the next appointment so that when we go to that appointment, we just know
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   exactly where to pull up the list of questions.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.040]   We put check boxes on them so we can run through them.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.560]   It all works really easily.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:24.360]   For all the hacks, I have so much information in Notion.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:29.000]   It's like every episode, the plan for that episode, every guest, when they're
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.800]   going to appear, who are my partners and sponsors for the show?
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.320]   What episodes are they on?
[00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:36.800]   What topics do I want to write about in the newsletter?
[00:11:36.800 --> 00:11:39.320]   What shows do I want to do cross promotions with?
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:39.960]   Everything.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:43.080]   I track all the income and the expenses for the show.
[00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:44.400]   Really everything is in here.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.280]   When you guys share hacks with me, all these great listener hacks, I
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.960]   put those into Notion as well.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:52.640]   It's really become like my second brain for any big, big thing.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:55.360]   That's lots of information of different types, right?
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.480]   If it was just files, maybe I could put in Dropbox.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:00.040]   If it just fits in a Google doc, it could just go there.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.400]   But when it's a lot of stuff I want to connect and reference and jump between
[00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.080]   and put in tables and sort, Notion does some really cool stuff like a table of
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:12.680]   episodes that also references a table of partners or also references a table of
[00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:18.480]   guests, it's like a database, but in just a much more intuitive UI for the average.
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:21.640]   Getting the crew together.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.240]   Isn't as easy as it used to be.
[00:12:23.240 --> 00:12:23.960]   I get it.
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:28.200]   Life comes at you fast, but trust me, your friends are probably
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.520]   desperate for a good hang.
[00:12:29.520 --> 00:12:33.600]   So kick 2024 off right by finally hosting that event.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.760]   Just make sure you do it the easy way and let our sponsor Drizzly, the go-to app
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.040]   for drink delivery, take care of the supplies.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:44.080]   All you need to come up with is the excuse to get together.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.920]   It doesn't even have to be a good one.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.320]   It could be your dog's birthday that the sun finally came out, or maybe you just
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.720]   want to celebrate that you got through another week with Drizzly.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.200]   You can make hosting easy by taking the drink run off your to-do list, which means
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:02.400]   you can entice your friends to leave their houses without ever leaving yours.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:06.320]   And since I know you like a good deal, Drizzly compares prices on their massive
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:09.560]   selection of beer, wine, and spirits across multiple stores.
[00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:12.920]   So when I really wanted to make a few cocktails while we were hosting family
[00:13:12.920 --> 00:13:17.520]   last week, not only could I get an Italian Amaro delivered in less than an hour, but
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.600]   I found it for $15 less than my local liquor store.
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   So whatever the occasion, download the Drizzly app or go to drizzly.com.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:29.520]   That's D-R-I-Z-L-Y.com today.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.880]   Must be 21 plus, not available in all locations.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:36.800]   When it comes to just finding all of this stuff and just operating
[00:13:36.800 --> 00:13:40.840]   efficiently on my computer, I also love an app that I've talked
[00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:42.320]   about in the past called Alfred.
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:47.480]   So if you're a Mac user, you probably know that you can hit command space bar and
[00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:51.640]   pull up a place where you can just type and search for a file or go to a website.
[00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:55.640]   Well, Alfred is like that, but supercharged.
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:58.720]   So you can load all kinds of stuff into it.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.920]   I have an emoji library, so I can keyboard shortcut my way to whatever emoji.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.360]   I use it as a calculator.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:05.720]   I use it to find files.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:08.240]   I use it to create custom workflows.
[00:14:08.240 --> 00:14:10.760]   So if there's something I need to do where I'm, you know,
[00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:12.680]   I have a set of keyboard commands.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.320]   For example, I want to like remove a signature and replace it with something.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.680]   I can just create a workflow and run it with one shortcut.
[00:14:20.680 --> 00:14:25.000]   But the best feature that saves me so much time is that Alfred stores
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.680]   my entire clipboard history.
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.360]   Whether it's images that I've screen grabbed or whether it's just text
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.160]   I've copied so I can quickly go back.
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.520]   So sometimes I want to grab a few lines from one email and move it to another.
[00:14:36.520 --> 00:14:41.600]   I can copy each one individually, go into this next email and paste each
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:45.680]   one individually just by browsing the history all from my keyboard and not
[00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:47.840]   have to jump back and forth between the docks.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:50.280]   I use Alfred at least a hundred times a day.
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:52.680]   It's got to be the most used app on my computer.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:54.320]   I think it's fantastic.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.120]   Another keyboard shortcut one is an app called Rectangle.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.200]   It just moves stuff around the desktop.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:02.920]   If I want to move things to the left side, to the right side, because
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:04.520]   I often have two windows going.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:08.200]   If I want to jump it to full screen, if I want to just make it really small
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.880]   in the corner, like a website I want to monitor or just something to keep small.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.240]   I can just do that.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:16.280]   It makes it so easy to move stuff around quickly.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:18.640]   I find that if you pause and you're dragging your mouse or your
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.800]   trackpad around, it just distracts me.
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:23.400]   So if I could just get it out of the way quickly, I love it.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.080]   And then I'll talk a little bit about Chrome because as much as I know that
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:31.880]   Safari is supposed to be the fastest browser and I love efficiency, there
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:36.240]   are just a lot of extensions that make Chrome such a great browser
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.120]   that ends up being my primary.
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:42.240]   So a few of the things I use, I've talked about a couple of these in the past.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.280]   One is called library extension.
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.680]   Anytime you're browsing Amazon, if there's a book available for free at
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.840]   your public library, it'll tell you another one.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:53.560]   If you have a capital one card, which I love is their Eno extension.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.040]   And it basically lets you create virtual cards for any retailers for free.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:02.000]   So unlike privacy where you don't get points because you have to pay with
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.200]   your debit card or a bank ACH, this will let you generate unique card numbers
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:12.040]   that are one-time use or specific to a merchant with your venture or venture X
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:12.400]   card.
[00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:16.320]   So if you don't have a venture card or a venture X card, obviously I'd appreciate
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.880]   you using the links at allthehacks.com/cards.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:20.240]   I love that card.
[00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:24.680]   And I love the fact that this can generate unique card numbers that you
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.760]   can turn off after you make a purchase.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:28.560]   I love the Lucia extension.
[00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:31.640]   If I'm on LinkedIn and I'm trying to get someone's email, it'll just
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:33.480]   auto pull in an email for you.
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.680]   I also love tab to window pop-up.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:37.640]   I know it's a little bit weird.
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:40.280]   I'm going to link to all these in the show notes, but basically if you're
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.840]   browsing around in Chrome, sometimes you want to look at two tabs at once.
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.280]   This extension lets you use a keyboard shortcut to take the tab out of the
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.520]   current window into a separate one, and then you can use rectangle to kind of
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:53.440]   make sure they're all organized the way you want.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:55.280]   I also love don't fuck with paste.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:58.640]   If you've ever been on one of those websites where they ask you to put in
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.720]   your bank routing number or something, and they don't allow paste on their
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.560]   website, this extension disables that and lets you paste into those fields.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:10.760]   I know they're doing it so that you don't maybe copy and paste the
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.680]   wrong ACH or routing number.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:16.880]   But for me, I actually think I'm much more likely to mess things up if I have
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.040]   to manually type the number.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:19.080]   So I love that one.
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.120]   I also love the card pointers extension.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:22.840]   I've mentioned card pointers in the past.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.720]   It's a free app that helps you manage all of your credit cards and makes it
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:29.480]   easy to find the right card to maximize your category bonuses on everyday
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:30.280]   purchases.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.840]   They also track all the credits and offers your cards eligible for.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:37.040]   They do all this on their iOS and Android app, but the Chrome extension
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.720]   will let you know the best card to use, as well as whether there are any offers,
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.880]   deals, or credits you can use on whatever site you're browsing.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:48.520]   And if you want to try Card Pointers Pro, you can get a free trial and 20% off at
[00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.600]   all the hacks.com/cardpointers.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.600]   Right now, they're also offering a $100 savings card with a $96 lifetime
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.640]   membership, which makes it effectively free.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.920]   The only other one I'll mention is Keepa and it tracks all the Amazon price history.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:06.360]   So if I'm looking at a product on Amazon, I love being able to go see like, is this
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:09.800]   the lowest it's been in the last few months or is it the most expensive it's been?
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:12.160]   Oh, and actually there's one more one tab.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.160]   If you're ever doing some kind of research and you pull up like 15 tabs to try to do
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.040]   something, and then you're not ready to do anything with it, one tab lets you click
[00:18:20.040 --> 00:18:23.320]   one button and it takes all those tabs and it just saves them.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.280]   So later you can bring them back, but you don't have to keep them open.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.160]   You don't have to keep them distracting you.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.640]   I really like that extension too.
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.640]   A few other apps that I want to share, I think most of them are cross platform.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:36.440]   So whether you're Mac or PC user.
[00:18:36.440 --> 00:18:40.520]   So once we had our first kid, we used a baby monitor called Nanit.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:44.480]   And I was always frustrated that if I wanted to watch our daughter and see how
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.120]   things were going and see if she needed anything, I'd have to keep my phone open.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:52.120]   And I really wanted to just be able to monitor the video feed on my computer,
[00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:54.760]   but they didn't have an app for the computer.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:56.160]   They couldn't load the video on the web.
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:01.040]   And so I was really into this app called BlueStacks and it would let you basically
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:03.080]   run an Android emulator on your computer.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.360]   So first off, if there's any mobile apps that you just wish you could run on your
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.080]   computer for whatever reason, they don't have a web app, BlueStacks was fantastic.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:13.280]   And I could run all these Android apps and it was great.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:18.840]   Then what happened was BlueStacks stopped supporting the M1 or M2 Apple processors.
[00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:20.200]   And I was like, ah, I need to find an answer.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.040]   I need to find an answer.
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:24.560]   Well, what I didn't know, and maybe everyone listening knows, but I didn't.
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:31.080]   The M1 and M2 processors for Mac natively support iOS apps on the computer.
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.720]   So now instead of having to run some third party app, I actually just
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.520]   opened the app store, searched for Nanit, and I could open and install
[00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:41.800]   and run iPhone and iPad apps on my Mac.
[00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:45.920]   So now I can control the camera from my computer and a few other things.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.800]   But if you don't have an M1 or an M2 Mac and you want to pull the Android app up,
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:51.920]   BlueStacks was great.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:55.520]   There are a handful of other Android emulators you could also use, but that
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:58.840]   hack was really great for me back before I got a new computer.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.480]   When it comes to managing food and recipes and groceries,
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.240]   I love the app Paprika.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.600]   It's cross-platform.
[00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.840]   It's not cheap, but it's so good.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.320]   And so every time I'm on the web and I want to clip a recipe, my wife
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.200]   and I, we both save it to Paprika.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.440]   We use the app for organizing what we're going to cook this week.
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:19.920]   And then you can take all the things that you're going to cook this week
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.360]   and throw it into a grocery list.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.160]   You can go through that grocery list when you're in the grocery store.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:27.600]   It auto sorts it by kind of aisle, check things off.
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.400]   My wife can add them to the list from home, or if we're in the grocery
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.360]   store splitting up, as one of us check something off, the other one
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:36.080]   sees it checked off in real time.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:40.040]   It's just a really simple, beautiful interface for managing recipes,
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.840]   meal planning, grocery shopping.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:42.640]   I love it.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:47.240]   And then last one's a one that I imagine most people use, but I think
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.200]   it's really great is 1Password.
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:53.320]   So we're going to do an episode in the near future about security and how
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:57.240]   to think about all of the things from identity theft to online protection
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:00.840]   to two-factor authentication, but 1Password is kind of the
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:03.280]   cornerstone of all of that for me.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:05.480]   I put all my passwords there.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:08.680]   I use it to make sure all my passwords are strong and unique.
[00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.840]   I use it in lieu of Google Authenticator.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:15.520]   So I actually store my two-factor codes in 1Password.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:19.200]   I use it to store secure things like my known traveler number and
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.960]   just stuff that I would need to grab.
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:23.880]   The browser extension makes it easy to grab at any time.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.000]   It works on mobile.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.160]   On iOS and Android, you can kind of set up a replacement keyboard so
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.080]   you can auto put in your passwords.
[00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:34.760]   I know Apple has their own kind of built-in thing, but I just
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.040]   think 1Password is better.
[00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:39.520]   And I know whatever the best deal that they're offering right now, you can
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:42.120]   get at allthehacks.com/1password.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.960]   It's just a great app.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.920]   And for something like security and passwords, it's not a place where
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.480]   I'm excited about trying to get the free thing instead of the better thing.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:55.800]   I signed up for it for a family account, made sure my parents got on it, made
[00:21:55.800 --> 00:21:58.040]   sure everyone in the family was using it.
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:02.880]   And it's just been a really big lifesaver for all of us to be able
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.720]   to really efficiently manage things.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.600]   My wife and I actually have a shared vault.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:10.160]   So for a lot of things like passwords, we want to be able to log into each
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.800]   other's bank accounts or different things.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:15.760]   We just keep them in a shared vault so we can each access them
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.680]   and we update things accordingly.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.000]   So 1Password is another really awesome one that I love.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.480]   I know there's LastPass.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.560]   I know there's Dashlane.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.320]   I know there are other password managers.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.360]   I'm not saying 1Password is always for everyone the best thing.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:29.880]   But for me, I love it.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:32.800]   I've been using it for, it seems like at least a decade.
[00:22:32.800 --> 00:22:34.560]   And I think it's fantastic.
[00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.040]   So let's change gears a little bit.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.680]   I think part of productivity in life and the things we use aren't always software.
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:45.440]   So I want to talk about some of the gear I use for the podcast, for my life, for
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.760]   using technology around the house, just to make life better.
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.600]   So I'll just start right now.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:55.480]   I'm talking to you on a real microphone, not the one built into my computer.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:56.760]   I have 2.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.800]   The one I started with, and that I recommend almost anyone who's
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:03.320]   recording any audio really get, because it's not that expensive,
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:07.000]   is the Audio-Technica ATR2100X.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.120]   It's about $100.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   It's a USB and XLR mic.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.760]   So USB, you could just plug into your computer.
[00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:18.920]   XLR, you could actually use it with an audio interface and other
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.200]   circumstances if you're recording professionally, but the
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:23.960]   quality of the mic is so good.
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:28.040]   And I remember as soon as I first got it, I was joining meetings for work remote,
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:33.320]   as we are doing nowadays, and everyone was like, "God, your audio sounds so good.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.600]   Oh man, I just want to hear you just say something."
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:36.840]   And so I thought it was so easy.
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:39.520]   In fact, a couple of my colleagues actually bought the microphone after
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.640]   hearing it because they're like, "Oh, I just want to sound good like that."
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.080]   I have since upgraded to a mic that, I don't know, I don't even
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.320]   know if it's noticeably better.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:47.720]   You guys listening can tell me.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.200]   I upgraded about six or seven months ago.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.960]   So the first maybe 20 episodes are on the old mic to a Shure SM7B.
[00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:59.280]   I would say this is only if you really want to commit to audio because that
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.160]   mic routes through a device called a Cloudlifter, routes through a
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.880]   device called an audio interface.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:05.120]   That plugs into my computer.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.040]   It's a lot of work.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:09.480]   I personally think the audio quality is a little bit better, but if
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.960]   you're not making a podcast, I wouldn't stress it too much.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.400]   You could use the computer mic.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:18.040]   Apple mics are pretty good, but I think the ATR2100X is a really good mic
[00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:20.240]   if you want to sound better, definitely check that out.
[00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.880]   For listening, I think the Apple AirPods might be one of the best
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.360]   products created in the last decade.
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:30.840]   My only knock on them is that if you use them a lot, the battery dies.
[00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:34.640]   And I now probably have three or four pairs of AirPods around the house.
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:38.160]   And most of them only have an hour or so battery life, but they're
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:41.840]   just good enough that I keep buying them because they make life so easy.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:43.760]   They're not studio quality headphones.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.760]   When I'm recording the podcast, I use Audio Technica M50Xs.
[00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.400]   I really think they're great headphones.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:51.360]   I tried a bunch.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:53.360]   So, you know, that was my take.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.800]   I'm not an audio engineer though.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.440]   I'm sure someone here listening is, and they have a better recommendation,
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.800]   but for me, those are my over ear headphones for just kind of working
[00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.520]   on the podcast, listening to high quality audio, everything else is
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:10.960]   AirPods, unless I'm on a long flight and I bring some over the ear noise
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:14.120]   canceling, Bose, quiet comfort headphones.
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.040]   Those are also fantastic for travel.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.080]   I also think video is important.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:23.840]   So honestly, just the Logitech C900 series cameras are great.
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.200]   I use it for almost everything except recording video for the podcast.
[00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:30.600]   I think I have a C920 and a C930.
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:32.160]   One is on Amy's computer.
[00:25:32.160 --> 00:25:32.920]   One's on mine.
[00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:34.400]   Lighting is really important.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:38.120]   I bought an Elgato ring light, which is probably way overkill
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:43.400]   for the average use case, but it's so great that you can control the light,
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.520]   the brightness, the color, everything, the color temperature from your computer
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.520]   without having to go press buttons.
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:51.160]   If you're recording a podcast, great.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:55.280]   If not, there are a ton of really, really affordable, cheap lights that I
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.920]   think boost the quality of video a lot.
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:01.040]   I had a Lume Cube before that, and I think it's great.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.960]   I still use it when I'm traveling because I'm not going to bring
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:06.640]   this giant light with me anywhere.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.000]   The other big upgrade I made, and this is really like if you're giving
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.280]   a ton of presentations, maybe it's worth it.
[00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.120]   I've had a few listeners reach out, so I'm going to share.
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:19.160]   But again, I think it's overkill for most people, but I actually bought a
[00:26:19.160 --> 00:26:22.040]   teleprompter for recording the podcast.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.840]   And that might seem like overkill, but it actually turns out
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:27.440]   teleprompters are not that expensive.
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:32.240]   The one I bought was under a hundred dollars, and I put an iPad under it,
[00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:36.200]   which I already owned, and there's this great app called Duet Display.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:40.160]   And with a lightning cable between your computer and your iPad, you can actually
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:41.960]   turn your iPad into a second screen.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:45.480]   So on one hand, it's great if you just are someone who wants to have that
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:49.040]   second screen so you can work on two screens from a laptop and not need a
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.800]   monitor, but they can also mirror the screen.
[00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:55.160]   So I actually use the iPad with a teleprompter and I put the
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.640]   camera behind the teleprompter.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.800]   So when I'm doing an interview with someone, I can have some notes and I
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:04.920]   can see their face while I'm looking right at the camera, it's not offset.
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:09.280]   Way overkill for most people, but because some people have emailed and asked, I
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:14.360]   thought I would share behind the teleprompter for me, I have my nice full
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:20.520]   frame Sony A7C, it's definitely overkill for a webcam, but it's really great.
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:22.360]   And I use that when we're traveling as well.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:27.640]   So I get a dual benefit there and Elgato makes a product called the Cam Link 4K,
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:32.320]   which lets you take an external nice camera and turn it into a webcam.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:37.160]   So that's my computer setup, but I think one thing that is important
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:39.880]   for anyone online is Wi-Fi reliability.
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:44.000]   I upgraded recently when we moved to a UniFi system.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.720]   I used to have a Netgear Orbi Wi-Fi system around the house and it was pretty
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:53.440]   good, but when we moved, I took the time to really upgrade to something that I'd
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:57.680]   used in our office at my startup, that Wealthfront used in their office, and
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:02.920]   it's the UniFi Wi-Fi system and it's been incredible, I don't think I've had
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:05.200]   a reboot or router in the last 18 months.
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.160]   Everything's been super fast.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:11.480]   It's not the cheapest platform, but it's also not crazy expensive.
[00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.280]   I think each access point, I bought about half of them used on Nextdoor
[00:28:15.280 --> 00:28:18.560]   and Facebook Marketplace, so you can go that route for a little bit less.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:20.240]   And we put them around the house.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:22.280]   I think each access point is less than a hundred dollars.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:24.120]   And so we have a handful of those around the house.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:27.000]   They all route to this device called a Dream Machine Pro.
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:34.000]   And we bought some UniFi cameras, which we use instead of Nest cameras or Ring
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.880]   cameras around the house, because I like that it's all local, so all the cameras
[00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:43.000]   get stored on a hard drive on the Dream Machine Pro, so I'm not constantly
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:47.560]   using my bandwidth to upload feeds from the cameras we have around our house.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:49.360]   And by around our house, I mean outside our house.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.160]   We don't keep any cameras inside the house.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.840]   As for getting in and out of the house, I love August locks.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:55.960]   They make things so easy.
[00:28:55.960 --> 00:28:59.760]   I don't think I've carried a key for our house around forever,
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:01.520]   like for the last five or seven years.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:03.720]   I can't remember how long ago we first got August locks.
[00:29:03.720 --> 00:29:05.000]   I love those.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.200]   We finally added a ring security system to this house.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:11.280]   I used to try to use this hardware system.
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.640]   I can't even remember what it was called.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:18.480]   And it was like the DIY process of wiring in your old wired alarm system
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.720]   to this circuit board that you can put into smart things and pay this service.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:25.960]   And yes, I might have saved a few dollars, but it was just a mess
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.120]   of tinkering with stuff. Ring is great.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.320]   It's super simple.
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:33.040]   If your house is already wired for something else, they have a version
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:36.480]   that you can just use the hardwired system you already have and bring it on ring.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:38.840]   That's what we do for security.
[00:29:38.840 --> 00:29:42.240]   The only other two things I think I'd add, they're not going to be shockers, right?
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.840]   Like I love Sonos and we have Sonos around the house.
[00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:46.960]   I think that's not a surprise.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:50.600]   And then the last piece of gear productivity tip trick
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:53.760]   that I'll share is I really love my aura ring.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:55.800]   I wear my aura ring every day.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:57.280]   I track my sleep with it.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:29:58.640]   I track workouts with it.
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:30:01.160]   The Gen three ring tracks your heart rate variability
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.800]   and the oxygen levels in your blood.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.760]   I think it's such a good product.
[00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:07.560]   Like I know I've said that, but like this whole episode is me sharing the things
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:08.800]   that I think are really good products.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:10.960]   But I really love the aura ring.
[00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:13.720]   I can get a really good sense of how sleep is going.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.080]   I can if I am drinking one night and I look the next morning, I'm like,
[00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:21.640]   oh, that makes sense, and it's actually led me to want to drink less
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.080]   because I really like waking up refreshed.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:29.040]   I know some people don't love the anxiety of feeling rested
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:30.160]   and finding out they weren't.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.840]   But for me, I love being able to try to see how different amounts of sleep,
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:38.160]   different bedtimes, different exercise routines, different foods
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:41.760]   kind of contribute to the quality of my sleep and try to really dial it in.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:45.520]   So it's really high because I think in order to operate at a high level,
[00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:47.840]   you really need sleep and it's really important.
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.120]   So definitely check out the aura ring.

[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:59.840]   All right. I think that's it.
