[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.320]   We end the week, Pastor John,
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.040]   with a topic that dawned on me recently, not long ago.
[00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.720]   I was editing a powerful sermon clip
[00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.960]   taken from your sermon series
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.660]   in Romans 7, verses 14 to 25.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.280]   Applying what it means to be a Christian
[00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.840]   who lives with disordered desires in our hearts.
[00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.720]   It was a sermon clip sent to us from a woman in Greece
[00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.640]   who struggled for years with an eating disorder,
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.720]   who chose to open up and tell others about her sin
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.680]   only after having heard your pastoral conclusion
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.860]   to sermon number five.
[00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.180]   I believe it was.
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.320]   It's an amazing clip and a powerful listener testimony
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.440]   that we published about a month ago in APJ 1751.
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.960]   But when I researched that clip
[00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.040]   and set it up for the podcast,
[00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.720]   I noticed we've never entered into the debate
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.560]   over Romans 7 here on the podcast.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.600]   Is this the struggle of Christian Paul,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.800]   or is it the struggle of pre-Christian Saul?
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.320]   Several times here in the podcast,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.360]   you've said it's a believer struggle,
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.360]   like in APJs 802, 1183, 1438, et cetera.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.220]   And then you built from this stated conclusion,
[00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:04.180]   but you've never defended that position in APJ,
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.540]   and I'd love to hear you do so.
[00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.820]   How would you frame the disagreement?
[00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.060]   And why do you land on the side of Romans 7
[00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.140]   describing the believer's struggle?
[00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.460]   The disagreement about Romans 7, 14 to 25
[00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.640]   is whether Paul is describing some dimension
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.900]   of his Christian experience,
[00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.900]   or whether he's describing his pre-Christian experience
[00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.180]   of defeat as he tried to keep the law,
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.180]   and he's describing it now
[00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.220]   from his perspective as a Christian.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.220]   Now, my view is that Romans 7, 14, 25
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.580]   is a description of the kind of experiences
[00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.740]   Paul often had as a Christian,
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.820]   and that we often have.
[00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.260]   And I say often had,
[00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.780]   because I don't want to give the impression
[00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.900]   that those verses describe the totality
[00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.420]   of Christian experience.
[00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.500]   Now, this disagreement among really good friends, right?
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.900]   Yeah, oh yeah, totally.
[00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.580]   You and I could name really good friends
[00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.900]   that just don't see eye to eye on this,
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.860]   and I love those brothers.
[00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.940]   I don't consider this disagreement
[00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.260]   as a ground for any kind of breaking
[00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.820]   of a relationship or a fellowship.
[00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:27.580]   The disagreement exists because on the one hand,
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.220]   Paul says, "I delight in the law of God in my inner being,"
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.380]   my inner being,
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.380]   and he says, "I my very self serve the law of God
[00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.760]   "with my mind,"
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.340]   which it is hard to imagine
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.980]   as a description of pre-Christian Paul.
[00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.220]   That's my opinion.
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.180]   It's very hard to imagine that.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.380]   On the other hand, he says, "I am of the flesh,
[00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.460]   "sold under sin,"
[00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:04.460]   or, "I do the very thing I hate," and so on.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:09.900]   Would a Christian, my disagreeing brother would ask,
[00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.740]   say that?
[00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.260]   Would the Christian Paul describe himself that way,
[00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.460]   sold under sin?
[00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.100]   So there's the problem.
[00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.660]   And here are my nine, I'm gonna give nine reasons,
[00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.300]   and I unpack these in what?
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.660]   How many sermons did I preach on that?
[00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.260]   Six, five, I can't remember on Romans--
[00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.540]   - At least five, yeah. - Seven.
[00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.540]   Nine reasons for thinking these are Paul's description
[00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.720]   of his present experience from time to time,
[00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:44.380]   though not his total Christian experience.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:49.020]   Number one, the most natural way to understand Paul's use
[00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.020]   of the first person I and the present tense
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.820]   is that he's talking about himself
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:59.980]   and part of his life now as a believer.
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.980]   He uses I or me or my about 40 times in this text,
[00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:10.300]   and he explains his situation in the present tense
[00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.100]   all the way through.
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.500]   I am of flesh.
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.980]   What I am doing, I do not understand.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.980]   I do the very thing I do not want, and so on, present tense.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:26.100]   On the face of it then, it looks like he's describing
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:29.020]   his present Christian experience.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.340]   So for the average person like me,
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.260]   it's gonna take a lot to say,
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:35.860]   no, that's not what is happening.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:40.860]   Number two, Paul speaks about the law of God in this passage
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.200]   in a way that sounds like the way a Christian believer
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.180]   would talk about it, not the way an unregenerate Jewish man
[00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.280]   would talk about it.
[00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:55.280]   Verse 22, I joyfully concur with the law of God
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.460]   in the inner man.
[00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.640]   Now it's this phrase in the inner man
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.700]   that sounds so much like the way Paul talks
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.380]   as a Christian about the Christian's real inner self.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.460]   I don't think Paul would have said this
[00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:14.140]   about his pre-Christian self.
[00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.480]   Number three, the description of Romans 7
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.220]   of Paul as a divided and sometimes tormented man
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.980]   in relation to the law doesn't fit
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:29.140]   with the way he describes his experience
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.420]   before he was a Christian.
[00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:36.760]   In his pre-Christian days, he is anything but a man
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.540]   who is torn because of any perceived failures
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:42.820]   to live up to the law of God.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.900]   In Galatians 1, Philippians 3, he describes himself
[00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.900]   as undivided zeal for the law.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.820]   So the Romans 7 Paul doesn't fit
[00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.620]   with the way he described his pre-Christian experience.
[00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.620]   Number four, I think Paul talks about himself
[00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.140]   in Romans 7 in a way that only a Christian could,
[00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:11.140]   a person with faith and with the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.820]   For example, he says in Romans 7, 18,
[00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.740]   for I know that no good thing dwells in me,
[00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.660]   and then he qualifies it, that is in my flesh.
[00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.140]   Now, if Paul is here giving a Christian assessment
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.060]   of his pre-Christian experience, why?
[00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.100]   Why does he add to the statement,
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.060]   there's no good thing in me, the qualifier,
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:40.580]   that is in my flesh?
[00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:42.500]   I think in Paul's view,
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.140]   the pre-Christian person is only flesh.
[00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:51.140]   Only a Christian is more than fallen flesh.
[00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.700]   He has the Holy Spirit, and that's why Paul has to say
[00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:58.180]   that qualifier, that is in my flesh,
[00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.900]   there is a good thing in me, namely the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:04.300]   So he's not talking about the pre-Christian Paul, I think.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.820]   Number five, in Galatians 5, 17,
[00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.100]   Paul uses language very close to Romans 7,
[00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.700]   but everyone agrees that in Galatians,
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.300]   it's a description of Christian experience.
[00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.500]   He says in verse 17, the flesh sets its desire
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.100]   against the spirit, the spirit against the flesh,
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:26.180]   for these are in opposition to one another,
[00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.060]   so that, and now comes the phrase
[00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:31.540]   that sounds just like Romans 7, almost the same language,
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:36.540]   so that you may not do the things that you please.
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.660]   This is a description of the inner conflict
[00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.580]   of the Christian, and the language is so similar
[00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.060]   to Romans 7, I do what I don't want to do,
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.340]   I don't do what I want to do, that I conclude
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.820]   Romans 7 is also Christian experience like Galatians 5.
[00:07:54.820 --> 00:07:58.340]   My sixth argument is an answer
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.020]   to the strongest argument against my view,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:02.940]   at least that's what some say it is.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:05.900]   In Romans 7, 14, Paul says,
[00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:10.900]   I am of flesh sold under sin.
[00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:17.140]   And my friends would say, would Paul really say, Piper,
[00:08:17.140 --> 00:08:21.140]   of a Christian that he's sold under sin?
[00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:27.620]   The imagery is of being sold as a slave.
[00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:29.500]   Can a Christian ever say,
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:33.660]   I am sold under the slave master of sin?
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:38.660]   After all, Romans 6, 18 says, having been freed from sin,
[00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.660]   you became slaves of righteousness.
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.700]   Now my response is, I don't think Paul is saying
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:50.700]   the Christian lives under sin as a normal way of life,
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.540]   continually dominated and defeated by sin,
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:00.700]   but that in the moment of failure,
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:05.100]   sin gets the upper hand like a slave master
[00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:07.500]   temporarily getting control of a person
[00:09:07.500 --> 00:09:10.700]   who's not really his, and I think this
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:15.700]   because both in Romans 6, 12 and Galatians 5, 1,
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:20.180]   Paul warns Christians, warns Christians
[00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:24.940]   precisely not to submit again to the reign
[00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:27.340]   or to the yoke of slavery.
[00:09:27.340 --> 00:09:32.940]   It's a real possibility that Christians can see themselves
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:36.420]   as temporarily sold under sins.
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:41.100]   I don't think that is a decisive counter argument.
[00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:46.100]   Number seven, a response to the objection from Romans 7, 24.
[00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:52.020]   Can a real Christian cry out,
[00:09:52.020 --> 00:09:57.980]   who will set me free from the body of this death?
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:04.300]   To which my response is, can a real Christian not cry out,
[00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:08.100]   who will set me free from this body of death?
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:13.100]   The body is not only diseased and dying and groaning,
[00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:18.380]   according to Romans 8, it is also the staging ground
[00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.260]   for many evil desires, Paul says.
[00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:24.660]   It is regularly the base of operations for sin.
[00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:30.660]   The unbeliever does not cry out for release from this.
[00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:32.220]   He doesn't.
[00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.420]   He is at home in it.
[00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.300]   This is a Christian cry.
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:44.060]   My eighth argument is the way others use Romans 8, 2.
[00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.380]   This is, I think, very powerful.
[00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:52.660]   It says, for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:57.500]   has set you free from the law of sin and of death.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.860]   Now, some say that this is a clear declaration
[00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.460]   that the warfare of Romans 7 is over
[00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:10.460]   because of the phrase law of sin in 8, 2 is used in 7, 23.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:19.340]   The person in verse 23 is made, quote,
[00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:24.340]   "a prisoner of the law of sin, which is in my members."
[00:11:24.340 --> 00:11:27.980]   But now in Romans 8, 2,
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.980]   we are free from the law of sin and death.
[00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:36.380]   So people conclude the person in 7, 23
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:41.380]   cannot be a Christian because the Christian is Romans 8, 2,
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.080]   and he's free from that.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.980]   But I think, in view of all we've seen,
[00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:51.860]   and in view of the exhortations in Romans 6,
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.860]   that to say we are now in Christ set free
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:03.060]   from the law of sin does not at all preclude
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:06.440]   the reality that from time to time,
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.340]   the law of sin does indeed get the upper hand
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:14.380]   and must be repented of and renounced.
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:17.100]   There is a freedom from it,
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:21.500]   but not an absolute freedom from its influence
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.580]   that we can defeat with warfare in the spirit.
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.500]   And finally, number nine,
[00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:32.500]   Romans 7 seems to reach its climax in verse 25.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:36.820]   The first half of the verse goes like this.
[00:12:36.820 --> 00:12:40.900]   Thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:42.460]   In other words, who's gonna deliver me
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:45.380]   from this horrible situation that I've been in
[00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:49.180]   in describing in these verses in Romans 7?
[00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.360]   Answer, thanks be to God, through Jesus Christ our Lord.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.360]   This is often taken to mean that after all the failure
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:03.520]   of verses 14 to 25, Paul now arrives
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:06.900]   at a point of triumph and transition.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:10.180]   He is moving from the defeated pre-Christian experience
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:13.900]   of Romans 7 to the triumphant Christian experience
[00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.120]   of Romans 8.
[00:13:15.120 --> 00:13:20.760]   But if that's the way Paul is thinking,
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:26.880]   the second half of verse 25 is a colossal embarrassment
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:29.060]   and a stumbling block.
[00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:32.940]   Verse 25 closes like this,
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:35.980]   which doesn't at all fit this understanding
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:40.180]   of big transition from 7 to 8,
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:43.240]   with the fulcrum being the first half of verse 25.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:49.060]   Just when this view expects a triumphant statement
[00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.740]   about how the divided man is finally united in victory
[00:13:53.740 --> 00:13:56.740]   and beyond conflict and entirely under the sway
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:14:01.580]   of the spirit, what do you get in verse 25b,
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.460]   the second half of the verse?
[00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:07.220]   You get just what you would expect to get
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:12.220]   if Romans 7 is really about the frequent Christian experience
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:14.300]   of conflict and struggle.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:18.620]   You get a summary statement of the struggling
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:21.020]   and divided life.
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:22.760]   It goes like this.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:27.760]   So then, on the one hand, I myself, with my mind,
[00:14:29.460 --> 00:14:33.980]   am serving the law of God, but on the other hand,
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.260]   with my flesh, the law of sin.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:43.420]   What an anticlimax, if the intention is to say
[00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:48.420]   that there's this decisive break between 7 and 8.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.620]   So for these nine reasons, I think we should read Romans 7,
[00:14:55.300 --> 00:15:00.300]   14 to 25, as the description, not of the totality
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:07.300]   of Christian experience, but the kind of discouragements
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:12.300]   and conflicts and defeats we often encounter
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.620]   as we do battle with sin.
[00:15:14.620 --> 00:15:15.460]   - Yeah, very good.
[00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:16.460]   Thank you, Pastor John, for explaining it.
[00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.300]   Again, this episode was inspired by a sermon clip
[00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.140]   sent to us by a listener, a woman in Greece
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.900]   who struggled for years with an eating disorder
[00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.340]   who only chose up to open up and tell others about the sin
[00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:30.580]   after having heard the sermon clip we published a month ago.
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.920]   See APJ 1751 in the archive for the clip and for her story.
[00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:38.580]   You can find episode 1751 online
[00:15:38.580 --> 00:15:41.640]   at desiringgod.org/askpastorjohn.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.720]   Well, we break for the weekend and return next week
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:47.420]   to talk about embryo adoption.
[00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:50.860]   It's a topic you have all asked about a lot over the years,
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:53.340]   and it's one we have not addressed much on the podcast
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.180]   in our first decade.
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:57.660]   We need to get back to it, embryo adoption.
[00:15:57.660 --> 00:15:58.500]   That's up next time.
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:15:59.420]   I'm your host, Tony Reinhke,
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:01.420]   and we'll see you back here on Monday.
[00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:04.000]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:16:06.580 --> 00:16:16.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
