[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600]   Are you a big fan of outsourcing a lot of things to team members,
[00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.040]   assistants, that kind of stuff? How do you on the personal side,
[00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.480]   kind of manage your time and not get caught up in in kind of those small
[00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.240]   questions and focus on what's most important?
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.680]   This one, I've always been pretty good at. I think I read the four hour work week. I think
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.920]   I read that like way too early, almost. I was like, I shall outsource everything.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:25.840]   But I read that really early. And I've tried to live it. It's actually helped a ton. So I've had
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.680]   a VA since I made like my first 100K. The second I hit 100K, I was like, hire a virtual assistant.
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.280]   And now I have a few virtual assistants. And then I have an assistant that manages the first virtual
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.560]   assistants. And then I have sort of my chief of staff who all of them report into.
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.920]   The key though, I think, in delegation is realizing that you can only really have,
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.480]   in my opinion, five, max 10 people report to you directly.
