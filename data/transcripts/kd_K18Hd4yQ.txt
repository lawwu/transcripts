[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.640]   All right, moving on.
[00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.760]   We got a question from Don Quixote.
[00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.640]   Let's see what we have here.
[00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.920]   Hopefully this is appropriately literary,
[00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.560]   or I'll be disappointed.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.320]   How can I help myself to remember
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.960]   all of your best advice?
[00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.160]   Now, that is not appropriately literary.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.400]   There's no actual Don Quixote allusions in this question.
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.160]   I am disappointed.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.280]   But let's go farther here.
[00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.000]   There's an elaboration.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.500]   Hi, Cal.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.280]   I'm making some small improvements to my office space.
[00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.680]   I'd like to include a nice print that
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.520]   summarizes maybe your top 10 or 20 best pieces of advice
[00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.000]   for living the deep life, which in my opinion
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.640]   should be possible given your proclivity for summarizing
[00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.440]   your advice in easy to remember catchphrases.
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.760]   He then gives us an example, that poster you've probably
[00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.960]   all seen of everything I really need to know
[00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.560]   I learned in kindergarten.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.600]   And Jesse printed me out a copy of this poster,
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.480]   so we can look at it here.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.320]   Share everything.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.920]   Play fair.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.360]   Don't hit people.
[00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.920]   Put things back where you found them.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:06.960]   Clean up your own mess.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.480]   Don't take things you're not yours.
[00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.280]   I don't know.
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.080]   Let me just say, by the way, this kindergarten poster,
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.620]   I mean, this seems like good advice,
[00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.720]   but is this really everything you need to know?
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.320]   I mean, what about how to manage your finances
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.440]   or how to deal with major health problems?
[00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.240]   I don't see anything in here about dealing
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.120]   with the inevitable tragedy of the death of those around you
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.280]   who you know and love.
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.440]   I am going to disagree that everything you need to know
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:32.840]   you learned in kindergarten.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.120]   I call balderdash on that.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.280]   But could there be an equivalent poster for me?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.080]   Well, Don, I'm going to do your work for you
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.920]   and say that might be quixotic, because I
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   do give a lot of advice.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.200]   But to be honest, the summary I use
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.040]   when I try to capture everything is not 20 pieces of advice.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.680]   It's three.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.600]   The best summary I have for my deep life philosophy writ large
[00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:01.160]   would be do less, do better, know why.
[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.160]   Those three categories capture everything
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.880]   I think is really important.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.080]   So do less.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.520]   Focus on the things that matter.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.200]   Be worried, concerned about over-distraction.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.920]   Be concerned by having too much on your plate.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.880]   Be concerned by the death of 1,000 paper
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.520]   cuts of too much work foci, making it difficult to do
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.800]   any one thing better.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.760]   Be worried about in your life outside of work,
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.240]   too many shining distractions taking your attention away
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.640]   from the smaller number of things that are really quality.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.080]   These are themes that go through all of my books,
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.880]   including my student books, for sure,
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.260]   and so good they can't ignore you, for sure in deep work,
[00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.720]   for sure in digital minimalism, even in a world without email.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.960]   Do better.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.680]   Care about how you actually execute the things you execute.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.640]   This is where deep work shows up.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.260]   For certain things, deep work is much better than shallow work.
[00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:49.920]   Do it without distraction.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.800]   There's also where productivity falls in.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.200]   If you have these obligations are part of your job,
[00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.440]   this is what you've decided to do, organize it.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.920]   Be smart about it.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.800]   Don't be haphazard.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:02.560]   Don't be reactive.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.400]   Don't just stumble through your day.
[00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.360]   And then the know why is to connect this all
[00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.880]   to the underlying reasons.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.640]   I am doing this for that.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.200]   Here is my vision of my lifestyle.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.500]   Here are my values.
[00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.200]   These things we talk about a lot when
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.320]   we talk about the deep life fall under that rubric of know why.
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.720]   So if you're not doing too much, you have autonomy, time,
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.220]   margin.
[00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.080]   If the things you do, you do at a high level of quality,
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.500]   you're intentional and organized by the things that maybe
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.920]   are easier but have to happen, and you connect everything
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.960]   to your values, to a vision of a life well lived,
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.240]   that is basically the deep life.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.360]   That actually used to be the tagline
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   of my blog of study hacks.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.720]   So in the beginning--
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.160]   quick digital history of Cal Newport--
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.880]   in the beginning, I wrote my first two books,
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.720]   How to Win a College, How to Become a Straight A Student.
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.040]   How to Become a Straight A Student came out in 2006.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.440]   In 2007, I launched my website, calnewport.com,
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.880]   and it was built on a blog that I called Study Hacks,
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.720]   because the whole idea was continue the discussion that
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.800]   was started in those two student books.
[00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.580]   It was the missing chapters from those student books.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:14.600]   And then once I made the transition around 2010,
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.120]   away from just student advice, I maintained the name Study Hacks.
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.160]   But there was a tagline.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.240]   There was a tagline.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.280]   I'd gone through different taglines for the blog,
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.600]   back when that was the core of my digital world,
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.840]   a core that now--
[00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:30.600]   the blog is more of my newsletter.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.140]   People like email newsletter better,
[00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:34.240]   and there's the podcast, et cetera.
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.200]   For a while, it was do less, do better, know why.
[00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:39.760]   It was how I was really summarizing the way I was
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.120]   thinking about student life.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.240]   And in particular-- not to go on too much of a tangent here--
[00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.280]   but in particular, after How to Become a Straight A Student,
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:48.940]   I got heavily involved in dealing
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.480]   with issues of student overload and student stress.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.560]   And that's really where that motto first emerged,
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.760]   do less, do better, know why.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.740]   It's how I thought you should go through high school
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.140]   and college in a way that opened up opportunities,
[00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:03.960]   but was not overwhelming or stressful.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.800]   It was the foundation for a life well-lived,
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.720]   not the foundation for getting a cardiac stint put in
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.520]   at an early age.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.940]   And so that's where that came from.
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.180]   And then over time, that influenced almost everything
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.400]   else I wrote about.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.840]   That influenced my career advice,
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.640]   my advice for the deep life more generally.
[00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.100]   So that was my tagline for a while.
[00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.520]   It got replaced with decoding patterns of success or something,
[00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.640]   or maybe decoding patterns of success was before.
[00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.200]   I had a bunch of different taglines,
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.320]   and then eventually I just got rid of the taglines.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.360]   But anyways, do less, do better, know why
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.280]   has been with me for a long time.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.200]   So that would be what should be on my poster.
