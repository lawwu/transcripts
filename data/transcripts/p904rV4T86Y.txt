[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.600]   So, I can imagine that the high-conflict person doesn't always appear as high-conflict.
[00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.920]   In fact, this is something that you've alluded to many times already in this conversation
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.960]   and certainly in your book, that sometimes these high-conflict personalities come in
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.760]   kind of under the radar and that can be confusing to people or they can go undetected for a
[00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:23.760]   long time.
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.000]   Yeah, so part of it goes with the specific personalities, so high-conflict people with
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.240]   borderline personality traits or histrionic personality traits are often more openly dramatic
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:45.080]   and so they might really shock you, suddenly they start yelling, screaming, throwing things
[00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.120]   just because you're having an average conversation, very disproportionate, but some, and it tends
[00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.280]   to be more of the antisocial personality, some narcissistic personalities can look really
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.000]   reasonable on the surface.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.320]   And they've actually had a lifetime of experience at looking good, which kind of covers up all
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.600]   the stuff under the surface.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:16.080]   And I think of a couple examples, so for example, and I deal sometimes with domestic violence
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:23.240]   cases, so let's say an abuser says, in court, says, "Oh, well, I was helping her because
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.800]   she was so upset I took her keys away and I held her down on the bed because I was afraid
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.880]   she would leave and get into a car crash."
[00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.800]   Well, there may be rare occasions where that's true, but that's a common story that we get
[00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:41.200]   from domestic abusers.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:47.920]   Or in court, I've seen this, where there'll be a very reasonable person kind of explaining
[00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:55.380]   the situation and their partner, more often a woman, is just emotional, is a mess, maybe
[00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.680]   even in tears.
[00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.220]   And people don't realize about 80% of divorces in court today, people represent themselves.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.760]   And so there's these conversations and the judge is like, "Well, this guy's being really
[00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.480]   reasonable and this woman's a mess, I mean, you know, I'm going to go with what he's saying."
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.600]   And so a lot of stuff slips under the radar that way.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.000]   But gender-wise, it could be the reverse, and a lot of relationships people get into,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.800]   people make themselves look really good and then the negative stuff comes out weeks, months,
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.480]   maybe a year later.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.500]   So that's why we say wait a year until you decide to commit.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.280]   Because nowadays, who knows, you may have someone that really is good at covering their
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.280]   bad behavior.
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.960]   Yeah, let's hover on that one particular point, because this is perhaps one of the most important
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.120]   takeaways from your work.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:56.840]   Could you just spell out this first year principle?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:04.460]   And perhaps it's useful for us to also acknowledge that, yes, there are a great many, truly great
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.280]   stories about people who met one weekend, two weeks later, got married, and then we're
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.440]   hearing the story 50 years later when they've got grandkids and great grandkids, they thrived.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.440]   Or people met, got engaged three months later, or, you know, in some cases, got pregnant
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.740]   three months later, and they have this wonderful marriage and family story to tell.
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.280]   We hear these stories and they're really wonderful stories, right?
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:34.280]   I mean, they sort of affirm your belief in humanity when you hear those stories.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.840]   And they are powerful.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.880]   But in discussing a little bit of this with you offline, you probably have witnessed more
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:51.280]   cases where people rushed and that rushing to commit or to create led to more problems
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.960]   than it did good.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:53.960]   Yes.
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:04:00.000]   And that's many, many of the high conflict divorces that I've worked on as a lawyer and
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.960]   before that as a therapist and sometimes as a mediator are, in my mind, kind of the bad
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.640]   luck stories.
[00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:15.040]   Got a decent person, usually my client, of course, but something happened, they got together
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.180]   too fast, and then all this stuff came out.
[00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.600]   And I really believe in today's world that it is a matter of luck.
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.360]   And that's why you should take a year to find out, am I, did I draw the short straw in this
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:38.080]   relationship because I got this perfect looking person, great record, all these good things.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:45.320]   But close relationships is where personality disorders come out, interpersonal difficulty,
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.680]   and the high conflict behaviors, mostly close relationships.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.520]   So they might, everyone might like them at work, but when you're home alone with them,
[00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.060]   they could be really terrible, yelling, hitting, doing all of this stuff.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.880]   So that's why we say wait a year.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.760]   I've had a lot of cases where people tell me we just fell in love, it was beautiful
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.320]   and everything was wonderful for about six months.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:17.520]   And then when I committed to get married, all this stuff started showing up.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.480]   But I got married anyway because I figured, well, time and love will heal everything.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.080]   Only it didn't.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:30.760]   So in today's world, there's a higher risk of getting a high conflict relationship I
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.360]   must say.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:37.620]   And the description you gave is what people often tell me, they say my grandparents got
[00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:42.480]   married a week after they met and they just celebrated their 60th anniversary, they're
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.280]   still in love, everything's wonderful.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.540]   Your grandparents tended to know who they were marrying.
[00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.480]   In today's world, not only don't you know, you don't have a history, but high conflict
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:59.040]   people have learned to cover up the full range of who they are.
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.620]   And they're not bad people, and that's something I want to emphasize.
[00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.920]   They just have a different personality.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:10.760]   And they may have been born this way, but they don't come with markings, you know,
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.800]   they don't come with the music like of Jaws, doo-doo-doo-doo.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:20.500]   They look good and anybody I think is at risk of falling into a relationship like this.
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.020]   I definitely want to come back to this point that you made, that you're not demonizing
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.020]   these people.
[00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.020]   Right.
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:33.220]   You're talking about how to behave with them or how to not behave with them in some cases
[00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:40.140]   in order to try and create the smoothest possible interactions, in some cases, no interaction.
[00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.980]   But if we could hover still a bit more on this first year idea, my understanding is
[00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:56.280]   that no getting engaged, or for that matter married, no conceiving children, and no moving
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.980]   in together in year one.
[00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:00.720]   Are those the critical...
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.880]   Except for the last one, is it's really, don't commit like getting married within the first
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.880]   year.
[00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.640]   Sometimes moving in together is a good way to find out what it's like up close with this
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.640]   person.
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:15.260]   Yeah, you learn a lot by living with somebody.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:16.260]   That's right.
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:17.260]   That's right.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:21.840]   And personality disorders, part of the definition is interpersonal dysfunction.
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:24.480]   And that's close, that's close relationships.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.080]   So if you haven't had that close relationship, you don't see what happens when you leave
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.360]   your socks out or the caps off the toothpaste and some little thing is some huge storm.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.880]   Or when somebody is sleep-deprived.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.360]   I always say you learn a lot about somebody after a bad night's sleep, you end them, right?
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   Right.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:46.520]   But the key is patterns of behavior.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:52.400]   So one thing I want to say is everybody gets angry sometimes, that's fine.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.520]   Everybody yells sometimes.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.540]   Everybody criticizes sometimes.
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:08:03.120]   But if they have a pattern, like their life pattern of relationship is to yell and scream
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:09.720]   and criticize and all that, whoa, this pattern is probably going to keep going.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.520]   And as I mentioned earlier, I believe, with personality disorders, it's a narrower pattern
[00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.160]   of behavior.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:21.320]   So it's more pattern-driven in several different settings.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:27.080]   Family, maybe at work when it's close, maybe in the community when it's close.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:36.040]   So these are recognizable patterns, as recognizable as alcoholism and addiction, once people learn.
[00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.040]   So that's the key.
[00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:40.520]   Give yourself some time, see if this stuff comes to the surface.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.240]   I think you're raising a really interesting point, which is that although nowadays we
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:51.760]   have more information about people available to us by way of the internet and social media,
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.960]   you made the comparison with our grandparents' era.
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:58.120]   I'm 49 years old, so my grandparents...
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:02.560]   Actually my grandparents knew each other from the time they were like in the eighth grade.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.600]   They eloped when they turned 18, boom, went and got married, I think to the dismay of
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:13.200]   one side or the other side of parents, but then were married more than 50 years.
[00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:15.840]   And grandkids, obviously, I'm one of them, et cetera.
[00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:21.720]   And so you have these stories and we love these kinds of stories, but as you point out,
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:26.400]   they knew each other very, very well and had for a long time.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:32.080]   Nowadays, one can "do their research", go online and look for things, but would you
[00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:34.920]   argue that that's not complete information?
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:35.920]   Right.
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.280]   I think it can be helpful.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:43.000]   I tell people, "Google your partner and find out if there's some history there that may
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   impact you."
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Definitely.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.160]   But don't believe that's sufficient.
[00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:52.280]   What I say, what you really want to talk to is relatives and friends of this person, and
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:57.800]   what you really want to do is see them in action with their relatives and friends.
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.800]   Relatives and friends.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.760]   Yes, because that's close relationships.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   That's the key.
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.440]   This is all about close relationships.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:06.520]   And that's what catches people by surprise.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.080]   They say, "This person looks good at work."
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:15.640]   Some people have worked together for 10 years and maybe they were in other relationships
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:20.480]   and they both got divorced, commiserated with each other, and they get together.
[00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:23.640]   And it's like, "We've known each other for 10 years, you know, we're going to have a
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.760]   great relationship."
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:30.720]   And they find out this is like a stranger almost, because it's a close relationship
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.760]   now.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:32.960]   And that's the difference.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:40.080]   How people behave in a close relationship often triggers like personality disorder stuff.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:47.520]   Fear of abandonment, fear of looking inferior, fear of being dominated, fear of not getting
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.600]   enough attention.
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   The personality disorders seem to have excessive fears in these areas.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:59.340]   Is it fair to say that if somebody has a lot of stable friendships over, you know, long
[00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:06.240]   periods of time, that that's a good indication that they can maintain close relationships?
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:09.520]   But it seems to me you'd also want to know, like, what is a close friend to that person?
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.080]   Do they actually spend time with them, you know, and likewise with coworkers?
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:21.120]   Because some work environments that I've been in are necessarily very non-personal.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.680]   You don't share much, right?
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:28.880]   Whereas other environments, like I know the partners of everyone I work with now at the
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.360]   podcast, that wasn't true for my academic colleagues.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:35.720]   I knew some of my academic colleagues' families, I would have dinner with them, et cetera,
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.340]   but some of them less so.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:39.000]   So context matters a lot.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Yes.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Right.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.680]   And I'd say, you mentioned the word stability, and that's really a key.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:50.240]   So if they have close friends they've had for 10, 20, 30 years, that's a really good
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.360]   sign.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:57.840]   Bad signs are, "I don't want you talking to my family, they're evil people, they'll say
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:03.200]   terrible things about me, you can't trust them, they'll end up, they'll turn on you,
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:04.840]   they'll hate you," all this stuff.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:10.120]   "You can't even ever talk to my, I can't even let you know who my family is and what their
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.320]   emails and phone numbers are."
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:13.320]   Oh goodness.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.320]   That's a warning sign.
[00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.320]   Definite warning sign.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.960]   Because everyone has conflict with family members at some level, but you would hope
[00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:25.520]   that one would feel comfortable allowing you to interact with their family.
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:26.520 --> 00:12:31.320]   And if your family's really difficult, introduce your partner to your family and let them see,
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:35.720]   "This is a difficult family and this is why I had to distance from them," because a lot
[00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:39.680]   of people, to be healthy, do have to get some more distance.
[00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:46.160]   But it's the secretiveness, it's the, just secrets in general are not a good thing for
[00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.080]   relationships.
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:54.840]   That's the biggest piece that's missing in a way, compared to 50 years ago when people
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:55.840]   knew.
[00:12:55.840 --> 00:12:59.640]   It was hard to have family secrets 50 years ago.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:05.840]   Well, even though people may be all over the internet, you might really know their secrets.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.480]   And that's what you need to find out.
[00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:09.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.060]   (upbeat music)
[00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:15.620]   (upbeat music)
