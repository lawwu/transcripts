[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520]   [Silence]
[00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.080]   Now let's take a step back into the real world
[00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:07.720]   and evaluate or think about what happens
[00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.240]   when somebody smokes cannabis or ingests cannabis
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.000]   by way of edible or tincture or something of that sort.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.980]   Cannabis is very fast to enter the bloodstream.
[00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.520]   In fact, within 30 seconds,
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.640]   it's going to enter the brain
[00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.920]   and permeate throughout the brain and body.
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.320]   That's very, very fast.
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.880]   I mean, when you contrast that with something like alcohol
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.760]   or even nicotine, depending on how the nicotine is delivered,
[00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.160]   that is a very fast delivery of the psychoactive
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.960]   and biologically active compound,
[00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.080]   which in this case is THC and CBD
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.400]   and probably some other things as well.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.520]   So within 30 seconds,
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520]   it reaches the brain and bodily tissues.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.760]   And within 30 to 60 minutes,
[00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.240]   it's going to reach its peak concentrations
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.520]   and have its peak biological effects.
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.560]   Those aren't always the same thing,
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.240]   but in the case of cannabis,
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:59.360]   and again, here I'm using cannabis
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.120]   as a kind of umbrella term for THC and CBD,
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.280]   the effects are going to peak at about 30 to 60 minutes
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.960]   after bringing those compounds into the body
[00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.600]   in some way or another.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.960]   And the effects tend to last
[00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.560]   anywhere from three to four hours,
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.280]   although there's some variation on that
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.440]   depending on individual metabolism,
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.920]   whether or not somebody is familiar with the compound,
[00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.360]   believe it or not, psychologically familiar,
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.080]   but also biologically familiar,
[00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.360]   or whether or not it's a first-time use
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.760]   or occasional use and so on.
[00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:32.240]   THC and CBD and other components of cannabis
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.120]   are highly what we call lipophilic.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.920]   That is, they have an affinity toward
[00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.060]   and they can actually pass through fatty tissues.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.160]   Now, every cell in your body,
[00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.640]   but especially neurons,
[00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.560]   have a double layer of fat on their outside.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.360]   And of course, when people hear fat,
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.680]   they always think, "Oh, fat's bad, fat's bad."
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.600]   Most of the world seems to want to lose fat or bodily fat.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.400]   Here, we're talking about the fatty membrane,
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.160]   the barrier around each tissue.
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.960]   In this case, we're talking particularly about neurons.
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.320]   And THC and CBD and the other components of cannabis
[00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.640]   are highly lipophilic.
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.520]   So they can get into essentially all cells
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.320]   just simply by flowing into them.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.580]   They will also remain in those cells for a long time.
[00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.880]   So I know that a number of people,
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.960]   depending on whether or not they get tested
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.080]   for work or for sport or otherwise,
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.900]   for cannabis or CBD and THC,
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.560]   don't take this as a strict number,
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.560]   but typically if one ingests CBD or THC,
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.480]   smokes cannabis, ingests by orally, et cetera,
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.320]   it doesn't matter.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.140]   It's going to stay in that fatty tissue
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.520]   and can be detected for at least as long as 80 days
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.360]   after ingestion.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.400]   And there's a whole industry
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.480]   as to how to accelerate the clearance.
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.860]   And I should just tell you that just losing bodily fat
[00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.960]   isn't going to eliminate it from your system,
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.000]   maybe partially in those fat cells,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   but certainly intravisceral fat and other fatty tissue
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.960]   that's in and around the brain and body
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.280]   is going to harbor that THC molecule and the CBD molecule
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.640]   for quite a long while, at least 80 days.
[00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.320]   Okay, so if someone smokes cannabis or they ingest cannabis,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.960]   very rapidly gets into the bloodstream
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.760]   and the components that are psychoactive
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.800]   get into the bloodstream
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.160]   and are immediately able to access neurons and other cells
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.160]   and start having these effects
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.800]   of parking at those endogenous cannabinoid receptors
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.080]   and impacting the signaling between neurons,
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.560]   which leads to the subjective effects of cannabis,
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.880]   including THC and CBD.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.720]   So let's talk about
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.120]   what those different subjective effects are.
[00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.080]   Again, this is going to vary depending on whether or not
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.280]   people are ingesting sativa varieties of cannabis.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.720]   Just to remind you, those tend to be elevated,
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.560]   mood, alertness, talkativeness.
[00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.320]   People who take sativa varieties tend to talk a lot more
[00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.960]   than they would otherwise.
[00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.400]   Again, there are exceptions to this.
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.600]   Of course, there are exceptions.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.960]   I'm sure there are people out there shouting,
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.200]   although I guess if you're the quiet people
[00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.040]   who don't talk too much, you're probably not shouting,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.480]   or if you're not, you're not doing on sativa.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.520]   Joke intended, but in any event, there are exceptions,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.300]   but there are also general rules.
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.640]   And the sativas tend to meet people sort of mood elevated,
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.620]   energetic, again, the sort of head high,
[00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.080]   and indica varieties tend to do the opposite,
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.480]   more of a sedative, relaxant, et cetera.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.300]   Why and how would they do that?
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:18.860]   Okay, well, without going into an extensive deep dive
[00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.420]   into the different neurotransmitter systems
[00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:23.180]   of the brain and body, what we know for sure
[00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.900]   is that CB1 receptors are present on an enormous number
[00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.920]   of different neurons in brain structures and neural circuits
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.340]   so that the sativa varieties that act as sort of a stimulant
[00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.460]   making people feel happy because in general,
[00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.060]   they do tend to elevate mood, at least at certain dosages.
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.500]   Talkative, tend to make people feel like they have ideas
[00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.060]   that are interesting, that they might want to share,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.840]   tend to narrow their context, so tend to increase focus.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.020]   This is something that's not often discussed about cannabis,
[00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.860]   but it can, especially the sativa varieties
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.940]   can increase people's level of focus to particular things,
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.860]   something they're watching or something they're doing,
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.460]   or music allows them to narrow their sense of focus.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.980]   That's going to occur by activation of CB1 receptors
[00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:09.480]   in the so-called prefrontal cortex,
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.140]   which is just behind the forehead.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:14.460]   And the prefrontal cortex acts as a strong modulator
[00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.180]   of so-called limbic circuitry and other circuitry
[00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.180]   that is more stress-oriented.
[00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.540]   The way to think about the stress and limbic circuitry,
[00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.940]   such as the amygdala, which many people have heard about,
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.780]   is that they aren't really circuits for fear and stress.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.940]   They are circuits that are constantly evaluating
[00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.840]   one's own internal state, heart rate, et cetera,
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.780]   and what's happening externally.
[00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:37.940]   And sorry to say, but the default of those systems
[00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.940]   is to detect danger, the sort of threat detection systems.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:43.080]   And then the prefrontal cortex largely acts
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.900]   as a brake on those systems,
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.740]   sort of like the reins pulling back on a steed of horses
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:50.020]   that would otherwise just kind of take off.
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.860]   And so the sativa varieties tend to increase CB1 activation
[00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:56.660]   in the prefrontal cortex and in other circuitry
[00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.800]   that then leads to a kind of overall reduction in stress
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.240]   because of the way that prefrontal circuitry
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.820]   can reduce activation of the amygdala.
[00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:06.120]   Now that, of course, does not explain
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.100]   why some people become very stressed and very paranoid
[00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.900]   when they smoke sativa varieties or other varieties
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:14.180]   of cannabis or ingest other varieties of cannabis.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.940]   We will talk about the paranoid effect
[00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.860]   and why that occurs and who might predict
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.300]   that would occur to them in a little bit.
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:23.500]   But I just want to give you a sense of how this is working
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.060]   because as I mentioned before,
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.460]   THC and/or CBD are going to bind that CB1 receptor,
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:30.620]   let's say in prefrontal cortex,
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:32.980]   the neurons of prefrontal cortex is going to bind there.
[00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:34.900]   And then there'll be a retrograde signaling
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.220]   back to the presynaptic neuron.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:38.020]   And in the case of prefrontal cortex,
[00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.020]   what's happening is it's increasing transmission,
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.700]   increasing the release of neurotransmitter
[00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.300]   in prefrontal cortex.
[00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.020]   However, at the same time,
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.060]   the very same THC and CBD that was brought into the system
[00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:54.660]   is binding the very same type of receptors, CB1 receptors
[00:06:54.660 --> 00:06:57.840]   in other brain structures, such as the amygdala,
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.680]   and causing retrograde signaling back
[00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:03.740]   to the presynaptic neurons in the amygdala,
[00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:06.800]   but it's quieting the activation of those neurons.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.040]   So this is interesting, right?
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.820]   We have the same compounds, THC and/or CBD,
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:15.460]   brought into the body and brain,
[00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:19.760]   binding the same receptors, in this case, the CB1 receptors,
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:23.020]   but depending on where those receptors are located
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.660]   and which brain areas we're referring to,
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.660]   they are either causing heightened levels of alertness
[00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:33.120]   and activation of systems that are designed
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.580]   to make you talkative and alertness and mood, et cetera,
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.280]   focus, or they're causing suppression of those circuitries.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   So we have kind of a seesaw effect here
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.480]   where the same compound is increasing mood and alertness
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.800]   and focus in the prefrontal cortex
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:49.080]   and is decreasing stress and threat detection
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:51.980]   in the amygdala, and that's one of the reasons why,
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:54.920]   especially the sativa varieties of cannabis,
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.360]   allow people to enter these states of focus.
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.520]   Some might even say flow,
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:00.380]   although I don't want to go into
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:01.960]   what flow states really are.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.760]   That's for a different discussion,
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:07.180]   and it's very poorly defined as it is.
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:08.940]   And I certainly don't want to give people the impression
[00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.640]   that cannabis increases flow states,
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.220]   because that's not always the case,
[00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:15.600]   and certainly most often it's not going to be the case.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.100]   But the idea here is that this molecule comes into our brain
[00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:22.280]   and is shifting everything towards a state of focus,
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.500]   elevated mood, of heightened sense of importance
[00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:27.420]   about whatever it is that we happen to be doing.
[00:08:27.420 --> 00:08:29.980]   And now, of course, whatever we could happen to be doing
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:33.760]   could be writing a song, writing poetry,
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.120]   communicating with somebody,
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.840]   but it could also be something as trivial
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.400]   as watching cartoons or watching a movie,
[00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.680]   which is not trivial in its own right,
[00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:45.440]   but in terms of thinking about the creative aspects
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:48.800]   or the creativity-stimulating aspects of cannabis,
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.580]   not sort of productivity-oriented.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.600]   So narrowed focus, elevated mood,
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.800]   more relaxed and yet energetic.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.720]   That's the major effects of the sativa varieties,
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.620]   except, and this is a really big, bold-faced,
[00:09:01.620 --> 00:09:03.500]   triple-underlined except,
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:06.900]   except in some individuals, depending on dosage,
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.940]   but also depending on pre-existing neural circuitry
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:12.820]   and propensity for anxiety,
[00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:16.580]   some people ingest or smoke sativa varieties.
[00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.860]   And regardless of whether or not it's a type 1, type 2,
[00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:20.540]   or type 3 variety, okay?
[00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:23.700]   Regardless of the ratio between THC and CBD,
[00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:28.500]   people will experience intense anxiety and paranoia.
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.200]   Now, how do you predict
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:32.760]   who will experience intense anxiety and paranoia
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.400]   and who will experience intense relaxation,
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.880]   focus, and sense of creativity
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.600]   from ingesting or smoking a type 1, type 2,
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.520]   or type 3 sativa?
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.120]   Well, there is no way to predict that.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:47.560]   And there's a lot of kind of what I would call street lore
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:52.440]   or dorm room lore or kind of peer, not peer-reviewed,
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:55.040]   but sort of peer-discussed,
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.620]   I mean, among friends and people and acquaintances,
[00:09:57.620 --> 00:10:00.400]   lore out there that what one needs to do
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.280]   is simply smoke more, right?
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:04.080]   Or just ingest more, you hear that.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.620]   Oh, well, listen, if it makes you paranoid,
[00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:06.920]   you simply need to use more.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.400]   That is absolutely categorically false.
[00:10:09.400 --> 00:10:12.760]   Everything we know about the way that THC and CBD work
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.620]   is that they tend to potentiate,
[00:10:14.620 --> 00:10:19.620]   that is increase the effects of these different systems
[00:10:19.620 --> 00:10:21.080]   at given synapses
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.640]   and in different areas of the brain and body.
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:27.480]   That is, if someone experiences paranoia or anxiety
[00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:31.680]   from a given strain of the marijuana plant
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:33.840]   or from ingesting an edible in a particular way
[00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.360]   or a particular kind of edible,
[00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:39.400]   that person is very likely to experience the same effect
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.960]   every time they ingest that strain or variety.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:46.600]   This is part of what's led to this enormous industry.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.680]   I mean, there are a number of different reasons,
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.800]   but this is part of what's led to this enormous industry
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:53.080]   of highly customized cannabis,
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.840]   where people will spend some time
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.280]   really seeking out the different strains of cannabis
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:01.560]   and hybrids of cannabis that work best for them
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:04.240]   and work best for them in particular contexts.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.400]   I wish I could tell you that if you are a person
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.860]   who is between five foot seven and six feet tall,
[00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:13.980]   and you have blue eyes or brown eyes,
[00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.360]   that the sativa varieties are going to be right for you
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.640]   or that the sativa varieties
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.000]   are going to give you panic attacks.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I can't do that.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.200]   The only way to determine it
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:24.120]   would be to actually experience ingesting those
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:24.960]   or smoking those,
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:27.020]   which is certainly also not what I'm suggesting, right?
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:27.860]   That's up to you.
[00:11:27.860 --> 00:11:29.780]   I'm not telling you what to do or what not to do,
[00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:31.560]   but there are no good predictors.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:34.520]   In fact, if you look in the literature,
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.680]   it is not at all clear
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:39.020]   that people who have a heightened level of anxiety
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.580]   when they do not smoke cannabis
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.580]   will experience cannabis as less paranoia-inducing
[00:11:46.580 --> 00:11:47.800]   or more relaxing.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.760]   That's simply not the case.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.480]   Now, what we can say for sure
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.320]   is that general categories of effects,
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.160]   such as increased focus and reduced anxiety
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.000]   are largely due to activation of areas
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:01.440]   like the prefrontal cortex.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:04.760]   Now, unlike other compounds like nicotine or alcohol
[00:12:04.760 --> 00:12:06.740]   or neurotransmitter systems like dopamine,
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.000]   when we talk about the cannabinoid system,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.540]   and I say effects, biological effects, psychoactive effects,
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:15.440]   I want you to keep in mind always,
[00:12:15.440 --> 00:12:17.440]   please, please, please keep in mind
[00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:20.060]   that those effects can be varied
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.260]   and often opposite in direction.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:25.440]   So let's just give an example of that.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:29.360]   I just mentioned that when people smoke or eat sativa,
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:32.240]   that it tends to lead to one specific set of,
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.120]   or generally leads to one specific set of effects,
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:36.520]   heightened focus, mood, et cetera.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:40.200]   Whereas when they ingest or smoke indica
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:41.900]   and its components, right?
[00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:44.440]   Again, we're still talking about THC and CBD
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:48.180]   in varying ratios, but now indica cannabis,
[00:12:48.180 --> 00:12:50.800]   and you say, well, why would it improve
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.720]   the transition time to sleep?
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.060]   Or at least give people the impression
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:55.600]   that it improved the transition time to sleep.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.800]   We'll talk about what indica actually does for sleep
[00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.020]   in a little bit.
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.960]   But indica also tends to suppress activation
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.200]   of the amygdala and threat detection centers in the brain.
[00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:06.160]   Again, binding the same CB1 receptors
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.240]   and those retrograde signaling mechanisms
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:09.700]   I talked about before.
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.900]   But it also tends to shut down the hippocampus,
[00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:16.320]   an area of the brain associated with memory,
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:20.620]   which is why indica varieties lead to pronounced,
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:23.980]   or I should say profound defects in short-term memory
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:25.620]   and sometimes in long-term memory as well,
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.460]   if it's consumed over long periods of time.
[00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.780]   We'll talk about short, medium, and long-term consumption,
[00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.580]   occasional consumption going forward.
[00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:33.660]   So what I'd like you to take away
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:35.460]   from this component of the discussion is,
[00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:38.500]   first of all, the mechanism of action
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:42.820]   by which cannabis impacts the brain and body,
[00:13:42.820 --> 00:13:44.260]   but in particular, the brain is going to be
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:47.000]   through CB1 receptors, and those CB1 receptors
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.580]   can lead to either an acceleration or a break
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.260]   on particular biological mechanisms.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:54.180]   And there are going to be a constellation
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.540]   of different accelerations and breaking
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.740]   of different neural systems in the brain and body,
[00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:02.500]   depending on whether or not people ingest sativa
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.940]   or indica or some hybrid strain.
[00:14:04.940 --> 00:14:06.440]   And perhaps most importantly,
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.180]   even if you didn't understand anything that I've said
[00:14:08.180 --> 00:14:09.940]   about the biology of these different strains
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:12.100]   and the receptors, please do understand
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.940]   that there is no way to predict
[00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:18.920]   what the effect of a given strain will be on an individual.
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.300]   There has been extensive exploration
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:23.940]   as to whether or not people who are so-called mellower
[00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:26.860]   or more anxious or any number
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.820]   of different personality dimensions will respond
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:30.700]   in one way or the other,
[00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:33.180]   but in fact, there is no way to tell.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.820]   Layer on top of that, the fact that dosing THC and CBD
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:40.700]   can be fairly straightforward in the form of edibles,
[00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.620]   right, because there can be,
[00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:44.820]   at least if it's a controlled source,
[00:14:44.820 --> 00:14:48.140]   a defined number of milligrams of THC,
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:50.560]   a defined number of milligrams of CBD.
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:52.520]   That's true for ingestibles.
[00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:54.720]   It's much harder to gauge that
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:57.140]   from the smokable forms of cannabis,
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:59.040]   especially if those smokable forms of cannabis
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:00.280]   are obtained through sources
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:02.760]   where there isn't a lot of clear information
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:05.840]   about the total amount of THC in that product.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:07.840]   Now, this is all changing quite a lot nowadays
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:12.120]   because of the commercialization of THC and CBD products
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.120]   and cannabis in a number of different areas,
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:15.800]   including in the United States.
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.540]   But still many people are ingesting cannabis, THC, CBD
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.780]   through sources where they don't really know
[00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:22.620]   how much they're bringing into their system.
[00:15:22.620 --> 00:15:25.220]   And so whether or not someone gets
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:29.580]   incredible anxiety relief, enhanced sense of mood and focus
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:31.640]   and wellbeing, pain relief, et cetera,
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.220]   or whether or not they have full-blown panic attacks,
[00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:37.500]   et cetera, is very hard to predict
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.800]   based on dosage information alone.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:42.300]   Now, of course, we can create broad categories
[00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:43.500]   and we're going to talk about studies
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.480]   that create broad categories of low dose,
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:47.240]   moderate dose and high dose,
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:49.500]   frequent use and infrequent use.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:52.320]   But unlike alcohol, unlike nicotine,
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:57.320]   we can't really point to specificity of X amount of alcohol,
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:15:59.880]   grams of alcohol per week, which is safe,
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:02.280]   or X amount of alcohol, which is not safe.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:04.640]   And so I know a lot of people out there are wondering,
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:07.840]   you know, how often can they smoke cannabis
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.480]   or how often can they eat cannabis or THC or CBD
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.800]   in any number of its different forms and products safely?
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:18.340]   Well, we have to really define what safely means
[00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:19.820]   and we have to really acknowledge
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:24.020]   that there's a pretty loose set of controls
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:27.080]   over what one is bringing into their brain and body
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:29.780]   as they ingest THC and CBD.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:33.020]   But even under conditions in which it's very controlled,
[00:16:33.020 --> 00:16:35.620]   it's very hard to predict what those effects will be.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:39.540]   So before moving into specifics of taking cannabis
[00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:41.340]   or not taking cannabis, who should, who shouldn't,
[00:16:41.340 --> 00:16:43.760]   what the medicinal purposes are
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:47.160]   and what some of the newer exciting data point to,
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:48.480]   I just briefly want to make a list.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.240]   And I promise very briefly, I know I'm not often concise,
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.960]   but I do try to be thorough for your sake.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.480]   I want to make a very brief list of the different brain
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:01.160]   areas that are impacted by THC and CBD
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.740]   and why THC and CBD have the various effects they do.
[00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:11.920]   When somebody smokes or ingests cannabis,
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:16.060]   doesn't matter what the THC or CBD ratio is,
[00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:21.320]   if they experience deficits in memory,
[00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:23.540]   and that's almost always present,
[00:17:23.540 --> 00:17:26.320]   that's going to be because of reductions
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.340]   in electrical activity within this brain region
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.980]   we call the hippocampus.
[00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:32.160]   Hippocampus means seahorse, it's shaped like a seahorse.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:35.000]   Anatomists like to name things after what things look like,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   but hippocampus memory is reduced
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.600]   in particular short-term memory.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:41.400]   That's true regardless of whether or not
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.560]   one is using sativa, indica, or some hybrid.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:51.860]   In general, the prefrontal cortex is going to be activated
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:54.640]   by the sativa varieties, which is going to increase thinking
[00:17:54.640 --> 00:17:58.820]   and narrowly constrain focus to some activity.
[00:17:58.820 --> 00:18:00.260]   And that's more commonly associated
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:01.620]   with the sativa varieties.
[00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.740]   The indica varieties, as I mentioned before,
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.780]   tend to lead to a suppression of activity
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:08.020]   in prefrontal cortex, believe it or not.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.220]   And turn off thinking and planning,
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:14.940]   this is why indica varieties are often used for relaxation
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:16.500]   and for promoting sleep.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:20.980]   Regardless of whether or not sativa or indica variety,
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:25.340]   and again, regardless of the ratio of THC to CBD,
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.340]   there is a general suppression of neural circuits
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:30.540]   within the so-called basal ganglia and cerebellum.
[00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.100]   Basal ganglia and cerebellum are areas of the brain
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.660]   that are involved in action planning
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.860]   and withholding action, so that would be the basal ganglia,
[00:18:36.860 --> 00:18:39.380]   so-called go/no-go circuitry.
[00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:41.980]   And the cerebellum, which is involved in balance,
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:44.600]   but also motor planning and motor sequencing.
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:49.280]   This is why people who smoke marijuana,
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.620]   regardless of the strain,
[00:18:51.620 --> 00:18:54.600]   will tend to be less physically mobile.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:57.100]   Other common effects are reddening of the eyes,
[00:18:57.100 --> 00:18:58.020]   dryness of the mouth,
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.860]   that's actually caused by the same general mechanism,
[00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:03.900]   which is a reduction in the secretion of saliva
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:07.020]   and of sort of tears and lubrication of the eyes
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.780]   from the lacrimal glands of the eyes
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.360]   because of the presence of largely CB2,
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:15.980]   but also CB1 receptors in the mouth and on the eyes.
[00:19:15.980 --> 00:19:17.940]   And there tends to be,
[00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.620]   especially with certain strains of cannabis,
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:23.460]   increase in appetite, so-called munchies.
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:28.020]   And that has everything to do with very, very high density
[00:19:28.020 --> 00:19:30.180]   of CB1 receptors in the hypothalamus,
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:31.940]   and in particular areas of the hypothalamus,
[00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:34.460]   like the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus,
[00:19:34.460 --> 00:19:36.220]   other areas as well, of course,
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:41.020]   that have tons of CB1 receptors, bind THC and CBD,
[00:19:41.020 --> 00:19:44.340]   and activate the neurons that strongly stimulate appetite
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.860]   through two mechanisms.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:49.740]   One is a cognitive mechanism of creating a preoccupation
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.580]   with food and anticipation of taste,
[00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:54.460]   as well as the experience of taste.
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.580]   So the narrowing of focus to what you want to go eat,
[00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:01.460]   right, you really crave, I don't know, pizza,
[00:20:01.460 --> 00:20:03.260]   it seems to be high-fat, high-carbohydrate foods,
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:08.260]   but really crave pizza, and narrowing of focus
[00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:09.740]   so that you're not thinking about anything else,
[00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:13.500]   but also signaling from the hypothalamus to the gut,
[00:20:13.500 --> 00:20:15.900]   to neurons within the stomach itself
[00:20:15.900 --> 00:20:17.620]   that regulate blood sugar.
[00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:22.420]   So there are strong effects on blood sugar of THC and CBD
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.580]   that generally lead to increases in appetite.
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:27.280]   So two parallel mechanisms, one within the brain,
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.340]   one within the body, increasing appetite.
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:30.920]   Okay, so there's an array of different effects.
[00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.180]   And as I mentioned before,
[00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:35.700]   CB1 receptors are present all over the nervous system
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:36.780]   in the brain, the spinal cord.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.500]   In fact, the presence of CB1 receptors in the spinal cord
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.660]   largely explains the fact that THC and CBD to some extent,
[00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:44.940]   although it's not very well-studied,
[00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:47.020]   can provide some pain relief.
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.340]   I say some because a lot of people perceive
[00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:53.080]   or believe that they experience more pain relief
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:55.260]   from cannabis than they actually do.
[00:20:55.260 --> 00:20:57.840]   It actually has a lot to do with a perceptual shift
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.500]   to basically focusing on other things,
[00:20:59.500 --> 00:21:02.940]   but there does seem to be some antinosusceptive,
[00:21:02.940 --> 00:21:07.620]   meaning anti-pain effects of cannabis, THC in particular.
[00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:09.980]   And that is exerted largely through effects
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:14.280]   on CB1 receptors in neurons of the spinal cord.
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.540]   So a broad array of effects are taking place
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.900]   regardless of what strain you take
[00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:20.100]   and whether or not you eat the cannabis
[00:21:20.100 --> 00:21:21.560]   or you smoke the cannabis.
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.980]   And the broad array of effects can be explained
[00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:25.820]   by the fact that that retrograde signaling
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.220]   can lead to activation or suppression of activity
[00:21:28.220 --> 00:21:29.520]   in various neurons.
[00:21:30.180 --> 00:21:32.760]   (upbeat music)
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:35.340]   (upbeat music)
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.240]   (upbeat music)
