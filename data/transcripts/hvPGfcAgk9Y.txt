[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460]   - Welcome to the Huberman Lab Guest Series,
[00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.140]   where I and an expert guest discuss science
[00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:07.300]   and science-based tools for everyday life.
[00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.660]   I'm Andrew Huberman,
[00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.660]   and I'm a professor of neurobiology and ophthalmology
[00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.620]   at Stanford School of Medicine.
[00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.260]   Today marks the second episode
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.660]   in our six episode series all about sleep
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.180]   with our expert guest, Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.100]   During today's episode,
[00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.180]   we discuss the do's and the do nots of sleep.
[00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.460]   Focusing for instance,
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.700]   on how to use light and absence of light
[00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.260]   as well as temperature, both of your sleep environment,
[00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.100]   specifically the room you're in, your body temperature,
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.660]   and much more in order to regulate the timing
[00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.420]   and quality of your sleep.
[00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.220]   And we discuss how things like alcohol,
[00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.580]   caffeine and cannabis impact sleep
[00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.340]   and the various stages of sleep.
[00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.060]   And we discuss the various tools that exist now
[00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.940]   and that are rapidly becoming available
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.420]   to improve your sleep.
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.660]   This episode is essential
[00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.700]   for anyone trying to optimize their sleep.
[00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.580]   And when I say optimize your sleep,
[00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.660]   I mean trying to optimize the formula
[00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.940]   that was addressed in the first episode of this series,
[00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.980]   which is the QQRT formula,
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.620]   the quality, quantity, regularity and timing of your sleep.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.020]   Four variables that combine to determine
[00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.300]   whether or not your sleep is optimized for you
[00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.660]   and thereby providing the most restoration and improvement
[00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.260]   to your mental health, physical health and performance.
[00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.140]   Before we begin,
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.900]   I'd like to emphasize that this podcast
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.600]   is separate from my teaching and research roles at Stanford.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.700]   It is however, part of my desire and effort
[00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.340]   to bring zero cost to consumer information about science
[00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.020]   and science related tools to the general public.
[00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.260]   In keeping with that theme,
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.940]   I'd like to thank the sponsors of today's podcast.
[00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.180]   Our first sponsor is Helix Sleep.
[00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.020]   Helix Sleep makes mattresses and pillows
[00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.620]   that are customized to your unique sleep needs.
[00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.020]   It's abundantly clear that sleep is the foundation
[00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.540]   of mental health, physical health and performance.
[00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.220]   When we're getting enough quality sleep,
[00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.740]   everything in life goes so much better.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.920]   And when we are not getting enough quality sleep,
[00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340]   everything in life is that much more challenging.
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.520]   And one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.480]   is to have the appropriate mattress.
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.440]   Everyone however, has slightly different needs
[00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.220]   in terms of what would be the optimal mattress for them.
[00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.860]   Helix understands that people have unique sleep needs
[00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.980]   and they've designed a brief two minute quiz
[00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.420]   that asks you questions like, do you sleep on your back,
[00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.380]   your side or your stomach?
[00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.060]   Do you tend to run hot or cold during the night?
[00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.300]   Or maybe you don't know the answers to those questions.
[00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.180]   If you go to the Helix site and take that brief quiz,
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.660]   they'll match you to a mattress that's optimal for you.
[00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.580]   For me, it turned out to be the Dusk D-U-S-K mattress.
[00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.020]   It's not too hard, not too soft.
[00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.340]   And I sleep so much better on my Helix mattress
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.820]   than on any other type of mattress I've used before.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.020]   So if you're interested in upgrading your mattress,
[00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.820]   go to helixsleep.com/huberman,
[00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.540]   take their brief two minute sleep quiz,
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.580]   and they'll match you to a customized mattress for you.
[00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:38.820]   And you'll get up to $350 off any mattress order
[00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.100]   and two free pillows.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.220]   Again, that's helixsleep.com/huberman
[00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.680]   to save up to $350 off and two free pillows.
[00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.600]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Woop.
[00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.100]   Woop is a fitness wearable device
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.300]   that tracks your daily activity and sleep,
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.180]   but also goes beyond that by providing real-time feedback
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.380]   on how to adjust your training and sleep schedule
[00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.820]   to perform better.
[00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:00.660]   I've been working with Woop
[00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.660]   on their scientific advisory council
[00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.580]   to try and help advance Woop's mission
[00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:06.540]   of unlocking human performance.
[00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.600]   As a Woop user, I've experienced the health benefits
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.760]   of their technology firsthand for sleep tracking,
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.860]   for monitoring other features of my physiology,
[00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.760]   and for giving me a lot of feedback
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.100]   about metrics within my brain and body
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.500]   that tell me how hard I should train or not train,
[00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:21.860]   and basically point to the things that I'm doing correctly
[00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.580]   and incorrectly in my daily life
[00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.540]   that I can adjust using protocols,
[00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.220]   some of which are actually within the Woop app.
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.520]   Given that many of us have goals
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.300]   such as improving our sleep, building better habits,
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.580]   or just focusing more on our overall health,
[00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.500]   Woop is one of the tools
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.540]   that can really help you get personalized data,
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.640]   recommendations, and coaching toward your overall health.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.160]   If you're interested in trying Woop,
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.880]   you can go to join.woop.com/huberman today
[00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.180]   to get your first month free.
[00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.620]   Again, that's join.woop.com/huberman.
[00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.460]   Today's episode is also brought to us by Waking Up.
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:55.320]   Waking Up is a meditation app
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.220]   that has hundreds of different meditations,
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.500]   as well as scripts for yoga nidra
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.820]   and non-sleep deep rest or NSDR protocols.
[00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.820]   By now, there's an abundance of data showing
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.540]   that even short daily meditations
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.620]   can greatly improve our mood, reduce anxiety,
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:14.140]   improve our ability to focus, and can improve our memory.
[00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.540]   And while there are many different forms of meditation,
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.640]   most people find it difficult to find
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.660]   and stick to a meditation practice in a way
[00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.780]   that is most beneficial for them.
[00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.820]   The Waking Up app makes it extremely easy
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.420]   to learn how to meditate
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.140]   and to carry out your daily meditation practice
[00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.060]   in a way that's going to be most effective
[00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.700]   and efficient for you.
[00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.060]   It includes a variety of different types of meditations
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.260]   of different duration, as well as things like yoga nidra,
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.460]   which place the brain and body into a sort of pseudo sleep
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.580]   that allows you to emerge
[00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.500]   feeling incredibly mentally refreshed.
[00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.180]   In fact, the science around yoga nidra is really impressive,
[00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.460]   showing that after a yoga nidra session,
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.800]   levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.520]   are enhanced by up to 60%,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.760]   which places the brain and body
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.880]   into a state of enhanced readiness
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.360]   for mental work and for physical work.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.400]   Another thing I really like about the Waking Up app
[00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.040]   is that it provides a 30-day introduction course.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:06.640]   So for those of you that have not meditated before
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.120]   or getting back to a meditation practice, that's fantastic.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.200]   Or if you're somebody who's already a skilled
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:13.560]   and regular meditator,
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.480]   Waking Up has more advanced meditations
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.580]   and yoga nidra sessions for you as well.
[00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.460]   If you'd like to try the Waking Up app,
[00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.180]   you can go to wakingup.com/huberman
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.700]   and access a free 30-day trial.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.700]   Again, that's wakingup.com/huberman.
[00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.140]   And now for my conversation with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:33.420]   Professor Matt Walker, welcome back.
[00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.260]   We're all so happy to have you here.
[00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.380]   And in episode one,
[00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.740]   you beautifully described the biology of sleep,
[00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:42.140]   why sleep is important,
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.300]   what happens when we don't get enough sleep,
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.480]   and you incentivized getting adequate amounts
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:50.000]   of great sleep, and you defined what great sleep is,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.840]   and you provided some excellent practical protocols
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.120]   and tools for getting great sleep.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.120]   However, today you're going to tell us, I believe,
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:06.400]   about the protocols for really optimizing one's sleep,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.280]   both conventional tools and protocols
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.040]   and some, let's say, unconventional.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:14.980]   Not heretical, but unconventional tools
[00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:16.840]   for optimizing one's sleep.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:19.480]   So let's start with the basics.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:22.680]   What are the basics of what I think I've heard you refer
[00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.760]   to previously as sleep hygiene?
[00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.760]   - Yeah, I think many of us can resonate
[00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:31.840]   with the idea of dental hygiene,
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.880]   but it turns out there's something called sleep hygiene.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.040]   And there are probably, I would say,
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:42.920]   five edicts of sleep hygiene.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.920]   I offer them as tools and not necessarily rules
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:53.400]   because I don't think people respond to rules.
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.200]   People respond to reasons and not rules.
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.080]   So if it's okay, I'll probably just unpack each one of them
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:01.560]   rather than just sort of bark them at you
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.480]   and hope people assume that it's the right answer.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:06.560]   I'll explain the answer
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.000]   so people understand why it's important.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.920]   So as I said, there are probably five things
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.960]   that you can start doing tonight
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:16.200]   to try to improve your sleep.
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.520]   The first we've spoken a little bit about
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.360]   in that first episode,
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:23.040]   it's part of the four macros of good sleep.
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.240]   First piece of advice, regularity.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.120]   Go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time,
[00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.600]   no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:36.160]   Regularity is king.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:39.240]   And the reason is because when you feed your brain
[00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:43.920]   the signals of timed regularity for your sleep,
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:47.960]   it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:50.520]   and the quality of that sleep.
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.200]   Because part of that signal of regularity
[00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.760]   going into your brain in terms of that repeated behavior,
[00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:59.720]   night after night sleep, in other words,
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.720]   helps train that central 24-hour circadian clock
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.720]   that we also spoke about in the first episode.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.280]   So that's the first piece of advice.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.360]   Try to keep it as regular as you possibly can.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.440]   The second piece of advice is darkness.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.880]   In my view, we are a dark, deprived society
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.760]   in this modern era.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.240]   And we need darkness at night,
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.840]   as well you've spoken about,
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:31.240]   to release a hormone called melatonin.
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.840]   And melatonin will help time
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.000]   the regular onset of your sleep.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.200]   So that sounds great, but boots on the ground, Matt,
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.040]   what does that mean?
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.440]   I would suggest the following.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.280]   In the last hour before bed,
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:50.920]   try to dim down 50%, if not more,
[00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:53.840]   of your lights in your home.
[00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.800]   And you will be quite surprised
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:00.080]   at how sleepy and soporific that will make you feel.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:03.000]   I will do this in a regimented way.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.560]   I have a little reminder that pops up
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:10.320]   and tells me now is the time to dim the lights
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:11.840]   based on your bedtime.
[00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:14.320]   And I'll go around and I'll shut lights down.
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.880]   In my bedroom, I will actually have a smart light bulb,
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.760]   and it is way down to probably
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.840]   as little as maybe five lux.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.480]   And lux is just a metric of the light.
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.560]   It's way down there,
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.480]   and it's also very deep orange, sort of red,
[00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.040]   and we can come on to why that's the case.
[00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:35.920]   So that's the first thing,
[00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:38.040]   even before you're thinking about sleep,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.360]   start to decrease the light.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:45.920]   For example, if you were there at, let's say,
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.600]   for a standard sleep schedule at 10 p.m.,
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:51.920]   and normally you are getting into bed at 10, 30 p.m.,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:54.040]   but you feel pretty wide awake,
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.880]   if there was an electrical blackout
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:59.760]   and you lost your phone, magnetic too,
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:03.160]   phone goes down, lights go down, total blackout,
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   my suspicion is that fairly soon you'd say,
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.520]   "Gosh, I actually feel quite sleepy."
[00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.520]   Whereas if the lights were blazing,
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.640]   you've got your phone, televisions on, lots of stimulation,
[00:10:15.640 --> 00:10:17.360]   you're probably going to think 10, 30,
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.040]   no, I could probably push through
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:20.760]   for at least another hour.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:23.600]   So try to dissipate that light.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.240]   And then if you need to, wear an eye mask,
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.040]   blackout curtains, always good as well.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:32.040]   But we need that darkness at night
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:35.080]   because when you give the brain the signal of darkness,
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.760]   it releases effectively a brake pedal.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.240]   That brake pedal has normally been applied by way of light
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:46.040]   on the release of that spigot of melatonin.
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:47.800]   And when you take the brake pedal off,
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.080]   it starts pumping out into the brain.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.520]   You can also then, of course,
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:58.200]   probably reverse engineer this trick in the morning.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:01.440]   And this is another component of why you've been,
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.640]   I think, such a wonderful advocate
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:06.120]   for light in the morning.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.440]   It does many things, but one of the things that it does
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.680]   is reapply that brake on melatonin
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.360]   and therefore you lose the signal to your brain of darkness.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.000]   That's what melatonin in some ways is doing.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.680]   We often call it the hormone of darkness
[00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.480]   or the vampire hormone.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.760]   Not necessarily 'cause it makes you look longingly
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.400]   at people's necklines and want to bite in,
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:31.240]   which is great if you're into that,
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:35.600]   but it's really simply about it's releasing melatonin,
[00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.640]   which tells the brain, "My goodness, it's nighttime."
[00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.800]   But if you've got bright light on,
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.520]   you come from your office, you're driving home,
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.440]   so you've got artificial light during the day,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:49.080]   which is probably not strong enough to stimulate you
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.320]   and bring you awake.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.000]   You come home and you've got, again, bright light,
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.600]   but it's still strong enough now
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:59.240]   to prevent the release of melatonin.
[00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:01.120]   You start to shift in your timing
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.760]   and you may have problems with your sleep.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.320]   So that's the second piece of advice.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.200]   I would love to ask you about that morning light too
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.280]   and the alertness benefits.
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:11.920]   I'm, as a sleep researcher,
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.520]   more focused on the evening component of light
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:16.800]   and decreasing it, but you've done a great job.
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.400]   I don't know if there's anything-
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.640]   - There are a couple of quick points
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:21.800]   that are based on some,
[00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:24.320]   what I consider really nice studies.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:25.800]   There's beautiful work in humans
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.560]   showing that bright light exposure in the morning,
[00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:29.840]   especially from sunlight,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.520]   but if one doesn't have access to sunlight
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.880]   for whatever reason, there are commercially available
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.800]   so-called SAD lamps, Seasonal Affective Disorder lamps.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.600]   They range anywhere from 5,000 to 10,000 lux, very bright.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.480]   But certainly morning sunlight viewing
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:47.920]   and lamps of the sort I just described
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:50.800]   have been shown to increase the amplitude
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.200]   of the morning cortisol spike by as much as 50%, five zero.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:58.120]   So people hear cortisol and they freak out.
[00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.960]   They think that's not good.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.800]   I want my cortisol low,
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.680]   but you actually want your cortisol highest in the morning
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.920]   and lower in the afternoon and evening.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:09.160]   And there's a lot of reasons for that elevated mood focus
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.160]   and alertness in the morning and throughout the day.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.600]   And ease of getting to sleep at night, lower anxiety,
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.000]   lower depressive symptoms, and so on.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.320]   So that bright light also serves to control
[00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.600]   the amplitude of cortisol in the direction you want
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.160]   in the early part of the day.
[00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.560]   The other thing that's just more of a underlying dynamics
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:29.520]   of the circadian visual system,
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.460]   which is a system that I worked on for years,
[00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:35.060]   these wonderful cells in the eyes
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:36.300]   that are not for image forming,
[00:13:36.300 --> 00:13:38.720]   but rather for detecting sunlight and bright light
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.440]   for sake of setting circadian rhythm,
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:43.720]   is that the sensitivity of that system early in the day
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:44.800]   is actually quite low.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:47.820]   So you need a lot of bright light early in the day
[00:13:47.820 --> 00:13:50.360]   to effectively wake up your system
[00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:53.840]   and shut down the sleepiness signals such as melatonin.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.000]   But later in the day, it's a rather diabolical system.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.900]   It takes very little light, even from artificial sources,
[00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.440]   to disrupt your circadian rhythm and quash melatonin
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:09.400]   as little as 15 seconds of bright light in the evening.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:11.460]   I think Chuck Zeisler's laboratory
[00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:12.920]   at Harvard Medical School showed
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.440]   can quash melatonin in the evening.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:16.760]   Now, I don't want people to freak out
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.640]   and think that if they go into a hotel bathroom,
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:20.280]   which oftentimes those are very bright,
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.000]   in the middle of the night, flip on the light
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.400]   that they're going to completely screw up
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.600]   their circadian rhythms.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:29.500]   But if I'm honest, they'd be much better off
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.800]   using their phone as a flashlight to navigate.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.960]   People always say, well, wait,
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.720]   but the flashlight on the phone is very bright,
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:37.320]   but let's just get logical here.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.840]   A light shown into your eyes, such as a flashlight,
[00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.680]   is very different than looking
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.480]   at a flashlight beam on the ground.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.880]   Far and away difference.
[00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.000]   So the point is that if you don't get enough bright sunlight
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.320]   or light in your eyes early in the day,
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.560]   and then you're indoors under artificial lighting,
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:54.800]   you might think, well, this is really bright lighting.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:55.640]   This is the kind of lighting
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:57.520]   that could disrupt my circadian rhythm at night,
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:00.080]   and therefore it's sufficient to wake up my system.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:02.040]   No, early in the day and throughout the day,
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.640]   you need a lot of bright light,
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:05.800]   as much as safely possible to avoid sunburn
[00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.040]   and things of that sort, which you don't want.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:11.000]   But then as the evening comes around, after sundown,
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.720]   you need very little artificial light
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.360]   in order to disrupt your circadian rhythm.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.200]   And then just very quickly,
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:21.360]   light from candles, fireplaces is okay.
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.200]   This is kind of interesting.
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.760]   It seems bright, but the measurements indicate
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.120]   that that's not gonna shift your circadian rhythm much.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:28.960]   Candles are great,
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.680]   but of course don't burn your house down.
[00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:34.720]   So the orange and red tones in the evening way dim down,
[00:15:34.720 --> 00:15:37.360]   that's the way to go early in the day,
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.560]   bright, bright, bright light,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.240]   as bright as you safely can tolerate.
[00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.800]   - And what I like about, firstly,
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:44.560]   your mention of cortisol.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:47.640]   You described how cortisol is rising in the morning,
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   and that's a great thing, and it is a good thing.
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.840]   And in the evening, it's starting to drop.
[00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:55.640]   And if you look right around your prototypical bedtime,
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.600]   and we're going to speak later in this episode
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:01.320]   as to what your real natural bedtime is
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:05.480]   versus the one that you may be taking right now,
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:06.480]   it's very interesting.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:10.160]   Cortisol will almost hit its lowest point,
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:11.760]   something that we call its nadir,
[00:16:11.760 --> 00:16:15.120]   it's the lowest point in that trough of its decline
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:17.960]   right around the time when you should be sleeping.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.240]   However, there's a great study
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:23.000]   that looked at people with insomnia.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And in subsequent episodes, we'll discuss this too,
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.680]   but one of the ways that we think about
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.360]   or conceptualize insomnia is in two different flavors,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.040]   sleep-onset insomnia, I can't fall asleep,
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.680]   and sleep-maintenance insomnia, I wake up,
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.360]   I can't get back to sleep.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:45.120]   And what they looked at was essentially cortisol levels.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:48.080]   They had a catheter in the arm
[00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:50.240]   and they were sampling it from the bloodstream,
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:52.480]   and they were able to do that every 30 minutes.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:55.520]   So it's a little bit like time-lapse photography,
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:58.080]   and you're getting a data point every 30 minutes
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.120]   across the 24-hour period,
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:04.400]   looking at cortisol across now a full 24-hour period.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.840]   And sure enough, when you look at healthy controls
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.280]   who can sleep well and insomnia patients,
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.560]   they look almost identical across the day.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:15.920]   But then when it comes to falling asleep
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:18.240]   right around that bedtime period,
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.040]   the healthy controls are going all the way down.
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.160]   The insomnia patients go down and down and down,
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.920]   and then they have a rise back up
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.920]   right around that sleep-onset period.
[00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:30.880]   And then they start to drop back down again
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.680]   just as the control group.
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.320]   But then they also often will have a spike
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:39.080]   in the middle of the night, which then comes down.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:41.120]   And then both of them are staying low
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.960]   throughout the early morning period,
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.000]   and then it starts to rise back up.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   So it's not as though net-net overall,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.600]   there is a higher level of cortisol
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:50.680]   in people with insomnia.
[00:17:50.680 --> 00:17:53.240]   It seems to be right at those trigger zones
[00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:56.760]   that map very nicely to sleep-onset problems,
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.080]   sleep maintenance problems.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.200]   - Very interesting.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.880]   As somebody who wakes up in the middle of the night
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.720]   and sometimes has trouble getting back to sleep,
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.320]   that resonates.
[00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.720]   I have no trouble falling asleep whatsoever.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:08.600]   - Yeah.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.960]   - Knock on wood.
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:11.880]   Superstitious about this at this point.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:14.040]   But I use tools like non-sleep deep rest,
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.200]   yoga nidra, long exhale breathing.
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   But, you know, and I think these wake up episodes
[00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:24.160]   seem to happen more when I'm processing a lot of stuff
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:25.560]   from my daily life.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.400]   - That's right.
[00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.040]   - You know, the unconscious brain oftentimes
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:32.800]   is working through things and will wake us up.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:37.200]   - Yeah, I often think that sleep maintenance insomnia
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.840]   that you've just described
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   is the revenge of daytime emotions unresolved.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:45.760]   - That's a great way to put it, yeah.
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:48.040]   - So that would be, so we've spoken about regularity,
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:49.720]   we've spoken about darkness,
[00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:52.040]   and we've spoken about the inverse of that in the morning,
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.320]   which is light, a little bit of cortisol.
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:58.680]   So the third out of the five is going to be temperature.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:01.160]   And the advice here is keep it cool.
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:03.680]   As we mentioned a little bit in the first episode,
[00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.080]   and we will go into great detail
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:07.560]   when we speak not just about these conventional
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.840]   and unconventional tips,
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.640]   but we're also going to go into the future of science
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:14.640]   and where sleep science is taking us to,
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.320]   in fact, optimize and even enhance our sleep.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.560]   We will speak a lot about temperature.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.760]   Suffice to say that you need to drop your core
[00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:26.960]   body temperature and your brain temperature
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:28.800]   by a little less than one degree Celsius,
[00:19:28.800 --> 00:19:30.760]   two to three degrees Fahrenheit
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   to get to sleep and stay asleep.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:37.960]   The general target that we have in sleep science,
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.800]   if you look across the literature,
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.840]   is somewhere around about the 67 degree Fahrenheit,
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:45.720]   or I'm trying to do the calculation,
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:48.800]   maybe 18.5-ish degrees Celsius.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:53.800]   Now I know that that sounds cold and cold it is,
[00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:55.520]   but you can also wear thick socks to bed.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.880]   You can have a hot water bottle at the end of the bed.
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:01.720]   That's great too, but the ambient must be cold.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:06.720]   The fourth piece of advice is walk it out.
[00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:10.400]   And here, what I mean is do not stay in bed
[00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:13.600]   for long periods of time awake.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.920]   And I think we mentioned this perhaps
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.960]   in the first episode too.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:22.160]   When you are awake in your bed for long stretches of time,
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.800]   because your brain is an incredibly associative device,
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:30.800]   it will quickly learn that this thing called my bed
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:34.040]   is the place where I'm awake and not asleep.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:39.200]   And what you need to do is break that association.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.200]   If you've learned that time and time again
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:42.440]   because you've stayed in bed,
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:45.640]   and the rule of thumb, and it's just a rule of thumb,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:48.040]   about 20, 25 minutes,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:51.360]   if you can't fall back asleep or you can't fall asleep,
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   it's okay.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.320]   Just say, "Tonight is not my night.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.800]   "It's not a problem.
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:59.280]   "Tomorrow is not completely shot.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.160]   "It's fine.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:02.200]   "I'm just going to get up, get out of bed."
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:03.560]   If you can, if you're lucky enough,
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.360]   try to go to a different room.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:09.800]   And in dim light, read a book, listen to a podcast,
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.920]   whatever it is that relaxes you, just do that.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.760]   Don't check email, don't eat,
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:15.560]   because if you start eating,
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:18.120]   that again trains your brain to start waking up
[00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.440]   and feeding at that time.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.280]   And only return to bed when you are sleepy.
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:25.520]   And there is no time limit for that.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.280]   I don't want you to come back after half an hour
[00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:32.000]   when you are still awake and not feeling sleepy enough.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:32.840]   Why?
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.240]   Because you're going to get back into bed
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.400]   and be in the same problem again.
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.640]   And gradually, if you do this, and it's hard to do it,
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:43.800]   you will relearn the association that you had,
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:45.360]   I'm sure, as a child,
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:49.000]   which is that your bed is this place of sleepiness.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:50.560]   Because often people will be saying,
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:53.560]   "I feel so tired in the evening."
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.000]   And then they get into bed and they say,
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:58.200]   "But now I can't fall asleep at all.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.480]   "I don't understand it."
[00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:01.840]   In part, it's because of that learned association.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.520]   So that would be the fourth tip.
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:09.520]   The fifth tip makes me even more unpopular
[00:22:09.920 --> 00:22:11.880]   as a personality and character,
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:16.400]   which is try to be mindful of your alcohol and caffeine.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.240]   Now, in a subsequent episode,
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.920]   we'll go into great detail as to how caffeine works,
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.360]   its mechanisms, why it is sleep disruptive,
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.040]   and why, in fact, I've even perhaps changed my mind
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.920]   on caffeine and its benefits.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.560]   But it also does have significant detriments to your sleep.
[00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:39.240]   So the rule of thumb here would be,
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:42.320]   try to cut yourself off from caffeine
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:45.520]   probably at least 10 or so hours
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:47.400]   before you expect to go to bed.
[00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:50.640]   And you can just calculate back, calculate that.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.200]   And try to limit it.
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:55.120]   So the dose and the timing make the poison.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.080]   Cut yourself off after maybe two or three cups of coffee.
[00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:01.640]   And then that timing component,
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.680]   count yourself back, cut yourself off.
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.520]   Decaffeinated coffee, not too bad
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.200]   if you find the right thing to, if you need that fix.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   Alcohol is probably one of the most misunderstood sleep aids,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:18.440]   in quotes, that there is.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:21.080]   It is no sleep aid at all.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:25.920]   Now, if I didn't understand what I know about alcohol and sleep,
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.880]   I would think that too, which is,
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:32.240]   look, when I have a nightcap just before bed or two,
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:34.400]   even though I don't wear them,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:39.200]   I may actually just fall asleep very easily.
[00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.000]   It feels like I stay asleep very soundly across the night.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:46.600]   So it's a great sleep aid and it really helps me.
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.520]   There are at least, I would say, three issues with alcohol.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:53.280]   The first is that alcohol is in a class of drugs
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:55.720]   that we call the sedatives.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.400]   And sedation is not sleep.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:02.360]   But when you take on board alcohol in the evening,
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:04.920]   you mistake the former for the latter
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.440]   and you think it helps you fall asleep.
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:12.000]   The second thing is that because it's sedation,
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:14.560]   or actually it's probably related to sedation,
[00:24:14.560 --> 00:24:19.400]   if I were to show you the electrical signature of your deep sleep
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.640]   when you're just sleeping naturally
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.280]   versus when you have alcohol in your system,
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.880]   it's not really the same.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.560]   It's not a naturalistic form of deep sleep.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.040]   It mimics it, it looks not too dissimilar.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.200]   But if I really do my analyses and I almost like that Pink Floyd album
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:37.680]   where I take the white light of electrical brain activity
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:39.840]   coming from your head as you're sleeping
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:42.560]   and split it apart into all of the different components,
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.640]   there are some components that are no longer present
[00:24:45.640 --> 00:24:48.120]   or some that are abnormally present.
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:52.040]   The second issue with alcohol is that it fragments your sleep.
[00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.640]   So it will litter your sleep
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.640]   with all these punctuated awakenings throughout the night.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:25:01.320]   The danger there is that many of those awakenings with alcohol
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:05.240]   you don't remember because they're too brief.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:07.320]   But then you wake up the next day and you think,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.320]   "Well, I didn't have a problem falling asleep.
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:11.800]   I didn't have a problem staying asleep.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:14.160]   But I just feel rough.
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:16.840]   I just don't feel restored by my sleep."
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.920]   And you don't add two and two together.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.240]   The final concern with alcohol is that it's quite a potent blocker
[00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:27.680]   of your rapid eye movement sleep or REM sleep.
[00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:31.400]   And in subsequent episodes, we'll go into great detail
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:36.640]   as to the incredible learning and memory creativity benefits
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.240]   that come by way of REM sleep.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:42.080]   Also, it's essential for our emotional regulation
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:45.240]   and recalibrating our moods.
[00:25:45.240 --> 00:25:50.120]   So for all of those reasons, I would say two things.
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:52.360]   First, if you are struggling with sleep,
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:54.800]   not feeling restored by your sleep,
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.960]   keep in mind your alcohol intake.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.040]   And also just in general, be mindful of that
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.600]   if you are thinking about your sleep and want to preserve it.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.880]   - So much of what you just said resonates.
[00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:08.560]   I confess that in my lifetime,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:12.560]   I've had periods of pretty spectacular sleep.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.200]   I characterize myself as somebody
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   that could fall asleep anywhere, anytime.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:22.720]   But I've also experienced the extreme challenges of sleep.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.320]   And that relates to different things,
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:26.680]   life circumstances, et cetera.
[00:26:26.680 --> 00:26:29.120]   In fact, recently, I've had some challenges with sleep
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:33.400]   despite using the protocols that I and others suggest.
[00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:37.680]   I hadn't heard some of the things that you're referring to here.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.720]   And middle-of-the-night waking has become more of an issue.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:45.440]   I communicated this to a former girlfriend of mine
[00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:50.760]   who I was in relationship with when I was a junior professor,
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:52.440]   meaning before I got tenure.
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:54.960]   And she said, "You don't remember.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.440]   You had a," Andrew, "But I do.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:27:01.400]   You had a pattern back then of after I would fall asleep,
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.720]   you would continue working on your laptop,"
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.680]   probably on Grants.
[00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:09.000]   "And then I would fall asleep working.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.120]   And then according to her,
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:11.360]   I would wake up in the middle of the night
[00:27:11.360 --> 00:27:14.000]   and work a little bit until I'd get tired again
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.080]   and then fall asleep, and then this would repeat."
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:22.000]   So really stamping down the associative learning element
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.040]   that you talked about before.
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.000]   So that was probably the first period of time in my life
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.920]   in which I created this rather deleterious association
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.480]   of work in the middle of the night in bed, right?
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:39.720]   And then more recently, I've had the experience of waking up,
[00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:41.920]   probably due to these like daytime things
[00:27:41.920 --> 00:27:45.040]   that I'm waking up in the middle of the night thinking about.
[00:27:45.040 --> 00:27:46.960]   And now because of our discussion
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.440]   during the course of recording this series,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.080]   I get out of bed after even 10, 15 minutes
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:55.880]   so that I can start to eliminate that association.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.680]   And another piece is that I've always felt
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:00.720]   that when I get out of bed in the middle of the night
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.720]   because I can't sleep and I go to the sofa,
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:04.840]   I often can sleep very well.
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:07.480]   And the reason being, right, it's a control experiment,
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:12.000]   proving that the location of sleep is...
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.720]   and the association of wakefulness and sleep in bed
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.400]   as opposed to on the sofa is a clear component.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.800]   And this is in an environment that's of equal temperature.
[00:28:19.800 --> 00:28:21.960]   I mean, it's not a perfect experiment, right?
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:23.400]   It's anecdata, as we say.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:28.760]   But I think that the associative piece is, oh, so strong
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:29.600]   for many people.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.000]   And so this is something to really take seriously.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.200]   - I love that notion of people will often say,
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:37.240]   "I just get up, I go to the couch or the sofa,
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:40.680]   "and that's where I'll wake up in the morning."
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:44.200]   Also, they'll say, "When I travel and I go to a hotel room,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.880]   "I just can sleep fine."
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:47.520]   Now, for some people, it's the inverse,
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.840]   but for those people, it's the contextual difference,
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:55.720]   meaning the change of the environment is so unfamiliar
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.360]   that it has not been bound to the association
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.200]   of wakefulness, it's related to sleep
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.520]   or at least the opportunity to sleep.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:06.520]   Sometimes even I've heard from some people,
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.800]   there's no studies or data on this,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.480]   even turning yourself around.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.080]   Now, this is hard if you have a partner in bed,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.720]   but you just switch top to bottom of the bed
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.120]   and you take your pillow
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:20.880]   and you pull the duvet all the way down
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.560]   and you put the pillow at the opposite end
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.560]   where your feet used to be and you get into bed.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:26.320]   And even just looking around
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:28.360]   and sort of having a difference,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:33.320]   that alone is so subtle, but it can make a real difference.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:35.920]   So again, just keep these things in mind.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.920]   I know it sounds strange or this whole sort of get up,
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:42.320]   get out of bed, break the association.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.080]   And we'll come on to something.
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:45.560]   Well, actually I'll come on to it now
[00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:47.280]   'cause I think it's one of the unconventional tips
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.520]   and you mentioned it.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.680]   A lot of people say to me, "That all sounds great.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.320]   "Science makes sense."
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:57.040]   I just don't, it's dark, it's kind of cold.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:59.520]   I really don't want to get out of bed.
[00:29:59.520 --> 00:30:01.760]   So give me some alternatives.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.680]   I think the single best piece
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:09.240]   of unconventional sleep advice I can give you
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:14.240]   is do anything that gets your mind off itself.
[00:30:14.240 --> 00:30:18.600]   The principal reason that if you look at insomnia
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:21.520]   as a physiological condition or current working model
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:25.000]   mechanistically of how insomnia plays out
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   is that you are in this state of almost low level anxiety
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:34.200]   and you are somewhat stressed.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:37.080]   And when you go to sleep or you try to go to sleep
[00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.800]   or you wake back up and you try to get back to sleep,
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.560]   you just have this Rolodex of anxiety.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:47.040]   In the modern world, we are constantly on reception
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.480]   and very rarely do we do reflection.
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:52.520]   And unfortunately for many of us,
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:54.400]   and I've been guilty of this,
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.480]   the only time we do reflection
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.000]   is when our head is placed on the pillow
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:00.320]   and we turn the light out.
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   And that is the last time you want to be doing reflection.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:06.440]   That's the worst moment.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.480]   And at that point,
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:11.000]   I think everyone can empathize with the idea
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:14.840]   of you turn the light out, you're under stress,
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:17.280]   your mind goes to those few things.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.800]   In the darkness of night,
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:24.120]   thoughts become almost 10 times worse than they do
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:25.680]   in the bright of day.
[00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:29.840]   And at that moment, you start to ruminate.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:33.200]   When you ruminate, you begin to catastrophize.
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.840]   And when you catastrophize,
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:38.000]   you're dead in the water for the next two hours.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.440]   So what do you do?
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:43.200]   The problem is, as I said, your mind is on itself
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.160]   and it's going through these repeated loops.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.680]   Anything you can do, for example,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.280]   you can do some kind of a meditation.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:55.840]   And when I was researching data for my book some years ago,
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:59.160]   I did look into meditation and I wasn't a meditator.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.840]   I was a hard-nosed scientist.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.440]   I didn't really kind of embrace with that notion
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:09.320]   or even that group of people.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:12.160]   But time and again, I read paper after paper
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.520]   and the data was very strong
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.040]   and it was coming from research groups
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:17.920]   that I respected very much indeed.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.200]   So I thought, well, okay,
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:22.120]   I should probably give this a try.
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.080]   And that was six years ago.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.120]   And since then, I now meditate for 10 minutes
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.120]   every single night before bed.
[00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:33.400]   I do a guided meditation 'cause I'm not particularly skilled.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   So I use an app that moves me through that.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.800]   But you can do whatever meditation you like.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.120]   That's one example.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:46.360]   The second example is you can do breathing methods
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.200]   because again, you're focused on your breath.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.320]   And what are you not focused on?
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:53.640]   Your thoughts. (laughs)
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.280]   And so anything that will allow you
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:01.760]   to explore some other focus,
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.040]   maybe it's a body scan
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.320]   where you start at the top of your head
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.400]   or you start at your feet and you work your way up
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.880]   and you just say, moving through now my neck,
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.360]   what sensations am I feeling?
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:16.760]   Now into my shoulders, moving down into my chest now,
[00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:19.520]   I can feel the ends of my fingers.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.440]   Am I sensing anything?
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:23.880]   And when you start doing that
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   or any of these types of things,
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.320]   the next thing that you remember
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.640]   is your alarm going off in the morning
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.160]   because you got your mind off itself.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.640]   So I would say that that's probably
[00:33:34.640 --> 00:33:36.400]   one of the unconventional tips.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.560]   But let me come back to the conventional.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.000]   Anything else I've probably missed out
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   or been unclear about there?
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.440]   Actually, I should probably say one thing
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.120]   in terms of these, they're not tips.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   I don't like the word.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.960]   I know you don't either or hacks
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.640]   these are protocols
[00:33:52.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   and they're well-informed scientific protocols.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.560]   In all of this discussion today,
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   you can get all of these things in place
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.360]   and still have problems with sleep.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:06.720]   The reason is because you may be suffering
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:07.920]   from a sleep disorder.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.800]   So the analogy would be,
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:11.880]   let's say that I'm your athletic coach
[00:34:11.880 --> 00:34:14.240]   and you're a sports superstar.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.440]   I can perfect everything.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.360]   I can perfect your diet, your supplements.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.960]   We can perfect your technique.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.560]   We can perfect.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:26.040]   But if you've got a broken ankle,
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:28.520]   none of those things are going to alter
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.880]   your performance right now.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.720]   You've got to get to a doctor
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:32.720]   and get that seen to.
[00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.320]   And then we can come back
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.400]   to fine tuning your performance.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.520]   It's the same with sleep.
[00:34:37.520 --> 00:34:38.760]   If you've got a sleep disorder,
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:41.760]   such as snoring, sleep apnea, or insomnia,
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.600]   we need to get you to a doctor first.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.080]   And then only after that,
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.120]   come back once you're resolved,
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:48.960]   then we can start to optimize.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:49.960]   That's the only other thing
[00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.840]   I probably should mention.
[00:34:51.840 --> 00:34:53.760]   - Yeah, this is all very useful discussion
[00:34:53.760 --> 00:34:56.200]   because I think that, of course,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:57.640]   there will be those folks out there
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.920]   that just like, what are they talking about?
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.520]   I sleep so well.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:02.640]   Consider yourself blessed.
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:04.120]   Many, many people struggle
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.640]   with challenges with sleep.
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.360]   And I think it's fair to say
[00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.520]   that sooner or later,
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.480]   most everybody experiences some challenges
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.760]   with sleep for whatever reason.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:14.640]   - You look at the statistics,
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:16.720]   that's highly likely in your lifetime,
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:17.840]   you are more than likely
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.360]   to go through either a period
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.000]   of challenging sleep,
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.640]   or in fact, a bout of insomnia.
[00:35:23.640 --> 00:35:24.920]   - I'd like to take a brief break
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.240]   and acknowledge our sponsor, AG1.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:29.800]   AG1 is a vitamin mineral probiotic drink
[00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:31.400]   that also contains adaptogens
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:32.840]   and is designed to meet
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.040]   all of your foundational nutritional needs.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.160]   By now, I'm sure you've all heard me say
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.400]   that I've been taking AG1 since 2012.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:41.200]   And indeed, that is true.
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:42.040]   Now, of course,
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.520]   I do consume regular whole foods every day.
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:46.400]   I strive to get those foods mostly
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.200]   from unprocessed or minimally processed sources.
[00:35:49.200 --> 00:35:50.800]   However, I do find it hard
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.040]   to get enough servings of fruits
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:53.400]   and vegetables each day.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:55.760]   So with AG1, I ensure that I get enough
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:58.120]   of the vitamins, minerals, prebiotic fiber
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.400]   and other things typically found
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:00.480]   in fruits or vegetables.
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:01.840]   And of course, I still make sure
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.160]   to eat fruits and vegetables.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.360]   And in that way, provide a sort of insurance
[00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:07.000]   that I'm getting enough of what I need.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.320]   In addition, the adaptogens
[00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:10.480]   and other micronutrients in AG1
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:12.000]   really help buffer against stress
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:13.720]   and ensure that the cells and organs
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.920]   and tissues of my body
[00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:16.560]   are getting the things they need.
[00:36:16.560 --> 00:36:17.400]   People often ask me
[00:36:17.400 --> 00:36:19.320]   that if they were gonna take just one supplement,
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.560]   what that supplement should be.
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:22.680]   And I always answer AG1.
[00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.240]   If you'd like to try AG1,
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.160]   you can go to drinkag1.com/huberman
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.560]   to claim a special offer.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.240]   You'll get five free travel packs
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:32.800]   plus a year supply of vitamin D3 K2.
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:37.200]   Again, that's drinkag1.com/huberman.
[00:36:37.200 --> 00:36:38.600]   You talked about alcohol.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:41.880]   I'm not a consumer of alcohol anymore.
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.720]   - Nor am I.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.360]   And it's not 'cause I have anything
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:45.200]   against it.
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:46.440]   - Yeah, many people do enjoy it
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.120]   and we're not calling judgment on them.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:54.000]   I mean, certainly much of the world enjoys alcohol.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.360]   Could we talk a little bit more about,
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:59.480]   aside from demolishing REM sleep,
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:05.400]   do we know that alcohol causes these disruptions
[00:37:05.400 --> 00:37:06.440]   in sleep directly,
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.520]   meaning by changing the pattern
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:11.160]   of release of neurotransmitters like GABA,
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.000]   things of that sort,
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:13.880]   or is this an indirect effect?
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:16.000]   Is this like through the gut microbiome
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.280]   that then impacts sleep?
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:20.640]   And the reason I ask is maybe we could get
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:25.480]   to some more specific do's and do not protocols.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.320]   So for instance,
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:28.120]   if somebody wants to have a cocktail,
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:30.280]   how close to sleep can they get
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   and not diminish their rapid eye movement sleep too much?
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:38.720]   You know, because people are still going to want to drink.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.800]   And with that said,
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.800]   if people do have a couple of drinks
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.520]   and then they go to sleep,
[00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.440]   is there anything they can do prior to sleep
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:51.440]   to try and rescue some of their quality sleep?
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:52.600]   - Great question.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:54.480]   So in terms of the mechanism,
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:57.480]   it seems actually not to be the alcohol,
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:02.000]   but some of the metabolic by-products of alcohol.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.200]   We think that perhaps the main culprit
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.040]   may be some of the aldehydes
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:09.680]   that are the metabolic separate consequences
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:11.600]   of alcohol metabolism.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.720]   You make a good point though,
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:19.720]   in terms of the dose response timing curve,
[00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:24.600]   how late or how early do I have to cut myself off
[00:38:24.600 --> 00:38:25.680]   from alcohol?
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:27.080]   People have done those studies
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.600]   and they have found that even an afternoon
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:31.160]   single glass of wine,
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:33.600]   if you measure sleep in the way that we measure it
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:35.920]   at Bicenter with high fidelity,
[00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:38.920]   you can see compromises and impairments.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.300]   I wish I could tell you otherwise.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:45.480]   I would say that based on that data,
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.560]   the principal protocol advice I would have for you
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.840]   is go to the pub in the morning.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.760]   That way, by the time you're about to sleep,
[00:38:52.760 --> 00:38:54.760]   the alcohol is out your system and you could...
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:38:55.880]   No, no, I would never.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:38:57.920]   As a public scientist,
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.040]   I would never advocate necessarily for morning.
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:00.920]   I'm just kidding you.
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   But that's sort of one of the unfortunate consequences
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.360]   that does seem to be an impact.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.880]   To say that there isn't
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:14.800]   is just me not being truthful about the data.
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   But again, if you think about the trade-off here,
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.920]   if you're going out or you're having friends over
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:26.160]   and you're gonna make an incredible evening of memories
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.280]   and you're going to open a favorite bottle of wine
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:30.400]   and have a couple of glasses of wine,
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:31.960]   is your sleep going to be compromised?
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.200]   Yes, it is.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.320]   But maybe that's worth the trade-off
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.960]   for that specific night.
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   I would just not wish you to...
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.560]   And you've spoken a lot
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:44.320]   and so has our dear friend, Peter Attir and others.
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:48.680]   There just doesn't seem to be any safe amount of alcohol.
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:52.920]   But I would say, think about that trade-off simply.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.160]   However, don't make it a habit that you're doing it
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:59.680]   multiple nights a week or more.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:01.640]   That would probably be the advice.
[00:40:01.640 --> 00:40:02.480]   - Great.
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:06.880]   What about food and sleep?
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.640]   How close to sleep is it okay to have a meal
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.480]   if you want to optimize your sleep?
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   I like to eat my final meal somewhere around 6.30 p.m.
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:23.960]   And I go to sleep somewhere around 8.30, 9 p.m.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:26.760]   In an ideal world, sometimes I go to sleep a bit later.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.120]   Sometimes I eat a little bit later.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   It's just, there's some variability with these.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.400]   But put differently,
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.640]   what is the relationship between food intake
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:39.360]   and sleep quality in terms of timing of food intake?
[00:40:39.360 --> 00:40:41.120]   And then perhaps we can talk a little bit
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:43.760]   about food macronutrients.
[00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:45.000]   - It's very interesting.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.520]   There was somewhat of a dogma out there
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:52.160]   that we have to stop eating three or four hours
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.440]   before bed for optimal sleep.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:57.680]   If you look at the data, the data is quite a spread,
[00:40:57.680 --> 00:40:58.640]   no pun intended.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:41:02.320]   There are some people for whom that works very well.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.280]   And if they eat even two hours before bed,
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.680]   they just get disrupted in terms of their sleep.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:14.320]   Some of that is about people just feeling too full
[00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.560]   and not feeling comfortable.
[00:41:16.560 --> 00:41:19.520]   Other aspects are that when you become recumbent,
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:21.000]   when you lie down,
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.520]   you have a higher risk of gastric reflux coming back up
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.920]   and therefore you get heartburn and that's pretty miserable.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.360]   And people will describe that too
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:33.080]   by way of closer proximity of food intake
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:35.720]   relative to when you're falling asleep.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.960]   Nevertheless, if you look at the data,
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:43.200]   and I did a recent very deep dive on this personally myself
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:45.600]   about 12 months ago,
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:50.000]   it's not quite as extreme as the dogma makes out.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.560]   If you eat two hours before bed on average,
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:56.240]   it doesn't seem to necessarily harm your sleep.
[00:41:56.240 --> 00:41:58.000]   Now that's very different than saying
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.080]   what is best to improve or enhance your sleep.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.240]   But the way these studies were designed,
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.480]   it was looking at detriments.
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:09.320]   They then went to 90 minutes before sleep onset.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.800]   And even there, there didn't seem to be marked impairments.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:17.760]   60 minutes, you started to see maybe some signs,
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:21.360]   but on average, the effect size was somewhat weak.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:25.520]   But then when you get close to sort of 45 minutes or so,
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:29.120]   then things did start to deteriorate.
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:32.720]   I think it depends hugely on your chronotype
[00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:35.040]   and also just on your appetite,
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   circadian rhythm preferences too.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.480]   I am someone who I do not feel very hungry
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.160]   when I first wake up in the morning.
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.360]   I don't feel very hungry throughout most of the day.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:49.320]   And I will onboard most of my calories
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.880]   probably in the hours,
[00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.120]   probably in about a four-hour period,
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:59.960]   maybe less, even three-hour period.
[00:42:59.960 --> 00:43:02.080]   And then I will cut myself off
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:05.600]   about 90 minutes before sleep.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.400]   So classically, I would have been considered
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   as violating this sleep dogma
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.760]   of cutting yourself off at least three hours.
[00:43:14.760 --> 00:43:16.880]   I think it's very personal though.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.520]   Just experiment with it.
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:20.520]   You will know the situation.
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:26.120]   As for macros and specific food components,
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.360]   the data is a little bit mixed.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:32.120]   Certainly what we know is that if you're eating a diet
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:38.480]   that is high in sugar and low in protein,
[00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:41.280]   your sleep is worse.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.120]   Why would that be the case?
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.240]   Well, one of the reasons that we think is that if you onboard sugar,
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.040]   it can be somewhat metabolically active.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.120]   And when it becomes metabolically active,
[00:43:53.120 --> 00:43:55.240]   it can increase your body temperature,
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:58.000]   your core body temperature, even just very subtly.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.120]   But that's enough to disrupt your sleep as we spoke about with temperature.
[00:44:03.120 --> 00:44:08.000]   But I think in terms of really the...
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.480]   what would be the ideal macro-nutrient
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:15.480]   and even micro-nutrient dietary recommendation
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.080]   that I would have for you,
[00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:21.880]   I don't think we have enough data yet above and beyond that statement.
[00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:29.840]   Yeah, I've experienced when I eat a very low-carbohydrate diet,
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:32.240]   which I've experimented with in the past,
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:35.160]   maybe even full ketogenic diet for brief periods of time,
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.000]   although I'm an omnivore, so I eat meat and eggs,
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.560]   and I also eat starches, pastas, rice, et cetera.
[00:44:41.560 --> 00:44:45.920]   But we know, based on beautiful work from, for example,
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.000]   Chris Palmer from Harvard Medical School,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.440]   who is a guest on this podcast.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.480]   I listened to that. It was a great podcast.
[00:44:52.480 --> 00:44:54.160]   Yeah, Chris is spectacular
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:59.520]   and has advocated the exploration of ketogenic diets
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:01.760]   for the treatment of various psychiatric conditions,
[00:45:01.760 --> 00:45:03.360]   not all, but psychiatric conditions.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.840]   And it seems, and he agreed with me on this,
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:10.800]   that when people go on very low-starch, very low-carbohydrate diets,
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:13.600]   that sometimes they can experience a bit of hypomania.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:17.280]   Some people can and challenge this with sleep.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:21.120]   And sometimes there are psychiatric reasons
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:25.480]   why people stay on those diets anyway,
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.800]   and then they have to do other things to encourage their sleep,
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.240]   either pharmacology or supplementation or some combination.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:33.440]   But I can say anecdotally for myself,
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:38.440]   if I don't eat starches for a extended amount of time,
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:42.400]   a couple of days, I find it very hard to get quality sleep,
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:45.280]   as indicated by sleep trackers,
[00:45:45.280 --> 00:45:53.520]   and just latency to fall asleep is longer than it is, et cetera.
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:59.120]   So, I've opted to eat most of my carbohydrates later in the evening,
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.280]   which kind of violates every rule of eat your carbs early in the day.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.120]   And I think there are some data to support
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.720]   that eating carbohydrates early in the day
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.600]   may actually have certain benefits for weight maintenance or weight loss.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:14.000]   So, I realized that, but those aren't my goals at the moment,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.120]   weight maintenance, yes, weight loss, no.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.600]   So, I think I've certainly feel after eating a dinner
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:23.680]   that has a bit more starch, pasta, rice, these things of that sort,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:26.320]   and a little bit lower protein as opposed to the inverse,
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:29.360]   like eating a couple of ribeye steaks and a salad,
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.840]   but no starch, that my sleep is substantially better.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:38.480]   And I always attributed that to the relationship
[00:46:38.480 --> 00:46:42.440]   between some of these starches and the tryptophan/serotonin pathway.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:46.880]   There is some data on that with the carbohydrate intake in the evening.
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:52.240]   And of course, that tryptophan and that carbohydrate intake
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:55.120]   will contain the precursor ingredients
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.640]   to something else that we've spoken about, which is melatonin.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:47:02.560]   And so, that may actually help healthily boost that melatonin signal.
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:06.720]   And there's a little bit of data on that to support it too.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.680]   We also did a study where we were looking at night-to-night-to-night sleep
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.960]   and carbohydrate intake the next day.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.800]   And it did seem to support what you're describing
[00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.680]   in terms of some of the carbohydrate benefits.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:24.200]   We also found a strange result that was almost the opposite prediction
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:27.400]   that we made, carbohydrate intake in the morning
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.280]   to equally help people wake up.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.000]   And we were a little bit uncertain as to why,
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.040]   but we're going to go into more detail.
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:43.000]   The reason that you mentioned the suggestion of not to take on carbs in the evening
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:49.800]   is in part based on the evidence that your body's ability to dispose of sugar
[00:47:49.800 --> 00:47:54.360]   and obviously when you're eating carbohydrate you can have a higher spike of sugar.
[00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.560]   Now that in part depends on what you're eating with that carbohydrate
[00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.240]   and also of course the nature of that carbohydrate,
[00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.480]   whether it's simple or whether it's complex,
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:10.480]   whether it's simple sugars versus complex more starchy carbohydrate.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:12.800]   But the idea is that your body,
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.720]   even if you were to eat the same amount of carbohydrate in the morning,
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:22.120]   in the afternoon or in the evening, same carbohydrate dose and type,
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.840]   but your body's ability to dispose of that
[00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:28.120]   without having excessive spikes of glucose
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:30.440]   is worse in the evening, better in the morning,
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:35.800]   i.e. if you're concerned about your blood sugar and your metabolic health,
[00:48:35.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   maybe that's what you should do.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:45.440]   I think that that data is unclear on the basis of if you are glycemic normal,
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:49.200]   meaning that you currently do not have signs of type 2 diabetes
[00:48:49.200 --> 00:48:53.080]   or you're not prediabetic, then that may not necessarily be the case.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:56.400]   And so I think that's why it could be beneficial for you
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:49:00.160]   and I know that you think deeply about that.
[00:49:00.160 --> 00:49:03.520]   I've even been tracking blood sugar as well, I don't have any signs of that,
[00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:05.720]   but I'm just fascinated by some of that data
[00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.760]   and how it interacts with my sleep because I'm a sleep nerd.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:13.160]   So I think right now we just don't have plentiful data
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:18.960]   to recommend a particular sleep "diet" for improved optimization.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:22.760]   I would say though that we can be a little bit more relaxed
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:25.200]   about the timing of our food.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:27.560]   Earlier you mentioned caffeine
[00:49:27.560 --> 00:49:33.320]   and caffeine is a topic that we get into substantial depth in episode 3,
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:38.360]   but there and now I will emphasize that
[00:49:38.360 --> 00:49:41.920]   caffeine is the most commonly used drug worldwide.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:46.520]   I think the statistics says that 90 plus percent of adults
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:51.040]   consume caffeinated beverages every day, which is remarkable.
[00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.680]   And a few years back, I recall there was an article in The Economist
[00:49:53.680 --> 00:49:59.520]   that charted the countries for which the caffeine consumption was highest.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:07.080]   And way out on the peak, peak, peak of almost triple or quadruple
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:13.920]   what the second place country consumed each day was,
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:16.880]   can you guess the country that consumes the most caffeine?
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:18.720]   Could be tea, coffee, any form.
[00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:20.960]   I'm going to suggest it's a Scandinavian country.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:24.280]   No, but they're up there.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:25.800]   It was Switzerland.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:27.640]   Now, I don't know if that's still the case,
[00:50:27.640 --> 00:50:28.800]   but apparently the Swiss-
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.480]   - The reason I went, I was thinking it was,
[00:50:30.480 --> 00:50:32.440]   because I've seen the graph, I was thinking it was Sweden,
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:34.040]   but hence the Scandinavian.
[00:50:34.040 --> 00:50:35.800]   - And if I have that wrong,
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:38.040]   certainly someone will put it in the comments on YouTube.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.440]   - No, I'm sure you're right and I was wrong with Sweden.
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:42.760]   - But as I recall, the Swiss drink so much caffeine.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:44.560]   They have a lot to think about.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.120]   So I love caffeine.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:51.000]   I drink black coffee, black espresso and yerba mate.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.120]   I love yerba mate.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:54.840]   I've been drinking it since I was a little one
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.400]   because of the Argentines in my family.
[00:50:57.400 --> 00:50:59.520]   And I drink it in the early part of the day,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:02.800]   typically a couple hours after waking or so,
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:04.920]   I'll have my first sip of caffeine.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.640]   And then I try to stop drinking caffeine
[00:51:07.640 --> 00:51:10.440]   somewhere around noon or 1 p.m.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.080]   Occasionally, I'll have a shot or two of espresso
[00:51:13.080 --> 00:51:14.280]   in the early afternoon
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:16.200]   if there's important work to be done
[00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:17.040]   and I need to do that.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.560]   But I've noticed that even that can alter my sleep
[00:51:20.560 --> 00:51:22.440]   in ways that I don't like.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:24.200]   But that afternoon coffee, for some reason,
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.520]   tastes so much better than the morning coffee for me.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.720]   I don't know what it is.
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:31.400]   So it's coffee, yerba mate packed early into the day
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:33.520]   and a lot of it for me.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.480]   I have a high tolerance for it, but then I let it taper.
[00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:43.120]   Is that an optimal contour of caffeine intake?
[00:51:43.120 --> 00:51:44.640]   Would zero caffeine be better
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.280]   if someone's just really committed to sleep
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.760]   and they don't like caffeine?
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.600]   Would zero be better than any?
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.040]   And what about that afternoon coffee
[00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:55.440]   or tea containing caffeine?
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.400]   I mean, how disruptive is it for sleep?
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.920]   - So the profile that you described,
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.920]   which is high peak early on,
[00:52:02.920 --> 00:52:04.200]   first thing when you wake up
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:06.040]   and then tapering off nicely down
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:09.880]   into the sort of early afternoon, ideal.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:12.000]   That sounds great to me.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.360]   As for that afternoon coffee,
[00:52:14.360 --> 00:52:17.400]   it really depends again on when you're expecting
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.240]   to go to sleep.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.200]   Now, for someone like you,
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:24.080]   I would say I would love to look at abstaining from that
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:25.680]   or just switching it out to,
[00:52:25.680 --> 00:52:29.280]   if you're using these pods or however you're brewing it,
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:33.320]   let's just switch it out and do an experiment for two weeks.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:38.000]   And we will look to see how much is that afternoon coffee
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.240]   really impacting your sleep?
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.280]   And we'll track your sleep
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:43.200]   with some degree of high fidelity with a wearable.
[00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:46.480]   And let's test that hypothesis
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.400]   because you go to sleep quite early.
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.320]   You are an early bird,
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:54.360]   maybe bordering on an extreme early bird.
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.240]   And we'll speak about,
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:53:00.120]   we have spoken about those different flavors of chronotype.
[00:53:00.120 --> 00:53:06.880]   I would prefer you not to be having that caffeine
[00:53:07.160 --> 00:53:10.880]   in the afternoon based on how early you go to sleep.
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:13.320]   And I mentioned that preference
[00:53:13.320 --> 00:53:14.680]   because of what you described
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:19.160]   regarding your sleep maintenance insomnia.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:20.880]   One of the issues with caffeine
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:23.280]   is that not only can it make it more difficult
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:24.680]   for you to fall asleep,
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.280]   which you don't have in part
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:28.800]   because if you're waking up quite frequently
[00:53:28.800 --> 00:53:31.240]   throughout the night and struggling to get back to sleep,
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.160]   you're going to be carrying a sleep debt into every night
[00:53:35.160 --> 00:53:37.120]   and that debt continues to grow.
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:39.440]   And it's almost like compounding interest on a loan.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:41.600]   So you will not have a problem falling asleep.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:45.600]   In fact, sometimes the speed with which people fall asleep
[00:53:45.600 --> 00:53:47.920]   and some of these sleep trackers
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.320]   will almost penalize you for falling asleep too quickly
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:55.320]   is because in sleep science and clinical sleep medicine,
[00:53:55.320 --> 00:53:58.320]   if you're, it should take you somewhere,
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:03.320]   healthy sleep onset, five to 15, 20 minutes.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:07.720]   But if you put your head on the pillow
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:10.800]   and you turn off the light and within a minute or so,
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:13.040]   you're dead to the world and you're gone.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.400]   I'm exactly, I'm worried that you're
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:16.760]   A, carrying a sleep debt.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:18.000]   Now, not necessarily,
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.440]   but I would like to explore it with you.
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:24.960]   And then I would say, even if you can fall asleep fine,
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:29.520]   this factor of waking up in the middle of the night
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:31.000]   is also related to caffeine.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:31.840]   Why?
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.960]   Because caffeine not only can make it harder to fall asleep,
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.240]   not your problem,
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:40.440]   but it keeps you out of that deep, deep sleep.
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.800]   And it puts you into a more shallow state
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:45.360]   of non-rapid eye movement sleep.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:48.120]   And when you are in the shallow state,
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:52.320]   it's A, easier for you to be woken up,
[00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:55.960]   but B, and I think more of the problem,
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:58.760]   it's harder for you to fall back asleep
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:00.880]   because your brain doesn't necessarily want
[00:55:00.880 --> 00:55:03.000]   to go back down into that deep sleep
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:06.080]   and nor has it come up out of that deep sleep.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:08.200]   So you're not in that wonderful, glorious,
[00:55:08.200 --> 00:55:11.520]   thick, treacly sort of sleepy state.
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:13.480]   When you wake up, you go to the restroom,
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.560]   you come back and you just know,
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:17.280]   oh, this is gonna be great.
[00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:20.240]   As long as I can fumble my way back to my mattress,
[00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:21.920]   I'm gonna be asleep within another two minutes
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:22.760]   going back to it.
[00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.520]   Whereas for you, you probably wake up
[00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:26.480]   and you feel pretty wide awake.
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.080]   I would like to see what happens
[00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:30.280]   when we negate that afternoon coffee
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:32.760]   on the frequency and the duration
[00:55:32.760 --> 00:55:36.000]   of those middle of the night awakenings for you.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:37.720]   - Yeah, I'm definitely making the effort
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:39.880]   to avoid caffeine intake in the afternoon.
[00:55:39.880 --> 00:55:42.400]   And I think I'm already starting to see
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.960]   some of the positive benefits of doing that
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.920]   as evidenced by the days that I consume caffeine
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:50.840]   in the afternoon and experience the deficits.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:51.680]   It's a real thing.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:55.720]   And I believe you've about the numbers
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.680]   on a different podcast previously.
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.320]   Talk a little bit about the metabolism of caffeine
[00:56:00.320 --> 00:56:02.600]   and maybe even some of the variations
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:03.600]   that exist between people
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:07.600]   in terms of the metabolic regulation of caffeine.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.960]   So how long, let's say drink a standard cup of coffee
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.280]   or a couple of espresso and it has a,
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.520]   gosh, I don't know, 150 milligrams of caffeine.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.360]   Is that 200?
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:18.480]   - Yeah, it could be 150, 200.
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.320]   - Yeah, let's say 200 because certainly a barista these days
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.160]   is gonna draw a beverage that's-
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.000]   - They're gonna over-index.
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:27.840]   - Yeah, so let's say 200 milligrams
[00:56:27.840 --> 00:56:32.640]   and somebody consumes that after lunch at 1 p.m.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.840]   and their bedtime is,
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.280]   let's make them more conventional than I,
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.160]   somewhere between 10 and 11 p.m.
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:42.280]   Okay, so they're about- - Nine to 10 hours.
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.640]   - Nine to 10 hours out from their bedtime.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:46.240]   They're having a nice strong, quote-unquote,
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:48.360]   nice strong cup of coffee after lunch.
[00:56:48.360 --> 00:56:53.600]   What does that look like in terms of their biochemistry
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:55.600]   and impact on sleep?
[00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:59.040]   So caffeine has something that we call a half-life
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:01.080]   of about five to six hours,
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:03.440]   meaning that after five to six hours,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:06.920]   about 50% of that caffeine is still circulating
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.320]   in your bloodstream and thus your brain.
[00:57:09.320 --> 00:57:12.680]   That means that caffeine has a quarter-life
[00:57:12.680 --> 00:57:15.880]   of somewhere between 10 to 12 hours.
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.280]   Now this is on average and we'll come back to variations,
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:21.720]   but think of it this way.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.160]   If you're taking a cup of coffee,
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:26.160]   like you described there, at midday,
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.160]   and then you're going to bed at, let's say, 11 or midnight,
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.880]   that would be the equivalent,
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:34.000]   based on what I've just told you,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:37.480]   the quarter-life of getting yourself into bed.
[00:57:37.480 --> 00:57:39.280]   And just before you took yourself into bed,
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   you swig a quarter of a cup of coffee
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.120]   and you hope for a good night of sleep.
[00:57:43.120 --> 00:57:46.280]   And the chances are that it may not happen.
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:49.640]   Now, again, that's a little bit sort of hyperbolic
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:53.320]   as a statement, but just try to conceptualize it
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.160]   in that way.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:58.640]   You would never think about taking on a last quarter
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.640]   of a cup of coffee just before you put your eye mask on.
[00:58:02.640 --> 00:58:06.000]   - No, but I have some friends and somebody actually
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.600]   who works with the podcast team,
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.800]   and we'll go out to dinner as a team when we're on the road
[00:58:09.800 --> 00:58:14.800]   and he'll order a big coffee right after 9 p.m. dinner.
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:16.360]   And I'm like, "Can you sleep?"
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.840]   And they say, "Oh yeah, no problem."
[00:58:17.840 --> 00:58:20.880]   - And that no problem is in part this,
[00:58:20.880 --> 00:58:23.280]   I don't have an issue with falling asleep,
[00:58:23.280 --> 00:58:25.560]   but if we were to, based on the data,
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.160]   map their electrical brain activity,
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.400]   you would be able to see this reduction
[00:58:31.400 --> 00:58:33.840]   in the deep non-REM sleep.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:36.800]   And it can reduce it, if you look at the data,
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:39.480]   somewhere between 15 to 20%.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   Now, for me to reduce your deep sleep by 15 to 20%,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:50.560]   I would probably have to age you by about 20 to 22 years.
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:52.200]   Or you could just do it every night
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:55.960]   with a late night coffee, should you wish.
[00:58:55.960 --> 00:58:59.400]   So again, and maybe we'll speak about this
[00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:03.280]   in later episodes, I have changed my mind on caffeine.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:06.920]   I think morning caffeine use, or coffee, I should say,
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.880]   being more specific, is fine
[00:59:08.880 --> 00:59:10.560]   because I think there are health benefits
[00:59:10.560 --> 00:59:12.880]   and we can go into in subsequent episodes
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:15.880]   why coffee and the coffee bean itself
[00:59:15.880 --> 00:59:17.440]   can provide those benefits.
[00:59:17.440 --> 00:59:22.440]   So I've become a little bit more bullish on morning caffeine
[00:59:22.440 --> 00:59:24.400]   but evening caffeine,
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.320]   I just think the data is just not supportive.
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:30.400]   Even if you are, and there are variations
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:33.400]   and you were very astute in your question,
[00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.800]   some people, I said, on average,
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.440]   caffeine has a half-life of about five to six hours.
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:41.040]   For some people, it's quicker.
[00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:43.520]   And for other people, it's slower.
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:44.360]   Why is that?
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.200]   It's based on a gene and we know the gene.
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:50.800]   It's a gene that is part of a set of liver enzymes.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:55.800]   And the gene is called the CYP1A2 gene.
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.280]   And there are variations in that gene,
[00:59:59.280 --> 01:00:00.960]   what we call polymorphisms.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.520]   And you can do these genetic tests
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:03.640]   that you can buy these kits
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:06.000]   and they will probably tell you which you are.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:07.720]   Are you sensitive or you're not sensitive?
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.080]   You probably already know. (laughs)
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:12.840]   And so some people will not be as sensitive
[01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:17.040]   and therefore they can have a more compressed timeframe
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.000]   of a half-life because it's moving out of their system
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.840]   in a quicker manner.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:23.680]   So again, I'm not trying to be scaremongering.
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.640]   I think you can have coffee in the morning
[01:00:25.640 --> 01:00:27.920]   and you'll be just fine.
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.600]   That late night coffee, I would like to see you obviate that
[01:00:32.600 --> 01:00:34.240]   if you are someone who's doing it.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:36.680]   - And the afternoon coffee sounds like,
[01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:38.360]   maybe only every once in a while
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.800]   and try and make it mostly decaf or decaf for that matter,
[01:00:41.800 --> 01:00:43.280]   if it's really just for the taste.
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:45.240]   - Yeah, if it's just for the taste, go decaf.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:48.000]   If it's not, I understand that in some ways
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.680]   what I'm talking about is the ideal world
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:52.640]   and drum roll, it turns out that most of us
[01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:53.480]   don't live in that.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:56.080]   We live in this thing called the real world. (laughs)
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:58.400]   And so if you are facing a circumstance
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.480]   where if you're under pressure at work
[01:01:00.480 --> 01:01:03.000]   or if you're a high-performing athlete and this is it,
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:06.400]   this is the event, it's all or nothing,
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.920]   understand that you are going to sacrifice
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.760]   some sleep at night,
[01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.640]   but maybe that sacrifice is well worth it.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:13.440]   So again, I'm very open-minded.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:18.440]   I'm not trying to be simply too rigid with this.
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:20.320]   - I wanna take a brief break
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:22.720]   and acknowledge our sponsor InsideTracker.
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.120]   InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:27.560]   that analyzes data from your blood and DNA
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:29.080]   to help you better understand your body
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.000]   and help you reach your health goals.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:33.760]   I've long been a believer in getting regular blood work done
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.840]   for the simple reason that many of the factors
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:37.760]   that impact your immediate and long-term health
[01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:40.360]   can only be analyzed from a quality blood test.
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:42.800]   The problem with a lot of blood tests out there, however,
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:44.200]   is that you get information back
[01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.440]   about metabolic factors, hormones, et cetera,
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:48.600]   but you don't know what to do with that information.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:49.440]   With InsideTracker,
[01:01:49.440 --> 01:01:51.600]   they make it very easy to understand your results
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:53.760]   and they also point you to specific directives
[01:01:53.760 --> 01:01:55.920]   that you can follow in the realm of nutrition,
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:01:58.600]   exercise, supplementation, even prescription drugs
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:02:00.680]   that can help bring the levels back into the ranges
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:02.000]   that are optimal for you.
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.840]   InsideTracker also offers InsideTracker Pro,
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.880]   which enables coaches and health professionals
[01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.120]   to provide premium and personalized services
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.960]   by leveraging InsideTracker's analysis and recommendations
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.040]   with their clients.
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.560]   If you'd like to try InsideTracker,
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:17.960]   you can go to insidetracker.com/huberman

[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:27.480]   So you've talked about alcohol and its effects on sleep.
[01:02:27.480 --> 01:02:29.720]   You've talked about caffeine and its effects on sleep.
[01:02:29.720 --> 01:02:32.800]   And we talked about food and its effects on sleep.
[01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:36.360]   What about THC and CBD?
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:39.720]   Sometimes they're referred to more generally as cannabis.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.100]   And it's interesting, gosh, when I was growing up,
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:47.720]   cannabis was illegal.
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:52.200]   Nowadays it's either legal or tolerated
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:55.120]   or decriminalized in many places, not all.
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:59.200]   But I would say there's been a tide shift
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:01.920]   in terms of cannabis,
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:05.840]   meaning that many people consume cannabis
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:08.760]   who are consuming it legally
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.520]   and consume it for a lot of reasons
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.600]   that other people consume alcohol,
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:17.320]   in a sedative effect, a slight hypnotic effect.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:19.800]   I mean, the actual definition of what these drugs do,
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:20.920]   it goes by certain terms
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.460]   in the psychiatric literature, of course,
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:25.200]   but in order to quote, unquote, mellow out,
[01:03:25.200 --> 01:03:28.160]   to feel more relaxed, to reduce their anxiety,
[01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:30.880]   it's far and away different than when I was growing up
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.960]   where, I mean, you would get into a lot of trouble
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.740]   if you were caught smoking a joint
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.680]   or taking a bong rip in the middle of the day.
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:42.880]   And I realize most people aren't doing that at work.
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:44.960]   I guess it depends on where you work.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:47.760]   But you know, edibles, tinctures,
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:50.880]   I mean, the consumption of THC and CBD
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.720]   is quite robust in a lot of places.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:58.080]   So with all the issues of legality
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.360]   and the fact that young people should not be consuming them,
[01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:04.200]   I mean, people 18 and younger,
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:05.240]   not just for legal reasons,
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:06.940]   but the brain is still developing.
[01:04:06.940 --> 01:04:12.040]   What is the story with THC, CBD, cannabis,
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:17.040]   edible, smoked, tinctures, on sleep specifically?
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:20.360]   - It's very interesting if you look firstly
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.840]   at the motivational reasons why people use cannabis.
[01:04:24.840 --> 01:04:28.400]   Based on the published study,
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:32.740]   somewhere in the top two reasons, sleep.
[01:04:32.740 --> 01:04:34.440]   - To fall asleep.
[01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:36.040]   - To fall asleep and stay asleep.
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.960]   Obviously, usually the principle first reason
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.440]   is just to get high and have the experience
[01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:42.040]   and the pleasure of being high,
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.400]   if that's what sort of floats your train.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:50.960]   But certainly it's sleep as what we call a hypnotic
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:53.560]   to put you asleep from the Greek derivative
[01:04:53.560 --> 01:04:55.720]   of the God for sleep.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:59.340]   That is high among the reasons that people will use.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:02.840]   We currently don't recommend it.
[01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:04.900]   And here is why.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:08.640]   Certainly THC helps you fall asleep faster.
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.860]   Very clear in the data.
[01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:15.360]   The problem is that first you start to develop a tolerance
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.380]   and to get that same sleep onset benefit,
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:22.040]   you need to get use, I should say, a higher dose.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.160]   So you start to develop dependency
[01:05:24.160 --> 01:05:27.040]   and your dose regimen starts to increase.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:30.880]   The second issue with THC is that it's very good
[01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:34.120]   at blocking your dream sleep, your REM sleep.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:36.640]   And in fact, many people, when they come in,
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.040]   they tell me, look, I was a heavy cannabis user,
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:41.360]   even a light cannabis user for some time.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.160]   And then I stopped using.
[01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:45.920]   And one of the strangest things happened to me.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.920]   I just started to have the most wild, vivid, crazy dreams.
[01:05:50.920 --> 01:05:53.720]   And I didn't know what was going on.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.880]   And it's a very simple explanation.
[01:05:55.880 --> 01:06:00.380]   As you've been using, your brain has been compromised
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:03.480]   in the amount of REM sleep it's been getting.
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:08.480]   And you've been building up chronically a REM sleep debt.
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:10.680]   And your brain is smart in the sense
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:15.160]   that it does try to clock to some degree
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:18.560]   a counter of how much REM sleep you've lost.
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.600]   And many people will say, yeah,
[01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:22.120]   I don't really remember my dreams when I'm using.
[01:06:22.120 --> 01:06:24.680]   But when they stop, the brain finally,
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:26.440]   because it's been cleansed of the thing
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.260]   that's the roadblock to REM sleep,
[01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:32.520]   not only do they go back to having the normal amount
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:36.240]   of REM sleep that people would have, they have that,
[01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:38.840]   plus they have what we call a REM sleep rebound,
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:42.400]   which is even more and more intense REM sleep,
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.480]   which leads to more intense dreaming.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:48.000]   So it's a very, I suspect there's a lot of people
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.600]   who've had that experience listening
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.240]   if they have been users and they've stopped.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.240]   So that's the second reason we don't advocate it.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:59.160]   The third reason is that when you stop using,
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:03.280]   you also go through a very vicious
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:05.280]   insomnia withdrawal syndrome.
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.720]   Often many people will do.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.480]   Now that depends on how much you've been using
[01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.060]   for how long you've been using.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:14.320]   If you look at the data, and by the way,
[01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.960]   part of the clinical diagnostic,
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.120]   the psychiatric diagnostic description
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.600]   of cannabis withdrawal is insomnia.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:28.560]   That's how reliable this insomnia problem is
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.040]   when you come off cannabis.
[01:07:30.040 --> 01:07:33.400]   And if you look at the data,
[01:07:33.400 --> 01:07:36.720]   one of the main reasons that people relapse
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.640]   and start using cannabis again,
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:40.680]   even though they don't want to,
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:43.800]   is because they can't deal with the insomnia
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.560]   that withdrawal has given them.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:48.620]   So you don't want to get into that vicious cycle.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:52.120]   Should you wish again, it's your choice.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:58.800]   So THC, I think is not to be advised right now.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:01.720]   CBD is interesting.
[01:08:01.720 --> 01:08:03.320]   I don't think there's enough data yet
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.040]   for us to have a very strong opinion,
[01:08:05.040 --> 01:08:07.660]   but I can at least offer mine.
[01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:10.480]   The data so far is a little bit mixed
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:12.480]   in what we call the effect size.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:14.560]   In other words, how reliable and how powerful
[01:08:14.560 --> 01:08:17.040]   is the benefit of CBD on sleep,
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:19.740]   but it does seem to have some benefit.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:23.020]   What's interesting is that it doesn't seem to have
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:26.700]   the detriments that I just described for THC.
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:30.280]   You've got to be looking at the data
[01:08:30.280 --> 01:08:33.020]   a little bit careful with CBD.
[01:08:33.020 --> 01:08:36.040]   It has what's called a U-shaped function to it,
[01:08:36.040 --> 01:08:39.940]   which is that if you're taking too little,
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:43.920]   and again, I really am so mindful of not trying to be,
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.760]   okay, here are the numbers, but if you look at them,
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:51.380]   I would say, kind of cross your eyes, squint your eyes,
[01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:55.260]   maybe less than 25 milligrams,
[01:08:55.260 --> 01:09:00.260]   you run into the danger of CBD being wake promoting
[01:09:00.260 --> 01:09:02.280]   rather than sleep promoting.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:05.160]   But once you get past, if you look ish,
[01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:07.800]   50 milligrams and above,
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.800]   then you start to go in the opposite direction
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:12.240]   where it seems to be sleep promoting.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.280]   And I mentioned that just because
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:16.920]   at least here in the United States
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:18.520]   and in many places in the world,
[01:09:18.520 --> 01:09:21.720]   that industry is not regulated.
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:25.440]   So it may say 50 milligrams on the bottle.
[01:09:25.440 --> 01:09:28.800]   You don't really know how some of those companies
[01:09:28.800 --> 01:09:31.680]   will have what's called third party laboratory testing
[01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:34.360]   where they'll send it out and you can scan a QRI code
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:36.120]   and you can look at an independent laboratory
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:39.200]   that tested it and show you the purity of it.
[01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.780]   So that may be one way to go.
[01:09:41.920 --> 01:09:46.640]   So CBD, I think has some favorable evidence right now.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:48.960]   If that's the case, let's just assume
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.040]   that you and I speak in another five years time
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:53.680]   and there's really good data now for this.
[01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.700]   What could be the mechanisms?
[01:09:55.700 --> 01:09:59.720]   I think there's probably at least two,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:02.000]   maybe three mechanisms.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.720]   The first is an indirect mechanism.
[01:10:04.720 --> 01:10:07.040]   CBD has been demonstrated very nicely
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:11.240]   in some fantastic studies to be an anxiolytic,
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.080]   which is a fancy term for saying
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:15.320]   it reduces down your anxiety.
[01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:19.440]   And earlier you and I discussed that anxiety and stress
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:21.880]   is one of the things that will keep you awake.
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:26.760]   So indirectly it removes this kind of gate
[01:10:26.760 --> 01:10:29.360]   that is preventing you from moving down
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.200]   the Royal road of sleep.
[01:10:31.200 --> 01:10:32.920]   And it opens back up the gates
[01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:35.340]   because it's removed that gate mechanism,
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.440]   which is high anxiety.
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.640]   And by way of being an anxiolytic,
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:42.160]   it's soften that anxiety and it's easier for you
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:43.000]   to fall asleep.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.680]   I think that's probably the principle mechanistic bet
[01:10:45.680 --> 01:10:47.520]   I would have right now.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:50.000]   Another indirect mechanism.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.120]   If you look at some of the studies in rats
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.920]   and we do human work at my sleep center.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.600]   So we don't do animal studies,
[01:10:56.600 --> 01:10:59.800]   but if you look at the data in the rats,
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.480]   CBD can be hypothermic,
[01:11:03.480 --> 01:11:06.160]   which means that it drops your core body temperature.
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:09.320]   And just as we spoke about in earlier in this episode,
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.000]   you need to drop your body temperature to get to sleep.
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.680]   So I think that's the second reason.
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:15.840]   I think the third reason is that it could have
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:19.040]   a direct sleep promoting mechanism.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:22.840]   I think it's unclear right now exactly how it's interacting
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.600]   with the sleep machinery of the brain.
[01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:26.360]   We've got some hypotheses.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:27.440]   The danger is, again,
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:29.640]   it's just not a well-regulated substance.
[01:11:29.640 --> 01:11:32.640]   So I am actually just full disclosure.
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.400]   I'm working with a company in the United Kingdom
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:39.760]   in collaboration with King's College
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.200]   and the Institute of Psychiatry there
[01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.920]   to see if we can create an analog,
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:47.360]   a clean analog of CBD.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:50.000]   But I think the potential upside of it,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:51.200]   not just for sleep,
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:54.120]   but for a number of different psychiatric conditions
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:57.440]   like anxiety could be beneficial.
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:11:59.480]   So I would say that that's right now
[01:11:59.480 --> 01:12:03.360]   the sort of the skinny on THC and CBD.
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.720]   - Okay, so just to make sure that I have the basic list
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:11.640]   of sleep hygiene factors, correct.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:14.920]   I have regularity is king.
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.760]   - Yep.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:17.480]   - Light and dark,
[01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.840]   meaning that one should optimize
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:22.600]   or at least seek to optimize their exposure to light
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:25.000]   in the morning and throughout the day
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.800]   and then in the evening to make things dim and dark.
[01:12:27.800 --> 01:12:29.140]   - Yes.
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:30.320]   - Temperature.
[01:12:30.320 --> 01:12:33.520]   And there you have, it's not a mantra,
[01:12:33.520 --> 01:12:34.360]   but what is it?
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:38.440]   It's a warm up to cool down to fall asleep.
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:42.240]   And then it's stay cool, like Fonzie,
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:47.240]   stay cool to stay asleep and then a warm up to wake up.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:48.280]   - Yep.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.200]   And we will come onto that I think in a little while again.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:51.760]   - Then there's walk it out,
[01:12:51.760 --> 01:12:53.400]   which is if I understand correctly,
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:56.160]   if you're trying to fall asleep or fall back asleep
[01:12:56.160 --> 01:12:58.960]   and it's taking you longer than about 20, 25 minutes,
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:00.120]   you should just get out of bed
[01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.040]   and go elsewhere in the house, do something else.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.680]   Maybe even lie down on a different surface in the house
[01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:06.500]   to try and see if you can sleep there,
[01:13:06.500 --> 01:13:07.480]   but don't stay in bed.
[01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:10.120]   Don't create a paired association of wakefulness
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:11.680]   and your bed,
[01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.920]   because that can lead to problems in subsequent nights.
[01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:16.760]   - Yeah, and I would only say that try to resist if you can,
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:19.200]   if you really want your bedroom to be the place
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:21.900]   where you now become consistently asleep,
[01:13:21.900 --> 01:13:25.160]   try not to start sleeping in some other location
[01:13:25.160 --> 01:13:27.180]   consistently because then all of a sudden
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:29.040]   you bond that with good sleep
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:33.640]   and you unbuckle this notion that we're trying to relearn,
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:36.600]   which is no, your bedroom is the place of sleep.
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:38.620]   So it's fine to go elsewhere.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.460]   Try to stay awake and force yourself to stay awake
[01:13:41.460 --> 01:13:44.420]   until you are absolutely sleepy, then go back to bed.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:49.280]   - Okay, and then we discussed alcohol, food, caffeine,
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.720]   and THC/CBD, aka cannabis.
[01:13:53.720 --> 01:13:55.080]   And with respect to alcohol,
[01:13:55.080 --> 01:13:58.120]   it's clear that none is best
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:13:59.900]   if you're going to have some,
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.260]   you don't want to drink too early in the day,
[01:14:02.260 --> 01:14:03.480]   but you don't want to drink too much
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:04.720]   or too close to bedtime
[01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:07.200]   because it can disrupt rapid eye movement, sleep.
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.860]   Food, it seems that creating some sort of buffer
[01:14:09.860 --> 01:14:14.640]   between your last bite of food and your to bed time by,
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:17.600]   anyway, somewhere between, you know, maybe two, three hours,
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.840]   but for some people it'll be more like 90 minutes.
[01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:20.900]   And of course that's going to depend
[01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:22.160]   on the size of the meal, et cetera,
[01:14:22.160 --> 01:14:25.440]   but eating a big meal and then going straight to bed,
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.700]   probably not a good idea.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:30.200]   Caffeine has this long half-life.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:32.720]   So if you're going to indulge, which I do,
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:35.280]   do so early in the day.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.880]   Beware of the afternoon caffeine.
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:40.480]   - Yeah, do the Huberman taper
[01:14:40.480 --> 01:14:41.760]   is what I'm going to call it right now,
[01:14:41.760 --> 01:14:43.480]   which is not an interpretive dance.
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:45.120]   It's simply the caffeine tape.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:48.960]   - And then THC/CBD does nothing good
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:51.040]   for your sleep architecture.
[01:14:51.040 --> 01:14:53.520]   Although some people have the impression
[01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:54.600]   that it is good for their sleep
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.320]   because it makes it easier for them to fall asleep.
[01:14:56.320 --> 01:14:59.080]   But what they're unaware of is that it is disrupting
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:02.600]   the quality and architecture of the different stages
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:06.160]   of sleep in ways that are not serving people well.
[01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:07.680]   - That seems to be the case for THC.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:12.000]   And I think CBD, you know, has promise
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:15.960]   and research must try harder, including my own.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:19.760]   - And you very kindly emphasize
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:21.400]   that you're not telling people what to do.
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.040]   They just should know what they're doing
[01:15:23.040 --> 01:15:26.400]   so that they can make changes if they so choose.
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.240]   - That's right.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:29.280]   I would always say that I'm not trained
[01:15:29.280 --> 01:15:30.440]   to be a medical doctor.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.760]   Any advice that I give
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:35.200]   is simply scientifically descriptive advice.
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:37.080]   It's not medically prescriptive
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.680]   nor lifestyle prescriptive advice.
[01:15:39.680 --> 01:15:41.040]   - I'm smiling 'cause what I always say
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.320]   is I'm a scientist, not a physician.
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.360]   So I don't prescribe anything,
[01:15:45.360 --> 01:15:47.800]   but I profess lots of things.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.680]   Whereas my good friend, who's a musician,
[01:15:49.680 --> 01:15:52.120]   Tim Armstrong says, "I'm not a cop."
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:54.120]   - That's right, so do what you want.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:59.480]   Okay, what a wonderful list to leap off
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:03.480]   into the unconventional and more advanced tools
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:05.160]   for sleep enhancement.
[01:16:05.160 --> 01:16:07.960]   So let's go there.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.320]   - So I think many people may have heard
[01:16:10.320 --> 01:16:11.840]   of some of the conventional,
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.920]   but what about the unconventional?
[01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:17.360]   I would probably offer five or six.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.440]   The first one I would say is that
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:20.880]   if you are struggling with sleep
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:24.520]   and you have had a bad night of sleep,
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:28.800]   the first recommendation is do nothing.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.200]   And what I mean by that is
[01:16:30.200 --> 01:16:31.720]   if you've had a bad night of sleep,
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.840]   you're awake for three hours,
[01:16:33.840 --> 01:16:38.560]   do not sleep in any later into the morning.
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:42.240]   Do not go to bed any earlier.
[01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:45.040]   Do not increase your caffeine intake
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.240]   to try to offset it.
[01:16:47.240 --> 01:16:49.200]   And do not nap during the day.
[01:16:49.200 --> 01:16:50.960]   Why am I telling you those things?
[01:16:50.960 --> 01:16:55.800]   If you wake up later that following morning,
[01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:58.560]   your adenosine clock that we spoke about,
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:17:00.560]   this building up of sleepiness
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:02.480]   that happens when we wake up,
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:05.400]   is going to start later in the day.
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:08.120]   So when it comes time for you to fall asleep
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:12.240]   at what would then be the next night at your normal time,
[01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:14.720]   you're not going to feel as sleepy, why?
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.720]   Because you woke up that much later
[01:17:16.720 --> 01:17:20.320]   and you're setting yourself up for failure again.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.480]   Equally, don't go to bed any earlier.
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:26.360]   If you have become accustomed and your brain has,
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.960]   and your circadian clock has become accustomed
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.440]   to going to bed at a certain time
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:31.560]   and hopefully you're doing it regularly,
[01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.120]   then getting into bed two or three hours early
[01:17:34.120 --> 01:17:35.880]   has the danger, it's not a certainty,
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:39.160]   but a danger of you then getting into bed and thinking,
[01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:42.040]   well, I know I had a bad night of sleep last night,
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:44.440]   but I still can't fall asleep straight away.
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:47.600]   So now you're spending another 90 minutes in bed
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.440]   at the beginning,
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:49.960]   'cause you've gone to bed 90 minutes earlier
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:52.000]   thinking it's a good idea to compensate.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.560]   Don't do that either.
[01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:56.760]   Hold out, even if you do feel tired,
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:17:59.600]   my recommendation would be after that bad night of sleep,
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:01.800]   hold out for as long as you can,
[01:18:01.800 --> 01:18:05.000]   as close to your natural bedtime as possible,
[01:18:05.000 --> 01:18:06.440]   then go to sleep
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.200]   and you will give yourself highest chance of success.
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:11.600]   Don't over-caffeinate, that's the obvious one,
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:13.960]   follow the beautiful Huberman taper,
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:17.840]   and then obviously try not to compensate with a nap.
[01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:18.680]   Why?
[01:18:18.680 --> 01:18:22.040]   Because that nap, as happens when we sleep,
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:24.440]   is going to remove some of that sleepiness,
[01:18:24.440 --> 01:18:27.960]   that adenosine, and once again, you get into bed
[01:18:27.960 --> 01:18:30.080]   and you're not as sleepy as you would naturally be.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:32.320]   So you again go through a bad night
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:33.560]   'cause you're struggling to sleep,
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.400]   or you wake up and you can't get back
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:38.640]   because you've got less weight of sleepiness
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.920]   on your shoulders due to the nap that happened earlier.
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:44.000]   So I know it's hard,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.800]   but I would say when the alarm goes off after a bad night,
[01:18:46.800 --> 01:18:49.320]   you just think, I do not want to get up,
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:51.120]   it's been such a rough night.
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:53.880]   I know it's a short-term gain,
[01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.920]   but trust me, it's a long-term loss
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:58.160]   because you're going to then just get
[01:18:58.160 --> 01:18:59.840]   into this vicious cycle.
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:02.160]   So that's the first unconventional tip.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.680]   - Can I just pause you for a second?
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.400]   I'm a little wide-eyed over here
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:09.640]   because I did not know any of that.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:11.320]   Typically, if I get a poor night's sleep,
[01:19:11.320 --> 01:19:14.160]   I'll do whatever I can to recover that sleep,
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.160]   take a nap, I'll adjust to bedtime the next evening.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:23.440]   So I hope everyone is paying careful attention
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:24.720]   to what Matt just said.
[01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:27.680]   I mean, that's an important list
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:29.600]   because I think one of the very common things
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:31.720]   is for people to just not get a great night's sleep.
[01:19:31.720 --> 01:19:32.720]   And I think most people think,
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:34.320]   okay, I'll drink a little more caffeine,
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.840]   I will go to bed a little earlier tonight,
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:41.300]   maybe catching a nap in the afternoon, this kind of thing.
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:42.600]   And I would have thought that too,
[01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.480]   and maybe even suggested that.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.440]   And if you listen to the first episode
[01:19:46.440 --> 01:19:49.280]   and where I list in a doomsday manner
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.320]   the things that can happen by way of a short night,
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.020]   you would think that that's what I would then recommend.
[01:19:54.020 --> 01:19:55.560]   But it was really imprinted on me
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:59.120]   by a wonderful sleep clinician, Michael Perlis,
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:01.280]   who sort of described some of these features
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:03.640]   and exactly the reasons sort of underlying them.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.740]   And I think I've just tried to bake that out
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.800]   into a formula that makes sense.
[01:20:07.800 --> 01:20:11.160]   Again, it's not about the rule, it's about explaining it,
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:12.680]   because when you explain it,
[01:20:12.680 --> 01:20:16.040]   at first, it sounds contradictory and paradoxical.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.280]   When you understand it,
[01:20:17.280 --> 01:20:20.440]   it hopefully sounds logical and actionable.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.800]   So that would be the first suggestion.
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:24.900]   - Could I just, sorry to interrupt again.
[01:20:24.900 --> 01:20:26.560]   My audience hates when I interrupt,
[01:20:26.560 --> 01:20:28.160]   but I'm doing it on their behalf.
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:29.420]   - Oh, I love it.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.160]   - Because I like to think that there's some value
[01:20:32.160 --> 01:20:35.840]   in some of at least what you say in response.
[01:20:35.840 --> 01:20:40.600]   I saw a really terrific post from Dr. Rhonda Patrick,
[01:20:40.600 --> 01:20:45.200]   who we both know and admire for her public education
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:46.920]   or public health education work.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:50.280]   And she described a study whereby if people are,
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:51.920]   I think it was slightly sleep deprived,
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.360]   maybe by a few hours,
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:55.960]   that some of the disruption
[01:20:55.960 --> 01:20:57.980]   to morning blood glucose regulation
[01:20:57.980 --> 01:21:00.680]   that is known to accompany partial sleep deprivation
[01:21:00.680 --> 01:21:02.840]   and certainly complete sleep deprivation,
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:06.800]   but in this case, partial sleep deprivation could be offset
[01:21:06.800 --> 01:21:09.240]   by still exercising in the morning.
[01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:10.360]   - That's right.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:12.360]   - Which, frankly, I have to say,
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.600]   if I haven't slept that well,
[01:21:13.600 --> 01:21:15.360]   then normally I'm like,
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:16.960]   maybe today's the day I don't exercise.
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:18.920]   But now having heard that information,
[01:21:18.920 --> 01:21:22.640]   I make it a point to still exercise,
[01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:25.600]   sometimes with a little bit less intensity,
[01:21:25.600 --> 01:21:27.360]   because I don't want to be completely exhausted
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:32.200]   in the afternoon and go to sleep at 4 p.m. or something,
[01:21:32.200 --> 01:21:33.520]   really disrupt my schedule.
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.080]   But I thought that was really interesting
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:38.500]   because it's a sort of partial inoculation
[01:21:38.500 --> 01:21:40.920]   of the blood glucose disruption
[01:21:40.920 --> 01:21:43.320]   caused by sleep deprivation.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:44.780]   - I'm so glad you brought it up.
[01:21:44.780 --> 01:21:48.160]   It's a fantastic study, and Rhonda and I,
[01:21:48.160 --> 01:21:52.160]   I think even tried to discuss it some years ago on a show,
[01:21:52.160 --> 01:21:54.880]   but I like it because it does offer
[01:21:54.880 --> 01:21:59.080]   some degree of actionable hope and a strategy.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:03.360]   Blood sugar, absolutely critical.
[01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.880]   It is very sensitive to sleep.
[01:22:05.880 --> 01:22:07.160]   When you don't get enough,
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:09.560]   it goes in bad directions.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.920]   You used a very specific word, cleverly so,
[01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:14.700]   and that word was partially.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:18.400]   At first you hear or read that study,
[01:22:18.400 --> 01:22:20.280]   and Rhonda was never suggesting this too,
[01:22:20.280 --> 01:22:21.760]   I'm not saying that.
[01:22:21.760 --> 01:22:25.760]   You think, well, if it offsets blood sugar,
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.960]   and the study was saying exercise
[01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:31.880]   can nullify a lack of sleep,
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:35.860]   you conflate that single outcome benefit
[01:22:35.860 --> 01:22:37.440]   with the idea that, well,
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.700]   but maybe it doesn't actually,
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:44.960]   does it compensate for the deficits in immune function,
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:48.320]   or cardiovascular disease concerns,
[01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:51.360]   or my hormonal health, or my learning and memory,
[01:22:51.360 --> 01:22:53.460]   or my emotional and brain health.
[01:22:53.460 --> 01:22:55.440]   Maybe it does, but maybe it doesn't.
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.280]   So I think I would always just caution people to saying,
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:00.400]   when you hear a study like that,
[01:23:00.400 --> 01:23:01.760]   it's very natural to think,
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.980]   oh, that must mean that it translates
[01:23:03.980 --> 01:23:05.520]   to everything else in my body,
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:08.040]   and everything else in my brain.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:10.480]   It may, but it also may not be.
[01:23:10.480 --> 01:23:14.480]   - Terrific, so if you don't sleep that well,
[01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:16.400]   do your best to still get some exercise,
[01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.840]   but just be mindful of the fact that,
[01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:21.120]   in the winter months, especially,
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:24.080]   that might, if you go too hard in the gym or on a run,
[01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:27.400]   you might be a little bit immune compromised,
[01:23:27.400 --> 01:23:28.640]   just be mindful of the fact
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.840]   that you're a more vulnerable being
[01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.400]   when you're sleep deprived,
[01:23:32.400 --> 01:23:34.700]   but that exercise can help adjust things
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:35.540]   in the right direction.
[01:23:35.540 --> 01:23:36.940]   And if it's early in the day,
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:41.300]   presumably that's not going to disrupt the proper bedtime.
[01:23:41.300 --> 01:23:43.420]   And if it's later in the day,
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:45.220]   I suppose, as long as you don't need caffeine
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.060]   in order to do that exercise,
[01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:53.060]   and/or if you're familiar with exercising later in the day,
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:56.380]   fine, I find if I exercise,
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:23:59.060]   I'm not one of these people that can go for a run,
[01:23:59.060 --> 01:23:59.900]   seven o'clock at night,
[01:23:59.900 --> 01:24:00.740]   and then just shower and go to sleep.
[01:24:00.740 --> 01:24:01.940]   - Of course, because you're a morning type.
[01:24:01.940 --> 01:24:03.700]   - Because I'm a morning type, other people can.
[01:24:03.700 --> 01:24:06.020]   Okay, we'll get into exercise a bit more in a later episode.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:07.220]   - We should do, yep.
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:08.100]   - We'll be sure to do that,
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:11.620]   but nonetheless, just raise that now.
[01:24:11.620 --> 01:24:13.020]   So what are some of the other
[01:24:13.020 --> 01:24:15.740]   unconventional protocols for sleep?
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.280]   - So I think other suggestions I would have
[01:24:18.280 --> 01:24:21.440]   after do nothing would be,
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.440]   try to think about limiting your time in bed.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:26.560]   If you are struggling with sleep,
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.340]   this is something that is used
[01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:32.940]   in probably the most well-validated
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:36.240]   psychological intervention for insomnia,
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:39.220]   and it's called Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia,
[01:24:39.220 --> 01:24:41.740]   or CBTI for short.
[01:24:41.740 --> 01:24:44.580]   What happens is that you work with a clinician,
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.620]   they interview you,
[01:24:45.620 --> 01:24:48.380]   they assess all of the reasons that you may not be sleeping,
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.580]   and then they create,
[01:24:49.580 --> 01:24:52.540]   from their toolbox of many different options,
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:56.020]   a bespoke, tailored sort of Savile Row soup prescription
[01:24:56.020 --> 01:24:58.220]   for you for your treatment.
[01:24:58.220 --> 01:24:59.540]   If you look at the studies
[01:24:59.540 --> 01:25:01.420]   of that collection of different tools
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:05.700]   in the CBTI box for intervention of insomnia,
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:08.180]   and you ask of all of those,
[01:25:08.180 --> 01:25:12.220]   which seems to carry the greatest impact on insomnia,
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:15.140]   which has the greatest sort of gravitas,
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.340]   it seems to be this thing
[01:25:16.340 --> 01:25:19.100]   that we call Bedtime Rescheduling.
[01:25:19.100 --> 01:25:22.340]   It used to be known as Sleep Restriction Therapy,
[01:25:22.340 --> 01:25:25.020]   but obviously, if you come to me and you say,
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.260]   "Look, I am not sleeping very well.
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.660]   "I've got insomnia."
[01:25:28.660 --> 01:25:31.460]   I say, "I understand, and I've got a treatment for you.
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:33.220]   "It's called Sleep Restriction Therapy."
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:35.180]   And you say, "No, no, no, you didn't understand.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:37.660]   "I'm not getting enough sleep."
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:39.100]   But it's not quite that.
[01:25:39.100 --> 01:25:40.900]   Here's how it works.
[01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:44.020]   If you are spending so much time in bed,
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.060]   too much time in bed,
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:50.380]   you are not forcing your brain to be efficient.
[01:25:50.380 --> 01:25:53.700]   And by way of constraining your sleep window,
[01:25:53.700 --> 01:25:58.220]   even to, let's say, five hours a night to begin with,
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.620]   I brute force ruthless efficiency
[01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:04.820]   from your sleeping brain after several days.
[01:26:04.820 --> 01:26:06.020]   So another analogy would be,
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:07.020]   let's say you're trying to make
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:10.380]   a nice thin crust of pizza base,
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:12.300]   and you put the dough on the table,
[01:26:12.300 --> 01:26:13.780]   and you start rolling it out.
[01:26:13.780 --> 01:26:15.300]   If you roll it too thin,
[01:26:15.300 --> 01:26:17.900]   it starts to get gaps and holes in it.
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:18.740]   Why?
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.260]   Because you've spread it out too far,
[01:26:21.260 --> 01:26:24.740]   and you've started to create these absences.
[01:26:24.740 --> 01:26:26.420]   That's the same thing that happens.
[01:26:26.420 --> 01:26:27.420]   And it's very natural.
[01:26:27.420 --> 01:26:29.580]   As an insomnia patient, you would say,
[01:26:29.580 --> 01:26:30.660]   "I'm just not getting enough sleep,
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.060]   "so I'm going to start spending more time in bed."
[01:26:33.060 --> 01:26:35.340]   It's the very worst idea.
[01:26:35.340 --> 01:26:36.620]   Another way would be to say,
[01:26:36.620 --> 01:26:37.700]   "Look, I go to the gym,
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:40.700]   "and I spend about an hour and a half working out."
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.620]   But if I were to videotape you,
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:43.860]   a lot of people are doing the,
[01:26:43.860 --> 01:26:45.820]   I think I've coined it as your phrase,
[01:26:45.820 --> 01:26:50.180]   but the 11th rep, where people do the 10 reps,
[01:26:50.180 --> 01:26:51.740]   and then all of a sudden there's the selfie,
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:53.420]   or there's the social media.
[01:26:53.420 --> 01:26:54.700]   - Oh, yeah, the texting.
[01:26:54.700 --> 01:26:56.140]   They finish the last rep, put it down,
[01:26:56.140 --> 01:26:58.220]   and then immediately to their phone.
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.540]   - And if you look, they're only working out
[01:27:00.540 --> 01:27:03.660]   for about, let's say, 45 minutes,
[01:27:03.660 --> 01:27:05.300]   and the other is wasted.
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:08.260]   So what if the next day you came to the gym,
[01:27:08.260 --> 01:27:09.420]   and I said, "Look, I'm sorry,"
[01:27:09.420 --> 01:27:12.060]   and there's some big bouncer guys at the door,
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:14.580]   "You are only allowed to work out for 40 minutes,
[01:27:14.580 --> 01:27:16.620]   "and then we're going to eject you."
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:19.900]   And the first day, you go back and you do the same thing.
[01:27:19.900 --> 01:27:23.900]   And then you've only got through 30% of your workout.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:24.740]   So you get booted.
[01:27:24.740 --> 01:27:26.380]   The next day, you come back and you do a little bit more,
[01:27:26.380 --> 01:27:27.820]   and you get booted again.
[01:27:27.820 --> 01:27:30.020]   After about five or six days,
[01:27:30.020 --> 01:27:32.540]   you've built up such a strong desire
[01:27:32.540 --> 01:27:34.620]   and hunger to get your workout in.
[01:27:34.620 --> 01:27:36.700]   You walk in, you put your phone on silent,
[01:27:36.700 --> 01:27:40.180]   you put it over in the corner, and you just get to it.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:42.300]   And that's the same thing that we're trying to do
[01:27:42.300 --> 01:27:44.220]   with sleep restriction therapy.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:46.020]   So you have to be a little bit careful,
[01:27:46.020 --> 01:27:47.180]   do it under supervision,
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:49.420]   especially if you're driving or you're operating,
[01:27:49.420 --> 01:27:50.260]   heavy machinery.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:51.380]   We just want to keep an eye.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.220]   It's not necessarily a big concern,
[01:27:53.220 --> 01:27:55.500]   but we would say, "Okay, Andrew,
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:58.140]   "you're currently spending almost total
[01:27:58.140 --> 01:28:02.340]   "about eight-ish or seven and a half hours in bed.
[01:28:02.340 --> 01:28:04.700]   "Tonight, I'm going to restrict you down
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:05.940]   "to five hours a night,
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:08.300]   "and we're going to do this for the next week."
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:09.740]   And the way that we normally do it
[01:28:09.740 --> 01:28:12.060]   is I don't change your wake up time.
[01:28:12.060 --> 01:28:13.860]   I change your to bed time.
[01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:14.700]   Why?
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:16.660]   It's easier to stay awake longer
[01:28:16.660 --> 01:28:19.140]   than it is to wake up earlier.
[01:28:19.140 --> 01:28:22.420]   So I put it on the front end of the compromise,
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:25.580]   and at first, things don't change.
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:27.740]   But after maybe about four or five days
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.180]   of going through this,
[01:28:29.180 --> 01:28:34.180]   I build up enough of a short-term debt in your system
[01:28:34.180 --> 01:28:37.540]   that your system all of a sudden thinks,
[01:28:37.540 --> 01:28:40.300]   "Gosh, I just cannot be as lazy anymore.
[01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:42.020]   "I can't do this thing of waking up
[01:28:42.020 --> 01:28:42.980]   "in the middle of the night
[01:28:42.980 --> 01:28:45.620]   "and spending an hour and a half awake.
[01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:47.180]   "I don't have the choice anymore."
[01:28:47.180 --> 01:28:49.900]   There's so much physiological buildup
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:51.620]   and pressure to do this.
[01:28:51.620 --> 01:28:55.340]   And gradually, what happens is that you sleep longer.
[01:28:55.340 --> 01:28:57.020]   You don't wake up as much.
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.980]   And after maybe about two weeks of doing this,
[01:28:59.980 --> 01:29:03.420]   all of a sudden, you go to bed at this later time.
[01:29:03.420 --> 01:29:05.580]   So for you, let's say you normally go to bed at eight.
[01:29:05.580 --> 01:29:08.820]   I'm going to have you go to bed at maybe 10, 30, 11,
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.220]   but we're still going to have you wake up
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:13.980]   at that sort of 4.30 a.m. mark
[01:29:13.980 --> 01:29:15.980]   that you would normally wake up.
[01:29:15.980 --> 01:29:20.700]   And all of a sudden, you go to bed at 10, 30, 11,
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.220]   you're out like a light.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:25.060]   And then again, the next thing you remember
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:26.300]   is your alarm going off saying,
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:28.220]   "I'm sorry, you've got to wake up."
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:30.780]   And what happens by way of that reset
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.700]   is gradually we will then, once you're stable,
[01:29:33.700 --> 01:29:35.300]   we will start to back it off.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:37.780]   We'll start to have you go to bed at 10.
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:41.660]   And if it stays stable, then 9.45, then 9.30,
[01:29:41.660 --> 01:29:44.660]   and titrate you back to where you were.
[01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.020]   And if there's any sign
[01:29:46.020 --> 01:29:48.060]   that you're starting to not sleep well,
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.820]   we zip it back up again.
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:51.700]   The goal here is, in some ways,
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:55.700]   almost like hitting the reset button on your Wi-Fi router.
[01:29:55.700 --> 01:29:59.940]   I'm trying to retrain your brain to better sleep
[01:29:59.940 --> 01:30:03.260]   because when you are not sleeping well,
[01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:06.780]   you've lost your confidence in your ability to sleep.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:10.100]   And when I do this technique with you,
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:14.380]   gradually your system and you cognitively relearn
[01:30:14.380 --> 01:30:17.380]   that you are a good sleeper and you can trust in sleep.
[01:30:17.380 --> 01:30:20.380]   And now your sleep does not control you.
[01:30:20.380 --> 01:30:22.580]   You control your sleep.
[01:30:22.580 --> 01:30:26.700]   The hard part, however, is that it's not easy to go through.
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:28.580]   And we have to be,
[01:30:28.580 --> 01:30:31.220]   we have to usually ask two questions with individuals.
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:34.820]   Firstly, what is your motivation for better sleep?
[01:30:34.820 --> 01:30:37.140]   We need to know that you really are motivated.
[01:30:37.140 --> 01:30:39.020]   And then second, you just stay
[01:30:39.020 --> 01:30:41.460]   with a high touch white glove frequency,
[01:30:41.460 --> 01:30:42.900]   checking in on individuals
[01:30:42.900 --> 01:30:44.780]   and motivating them to keep going
[01:30:44.780 --> 01:30:47.060]   'cause it's very easy to fall off the wagon.
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:51.540]   So that's the next suggestion, sleep restriction therapy
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:54.060]   or bedtime rescheduling, as we would call it.
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:56.540]   - You said it's difficult for people to go through.
[01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:58.060]   You know, it takes a little bit of rigor,
[01:30:58.060 --> 01:30:59.140]   a little bit of attention,
[01:30:59.140 --> 01:31:02.740]   means in some cases getting less sleep than one would like.
[01:31:02.740 --> 01:31:05.660]   But as compared to something that, you know,
[01:31:05.660 --> 01:31:07.780]   sadly I've experienced a lot in my life
[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:10.300]   of having challenges with sleep
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.700]   and trying to get things back in order
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:13.540]   and looking at the bed and just going,
[01:31:13.540 --> 01:31:16.700]   "Oh my God, battleground," you know, battleground.
[01:31:16.700 --> 01:31:19.740]   You know, it's, I think it makes a lot of sense.
[01:31:19.740 --> 01:31:21.620]   And I love the analogy to the gym.
[01:31:21.620 --> 01:31:24.860]   Somehow, if there's a restriction to one hour
[01:31:24.860 --> 01:31:27.380]   in and out the door, or maybe 70 minutes in and out the door
[01:31:27.380 --> 01:31:28.780]   'cause you need to put your stuff in a locker
[01:31:28.780 --> 01:31:30.180]   or something like that,
[01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:33.100]   it always, at least for me, gets done best
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:34.660]   when you just have those constraints.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:36.380]   I think there's something about the human brain
[01:31:36.380 --> 01:31:41.140]   that we don't do well in unrestrained systems
[01:31:41.140 --> 01:31:43.740]   that I really think guardrails are fantastic.
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.180]   I love deadlines, for instance.
[01:31:45.180 --> 01:31:46.820]   - Yeah, discipline is essentially the--
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:48.700]   - Yeah, hard deadlines.
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:50.260]   Like, or as they say in academia,
[01:31:50.260 --> 01:31:51.980]   'cause we, you know, write grants all the time,
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:54.580]   drop deadlines, which who made up that term?
[01:31:54.580 --> 01:31:56.100]   But like, if you don't make it, that's it.
[01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:58.380]   It's like, there isn't a, "Hey, I'll send this in tomorrow."
[01:31:58.380 --> 01:32:02.460]   5 p.m. Pacific time, that website closes
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:04.060]   and you better have you--
[01:32:04.060 --> 01:32:06.180]   - Boy, do you get things done all of a sudden.
[01:32:06.180 --> 01:32:09.420]   It's surprising how much distraction you can, you know,
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:12.180]   pull out the noise and focus on the signal.
[01:32:12.180 --> 01:32:13.980]   It's great signal to noise ratio.
[01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:17.140]   - Yeah, and I love the idea that one can control their sleep
[01:32:17.140 --> 01:32:18.580]   as opposed to sleep controlling them.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:22.180]   I think that that's, and this notion of sleep confidence,
[01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:25.460]   one's confidence in their ability to sleep.
[01:32:25.460 --> 01:32:27.700]   These are important terms and they're more than just terms
[01:32:27.700 --> 01:32:32.700]   because I think that a field and an area of health practice
[01:32:32.700 --> 01:32:34.980]   and gosh, what's more important than sleep?
[01:32:34.980 --> 01:32:36.260]   It's the foundation of mental health,
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:38.260]   physical health and performance, period.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:44.180]   Really thrives on a common nomenclature.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.340]   And I really appreciate that you're, you know,
[01:32:46.340 --> 01:32:50.980]   peppering these episodes with new nomenclature
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:53.900]   that captures a lot of the essence of the protocols
[01:32:53.900 --> 01:32:54.740]   and the mechanisms.
[01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:58.380]   So there, that's my editorial, please continue.
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:00.060]   - I would say that in terms of other things,
[01:33:00.060 --> 01:33:03.540]   maybe just to go through them a little more quickly,
[01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.900]   we've spoken some about a wind down routine.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.340]   Most people under-appreciate the importance
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.260]   of a wind down routine.
[01:33:11.260 --> 01:33:13.900]   We often think that sleep is like a light bulb,
[01:33:13.900 --> 01:33:16.820]   that we dive into bed, we switch off the light bulb
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:19.660]   and sleep should appear just as quickly.
[01:33:19.660 --> 01:33:21.140]   It's untrue.
[01:33:21.140 --> 01:33:24.580]   Sleep in terms of a process is much more physiologically
[01:33:24.580 --> 01:33:26.460]   like trying to land a plane.
[01:33:26.460 --> 01:33:29.780]   It just takes time to come down onto the terra firma
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:31.980]   of good sleep at night.
[01:33:31.980 --> 01:33:35.580]   Whatever it is you enjoy as a relaxation method,
[01:33:35.580 --> 01:33:37.940]   engage in it, could be listening to a podcast,
[01:33:37.940 --> 01:33:39.420]   could be reading a book.
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.420]   Maybe it's a meditation, it's light stretching.
[01:33:42.420 --> 01:33:45.540]   Maybe, whatever it is that you do,
[01:33:45.540 --> 01:33:48.300]   just build it in to your regimen.
[01:33:48.300 --> 01:33:50.260]   You know, you would never, you know,
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:54.380]   be driving down the road and then pull into your garage
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:33:57.500]   at the same 40 mile an hour speed.
[01:33:57.500 --> 01:34:00.620]   You gradually decelerate and you come to a stop.
[01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:03.180]   It's the same thing with sleep.
[01:34:03.180 --> 01:34:05.820]   So you need to find some way to decelerate
[01:34:05.820 --> 01:34:08.940]   and we've spoken about methods already as to how to do that.
[01:34:08.940 --> 01:34:12.940]   The next tip is a little quirky and funny.
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:15.540]   Do not count sheep.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:17.380]   There's a great study from my colleague,
[01:34:17.380 --> 01:34:19.620]   Dr. Alison Harvey at UC Berkeley,
[01:34:19.620 --> 01:34:21.060]   and she put this to the test.
[01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:23.780]   Didn't make people fall asleep faster.
[01:34:23.780 --> 01:34:27.020]   It made them take longer to fall asleep.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:29.340]   However, she did find an alternative.
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:35.380]   If you are not into meditation or podcasts or sleep stories
[01:34:35.380 --> 01:34:38.380]   or whatever it is that you wish for,
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.500]   try taking yourself on a mental walk.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:44.900]   And it has to be a walk that you know very well.
[01:34:44.900 --> 01:34:46.900]   So let's say that you walk your dog every day
[01:34:46.900 --> 01:34:48.580]   and you know there's a couple of walks
[01:34:48.580 --> 01:34:50.180]   that you take with your dog.
[01:34:50.180 --> 01:34:52.340]   Do it in hyper detail.
[01:34:52.340 --> 01:34:55.620]   So close your eyes, you go to the front door,
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:58.580]   you clip in the dog to the leash, you walk out,
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.140]   you go down the steps, out to the driveway,
[01:35:02.140 --> 01:35:04.420]   then you take a right, but you always cross over
[01:35:04.420 --> 01:35:05.620]   and you look to the left and the right
[01:35:05.620 --> 01:35:07.420]   'cause that's the place where traffic always comes.
[01:35:07.420 --> 01:35:09.620]   You cross over and now you're walking up
[01:35:09.620 --> 01:35:13.300]   and there's that strange sort of set of garbage
[01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:15.420]   that's been outside of that house for a long time
[01:35:15.420 --> 01:35:17.300]   and you don't know why it hasn't been cleared.
[01:35:17.300 --> 01:35:18.500]   And then you move.
[01:35:18.500 --> 01:35:22.940]   That type of high fidelity detail
[01:35:22.940 --> 01:35:26.420]   allows you to do what we said earlier,
[01:35:26.420 --> 01:35:29.380]   which is get your mind off itself.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.580]   And when you do that, again,
[01:35:31.580 --> 01:35:34.900]   typically you fall asleep faster and that's what she found.
[01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:36.540]   It was a great, great study.
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.260]   I really enjoyed that.
[01:35:38.260 --> 01:35:42.700]   - I'm curious as to why it works so well.
[01:35:42.700 --> 01:35:44.860]   And I'm not challenging that it works.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.580]   I can imagine having just closed my eyes
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:49.020]   and kind of imagine what that would be like.
[01:35:49.020 --> 01:35:49.980]   It's very pleasant.
[01:35:49.980 --> 01:35:53.900]   There might be, and here I'm just speculating,
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.860]   something about engaging one's procedural memory
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:58.180]   because that's procedural memory.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:35:59.740]   You're trying to remember how you do something
[01:35:59.740 --> 01:36:03.140]   as opposed to declarative memory, which is about facts.
[01:36:03.140 --> 01:36:05.380]   I remember this and this is gonna happen tomorrow.
[01:36:05.380 --> 01:36:07.620]   I wonder whether or not there's something
[01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:10.980]   about using a procedural memory
[01:36:10.980 --> 01:36:17.020]   as opposed to a declarative memory visualization.
[01:36:17.020 --> 01:36:19.100]   Somebody should do that study.
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:19.940]   - They should.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:20.900]   And I think it's certainly possible
[01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:22.940]   that when you're incorporating some aspect,
[01:36:22.940 --> 01:36:26.660]   some aspects of the scene and the information
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:28.020]   is more sort of veridical
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:30.780]   and maybe sort of episodic declarative memory.
[01:36:30.780 --> 01:36:33.780]   But when you're taking yourself for a mental walk,
[01:36:33.780 --> 01:36:35.580]   what is the fundamental premise of that?
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:38.780]   It's a walk, it's motion, it's procedural memory.
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:40.660]   And so maybe it's something to do about
[01:36:40.660 --> 01:36:44.260]   with being more attentive to becoming embodied
[01:36:44.260 --> 01:36:48.020]   because when you're out walking and you're moving,
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:50.060]   it is a more embodied experience
[01:36:50.060 --> 01:36:52.500]   than just sitting there at your desk,
[01:36:52.500 --> 01:36:56.300]   which is mostly your head and very little your body.
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:36:58.300]   So I think it's an intriguing idea.
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:02.820]   And I think another tip that I now think of,
[01:37:02.820 --> 01:37:05.660]   which also comes from the work of Dr. Alison Harvey,
[01:37:05.660 --> 01:37:11.820]   when individuals come up to me after sort of public events
[01:37:11.820 --> 01:37:14.300]   or they see me at the airport,
[01:37:14.300 --> 01:37:17.460]   they'll say, look, every night for some strange reason
[01:37:17.460 --> 01:37:22.460]   at 2.45 a.m. I wake up and it happens three or four nights
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:26.540]   a week, my first question to them is,
[01:37:26.540 --> 01:37:28.660]   how do you know it's 2.45?
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:32.460]   And they say, well, I look at the clock
[01:37:32.460 --> 01:37:33.660]   or I look at my phone.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:36.660]   Best piece of advice next,
[01:37:36.660 --> 01:37:40.660]   remove all clock faces from the bedroom.
[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:44.220]   No matter how bad your sleep is going to be that night,
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:46.460]   knowing what time it is,
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:48.660]   is only going to make matters worse.
[01:37:48.660 --> 01:37:51.500]   It is not going to make matters any better.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:56.580]   And that can create an anxiety trigger that you think
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:59.820]   it's 2.45 and then you're tossing and turning,
[01:37:59.820 --> 01:38:03.180]   you look back at the clock and now it's 3.14 a.m.
[01:38:03.180 --> 01:38:05.180]   And you think I've got to be awake at six,
[01:38:05.180 --> 01:38:08.940]   I've got a big meeting and now it's 5.25.
[01:38:08.940 --> 01:38:10.620]   Don't do that to yourself.
[01:38:10.620 --> 01:38:14.180]   And I, even though I don't typically struggle with sleep,
[01:38:14.180 --> 01:38:17.140]   I have no clock faces in my bedroom.
[01:38:17.140 --> 01:38:21.020]   The phone that I use to help do the guided meditation
[01:38:21.020 --> 01:38:25.900]   is an old phone and it has only wifi connectivity
[01:38:25.900 --> 01:38:27.740]   and nothing else on it.
[01:38:27.740 --> 01:38:30.660]   And I will only hit play
[01:38:30.660 --> 01:38:32.820]   and then I will never turn it around.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:37.340]   I will not look at the clock face, just doesn't help me.
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:40.860]   - Another incentive for keeping the phone out of the room,
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:44.460]   if one can, I understand there are reasons
[01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:47.820]   when one would want the phone in the room
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:52.820]   if it's potentially signaling an emergency.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:55.140]   - I think it's a very important point
[01:38:55.140 --> 01:38:58.060]   and we've done some work in this area too.
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:03.060]   What that phone does is create a low level of anxiety.
[01:39:03.060 --> 01:39:06.940]   It's what we call anticipatory anxiety.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:10.900]   One of the mechanisms separate from that,
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:12.220]   well, it's related to that.
[01:39:12.220 --> 01:39:14.140]   If you look at teen phone use,
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:16.580]   one of the reasons that they don't sleep very well at night
[01:39:16.580 --> 01:39:19.100]   is that they're constantly checking their phones
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:21.140]   because of FOMO, a fear of missing out.
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:23.620]   What has gone on as I've been asleep?
[01:39:23.620 --> 01:39:26.260]   And it's stunning the data, but for most adults,
[01:39:26.260 --> 01:39:30.140]   the other reason I don't like advocating for phone use,
[01:39:30.140 --> 01:39:34.340]   when your alarm goes off in the morning,
[01:39:34.340 --> 01:39:37.740]   what is the first thing that you do as you're in bed?
[01:39:37.740 --> 01:39:40.620]   You swipe right or you unlock your phone
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:43.140]   and you instantly start checking social media,
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:45.420]   emails, text messages.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:50.420]   And this tsunami of stress and anxiety just floods over you.
[01:39:50.420 --> 01:39:54.660]   It hits you like this wall of anxiety.
[01:39:54.660 --> 01:39:57.420]   And I bring this up because it again,
[01:39:57.420 --> 01:40:02.260]   trains your brain for expectation of that.
[01:40:02.260 --> 01:40:06.180]   Anticipatory anxiety has a consequence on your sleep.
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:08.020]   And everyone knows this.
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:11.900]   Let's say that you've booked an early morning flight
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:13.940]   and you've got to wake up at 5 a.m.
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:16.900]   when normally you wake up at 7 a.m.
[01:40:16.900 --> 01:40:19.460]   Two things will usually happen.
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:22.100]   First, you know that you're just not going to sleep
[01:40:22.100 --> 01:40:24.220]   as deeply that night because you're on edge.
[01:40:24.220 --> 01:40:27.020]   And this is for an interview or it's for a critical,
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.620]   this is a non-negotiable trip that has to happen.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.460]   You've got to wake up.
[01:40:31.460 --> 01:40:36.460]   The second thing is that when you are expecting
[01:40:36.460 --> 01:40:41.260]   that wave of sort of a need to wake up
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:44.820]   and maybe it's just, I'm expecting the phone again,
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.060]   you will wake up just a few minutes before your alarm.
[01:40:49.060 --> 01:40:51.420]   It's stunning how many people will say,
[01:40:51.420 --> 01:40:53.340]   I had this big flight the next day.
[01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:56.260]   And you almost know I'm going to wake up two minutes
[01:40:56.260 --> 01:40:58.180]   before my alarm goes off.
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:40:59.020]   Why?
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:01.900]   Because your brain has stayed in the shallow state
[01:41:01.900 --> 01:41:03.820]   of anticipatory anxiety
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:05.420]   and you don't get as much deep sleep.
[01:41:05.420 --> 01:41:07.780]   And we've now demonstrated that we know this.
[01:41:07.780 --> 01:41:10.140]   When you have that low level of anxiety,
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:12.220]   the depth of your deep sleep is not as deep.
[01:41:12.220 --> 01:41:13.540]   You don't get the good.
[01:41:13.540 --> 01:41:17.740]   So again, not to be trying to dictate what people do,
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.540]   just be aware that when you do create that behavior
[01:41:21.540 --> 01:41:26.060]   and that regiment, it becomes almost like a knee jerk
[01:41:26.060 --> 01:41:28.420]   sort of trained habitual response.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:29.500]   - Terrific.
[01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:31.540]   Let's talk about some of the advanced tools
[01:41:31.540 --> 01:41:33.140]   for sleep enhancement.
[01:41:33.140 --> 01:41:36.780]   You know, what sorts of methods could one incorporate?
[01:41:36.780 --> 01:41:38.380]   You know, what are some of the data?
[01:41:38.380 --> 01:41:41.260]   And is there any way that we can sort of lump these
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:44.940]   into sort of some framework or categories?
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:47.260]   Because I know there are a lot of different tools.
[01:41:47.260 --> 01:41:48.100]   - There are.
[01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:50.220]   And I suppose this would be, you know,
[01:41:50.220 --> 01:41:53.140]   I know our friend Petra Teer has spoken about medicine 3.0.
[01:41:53.140 --> 01:41:56.820]   I think this would probably be sleep optimization 3.0.
[01:41:56.820 --> 01:41:58.500]   What is coming down the pike?
[01:41:58.500 --> 01:42:00.780]   What is in the research?
[01:42:00.780 --> 01:42:04.940]   And I think, you know, could make it to market
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:06.900]   or has made it to market,
[01:42:06.900 --> 01:42:10.420]   but yet we're still right on the cusp.
[01:42:10.420 --> 01:42:13.940]   We've seen, we again in the Royal We,
[01:42:13.940 --> 01:42:17.940]   have been able to augment human sleep
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.940]   in at least four different ways.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:25.180]   There are methods for electrical brain stimulation.
[01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:29.980]   There are methods for acoustic stimulation of sleep.
[01:42:29.980 --> 01:42:31.540]   So electrical stimulation of sleep,
[01:42:31.540 --> 01:42:34.020]   acoustic stimulation of sleep,
[01:42:34.020 --> 01:42:36.420]   thermal manipulation of sleep,
[01:42:36.420 --> 01:42:39.820]   and then finally kinesthetic manipulation of sleep,
[01:42:39.820 --> 01:42:42.220]   meaning movement-based stimulation.
[01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:46.700]   And maybe I can just sort of go into each one of those.
[01:42:46.700 --> 01:42:51.060]   The electrical stimulation is probably the most well-rendered
[01:42:51.060 --> 01:42:52.900]   of all of those four.
[01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:56.660]   In part, because we started there
[01:42:56.660 --> 01:42:58.740]   and here it's not the Royal We,
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:00.940]   we have done a lot of work on this.
[01:43:00.940 --> 01:43:02.660]   And I can tell you a little bit
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:04.540]   about a company emerging from that.
[01:43:04.540 --> 01:43:08.940]   But when you're trying to manipulate the human brain,
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:11.900]   the principal currency in which the brain communicates
[01:43:11.900 --> 01:43:13.100]   is electricity.
[01:43:13.100 --> 01:43:15.220]   Now, there are lots of things that help it do that,
[01:43:15.220 --> 01:43:16.660]   such as chemicals,
[01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.420]   but the principal language
[01:43:18.420 --> 01:43:21.980]   and verbiage of the brain is electricity.
[01:43:21.980 --> 01:43:23.940]   So if you're going to manipulate the brain,
[01:43:23.940 --> 01:43:27.620]   why don't you speak in its currency of electricity?
[01:43:27.620 --> 01:43:30.540]   So we and others have developed a method
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:36.060]   based on something called direct current brain stimulation,
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:40.460]   and specifically something called transcranial direct current stimulation.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:41.980]   And I'll unpack that.
[01:43:41.980 --> 01:43:44.780]   Trans meaning movement, so if you've heard of transport,
[01:43:44.780 --> 01:43:47.780]   it's about moving things from one port to another.
[01:43:47.780 --> 01:43:51.900]   Transatlantic, moving, you know, across the Atlantic.
[01:43:51.900 --> 01:43:54.300]   So here, the start of it is moving.
[01:43:54.300 --> 01:43:56.660]   You're moving something from one place to the next.
[01:43:56.660 --> 01:43:59.380]   Transcranial means through your skull.
[01:43:59.380 --> 01:44:01.340]   So we're moving something through your skull.
[01:44:01.340 --> 01:44:05.940]   Transcranial direct current is the type of voltage
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:09.260]   or the type of electrical impulse that we're putting in.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:12.780]   It could be alternating current, or it could be direct current.
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:16.580]   And early methods and those we use have been direct current.
[01:44:16.580 --> 01:44:19.700]   So transcranial direct current, and then stimulation.
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:23.940]   We're trying to stimulate the brain, specifically the cortex.
[01:44:23.940 --> 01:44:25.380]   And the way that we do this
[01:44:25.380 --> 01:44:28.300]   is that we apply electrode pads to your head,
[01:44:28.300 --> 01:44:32.060]   and we insert a small amount of voltage into your brain.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:35.540]   Now, it's so small that you typically don't feel it,
[01:44:35.540 --> 01:44:39.860]   but it has a measurable impact on that electrical brain activity.
[01:44:39.860 --> 01:44:41.980]   So very early on, scientists,
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:44.300]   and we weren't the first to do this by any means,
[01:44:44.300 --> 01:44:47.060]   there was a great paper, now a famous paper in my field,
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:50.660]   by a wonderful scientist, Jan Born in Germany.
[01:44:50.660 --> 01:44:52.900]   And they took a group of subjects,
[01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:57.980]   and they applied these electrode pads specifically to the front of the brain.
[01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:00.380]   And I'll explain why we target the front of the brain
[01:45:00.380 --> 01:45:04.740]   with sleep electrical enhancement, or the electroceutical, as it were.
[01:45:04.740 --> 01:45:08.580]   They applied these electrode pads to two groups of participants,
[01:45:08.580 --> 01:45:12.020]   and then they let them go into sleep.
[01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:15.660]   And as you'll remember, we described that in the first two or three hours of sleep
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:17.620]   is when you get most of your deep sleep.
[01:45:17.620 --> 01:45:21.820]   And they were targeting those deep, slow brain waves that we spoke about,
[01:45:21.820 --> 01:45:26.140]   those big, slow, powerful waves that define deep sleep.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:28.740]   And what they did in one of those groups,
[01:45:28.740 --> 01:45:30.500]   the other group was the placebo group,
[01:45:30.500 --> 01:45:33.740]   they still had the electrodes applied, they still went to sleep.
[01:45:33.740 --> 01:45:35.460]   In the stimulation group,
[01:45:35.460 --> 01:45:39.260]   they waited until those individuals went into deep sleep.
[01:45:39.260 --> 01:45:41.060]   And I told you in the first episode
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:45.340]   that those deep sleep brain waves were going up and down very, very slowly,
[01:45:45.340 --> 01:45:48.500]   maybe just once or twice a second.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:51.980]   So they started to stimulate the brain,
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:56.260]   inputting these stimulation pulses at a very slow rhythm,
[01:45:56.260 --> 01:45:58.300]   trying to match the rhythm of the brain.
[01:45:58.300 --> 01:46:00.140]   In fact, they were less than one hertz,
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.460]   less than one cycle per second in terms of a pulse.
[01:46:04.460 --> 01:46:12.020]   It's almost as though we're trying to act like a choir to a flagging lead vocalist.
[01:46:12.020 --> 01:46:14.780]   And as these brain waves are going up and down,
[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:18.020]   you're trying to sing in time with those deep sleep brain waves.
[01:46:18.020 --> 01:46:20.740]   And in doing so, you're trying to boost and amplify
[01:46:20.740 --> 01:46:22.900]   the size of those deep sleep brain waves.
[01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:25.740]   Now, to begin with, they just waited until they went into deep sleep
[01:46:25.740 --> 01:46:28.020]   and they started to stimulate at that frequency.
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:30.580]   And I'll come back to why that's important in a second.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:32.700]   But sure enough, what they demonstrated,
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:38.540]   they were able to boost the electrical quality of that deep sleep by about 60%.
[01:46:38.540 --> 01:46:43.020]   And they were also able to almost double the amount of memory benefit
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:45.980]   that sleep provided, which is very impressive.
[01:46:45.980 --> 01:46:47.100]   That is impressive.
[01:46:47.100 --> 01:46:52.100]   Now, I should note that there was more recently a replication attempt of that paper,
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:53.460]   and they did a very good job.
[01:46:53.460 --> 01:46:55.620]   They really did it to the letter.
[01:46:55.620 --> 01:46:59.340]   And they weren't able to replicate the effects as powerfully.
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:04.900]   However, subsequent studies have now taken a more nuanced approach,
[01:47:04.900 --> 01:47:06.940]   and it's the one that we've taken too.
[01:47:06.940 --> 01:47:10.900]   And it's called closed loop stimulation.
[01:47:10.900 --> 01:47:14.940]   Closed loop here simply means that I'm not going to just wait
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:17.900]   until you go into deep sleep, and then just take a chance
[01:47:17.900 --> 01:47:19.900]   and start stimulating your brain,
[01:47:19.900 --> 01:47:24.940]   not knowing of the synchrony of my pulses into your brain
[01:47:24.940 --> 01:47:28.220]   relative to the brain waves that you're experiencing.
[01:47:28.220 --> 01:47:29.900]   Closed loop does do that.
[01:47:29.900 --> 01:47:34.380]   So what I'm doing is I'm measuring the electrical brain waves that are occurring.
[01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:38.220]   And because they're nice and slow, they're very predictable.
[01:47:38.220 --> 01:47:42.060]   And I can program my algorithm and my brain stimulation machine
[01:47:42.060 --> 01:47:44.020]   to say I'm going to wait and wait.
[01:47:44.020 --> 01:47:48.460]   And as soon as you are on this peak of your slow wave,
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:52.340]   which turns out to be the negative trough, but I'll forego that,
[01:47:52.340 --> 01:47:56.020]   we then try to strike at that point of midnight
[01:47:56.020 --> 01:48:01.340]   when you're going through the biggest sort of powerful dip in the brain wave.
[01:48:01.340 --> 01:48:04.620]   And we're trying to sort of enhance it, same with the peak.
[01:48:04.620 --> 01:48:09.700]   So this is where we get a stimulus from the brain,
[01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:11.020]   your electrical brain activity,
[01:48:11.020 --> 01:48:13.900]   and then we create a timed response.
[01:48:13.900 --> 01:48:17.700]   So it's a stimulus response. It's a call and response loop.
[01:48:17.700 --> 01:48:22.100]   And by way of doing that, it's a much smarter specific method
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:24.700]   than a more generalized, I'm just going to stimulate
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:27.580]   and hope I catch those waves at the peaks.
[01:48:27.580 --> 01:48:30.740]   The reason is important because different people
[01:48:30.740 --> 01:48:33.940]   have different speeds of their slow brain waves.
[01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.060]   They're all slow, but your speed of brain wave
[01:48:37.060 --> 01:48:39.380]   may be a little bit different to mine.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:43.820]   And if I'm off with my stimulation by let's say just half a second
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:46.220]   or a quarter of a second, time and time again,
[01:48:46.220 --> 01:48:49.460]   I may be leaving some benefit on the table.
[01:48:49.460 --> 01:48:53.180]   But closed loops stimulation creates this personalized
[01:48:53.180 --> 01:48:55.980]   electrical prescription of stimulation.
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:00.100]   And when you do that, you get very reliable benefits.
[01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:02.500]   You can boost those deep slow brain waves.
[01:49:02.500 --> 01:49:05.420]   You get the memory benefits, but also what we found
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:08.060]   is you not only boost those deep sleep brain waves,
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:11.020]   you boost another electrical signature that I spoke about
[01:49:11.020 --> 01:49:13.980]   in the first episode called sleep spindles.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:16.780]   And it seems to be the combination of those two things
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:20.500]   by way of electrical stimulation that provides the benefits.
[01:49:20.500 --> 01:49:23.620]   Now, I should note, I haven't mentioned this before,
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:28.220]   you can buy these devices on the internet DIY style.
[01:49:28.220 --> 01:49:29.740]   Do not do that.
[01:49:29.740 --> 01:49:31.180]   If you go onto the internet too,
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:32.860]   you can also find some horror stories.
[01:49:32.860 --> 01:49:35.700]   People have misappropriated the voltage.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:38.420]   They've got skin burns, they've lost their eyesight for several weeks.
[01:49:38.420 --> 01:49:39.860]   Do not do this at home.
[01:49:39.860 --> 01:49:44.100]   I promise you, use, you know, wait until these products come out.
[01:49:44.100 --> 01:49:46.940]   And that's one of the reasons why we've scaled into a company
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:48.740]   and we're trying to do this.
[01:49:48.740 --> 01:49:50.940]   We've got a long way to go yet.
[01:49:50.940 --> 01:49:54.540]   Huge number of trials that we have to do before, you know,
[01:49:54.540 --> 01:50:00.500]   I feel ready to really lay it on the table and say,
[01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:03.980]   "You should absolutely buy this. It's well worth it."
[01:50:03.980 --> 01:50:06.660]   But we're getting very, very close, I would say.
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:11.140]   Great. What about thermal manipulations, temperature?
[01:50:11.140 --> 01:50:15.420]   I mean, there's such a tight relationship between temperature and sleep
[01:50:15.420 --> 01:50:18.420]   and wakefulness for that matter.
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:22.780]   What sort of technologies, tools, protocols exist
[01:50:22.780 --> 01:50:27.860]   that use thermal manipulation as a way to augment sleep?
[01:50:27.860 --> 01:50:30.780]   I love this topic because there are
[01:50:30.780 --> 01:50:35.980]   high-fi, low-fi and no-fi technologies that you can use.
[01:50:35.980 --> 01:50:41.220]   The story of sleep and temperature, as you mentioned before and reiterated,
[01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:45.860]   in terms of the three-part stanza, that terse that I would describe is,
[01:50:45.860 --> 01:50:50.300]   again, you need to warm up to cool down to fall asleep.
[01:50:50.300 --> 01:50:53.900]   You need to stay cool to stay asleep. You need to warm up to wake up.
[01:50:53.900 --> 01:50:56.700]   What that refers to technically in sleep science
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.140]   are what we call the thermal trigger zones.
[01:50:59.140 --> 01:51:01.900]   So, warming up to cool down to fall asleep
[01:51:01.900 --> 01:51:05.620]   is what we call the sleep onset thermal trigger zone.
[01:51:05.620 --> 01:51:09.100]   Cooling down or staying cool to stay asleep
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:12.300]   is about the deep sleep trigger zone.
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:18.780]   And then warming up to wake up is the activating alertness trigger zone.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:21.140]   Studies, if you looked at them to begin with
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:24.540]   before they manipulated that, found something fascinating.
[01:51:24.540 --> 01:51:27.740]   If I take you, Andrew Huberman, and I bring you into my lab
[01:51:27.740 --> 01:51:31.460]   and I remove your phone or your laptop
[01:51:31.460 --> 01:51:33.700]   and you say goodbye to your friends and family
[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:35.900]   and I bring you into the center
[01:51:35.900 --> 01:51:40.380]   and there are no cues as to what time of day, no windows, no nothing.
[01:51:40.380 --> 01:51:44.300]   And I'm just going to say, "Look, I'll keep asking you,
[01:51:44.300 --> 01:51:52.380]   but at the moment that you feel most sleepy, just let me know."
[01:51:52.380 --> 01:51:57.860]   It turns out that before that we'd done the delightful intervention
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:00.540]   of inserting a rectal probe into you
[01:52:00.540 --> 01:52:03.780]   because that's the best way that we can measure your core body temperature.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:05.740]   So, we're measuring your core body temperature
[01:52:05.740 --> 01:52:09.940]   and sure enough, despite you knowing nothing about what time it is,
[01:52:09.940 --> 01:52:15.060]   the moment that you will tell me, "I am ready to go to bed and I am sleepy,"
[01:52:15.060 --> 01:52:19.700]   is the moment when you are on the greatest decelerating trajectory
[01:52:19.700 --> 01:52:21.540]   of your core body temperature.
[01:52:21.540 --> 01:52:25.620]   It is highly predictive of how sleepy you will feel.
[01:52:25.620 --> 01:52:27.860]   The way that your body does this
[01:52:27.860 --> 01:52:32.460]   is by pushing blood out to the surface regions of your skin,
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:34.460]   notably your hands and your feet,
[01:52:34.460 --> 01:52:37.220]   because these are these highly vascular regions.
[01:52:37.220 --> 01:52:41.380]   And you had a great podcast from one of my heroes and good friend, Craig Heller,
[01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:45.100]   who's done some amazing work on this at Stanford.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:50.740]   So, naturally, as we lie down, blood races to our hands and our feet
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:52.420]   and also our head,
[01:52:52.420 --> 01:52:57.860]   and we start to release that heat trapped in the core of our body.
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:53:02.300]   And by releasing that heat at the surface, our core body temperature drops.
[01:53:02.300 --> 01:53:06.500]   Hence, the outer surfaces of you, hands, feet and face,
[01:53:06.500 --> 01:53:12.940]   have to warm up for your core to cool down for you to fall asleep.
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:16.420]   And in fact, there was a great nature paper some years ago,
[01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:18.940]   they just measured the temperature of someone's feet
[01:53:18.940 --> 01:53:23.340]   and they looked at how quickly they fell asleep and when they fell asleep.
[01:53:23.340 --> 01:53:28.100]   Sure enough, the warmer your feet, the faster you fell asleep.
[01:53:28.100 --> 01:53:31.980]   Why? Because the warmness reflects the blood dilation
[01:53:31.980 --> 01:53:34.940]   and the pumping out of the blood to the periphery.
[01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:38.980]   And then they did it in rats, where they started to warm the paws of the rats
[01:53:38.980 --> 01:53:41.100]   and the rats fell asleep more quickly.
[01:53:41.100 --> 01:53:44.340]   I love this notion of, again, we don't do anamorphic,
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:48.700]   but I love the notion of wrapping a beautiful little rat up in cotton wool
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:52.500]   and I'm warming its feet with this pad and it's just blissed out
[01:53:52.500 --> 01:53:58.060]   and then, poof, he's gone, after all, she, I respect their privacy.
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:00.020]   So, that was the early evidence.
[01:54:00.020 --> 01:54:02.700]   That then led to a series of manipulation studies.
[01:54:02.700 --> 01:54:05.660]   The most notable is brilliant.
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:10.380]   It comes from a colleague in the Netherlands, Ousmane Semmeren and his group.
[01:54:10.380 --> 01:54:16.020]   They created essentially what was a wet, think about a wetsuit.
[01:54:16.020 --> 01:54:20.780]   But that wetsuit is covered with all of these thin tubes,
[01:54:20.780 --> 01:54:26.980]   almost like veins that go all over the suit to all territories of your body.
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:33.060]   And then what they would be able to do is perfuse water, warm water or hot water,
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:36.860]   exquisitely to different parts of the brain or the body.
[01:54:36.860 --> 01:54:40.060]   - Cool. - Amazing. Yeah, no pun intended.
[01:54:40.060 --> 01:54:46.820]   So, what they did was then they started to manipulate these peripheral regions.
[01:54:46.820 --> 01:54:49.860]   And sure enough, when they did this,
[01:54:49.860 --> 01:54:55.980]   they were able to have individuals fall asleep 25% faster.
[01:54:55.980 --> 01:54:59.140]   And these were healthy individuals who are normally sleeping
[01:54:59.140 --> 01:55:03.140]   within a very natural quick period of time.
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:06.660]   But they were able to lop off 25% of that time
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:10.020]   simply by warming these certain parts of the brain
[01:55:10.020 --> 01:55:13.620]   to lift the blood away from the core of the body.
[01:55:13.620 --> 01:55:19.700]   And by doing that, they accelerated the temperature core deceleration
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:22.540]   and therefore increased or accelerated the speed
[01:55:22.540 --> 01:55:25.540]   with which sleep arrived to those individuals.
[01:55:25.540 --> 01:55:30.220]   Sleep appeared with much greater alacrity than it would have done otherwise,
[01:55:30.220 --> 01:55:32.780]   even though it was quick anyway.
[01:55:32.780 --> 01:55:36.140]   So, them not being satisfied with that,
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:39.460]   they moved on to the deep sleep trigger zone.
[01:55:39.460 --> 01:55:43.180]   And this isn't, you need to stay cool to stay asleep.
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:47.180]   And here now, they started to just continue to cool the core,
[01:55:47.180 --> 01:55:50.860]   the central aspects of the body.
[01:55:50.860 --> 01:55:55.620]   What they were able to do is increase the amount of deep sleep
[01:55:55.620 --> 01:55:59.940]   by somewhere between 25 to, look at some of the data,
[01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:03.620]   almost 40 minutes they were able to boost the amount of deep sleep
[01:56:03.620 --> 01:56:05.460]   with the thermal manipulation.
[01:56:05.460 --> 01:56:08.780]   And when they were measuring the electrical brainwaves
[01:56:08.780 --> 01:56:11.180]   and they decomposed those brainwaves,
[01:56:11.180 --> 01:56:15.780]   even the power and the electrical quality of those slow waves was increased.
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.740]   Very impressive too.
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:19.580]   Next, not being satisfied with that,
[01:56:19.580 --> 01:56:23.300]   they turned to older adults for the reasons that we've just described.
[01:56:23.300 --> 01:56:25.460]   What they found was that in those older adults
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:28.900]   when they were not manipulated with this thermal temperature,
[01:56:28.900 --> 01:56:30.420]   in the second half of the night,
[01:56:30.420 --> 01:56:33.740]   there was a 50% probability that they were going to be awake
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:36.100]   for some part of the second half of the night.
[01:56:36.100 --> 01:56:38.220]   When they did the thermal manipulation,
[01:56:38.220 --> 01:56:41.460]   they dropped that number down to 5%.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:47.140]   So they reduced a 50% probability of waking up down to 5% in older adults.
[01:56:47.140 --> 01:56:51.260]   And again, they improved the quality of their deep sleep.
[01:56:51.260 --> 01:56:55.300]   Think about, by the way, why that was so effective for older adults.
[01:56:55.300 --> 01:56:57.580]   I guarantee you, you've probably seen,
[01:56:57.580 --> 01:57:00.420]   you've been in a warm climate or you've been down on the beach,
[01:57:00.420 --> 01:57:03.620]   you know, here sort of in Los Angeles,
[01:57:03.620 --> 01:57:07.540]   and people are out in shorts and t-shirts or crop tops.
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:09.820]   And then occasionally there will be someone,
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:11.900]   and I've seen these sites where, you know,
[01:57:11.900 --> 01:57:15.340]   a child is sort of wheeling along their elderly parents,
[01:57:15.340 --> 01:57:18.300]   a beautiful sort of scene of caring.
[01:57:18.300 --> 01:57:19.940]   But the older adult,
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:23.860]   they're not dressed in the same way that everyone else is dressed on the beach.
[01:57:23.860 --> 01:57:27.100]   They are wrapped up, some of them have a woolen hat on.
[01:57:27.100 --> 01:57:28.380]   Why?
[01:57:28.380 --> 01:57:33.740]   Older adults cannot thermoregulate anywhere near as well as young adults.
[01:57:33.740 --> 01:57:35.020]   Is that right?
[01:57:35.020 --> 01:57:37.740]   And it's the reason that older adults will always be saying,
[01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:41.820]   "I'm just so cold and my hands and my feet especially are always cold."
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:44.220]   Now, that's a problem for sleep,
[01:57:44.220 --> 01:57:48.820]   because if you cannot vasodilate at the level of your hands and your feet,
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:50.980]   you can't get the blood out from the core,
[01:57:50.980 --> 01:57:53.980]   you can't drop your core body temperature as much.
[01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:57.260]   And we started to understand from those types of data
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:58:01.420]   that part of the aging sleep-related problem equation
[01:58:01.420 --> 01:58:05.460]   is not just that the brain deteriorates in sleep-related regions,
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:08.780]   which we've been doing most of our work on,
[01:58:08.780 --> 01:58:13.900]   it's also part of a body equation and a thermoregulatory equation.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:16.580]   There was also a great study unrelated from Australia.
[01:58:16.580 --> 01:58:18.860]   They looked at insomnia patients,
[01:58:18.860 --> 01:58:22.140]   and they put their hands or their feet in warm water.
[01:58:22.140 --> 01:58:23.980]   And by doing that, it's a manipulation.
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:26.460]   And you can see how quickly their hands and their feet,
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:29.140]   what we call vasodilate, fill with blood.
[01:58:29.140 --> 01:58:33.300]   Healthy people vasodilated very quickly in response to that warm water,
[01:58:33.300 --> 01:58:37.020]   meaning that their hands and their feet sort of had this red,
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:40.980]   or at least for my feet, they would be this red tone to them.
[01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:43.220]   However, in the insomnia patients,
[01:58:43.220 --> 01:58:46.260]   they did not vasodilate anywhere near as well.
[01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:49.300]   So once again, it suggests that when you have problems with sleep,
[01:58:49.300 --> 01:58:54.340]   part of the equation may be that you have impaired thermoregulatory ability.
[01:58:54.340 --> 01:58:57.300]   And we do see this in insomnia patients.
[01:58:57.300 --> 01:59:02.500]   So that was, I think, a brilliant causal manipulation.
[01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:06.140]   The problem is that most of us don't have access
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:10.500]   to a sort of come-to-bed-at-eyes thermal suit.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:14.460]   So what can we do as a consequence?
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:17.940]   Please don't cut that. I get myself into terrible trouble, rightly so.
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:20.180]   -You'll be all right. -I should be punished.
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:24.580]   What they did then was to say, "Well, okay, let's look at this.
[01:59:24.580 --> 01:59:27.300]   Is there something that we could do that's cheaper
[01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:30.220]   and more accessible to the general public?"
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:34.460]   And if you look, there's a literature that preceded that manipulation,
[01:59:34.460 --> 01:59:38.060]   and it's so reliable that we now have a term for it in sleep science.
[01:59:38.060 --> 01:59:40.420]   It's called the warm bath effect.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:45.020]   And many people will say, "Look, I love to have a warm bath
[01:59:45.020 --> 01:59:50.780]   or a hot shower before bed, and I think when I get out, I'm nice and toasty,
[01:59:50.780 --> 01:59:54.300]   and it's because I'm nice and warm that I fall asleep and I stay asleep."
[01:59:54.300 --> 01:59:55.780]   It's the exact opposite.
[01:59:55.780 --> 01:59:58.900]   When you get out of the warm bath or the shower,
[01:59:58.900 --> 02:00:03.500]   you have once again vasodilated at the surface of your skin.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:08.420]   You get out of the bath, you get this huge thermal dump of heat away from the core.
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:11.380]   What happens? You fall asleep and you stay asleep more soundly.
[02:00:11.380 --> 02:00:14.100]   Now, there are other reasons that that has a benefit.
[02:00:14.100 --> 02:00:18.420]   It's relaxing, you decompress, you're staying away from technology, etc.
[02:00:18.420 --> 02:00:21.900]   But that is one of the thermal benefits.
[02:00:21.900 --> 02:00:24.420]   And in fact, there were studies by a legend in my field
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:29.060]   who passed away just a few years ago, Jim Horn at Loughborough University in the UK.
[02:00:29.060 --> 02:00:31.580]   And they did some of these pioneering studies.
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:34.300]   They were able to improve the amount of deep sleep
[02:00:34.300 --> 02:00:37.820]   by almost 40 minutes in some individuals.
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:40.300]   What was the protocol there?
[02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:44.300]   As I recall, I think they were in the bath for somewhere around...
[02:00:44.300 --> 02:00:47.660]   The bath duration time was somewhere around 30 minutes,
[02:00:47.660 --> 02:00:51.260]   but they were doing sort of segments where it was maybe 40 minutes,
[02:00:51.260 --> 02:00:53.500]   10 minutes in and then you could sort of get out.
[02:00:53.500 --> 02:00:56.540]   I think the temperature, because it was UK,
[02:00:56.540 --> 02:01:02.580]   was around about 40 degrees Celsius somewhere in that region.
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:07.060]   I may be getting those numbers wrong because I know we like to protocolize some of this.
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:12.580]   But they were able to show some really pleasant benefits to deep sleep.
[02:01:12.580 --> 02:01:14.340]   It also helped people fall asleep,
[02:01:14.340 --> 02:01:17.660]   helped them fall asleep by about 25 minutes faster
[02:01:17.660 --> 02:01:20.580]   in those people who were really having a hard time with sleep.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:22.260]   I'm going to take a hot bath tonight.
[02:01:22.260 --> 02:01:25.180]   I sometimes do the sauna in the evening before sleep.
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:28.700]   I'm a big fan of cold in the morning, cold shower, cold plunge in the morning.
[02:01:28.700 --> 02:01:30.620]   Because you're reverse engineering the equation.
[02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:33.820]   You're trapping the heat into the core of your body, you're waking yourself up.
[02:01:33.820 --> 02:01:36.780]   Right. And then in the evening, I've used sauna.
[02:01:36.780 --> 02:01:40.420]   The one issue with sauna is I really crank the heat of the sauna.
[02:01:40.420 --> 02:01:42.380]   And then sometimes if you do that right before bed,
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:45.340]   you take a warm shower right afterwards, you get into bed.
[02:01:45.340 --> 02:01:49.140]   Oftentimes, I'll wake up thirsty because it dehydrates you.
[02:01:49.140 --> 02:01:52.340]   And then if I drink a lot of water to hydrate after I'm in the sauna,
[02:01:52.340 --> 02:01:54.140]   then I'm waking up too much in the middle of the night.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:57.980]   So I think sauna is great, but right before bed...
[02:01:57.980 --> 02:02:03.340]   I would love to... I don't have a sauna at home or an access to...
[02:02:03.340 --> 02:02:07.220]   I mean, there are saunas in and around where I live.
[02:02:07.220 --> 02:02:11.300]   But what I want to do is have it proximal to my bedtime.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:16.060]   And my bedtime, because I'm a neutral type, you know, sort of around 11-ish,
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:19.060]   nowhere is open and willing to allow me to sit in the sauna.
[02:02:19.060 --> 02:02:20.940]   How long do you sit in there usually?
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:22.700]   I'm a little bonkers about this.
[02:02:22.700 --> 02:02:25.060]   Well, if it's in the evening and I just want to relax,
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:26.700]   I would say maybe 20, 30 minutes.
[02:02:26.700 --> 02:02:29.340]   And I tend to go really warm, warmer than I want to stay here.
[02:02:29.340 --> 02:02:31.060]   What does Peter do? Peter, is he your friend?
[02:02:31.060 --> 02:02:33.300]   I've done sauna cold plunge with Peter.
[02:02:33.300 --> 02:02:37.060]   He usually does it in the evening, goes sauna cold, sauna cold, sauna cold.
[02:02:37.060 --> 02:02:38.060]   Okay.
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:40.060]   Warm shower.
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:43.020]   And I don't know how many nights a week he's doing that.
[02:02:43.020 --> 02:02:45.820]   But in terms of the temperature of the sauna, you know,
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:50.100]   generally somewhere between 175 and 210 degrees,
[02:02:50.100 --> 02:02:51.820]   depending on how heat adapted you are.
[02:02:51.820 --> 02:02:55.220]   But I think a hot bath is great or a nice hot shower.
[02:02:55.220 --> 02:02:56.660]   Yeah, I've certainly done that.
[02:02:56.660 --> 02:03:00.460]   And when I'm traveling with jet lag, I will absolutely...
[02:03:00.460 --> 02:03:04.140]   That's part of my sort of jet lag protocol.
[02:03:04.140 --> 02:03:05.900]   I'll make sure I do...
[02:03:05.900 --> 02:03:09.820]   'Cause I don't really struggle too much with sleep, at least at present.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:13.500]   But when I go through jet lag and I go back home to London,
[02:03:13.500 --> 02:03:14.540]   of course it's tough.
[02:03:14.540 --> 02:03:15.540]   The worst.
[02:03:15.540 --> 02:03:18.660]   Protocolize the living daylights out of that and do as much as I can.
[02:03:18.660 --> 02:03:23.860]   So I think that's probably the end of the thermal story.
[02:03:23.860 --> 02:03:28.300]   Although we are now trying to see if we can take low fire approaches
[02:03:28.300 --> 02:03:30.500]   where we're going to do some foot warming.
[02:03:30.500 --> 02:03:32.500]   We're trying to develop some foot warming technology
[02:03:32.500 --> 02:03:37.900]   that can be built into maybe a mattress.
[02:03:37.900 --> 02:03:40.460]   And some mattress companies, there are some great ones.
[02:03:40.460 --> 02:03:43.500]   I know, obviously, Matteo at Eight Sleep,
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:46.180]   and they are doing amazing things.
[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:49.380]   I think his company, again, I have no affiliation,
[02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:51.940]   but we connect very well and he's brilliant.
[02:03:51.940 --> 02:03:53.700]   So they're doing something like that.
[02:03:53.700 --> 02:03:55.860]   I do use and love my Eight Sleep.
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:58.220]   Here's what I'd love somebody to engineer.
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:00.420]   And we've got a lot of people who listen to the podcast
[02:04:00.420 --> 02:04:02.980]   who think about product development.
[02:04:02.980 --> 02:04:06.980]   It would be wonderful to have a portable pair of socks
[02:04:06.980 --> 02:04:08.340]   so that you can use them when you travel
[02:04:08.340 --> 02:04:11.420]   or when you go to sleep anywhere at home or elsewhere
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:13.660]   that would warm your feet up at the beginning of the night.
[02:04:13.660 --> 02:04:15.500]   So this is a place for us to recap.
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:18.620]   Warm up to cool down, to fall asleep, right?
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:21.060]   Stay cool, stay cool.
[02:04:21.060 --> 02:04:25.740]   To stay asleep and then warm up in the morning to wake up.
[02:04:25.740 --> 02:04:28.140]   And so that is pretty straightforward
[02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:29.540]   to build into a pair of socks.
[02:04:29.540 --> 02:04:31.340]   Somebody can do this, somebody do this.
[02:04:31.340 --> 02:04:32.180]   Okay.
[02:04:32.180 --> 02:04:36.340]   - So we've done electrical, we've done thermal.
[02:04:36.340 --> 02:04:40.100]   - What about auditory?
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:43.620]   - Auditory, so acoustic stimulation.
[02:04:43.620 --> 02:04:49.380]   In a very similar way to electrical stimulation
[02:04:49.380 --> 02:04:52.740]   where you're trying to target that deep sleep
[02:04:52.740 --> 02:04:57.060]   and see if you, a better analogy is probably a metronome.
[02:04:57.060 --> 02:04:59.620]   And you're trying to see if you can kind of
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:02.900]   force the metronome further over back and forth
[02:05:02.900 --> 02:05:04.660]   with these types of technologies.
[02:05:04.660 --> 02:05:07.460]   So auditory stimulation came on the map.
[02:05:07.460 --> 02:05:09.780]   Again, I think probably Jan Born's group in Germany
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:11.420]   was some of the first to do this.
[02:05:11.420 --> 02:05:15.220]   They initially started with the same generalized approach
[02:05:15.220 --> 02:05:17.740]   where they would take acoustic tones
[02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:19.260]   and they would first assess
[02:05:19.260 --> 02:05:22.660]   what is your level of awakening threshold?
[02:05:22.660 --> 02:05:25.420]   So you'd be asleep and they would just have these tones,
[02:05:25.420 --> 02:05:28.700]   very light tones, like a sort of a ping, ping.
[02:05:28.700 --> 02:05:30.900]   And they would gradually increase the volume up
[02:05:30.900 --> 02:05:32.980]   and they would look to see what is the point
[02:05:32.980 --> 02:05:36.300]   where that volume of the tone wakes you up.
[02:05:36.300 --> 02:05:38.900]   And then they understood your specific threshold,
[02:05:38.900 --> 02:05:41.260]   what's called an awakening threshold.
[02:05:41.260 --> 02:05:42.460]   And they would set the volume
[02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:45.100]   to a sub-awakening threshold.
[02:05:45.100 --> 02:05:47.140]   Great, so you've got that locked in place.
[02:05:47.140 --> 02:05:50.060]   And now you start, and they did this
[02:05:50.060 --> 02:05:53.780]   within the first 90 minutes of people falling asleep.
[02:05:53.780 --> 02:05:57.260]   They started to play these sub-awakening level,
[02:05:57.260 --> 02:05:59.420]   volume levels of tones,
[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:03.780]   but they were playing them at this very slow frequency
[02:06:03.780 --> 02:06:07.620]   as if again, they're trying to sync and match
[02:06:07.620 --> 02:06:12.380]   the slow dancing rhythm of the slow brainwaves.
[02:06:12.380 --> 02:06:14.180]   And sure enough in that first study,
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:18.660]   and it was indiscriminate, meaning they just set the tones,
[02:06:18.660 --> 02:06:20.620]   playing like a metronome, set the tone,
[02:06:20.620 --> 02:06:22.980]   set the, and then, sorry, set the volume
[02:06:22.980 --> 02:06:25.340]   and then set the cadence of the volume,
[02:06:25.340 --> 02:06:28.260]   the speed, the frequency of those tones
[02:06:28.260 --> 02:06:30.740]   to just a little bit less than one hertz,
[02:06:30.740 --> 02:06:33.180]   a little bit less than one cycle per second.
[02:06:33.180 --> 02:06:34.540]   And then off you drifted to sleep
[02:06:34.540 --> 02:06:36.100]   and they played it for the first 90 minutes
[02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:38.460]   'cause that's the rich phase of deep sleep.
[02:06:38.460 --> 02:06:40.860]   And they were able to increase
[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:44.100]   the amount of deep sleep significantly.
[02:06:44.100 --> 02:06:45.780]   The problem in that first study
[02:06:45.780 --> 02:06:47.980]   was that they also did a memory test
[02:06:47.980 --> 02:06:50.740]   because in all of these studies, including my own,
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:54.460]   even if I boost your sleep tonight, Andrew Huberman,
[02:06:54.460 --> 02:06:56.780]   my next, if that's the result that you show me,
[02:06:56.780 --> 02:06:59.420]   I have four words for you as a scientist.
[02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:02.340]   Yes, and so what? (laughs)
[02:07:02.340 --> 02:07:04.420]   Is it functional?
[02:07:04.420 --> 02:07:06.340]   Because if I boost your sleep,
[02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:08.260]   but it doesn't change anything to you,
[02:07:08.260 --> 02:07:09.940]   the organism the next day,
[02:07:09.940 --> 02:07:12.340]   I'm going to suggest that that enhancement
[02:07:12.340 --> 02:07:15.540]   is epiphenomenal, not functional.
[02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:19.740]   - So it has to improve some reasonable metric
[02:07:19.740 --> 02:07:22.780]   in wakefulness that like improved memory,
[02:07:22.780 --> 02:07:25.540]   improved task switching ability.
[02:07:25.540 --> 02:07:26.820]   - So it's outcome measures.
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:27.780]   - Grip strength.
[02:07:27.780 --> 02:07:28.620]   - Correct.
[02:07:28.620 --> 02:07:29.460]   - Something.
[02:07:29.460 --> 02:07:31.740]   - Yeah, so even if I, for example,
[02:07:31.740 --> 02:07:33.980]   lower your blood pressure with a new drug,
[02:07:33.980 --> 02:07:36.900]   if I'm not changing your cardiovascular disease risk,
[02:07:36.900 --> 02:07:38.020]   then the question is,
[02:07:38.020 --> 02:07:40.780]   why am I just continuing on with the drug
[02:07:40.780 --> 02:07:42.780]   if it's not really changing much?
[02:07:42.780 --> 02:07:43.620]   Same thing here.
[02:07:43.620 --> 02:07:44.580]   And what they found was that
[02:07:44.580 --> 02:07:46.860]   when they did the memory test the next morning,
[02:07:46.860 --> 02:07:48.300]   by enhancing that deep sleep,
[02:07:48.300 --> 02:07:51.420]   there actually wasn't a memory benefit.
[02:07:51.420 --> 02:07:52.940]   So perhaps what was happening
[02:07:52.940 --> 02:07:55.100]   is that this was just non-specific.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.220]   So again, they then returned,
[02:07:57.220 --> 02:08:00.540]   and now others have returned to the closed loop mechanism,
[02:08:00.540 --> 02:08:02.980]   where now I've got electrodes on your head
[02:08:02.980 --> 02:08:05.580]   and I'm measuring your slow wave brainwaves.
[02:08:05.580 --> 02:08:08.060]   And literally I am next door in the room
[02:08:08.060 --> 02:08:10.540]   and I'm watching those slow brainwaves go up and down.
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:12.420]   And then I've got a computer algorithm
[02:08:12.420 --> 02:08:15.260]   that is watching those, "watching" in quotes,
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:16.340]   watching that too.
[02:08:16.340 --> 02:08:18.660]   And it's predicting when the next wave is going to come.
[02:08:18.660 --> 02:08:22.300]   And when it does, auditory tone clicks, sub-awakening,
[02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:23.580]   you don't wake up.
[02:08:23.580 --> 02:08:24.700]   And sure enough,
[02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:29.460]   when you sort of tone into the brain at that time,
[02:08:29.460 --> 02:08:32.820]   you boost the size of that brainwave.
[02:08:32.820 --> 02:08:33.660]   And once again,
[02:08:33.660 --> 02:08:35.860]   they boosted the size of those deep sleep brainwaves.
[02:08:35.860 --> 02:08:39.620]   They also improve those more quick bursts of activity,
[02:08:39.620 --> 02:08:40.740]   the sleep spindles.
[02:08:40.740 --> 02:08:44.140]   And now sure enough, they were able to improve memory.
[02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:45.740]   However, if you look at that paper,
[02:08:45.740 --> 02:08:47.780]   and here's why I think the first method
[02:08:47.780 --> 02:08:49.580]   may not have worked very well,
[02:08:49.580 --> 02:08:52.380]   and why I don't suggest people start
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:54.020]   trying to set this up themselves.
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:58.300]   When they kept stimulating the brain,
[02:08:58.300 --> 02:09:01.180]   slow wave after slow wave,
[02:09:01.180 --> 02:09:06.180]   after about three or four strikes of the metronome
[02:09:06.180 --> 02:09:10.020]   to boost those slow waves, the benefits stopped.
[02:09:10.020 --> 02:09:11.980]   And if they kept going,
[02:09:11.980 --> 02:09:14.700]   you started to inhibit the amount
[02:09:14.700 --> 02:09:17.180]   of naturally occurring deep sleep brainwaves.
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:18.860]   Why would it do this?
[02:09:18.860 --> 02:09:21.660]   Deep sleep brainwaves, I told you in the first episode,
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:25.220]   are a act of incredible neural coordination.
[02:09:25.220 --> 02:09:27.420]   It's mass coordination.
[02:09:27.420 --> 02:09:29.740]   Now, one of the extreme versions
[02:09:29.740 --> 02:09:32.180]   of mass coordinated propagated activity
[02:09:32.180 --> 02:09:35.260]   that is maladaptive, that is pathological,
[02:09:35.260 --> 02:09:37.780]   is called an epileptic seizure.
[02:09:37.780 --> 02:09:40.620]   And your brain has in place for the most part,
[02:09:40.620 --> 02:09:45.060]   stop gaps to prevent that type of spread
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:47.460]   of vast amounts of coordinated,
[02:09:47.460 --> 02:09:50.460]   spontaneous electrical oscillations,
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:52.820]   because the brain is such a conductive device
[02:09:52.820 --> 02:09:55.380]   that once you get it going, you've got to be careful,
[02:09:55.380 --> 02:09:58.060]   because it may start to conduct out of control.
[02:09:58.060 --> 02:10:00.380]   So we think that these checks and balances
[02:10:00.380 --> 02:10:01.700]   that were in place,
[02:10:01.700 --> 02:10:04.420]   even though you can artificially stimulate it for a while,
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:05.900]   after a while, the brain says,
[02:10:07.620 --> 02:10:09.020]   "You've got to back off for a while
[02:10:09.020 --> 02:10:10.980]   because this is getting a little bit out of control."
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:14.300]   You do a breath pause, and then you restart again,
[02:10:14.300 --> 02:10:16.380]   and you get the benefit, and then you breath pause.
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:18.220]   So you've got to do it a little bit intimately.
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:19.780]   Now, you've got to read the,
[02:10:19.780 --> 02:10:22.500]   what we call the supplemental materials of that paper.
[02:10:22.500 --> 02:10:23.340]   You've got to go,
[02:10:23.340 --> 02:10:24.940]   it's like the fine print on a legal document.
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:27.540]   If you dig into it, you can see that that was the case,
[02:10:27.540 --> 02:10:30.820]   but it wasn't necessarily evident.
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:35.820]   So those were really the data on acoustic stimulation.
[02:10:36.020 --> 02:10:38.820]   And now with this closed loop acoustic stimulation
[02:10:38.820 --> 02:10:40.380]   that we've got going on,
[02:10:40.380 --> 02:10:42.700]   it seems to provide these nice benefits.
[02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:46.740]   Some people then will probably be asking,
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:48.940]   what about these noise machines?
[02:10:48.940 --> 02:10:51.900]   What about white noise, et cetera?
[02:10:51.900 --> 02:10:53.460]   I've taken a look at this,
[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:56.220]   and so far, I think for white noise machines,
[02:10:56.220 --> 02:10:58.780]   the data is equivocal.
[02:10:58.780 --> 02:11:01.340]   There was a recent study, a review article,
[02:11:01.340 --> 02:11:04.420]   I think it looked at about 37 different studies.
[02:11:04.420 --> 02:11:06.340]   I could have this wrong.
[02:11:06.340 --> 02:11:09.580]   And what they found was that there was no reliable,
[02:11:09.580 --> 02:11:14.580]   robust directional effect of white noise machines on sleep.
[02:11:14.580 --> 02:11:17.700]   Some studies demonstrated that it helped sleep.
[02:11:17.700 --> 02:11:19.500]   Some studies didn't change sleep.
[02:11:19.500 --> 02:11:21.820]   Some studies suggested it may make sleep
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:23.860]   a little bit worse, just nothing reliable.
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:26.500]   - But maybe it's masking external sound.
[02:11:26.500 --> 02:11:27.580]   - Correct, so I think if,
[02:11:27.580 --> 02:11:30.180]   and one of the positive studies in that scenario
[02:11:30.180 --> 02:11:33.220]   was a study that was done in New York City.
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:37.620]   And it was in a region where there was a lot
[02:11:37.620 --> 02:11:42.020]   of external sound pollution and noise.
[02:11:42.020 --> 02:11:44.580]   As you could well imagine, it's New York City.
[02:11:44.580 --> 02:11:47.620]   And sure enough, that's where they got
[02:11:47.620 --> 02:11:50.460]   some really nice benefits of the white noise machine.
[02:11:50.460 --> 02:11:53.620]   So I think it is, you're right, context dependent.
[02:11:53.620 --> 02:11:55.620]   There was an interesting recent study
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:12:00.100]   that came out from Eterman Lerner's group
[02:12:00.100 --> 02:12:03.620]   at the University of Texas, San Antonio.
[02:12:03.620 --> 02:12:07.540]   And they didn't use white noise, they used pink noise.
[02:12:07.540 --> 02:12:09.060]   Now, what's the difference?
[02:12:09.060 --> 02:12:14.060]   Pink noise has a little less what we call power
[02:12:14.060 --> 02:12:17.820]   or intensity in the higher frequency ranges
[02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:19.860]   of the sound spectrum.
[02:12:19.860 --> 02:12:23.980]   And it's more enriched in the slower domain
[02:12:23.980 --> 02:12:26.660]   of that power spectrum, which you could argue
[02:12:26.660 --> 02:12:28.900]   is a bit more fitting with sleep.
[02:12:28.900 --> 02:12:32.020]   And I think this study may have been a nap study
[02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:33.620]   or I may be wrong, but anyway,
[02:12:33.620 --> 02:12:37.420]   what they found was that they increased total sleep time
[02:12:37.420 --> 02:12:41.500]   by, I think it was close to 30 minutes with the pink noise.
[02:12:41.500 --> 02:12:44.220]   They did not change the amount of deep sleep,
[02:12:44.220 --> 02:12:47.900]   but they did enhance the amount of stage two non-REM sleep,
[02:12:47.900 --> 02:12:49.500]   which we have spoken about before
[02:12:49.500 --> 02:12:51.780]   and we will in subsequent episodes
[02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:53.980]   that is beneficial for things like learning and memory,
[02:12:53.980 --> 02:12:55.820]   including motor skills.
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:58.180]   And they increased the amount of REM sleep
[02:12:58.180 --> 02:13:00.460]   to a much more modest degree,
[02:13:00.460 --> 02:13:02.740]   but those changes were significant.
[02:13:02.740 --> 02:13:07.740]   So I'm not trying to rule out noise machines right now
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:10.580]   and I have no affiliation with any company
[02:13:10.580 --> 02:13:11.860]   or anything in that space.
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:15.500]   I don't want to throw the baby out with the bath water.
[02:13:15.500 --> 02:13:17.420]   I just simply think that right now
[02:13:17.420 --> 02:13:18.820]   that we don't have enough evidence,
[02:13:18.820 --> 02:13:21.380]   but as you and I know, as scientists,
[02:13:21.380 --> 02:13:24.220]   absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.
[02:13:24.220 --> 02:13:25.740]   Just because it doesn't exist,
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:27.020]   doesn't mean that I don't think
[02:13:27.020 --> 02:13:30.620]   that it's still a potential route, these types of machines.
[02:13:30.620 --> 02:13:35.620]   - What about kinesthetic, stipular tools, protocols?
[02:13:35.620 --> 02:13:40.780]   Body position is something that has
[02:13:40.780 --> 02:13:43.740]   an interesting relationship to propensity to fall asleep
[02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:45.140]   based on brain cooling
[02:13:45.140 --> 02:13:47.660]   that we talked about in another episode,
[02:13:47.660 --> 02:13:51.700]   but what about manipulation of the body's movement?
[02:13:51.700 --> 02:13:55.540]   Is there anything in that domain?
[02:13:55.540 --> 02:13:58.300]   - It sounds wacky at first.
[02:13:58.300 --> 02:14:03.140]   - Yeah, it does, but I said it, so I still want to know.
[02:14:03.140 --> 02:14:06.620]   - Come on, social media, just be nice, be friendly.
[02:14:06.620 --> 02:14:11.420]   I would say that if you look back in, again,
[02:14:11.420 --> 02:14:13.340]   the annals of human history,
[02:14:13.340 --> 02:14:16.140]   from the very early inception,
[02:14:16.140 --> 02:14:20.660]   you will see mentions of a child being rocked in a manger
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:22.700]   or rocked in a crib.
[02:14:22.700 --> 02:14:26.540]   Often parents will take their young infant
[02:14:26.540 --> 02:14:30.300]   and you will quote unquote rock them to sleep.
[02:14:30.300 --> 02:14:34.900]   And we as adults will sometimes get in a hammock
[02:14:34.900 --> 02:14:36.820]   and if you're rocked, what happens?
[02:14:36.820 --> 02:14:37.820]   You will fall asleep.
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:40.180]   It's that prototypical image of someone
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:42.820]   with a hat over their face and in a hammock
[02:14:42.820 --> 02:14:44.540]   and they've sort of fallen asleep.
[02:14:44.540 --> 02:14:48.940]   So it was very clear that something was going on
[02:14:48.940 --> 02:14:50.220]   in this space.
[02:14:50.220 --> 02:14:53.740]   And then a group from the University of Geneva
[02:14:53.740 --> 02:14:57.220]   led by another fantastic sleep scientist, Sophie Schwartz,
[02:14:57.220 --> 02:15:01.060]   did an epic study that, again,
[02:15:01.060 --> 02:15:01.900]   it's one of those studies
[02:15:01.900 --> 02:15:06.380]   that I probably once more wished I'd done.
[02:15:06.380 --> 02:15:08.500]   Here's what they did.
[02:15:08.500 --> 02:15:10.660]   They took a bed frame
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:13.820]   and then they suspended it on chains from the ceiling.
[02:15:13.820 --> 02:15:14.660]   Now stick with me.
[02:15:14.660 --> 02:15:16.540]   I'm not going in that, you know,
[02:15:16.540 --> 02:15:18.780]   there's no hot candle wax being applied here.
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:21.460]   Don't worry, I'll keep it PG again.
[02:15:21.460 --> 02:15:22.860]   And then the next thing that they did
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:25.580]   was connect a rotating arm to that bed
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:27.460]   at the side of the bed.
[02:15:27.460 --> 02:15:32.220]   And that arm would start to simply just push the bed
[02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:35.260]   laterally from left to right, left to right.
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:37.140]   And they started just swinging the bed
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:39.260]   in a very controlled manner.
[02:15:39.260 --> 02:15:41.420]   But here, and I should ask Sophie exactly
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:42.820]   why they made this choice.
[02:15:42.820 --> 02:15:45.100]   They were rotating the bed,
[02:15:45.100 --> 02:15:48.060]   not at this sort of around one Hertz,
[02:15:48.060 --> 02:15:49.940]   which is what we'd done with electrical stimulation
[02:15:49.940 --> 02:15:51.580]   or acoustic stimulation.
[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:54.300]   They were doing it at 0.25 Hertz,
[02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:56.260]   which is much slower still.
[02:15:56.260 --> 02:15:57.100]   - Almost imperceptibly.
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:00.740]   - The bed is rocking, you know,
[02:16:00.740 --> 02:16:04.460]   once every four seconds.
[02:16:04.460 --> 02:16:08.620]   It's a very slow lull.
[02:16:08.620 --> 02:16:11.940]   And sure enough, what they found
[02:16:11.940 --> 02:16:13.180]   in the first series of studies,
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:16.180]   they did a nap study, a 90 minute nap study.
[02:16:16.180 --> 02:16:17.900]   When you did this rocking motion
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.860]   versus when the bed was still,
[02:16:19.860 --> 02:16:23.540]   they increased the speed with which people fell asleep.
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:25.700]   They boosted the amount of deep sleep
[02:16:25.700 --> 02:16:28.860]   and they boosted the amount of those sleep spindle
[02:16:28.860 --> 02:16:31.140]   oscillations that we described.
[02:16:31.140 --> 02:16:32.500]   Not satisfied, they then said,
[02:16:32.500 --> 02:16:35.180]   well, what happens across a night of sleep?
[02:16:35.180 --> 02:16:37.020]   They did it then across a night of sleep.
[02:16:37.020 --> 02:16:38.700]   They replicated the same findings
[02:16:38.700 --> 02:16:40.500]   and now they got a memory benefit.
[02:16:40.500 --> 02:16:43.380]   Now the memory benefit you could argue is modest.
[02:16:43.380 --> 02:16:47.500]   It was 10% of a memory improvement benefit
[02:16:47.500 --> 02:16:49.060]   when you woke up from sleep
[02:16:49.060 --> 02:16:51.740]   relative to the already sizable benefit
[02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:53.060]   that sleep naturally gives
[02:16:53.060 --> 02:16:54.900]   when you're not rocking the bed.
[02:16:54.900 --> 02:16:57.140]   But you think, well, 10%.
[02:16:57.140 --> 02:17:00.260]   If I were, let's say a student
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:04.660]   and I got a B and someone, the professor said,
[02:17:04.660 --> 02:17:07.220]   look, by the way, there is something that you can do
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:09.340]   and we can increase your grade by 10%
[02:17:09.340 --> 02:17:11.340]   and you can get to an A or an A plus
[02:17:11.340 --> 02:17:12.900]   depending on the grading system.
[02:17:12.900 --> 02:17:13.740]   Would you take it?
[02:17:13.740 --> 02:17:16.260]   Would you take 10% benefit?
[02:17:16.260 --> 02:17:17.500]   Absolutely, you would.
[02:17:17.500 --> 02:17:20.700]   So grade point averaging increase.
[02:17:20.700 --> 02:17:23.860]   So it isn't trivial necessarily.
[02:17:23.860 --> 02:17:26.940]   - Well, I also, I'm positively surprised
[02:17:26.940 --> 02:17:31.380]   how important this but so what condition
[02:17:31.380 --> 02:17:32.700]   is for you sleep researchers.
[02:17:32.700 --> 02:17:33.540]   - Yeah, and so what?
[02:17:33.540 --> 02:17:35.860]   - You know, that enhancement in say deep sleep
[02:17:35.860 --> 02:17:37.460]   or rapid eye movement sleep
[02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:40.460]   needs to translate to some daytime benefit
[02:17:40.460 --> 02:17:43.740]   in order to really get you guys excited.
[02:17:43.740 --> 02:17:45.900]   But here's why I think that's great.
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:49.300]   It's always great to have a high threshold for excitement.
[02:17:49.300 --> 02:17:53.020]   But one of the things that one could argue
[02:17:53.020 --> 02:17:55.380]   is that there are only so many tests
[02:17:55.380 --> 02:17:59.820]   that you can have in a laboratory of daytime functioning.
[02:17:59.820 --> 02:18:03.940]   I think I am on board the fact that sleep
[02:18:03.940 --> 02:18:05.580]   is the bedrock of mental health,
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:06.820]   physical health and performance.
[02:18:06.820 --> 02:18:10.460]   So an improvement in, you know,
[02:18:10.460 --> 02:18:12.860]   a statistically significant improvement
[02:18:12.860 --> 02:18:14.940]   in deep sleep or REM sleep,
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:18.180]   to me just seems like that's gotta be good for something.
[02:18:18.180 --> 02:18:19.860]   We might not know what that something is
[02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:21.380]   to test in the laboratory,
[02:18:21.380 --> 02:18:23.380]   but it could be that the threshold for improvement
[02:18:23.380 --> 02:18:26.340]   of say gut microbiome production of neurotransmitters
[02:18:26.340 --> 02:18:29.540]   is, you know, 0.1% improvement in deep sleep.
[02:18:29.540 --> 02:18:30.580]   We don't know, I made that up.
[02:18:30.580 --> 02:18:32.180]   So don't quote that statistic anyone.
[02:18:32.180 --> 02:18:36.740]   But I so admire the kind of extreme thresholds
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:38.420]   of what gets you guys excited.
[02:18:38.420 --> 02:18:40.020]   - No, your point is a very good one
[02:18:40.020 --> 02:18:43.180]   because you could argue based on what I just went back
[02:18:43.180 --> 02:18:47.820]   and said regarding the exercise study with Rhonda Patrick,
[02:18:47.820 --> 02:18:50.900]   I've just reversed my own threshold logic.
[02:18:50.900 --> 02:18:55.620]   I said to you, well, okay, exercise was able to overcome
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:58.660]   some of the deficits that occur by way of sleep deprivation
[02:18:58.660 --> 02:19:00.020]   for your blood sugar.
[02:19:00.020 --> 02:19:02.540]   But don't assume that that necessarily means
[02:19:02.540 --> 02:19:04.900]   it overcomes the detriments,
[02:19:04.900 --> 02:19:06.340]   the other detriments that you'll have
[02:19:06.340 --> 02:19:10.940]   for your hormonal health, your thermoregulatory capacity,
[02:19:10.940 --> 02:19:13.260]   your cardiovascular disease, your brain function.
[02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:16.940]   So I've just said, look, simply, you know,
[02:19:16.940 --> 02:19:20.340]   one thing doesn't mean that you've assessed all things.
[02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:23.500]   And now I'm saying, okay, if you don't show
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:26.940]   that it improved that one thing, then it's not functional.
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:30.100]   But Matt, by your own logic, you've said,
[02:19:30.100 --> 02:19:32.220]   but you didn't assess many of the other things.
[02:19:32.220 --> 02:19:35.260]   So even if it didn't improve memory,
[02:19:35.260 --> 02:19:39.500]   as you said, the bedrock of all things health,
[02:19:39.500 --> 02:19:41.300]   you need to assess all of them
[02:19:41.300 --> 02:19:43.140]   before you make your conclusion
[02:19:43.140 --> 02:19:46.060]   of the yes and so what failed test.
[02:19:46.060 --> 02:19:48.500]   So you're absolutely right to point that out.
[02:19:48.500 --> 02:19:54.900]   So what was interesting after that data came out in humans,
[02:19:54.900 --> 02:19:56.460]   which is usually the opposite way around,
[02:19:56.460 --> 02:19:59.100]   they started to look in animal models
[02:19:59.100 --> 02:20:01.220]   and you mentioned the vestibular system,
[02:20:01.220 --> 02:20:05.140]   this ability for us to understand motion and movement.
[02:20:05.140 --> 02:20:07.620]   And there's lots of mechanisms for that.
[02:20:07.620 --> 02:20:11.900]   They looked at mice and they started doing this rocking
[02:20:11.900 --> 02:20:16.900]   again and sure enough, the mice fell asleep faster.
[02:20:16.900 --> 02:20:19.420]   But then they found a strain of mice
[02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:24.420]   that did not have the lateral vestibular sensation mechanism
[02:20:24.420 --> 02:20:29.180]   and they rocked them just the same way,
[02:20:29.180 --> 02:20:31.740]   zero change in their sleep.
[02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:32.700]   Because you could imagine,
[02:20:32.700 --> 02:20:35.220]   well, it's important to understand the mechanism here.
[02:20:35.220 --> 02:20:37.180]   Is it that when you're rocking,
[02:20:37.180 --> 02:20:39.740]   there is, it's not just about vestibular stimulation,
[02:20:39.740 --> 02:20:44.740]   maybe that rocking sort of modestly changes friction,
[02:20:44.740 --> 02:20:47.100]   which changes temperature.
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:49.100]   You could come up with all sorts of wacky reasons.
[02:20:49.100 --> 02:20:51.740]   This was a very clear causal manipulation
[02:20:51.740 --> 02:20:53.820]   of the lateral vestibular system.
[02:20:53.820 --> 02:20:57.020]   And if that is not in place, you fail to get the benefit.
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:20:59.140]   So it clearly has something to do
[02:20:59.140 --> 02:21:01.100]   with the vestibular system.
[02:21:01.100 --> 02:21:03.060]   - Can I venture a guess as to why that is?
[02:21:03.060 --> 02:21:04.420]   - Yeah, please. - I interrupted,
[02:21:04.420 --> 02:21:07.660]   but in case I happen to be right by some chance,
[02:21:07.660 --> 02:21:11.220]   previously we talked about the need
[02:21:11.220 --> 02:21:15.460]   to lose a sense of one's posture
[02:21:15.460 --> 02:21:18.460]   and relationship to gravity in order to fall asleep.
[02:21:18.460 --> 02:21:20.340]   But you have to go into this lack
[02:21:20.340 --> 02:21:23.340]   of proprioceptive awareness in order to fall asleep.
[02:21:23.340 --> 02:21:25.420]   Proprioception being the knowledge of where one's limbs
[02:21:25.420 --> 02:21:27.220]   are relative to the body and body relative
[02:21:27.220 --> 02:21:29.020]   to other surfaces in gravity.
[02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:31.540]   And this is something that can be accomplished
[02:21:31.540 --> 02:21:34.700]   in these, you know, flotation tanks and things like that
[02:21:34.700 --> 02:21:38.140]   and other ways go to outer space.
[02:21:38.140 --> 02:21:40.660]   But- - The cheaper version.
[02:21:40.660 --> 02:21:41.780]   - The cheaper version.
[02:21:41.780 --> 02:21:47.860]   So could it be that the rocking at that very slow frequency
[02:21:47.860 --> 02:21:50.780]   is tapping into the vestibular system
[02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:53.300]   in a way that that proprioceptive feedback
[02:21:53.300 --> 02:21:58.300]   about body position is somehow starts to vanish?
[02:21:58.300 --> 02:22:00.740]   And because I'm intrigued by this idea
[02:22:00.740 --> 02:22:04.580]   that you have to lose perception of your body's positioning
[02:22:04.580 --> 02:22:08.460]   and proprioceptive awareness in order to fall asleep.
[02:22:08.460 --> 02:22:11.820]   And maybe your description earlier of a protocol
[02:22:11.820 --> 02:22:15.660]   of going on a mental walk in order to fall asleep.
[02:22:15.660 --> 02:22:17.780]   I just feel like these things are starting to converge
[02:22:17.780 --> 02:22:20.620]   on some themes here. - On a central common pathway
[02:22:20.620 --> 02:22:23.300]   that could be the absence of proprioceptive.
[02:22:23.300 --> 02:22:25.380]   I think it's entirely possible.
[02:22:25.380 --> 02:22:26.820]   In some ways right now,
[02:22:26.820 --> 02:22:28.820]   we think that these two things are associated
[02:22:28.820 --> 02:22:30.660]   that as you're falling asleep,
[02:22:30.660 --> 02:22:34.620]   gradually you will lose proprioceptive sensation.
[02:22:34.620 --> 02:22:39.620]   But simply the fact that two things are associated
[02:22:39.620 --> 02:22:41.380]   doesn't necessarily mean they're causal.
[02:22:41.380 --> 02:22:44.220]   But your suggestion here is a very elegant way
[02:22:44.220 --> 02:22:46.500]   of testing that hypothesis,
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:48.860]   which is that perhaps if you could show
[02:22:48.860 --> 02:22:53.620]   that the symmetric of proprioception becomes compromised
[02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:58.100]   when you start doing lateral sort of kinesthetic
[02:22:58.100 --> 02:23:00.220]   or movement stimulation,
[02:23:00.220 --> 02:23:02.460]   that's a very powerful demonstration
[02:23:02.460 --> 02:23:06.780]   that it's not just so here with the study in the mice,
[02:23:06.780 --> 02:23:09.820]   they lacked the lateral vestibular sensation
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:11.580]   and you lost the sleep benefit.
[02:23:11.580 --> 02:23:13.100]   But maybe there's one step down,
[02:23:13.100 --> 02:23:17.060]   which is that when you lose that vestibular stimulation,
[02:23:17.060 --> 02:23:18.740]   you lose the benefit on the thing
[02:23:18.740 --> 02:23:21.180]   that really is augmenting the sleep,
[02:23:21.180 --> 02:23:23.740]   which is the change in proprioception.
[02:23:23.740 --> 02:23:27.340]   So this is the first step in a chain of command
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:29.900]   and you've missed the final common transactor
[02:23:29.900 --> 02:23:32.300]   of that ingredient called better sleep.
[02:23:32.300 --> 02:23:34.860]   And those I would say are probably
[02:23:34.860 --> 02:23:39.860]   the four current bastions of sleep augmentation.
[02:23:39.860 --> 02:23:42.180]   Hopefully that describes to listeners
[02:23:42.180 --> 02:23:45.460]   the range of where sort of sleep 3.0,
[02:23:45.460 --> 02:23:48.100]   sleep enhancement 3.0 is going
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:51.380]   and also describes the way in which we can come down
[02:23:51.380 --> 02:23:54.660]   the strata from high friction, low friction to no friction.
[02:23:54.660 --> 02:23:58.340]   And also in terms of cost where you can have high cost,
[02:23:58.340 --> 02:23:59.540]   minimal cost, low cost.
[02:23:59.540 --> 02:24:03.460]   I mean, hot bath or a shower is pennies on the dollars so.
[02:24:03.460 --> 02:24:05.460]   - Especially if you take a cold shower in the morning
[02:24:05.460 --> 02:24:06.580]   and save on your heating bill.
[02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:08.660]   So you can take a little bit longer hot shower
[02:24:08.660 --> 02:24:11.740]   in the evening and then you net to zero difference.
[02:24:11.740 --> 02:24:13.940]   It's just my way of saying,
[02:24:13.940 --> 02:24:15.380]   take a cold shower in the morning.
[02:24:15.380 --> 02:24:16.940]   Feels great when you get out.
[02:24:16.940 --> 02:24:22.540]   What about some ways to enhance rapid eye movement sleep
[02:24:22.540 --> 02:24:25.420]   beyond what you've covered up until now?
[02:24:25.420 --> 02:24:30.540]   - So I think there are probably two emerging data sets
[02:24:30.540 --> 02:24:31.780]   that I've been intrigued by.
[02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:34.220]   One of which we've been doing some work on
[02:24:34.220 --> 02:24:35.940]   and it comes back to thermal.
[02:24:35.940 --> 02:24:38.380]   What I failed to mention is not just that you need
[02:24:38.380 --> 02:24:40.860]   to warm up to wake up, which you do,
[02:24:40.860 --> 02:24:45.860]   but you also need to warm up to REM sleep, but not too much.
[02:24:45.860 --> 02:24:49.260]   If you take an organism or a human being
[02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:51.940]   and you strip them of bedsheets and strip them of clothes
[02:24:51.940 --> 02:24:54.980]   so they're basically almost au naturel.
[02:24:54.980 --> 02:24:59.100]   If you warm the body up to what we call
[02:24:59.100 --> 02:25:02.020]   the thermo neutral point.
[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:04.660]   So it tends to be, and this sounds extreme
[02:25:04.660 --> 02:25:07.260]   and you don't have to do this because you're under sheets
[02:25:07.260 --> 02:25:10.100]   and that makes a world of difference.
[02:25:10.100 --> 02:25:14.620]   But if you warm the room to about 30 degrees Celsius,
[02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:19.220]   which gets close to at the surface ambient level
[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:21.900]   for your skin, something that can bring
[02:25:21.900 --> 02:25:24.780]   your core body temperature up back up to operating.
[02:25:24.780 --> 02:25:26.740]   Because I told you when you go,
[02:25:26.740 --> 02:25:28.380]   when you're in that deep sleep trigger zone,
[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:31.100]   the middle zone, your core body temperature drops
[02:25:31.100 --> 02:25:32.700]   and it drops significantly.
[02:25:32.700 --> 02:25:35.380]   And to wake up, you have to warm up.
[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:37.060]   But on the journey to warming up,
[02:25:37.060 --> 02:25:41.340]   you also have to get to thermo neutrality
[02:25:41.340 --> 02:25:43.220]   for you to have REM sleep.
[02:25:43.220 --> 02:25:46.260]   If I keep you too cold,
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:48.940]   I can reduce the amount of REM sleep.
[02:25:48.940 --> 02:25:53.780]   If I get you too hot, I can impair the amount of REM sleep.
[02:25:53.780 --> 02:25:56.180]   So it's a Goldilocks phenomenon, not too little,
[02:25:56.180 --> 02:25:58.500]   not too much, just the right amount.
[02:25:58.500 --> 02:26:03.140]   If I keep you there in terms of your thermal net neutrality,
[02:26:03.140 --> 02:26:05.580]   I can boost your REM sleep.
[02:26:05.580 --> 02:26:07.260]   Now that's fiendishly difficult
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:09.340]   when you're trying to solve that equation
[02:26:09.340 --> 02:26:10.420]   as a commercial device,
[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:12.460]   because different people are under different blankets,
[02:26:12.460 --> 02:26:13.940]   they run at different hot temperatures,
[02:26:13.940 --> 02:26:16.380]   they've got different partner situations.
[02:26:16.380 --> 02:26:19.340]   So you need a closed loop system again.
[02:26:19.340 --> 02:26:21.460]   But it's something that we're very interested in
[02:26:21.460 --> 02:26:24.700]   because almost all of the methods that I've described,
[02:26:24.700 --> 02:26:26.780]   and you are smart to pick this up,
[02:26:26.780 --> 02:26:29.020]   all target deep non-REM sleep.
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:30.860]   But we spoke about in the first episode,
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:32.380]   every stage of sleep is important.
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:33.740]   And in subsequent episodes,
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:37.140]   I'll tell you exactly why REM sleep is so critical.
[02:26:37.140 --> 02:26:38.300]   So how can we boost that?
[02:26:38.300 --> 02:26:41.260]   That's one way that we're starting to explore it,
[02:26:41.260 --> 02:26:44.220]   but nothing, I think, solid yet.
[02:26:44.220 --> 02:26:46.660]   The other is some of the drugs,
[02:26:46.660 --> 02:26:49.380]   the newer sleep medications that have come onto the market.
[02:26:49.380 --> 02:26:53.420]   And again, I think I mentioned I did take the task
[02:26:53.420 --> 02:26:56.340]   and I feel perhaps rightfully so
[02:26:56.340 --> 02:26:58.220]   about the classic sleep medications
[02:26:58.220 --> 02:27:00.300]   that if you look at the scientific data,
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:03.580]   if you can avoid them, it's probably best to do so.
[02:27:03.580 --> 02:27:05.860]   - Things like Ambien, et cetera.
[02:27:05.860 --> 02:27:07.820]   - We call them the Z drugs 'cause they all start,
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:09.660]   they're sort of generic names,
[02:27:09.660 --> 02:27:12.500]   sort of start with a Z, you know.
[02:27:12.500 --> 02:27:16.700]   Ambien, for example,
[02:27:16.700 --> 02:27:20.180]   has a Z at the start of it for its generic name,
[02:27:20.180 --> 02:27:22.540]   but I don't want to get into naming any necessarily.
[02:27:22.540 --> 02:27:23.980]   - That's all right, they'll come after me, not you.
[02:27:23.980 --> 02:27:26.300]   - Yeah, but for Ambien.
[02:27:26.300 --> 02:27:30.220]   What's interesting about those medications,
[02:27:30.220 --> 02:27:31.540]   again, they're in a class of drugs
[02:27:31.540 --> 02:27:33.700]   that we call the sedative hypnotics.
[02:27:33.700 --> 02:27:35.940]   So again, sedation, not sleep.
[02:27:35.940 --> 02:27:37.420]   And also there's been some great work,
[02:27:37.420 --> 02:27:38.940]   again, by Dirk and colleagues.
[02:27:38.940 --> 02:27:41.620]   If I were to show you that electrical signature
[02:27:41.620 --> 02:27:43.100]   of your deep sleep,
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:44.740]   it does look as though those drugs
[02:27:44.740 --> 02:27:47.980]   kind of increase the amount of electrical activity
[02:27:47.980 --> 02:27:49.780]   in that slower deep sleep range,
[02:27:49.780 --> 02:27:52.420]   except once you go all the way to the far left
[02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:54.860]   to the slowest of those slow brain waves,
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:58.260]   which turns out to be the types of waves
[02:27:58.260 --> 02:27:59.700]   that are most beneficial
[02:27:59.700 --> 02:28:03.580]   for most health-related brain and body functions.
[02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:06.180]   You get this huge dent
[02:28:06.180 --> 02:28:08.860]   in your electrical brainwave activity.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:10.860]   It's almost as though those drugs take a bite
[02:28:10.860 --> 02:28:14.820]   out of that realm of electrical activity.
[02:28:14.820 --> 02:28:18.700]   And of course there are issues with daytime sleepiness
[02:28:18.700 --> 02:28:20.140]   and some safety-related issues.
[02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:23.700]   There's been health associations, not necessarily causal.
[02:28:23.700 --> 02:28:28.140]   And so I offered one scientific viewpoint
[02:28:28.140 --> 02:28:32.220]   of those medications in the book, and so be it.
[02:28:32.220 --> 02:28:35.260]   It's not as though I'm anti-medication, as I said,
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:37.620]   and some of the new medications are very interesting.
[02:28:37.620 --> 02:28:38.740]   Brings me back to REM sleep.
[02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:42.580]   There's a new class of sleep medications called the DORAs,
[02:28:42.580 --> 02:28:47.580]   and it stands for, it's D-O-R-A, small S,
[02:28:47.580 --> 02:28:53.380]   and it stands for dual orexin receptor antagonists.
[02:28:53.380 --> 02:28:56.820]   Oh my goodness, mouthful.
[02:28:56.820 --> 02:28:58.300]   That just sounds like word salad
[02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:00.220]   to anyone who's not a neuroscientist.
[02:29:00.220 --> 02:29:05.740]   Orexin, which is part of that set of words,
[02:29:05.740 --> 02:29:07.300]   is a chemical in the brain.
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:11.420]   And orexin became prominent with the study of narcolepsy.
[02:29:11.420 --> 02:29:13.580]   And what we, we as the Royal We,
[02:29:13.580 --> 02:29:17.180]   people like Emmanuel Mignot and others at Stanford,
[02:29:17.180 --> 02:29:19.580]   what they discovered was that narcoleptic patients
[02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:24.580]   have a profound deficit in this chemical, orexin,
[02:29:24.580 --> 02:29:25.860]   and in the receptors. - Also called hypocretin.
[02:29:25.860 --> 02:29:27.460]   - Also called hypocretin.
[02:29:27.460 --> 02:29:29.300]   And it has a function both, it turns out,
[02:29:29.300 --> 02:29:31.900]   for wakefulness and a function for feeding
[02:29:31.900 --> 02:29:33.700]   and eating-related behaviors.
[02:29:33.700 --> 02:29:35.980]   Hypocretin was probably more related to it
[02:29:35.980 --> 02:29:37.460]   when it was time, 'cause it was discovered
[02:29:37.460 --> 02:29:38.940]   right around the same time.
[02:29:38.940 --> 02:29:40.700]   - So early 2000s. - And two different groups,
[02:29:40.700 --> 02:29:42.380]   yes, exactly, beautiful.
[02:29:42.380 --> 02:29:45.220]   Two different groups named it differently.
[02:29:45.220 --> 02:29:48.580]   But narcolepsy, as some people may know,
[02:29:48.580 --> 02:29:50.820]   is it's a condition, it's a sleep disorder.
[02:29:50.820 --> 02:29:52.700]   And one of the symptoms is called
[02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:54.300]   excessive daytime sleepiness,
[02:29:54.300 --> 02:29:57.620]   where you have inappropriate invasions of sleep
[02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:00.100]   during the day when you want to be awake.
[02:30:00.100 --> 02:30:00.940]   Why?
[02:30:00.940 --> 02:30:03.900]   Well, it turns out that this chemical orexin
[02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:06.540]   acts like a finger on the light switch
[02:30:06.540 --> 02:30:09.260]   of all of the apparatus in your brain
[02:30:09.260 --> 02:30:11.900]   that switches on to force you awake.
[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:13.500]   It reaches down into the,
[02:30:13.500 --> 02:30:15.780]   it's released from a central part of your brain
[02:30:15.780 --> 02:30:16.660]   called the hypothalamus,
[02:30:16.660 --> 02:30:18.700]   and it releases down into the brainstem
[02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:22.220]   to activate what we call the ascending arousal system,
[02:30:22.220 --> 02:30:25.140]   or the reticular ascending arousal system of the brain.
[02:30:25.140 --> 02:30:27.460]   And when that lights up, it's like the light switch,
[02:30:27.460 --> 02:30:31.260]   which says on for waking brain activity.
[02:30:31.260 --> 02:30:36.260]   And so what was happening was that this orexin up higher up
[02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:41.500]   was not forcing the finger of wakefulness on during the day.
[02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:45.220]   So almost instead of a switch, which is what you want,
[02:30:45.220 --> 02:30:47.300]   it was more like a dimmer switch.
[02:30:47.300 --> 02:30:49.300]   And you know, when you get to that dimmer switch point
[02:30:49.300 --> 02:30:50.740]   right in the middle where it's flickering,
[02:30:50.740 --> 02:30:52.580]   it's on, it's off, it's on, it's off,
[02:30:52.580 --> 02:30:55.540]   that's almost the state in which the narcoleptic brain was
[02:30:55.540 --> 02:30:57.980]   because they had a deficiency of orexin.
[02:30:57.980 --> 02:31:01.380]   So that was the orexin story in narcolepsy.
[02:31:01.380 --> 02:31:03.500]   So why is it relevant for insomnia?
[02:31:03.500 --> 02:31:06.900]   Well, people realized the problem with narcolepsy
[02:31:06.900 --> 02:31:08.820]   is that they're asleep during the day
[02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:10.660]   when they want to be awake.
[02:31:10.660 --> 02:31:14.220]   But the opposite problem is true of insomnia patients.
[02:31:14.220 --> 02:31:18.300]   They want to be asleep at night, but they're awake.
[02:31:18.300 --> 02:31:21.220]   So why don't we selectively develop a drug
[02:31:21.220 --> 02:31:23.100]   that goes after this finger
[02:31:23.100 --> 02:31:25.900]   that flips the light switch on for wakefulness,
[02:31:25.900 --> 02:31:28.500]   but now let's block it at night.
[02:31:28.500 --> 02:31:31.980]   So we flick the switch back in the off position,
[02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:34.420]   we turn out the lights for the brain,
[02:31:34.420 --> 02:31:37.860]   and we remove the problem of insomnia,
[02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:41.140]   which is excessive wakefulness at night,
[02:31:41.140 --> 02:31:42.340]   which is one of its problems.
[02:31:42.340 --> 02:31:45.900]   And therefore, when you remove that,
[02:31:45.900 --> 02:31:48.460]   indirectly what comes in its place
[02:31:48.460 --> 02:31:50.540]   is this thing called more naturalistic sleep.
[02:31:50.540 --> 02:31:52.740]   And that's why it's been more favored now
[02:31:52.740 --> 02:31:54.860]   as the principal drug.
[02:31:54.860 --> 02:31:57.460]   It's still not necessarily well known by physicians
[02:31:57.460 --> 02:31:58.780]   or it's not very well prescribed.
[02:31:58.780 --> 02:32:00.660]   It's not very well covered here in the United States,
[02:32:00.660 --> 02:32:01.980]   unfortunately, with insurance.
[02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:05.220]   So it's a very expensive option right now.
[02:32:05.220 --> 02:32:08.540]   Health providers will choose not to do that, unfortunately.
[02:32:08.540 --> 02:32:11.180]   So what's interesting about that drug though,
[02:32:11.180 --> 02:32:13.940]   is that it's mixed in terms of the studies,
[02:32:13.940 --> 02:32:16.980]   but quite reliably, it does seem to improve sleep,
[02:32:16.980 --> 02:32:18.940]   very much so, but it seems to,
[02:32:18.940 --> 02:32:20.820]   unlike those classic sleeping pills,
[02:32:20.820 --> 02:32:24.020]   which artificially look like they're increasing deep sleep,
[02:32:24.020 --> 02:32:26.860]   even though they're not, they're doing sedation.
[02:32:26.860 --> 02:32:30.100]   These drugs can improve most all aspects of sleep,
[02:32:30.100 --> 02:32:31.660]   but including REM sleep,
[02:32:31.660 --> 02:32:34.540]   which those classic sleeping pills did not.
[02:32:34.540 --> 02:32:35.540]   Why is it doing that?
[02:32:35.540 --> 02:32:36.380]   We still don't know,
[02:32:36.380 --> 02:32:39.900]   but one of the things that these DORA drugs do
[02:32:39.900 --> 02:32:41.420]   that block the orexin,
[02:32:41.900 --> 02:32:45.300]   take off the on position of the light switch
[02:32:45.300 --> 02:32:46.700]   and flip them off,
[02:32:46.700 --> 02:32:48.660]   when you switch it off,
[02:32:48.660 --> 02:32:52.300]   it can actually then allow the activation
[02:32:52.300 --> 02:32:54.380]   or the stimulation of something called
[02:32:54.380 --> 02:32:59.380]   melanin concentrated hormone or MCH in the brain.
[02:32:59.380 --> 02:33:03.500]   And that, when it is triggered on,
[02:33:03.500 --> 02:33:07.300]   can stimulate another chemical called acetylcholine
[02:33:07.300 --> 02:33:09.980]   in the brain, which is a neurotransmitter.
[02:33:09.980 --> 02:33:12.260]   If there is one neurotransmitter in the brain
[02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:15.180]   that seems to be responsible almost exclusively
[02:33:15.180 --> 02:33:16.620]   for this thing called REM sleep,
[02:33:16.620 --> 02:33:18.700]   or dominantly I should say for REM sleep,
[02:33:18.700 --> 02:33:20.300]   it is acetylcholine.
[02:33:20.300 --> 02:33:22.660]   And this was discovered way back in the 1970s
[02:33:22.660 --> 02:33:26.140]   by my former, one of my former mentors,
[02:33:26.140 --> 02:33:28.060]   Alan Hobson at Harvard.
[02:33:28.060 --> 02:33:30.980]   And what this drug may be doing
[02:33:30.980 --> 02:33:33.340]   is indirectly boosting the amounts
[02:33:33.340 --> 02:33:35.020]   of acetylcholine in the brain,
[02:33:35.020 --> 02:33:36.180]   particularly in a region of the brain
[02:33:36.180 --> 02:33:37.340]   called the basal forebrain,
[02:33:37.340 --> 02:33:39.500]   which is a REM sleep regulating region.
[02:33:39.500 --> 02:33:42.260]   And that's the reason that you get boosts in REM sleep.
[02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:45.300]   And people also report dreaming a little bit more too
[02:33:45.300 --> 02:33:46.660]   on those medications.
[02:33:46.660 --> 02:33:48.740]   So thermal manipulation,
[02:33:48.740 --> 02:33:51.460]   getting you to net neutral thermal zones
[02:33:51.460 --> 02:33:53.060]   helped increase REM sleep.
[02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:54.660]   But also there are some medications
[02:33:54.660 --> 02:33:56.700]   that were not necessarily designed
[02:33:56.700 --> 02:33:58.820]   for REM sleep enhancements selectively,
[02:33:58.820 --> 02:34:00.460]   but there is evidence that they do that.
[02:34:00.460 --> 02:34:03.580]   So if you ask me, where are we at with REM?
[02:34:03.580 --> 02:34:07.700]   It's certainly more bereft of methods
[02:34:07.700 --> 02:34:09.820]   than deep non-REM sleep,
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:12.140]   but we are starting to find some now.
[02:34:12.140 --> 02:34:14.020]   - Given what you just told us about the role
[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:17.060]   of acetylcholine in rapid eye movement sleep,
[02:34:17.060 --> 02:34:21.300]   what about taking precursors to acetylcholine?
[02:34:21.300 --> 02:34:23.580]   I mean, certainly a good number of them exist,
[02:34:23.580 --> 02:34:27.780]   even like over-the-counter supplements like alpha-GPC.
[02:34:27.780 --> 02:34:31.660]   And then of course there are choline donors
[02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:33.940]   and things like that that can increase
[02:34:33.940 --> 02:34:35.940]   cholinergic transmission.
[02:34:35.940 --> 02:34:38.340]   Does that get into issues of,
[02:34:38.340 --> 02:34:41.660]   if one does that globally,
[02:34:41.660 --> 02:34:43.700]   is it possible that you increase arousal
[02:34:43.700 --> 02:34:44.940]   and have trouble falling asleep?
[02:34:44.940 --> 02:34:47.060]   Because some of those cholinergic agents
[02:34:47.060 --> 02:34:49.380]   can be activating. - Can be quite activating.
[02:34:49.380 --> 02:34:50.660]   So that's one of the problems.
[02:34:50.660 --> 02:34:54.500]   The second is you may stop
[02:34:54.500 --> 02:34:57.220]   because you're going to have to take them before bed.
[02:34:57.220 --> 02:35:00.860]   You may brute force REM sleep to arrive earlier
[02:35:00.860 --> 02:35:02.900]   and you may therefore come at the cost
[02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:05.660]   of deep non-REM sleep.
[02:35:05.660 --> 02:35:09.540]   And so you'd have to get some kind of timed release capsule,
[02:35:09.540 --> 02:35:10.500]   which you can do.
[02:35:10.500 --> 02:35:13.100]   You can coat these capsule and you can get a timed release
[02:35:13.100 --> 02:35:15.660]   and you would want to take it before bed.
[02:35:15.660 --> 02:35:18.460]   And then maybe after about four or five hours,
[02:35:18.460 --> 02:35:21.420]   you would want to kick it into gear because now you're in.
[02:35:21.420 --> 02:35:23.900]   So it's a little bit, it gets a bit tricky.
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:26.180]   - Yeah, this is one of the reasons why I personally,
[02:35:26.180 --> 02:35:27.100]   this is just my experience.
[02:35:27.100 --> 02:35:29.380]   I'm not a fan of supplements that tap
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:32.340]   into the serotonergic system for sake of sleep
[02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:35.460]   because certainly serotonin plays an important role in sleep
[02:35:35.460 --> 02:35:37.660]   but anytime I've taken something,
[02:35:37.660 --> 02:35:40.700]   5-HTP or something like that to try and improve sleep,
[02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:44.660]   I find that I fall asleep and then I wake up very deep,
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:47.380]   deep sleep and then I wake up very alert
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:49.380]   and I have trouble with the later phases of sleep.
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:52.180]   And I think that is because yes,
[02:35:52.180 --> 02:35:53.580]   serotonin is involved in sleep,
[02:35:53.580 --> 02:35:55.900]   but it's involved in sleep at a very specific point
[02:35:55.900 --> 02:35:57.100]   in this, as you refer to it,
[02:35:57.100 --> 02:35:59.820]   this like symphony or ballet of different sleep stages
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:02.460]   and how they evolve and interdigitate
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:04.300]   with one another across the night.
[02:36:04.300 --> 02:36:06.740]   So, while I do think there are things
[02:36:06.740 --> 02:36:08.380]   that one can use pharmacologically
[02:36:08.380 --> 02:36:10.340]   or supplement based to improve sleep,
[02:36:10.340 --> 02:36:12.540]   generally, I like to think of those as the kind of thing
[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:15.660]   that kind of pushes away front of the whole sleep process
[02:36:15.660 --> 02:36:18.740]   as opposed to trying to tap into one specific neurotransmitter
[02:36:18.740 --> 02:36:20.660]   within the sleep ballet.
[02:36:20.660 --> 02:36:21.500]   - Exactly.
[02:36:21.500 --> 02:36:23.740]   Yeah, I like that way of thinking
[02:36:23.740 --> 02:36:27.980]   and you do have to be careful because in biology,
[02:36:27.980 --> 02:36:32.180]   it's often rare that there are any free lunches in truth.
[02:36:32.180 --> 02:36:36.300]   Nature has optimized our systems so exquisitely
[02:36:36.300 --> 02:36:38.820]   that when you start to try and gain the system
[02:36:38.820 --> 02:36:41.540]   for one thing, be very mindful
[02:36:41.540 --> 02:36:43.940]   that it may come at the cost of something else.
[02:36:43.940 --> 02:36:46.980]   And that's why whenever we're doing these types
[02:36:46.980 --> 02:36:50.260]   of sort of developments of technologies for sleep,
[02:36:50.260 --> 02:36:52.300]   we are very cautious, not just to say,
[02:36:52.300 --> 02:36:54.540]   did we improve the thing that we're targeting?
[02:36:54.540 --> 02:36:57.140]   But first call of business in medicine
[02:36:57.140 --> 02:36:59.340]   is not will this drug help you,
[02:36:59.340 --> 02:37:02.620]   but firstly, is there any downside in terms of
[02:37:02.620 --> 02:37:04.340]   will this drug hurt you?
[02:37:04.340 --> 02:37:06.900]   And then you have to understand the cost ratio benefit
[02:37:06.900 --> 02:37:08.500]   between those two things.
[02:37:08.500 --> 02:37:10.500]   - Yeah, just one more anecdote
[02:37:10.500 --> 02:37:12.420]   that is in agreement with what you said.
[02:37:12.420 --> 02:37:15.780]   Nowadays, there's an increased excitement around peptides,
[02:37:15.780 --> 02:37:16.700]   the use of peptides.
[02:37:16.700 --> 02:37:17.820]   - There is, yeah.
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:20.020]   - And I currently don't use any,
[02:37:20.020 --> 02:37:24.340]   but I did a short run with occasional use of cermorelin,
[02:37:24.340 --> 02:37:27.380]   which is a secretagogue, which is a growth hormone.
[02:37:27.380 --> 02:37:28.220]   - That's right.
[02:37:28.220 --> 02:37:30.660]   - It promotes the secretion of growth hormone,
[02:37:30.660 --> 02:37:31.620]   not growth hormone itself.
[02:37:31.620 --> 02:37:34.260]   I took it not many times and I was tracking my sleep.
[02:37:34.260 --> 02:37:37.060]   And what I noticed is it put me into a little bit
[02:37:37.060 --> 02:37:37.900]   of a hypnotic state.
[02:37:37.900 --> 02:37:42.140]   Dreams were very intense, but deep, deep sleep.
[02:37:42.140 --> 02:37:44.380]   But according to my sleep tracker,
[02:37:44.380 --> 02:37:46.540]   and I only ran this for maybe three nights,
[02:37:46.540 --> 02:37:48.700]   according to my sleep tracker,
[02:37:48.700 --> 02:37:52.060]   it completely eliminated all my rapid eye movement sleep,
[02:37:52.060 --> 02:37:54.700]   at least as measured by the sleep tracker.
[02:37:54.700 --> 02:37:57.580]   But the amount of deep sleep, of slow wave sleep,
[02:37:57.580 --> 02:38:00.260]   just like massively expanded.
[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:02.020]   So that can't be good.
[02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:02.900]   That can't be good.
[02:38:02.900 --> 02:38:06.500]   - No, you don't want to mess with that cocktail ratio
[02:38:06.500 --> 02:38:08.340]   that we described in the first episode.
[02:38:08.340 --> 02:38:13.340]   We presume that it's emerged as the correct Da Vinci code
[02:38:13.340 --> 02:38:16.380]   of sleep stage recipes.
[02:38:16.380 --> 02:38:20.220]   And there may be a time and a place where you want
[02:38:20.220 --> 02:38:25.220]   to over-index on one of those things for whatever reason,
[02:38:26.060 --> 02:38:29.220]   but to do it consistently and permanently,
[02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:33.460]   I would again say, if you think within the space
[02:38:33.460 --> 02:38:38.460]   of a lifetime that you know something that,
[02:38:38.460 --> 02:38:44.480]   2.6 million years of evolution has not understood,
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:48.220]   chances are you're probably wrong.
[02:38:48.220 --> 02:38:49.060]   - I agree.
[02:38:49.060 --> 02:38:52.520]   And certainly later in this series,
[02:38:52.520 --> 02:38:55.300]   we will touch into some of the over-the-counter supplements
[02:38:55.300 --> 02:38:57.820]   and other things that one can do in order to augment sleep
[02:38:57.820 --> 02:38:59.180]   that do seem to have some benefit
[02:38:59.180 --> 02:39:01.780]   because there are such things.
[02:39:01.780 --> 02:39:05.500]   But in the meantime, thank you for providing
[02:39:05.500 --> 02:39:10.500]   this incredible arc of description of basic sleep hygiene
[02:39:10.500 --> 02:39:13.940]   and regularity, light, dark temperature,
[02:39:13.940 --> 02:39:15.340]   getting out of bed when you can't sleep,
[02:39:15.340 --> 02:39:20.340]   alcohol, food, caffeine, cannabis, unconventional protocols,
[02:39:20.340 --> 02:39:24.220]   and let's call them advanced protocols,
[02:39:24.220 --> 02:39:27.620]   electrical protocol, brain stimulation, in other words,
[02:39:27.620 --> 02:39:32.140]   thermal manipulation, auditory stimulation, kinesthetic,
[02:39:32.140 --> 02:39:36.260]   and then these rapid eye movement enhancing drugs
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:38.880]   and on and on.
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:41.920]   Matt, I can't thank you enough.
[02:39:41.920 --> 02:39:46.920]   This has been just replete with actionable tools
[02:39:46.920 --> 02:39:48.820]   and considerations, and I love that you took us
[02:39:48.820 --> 02:39:51.980]   to the cutting edge of what's happening now.
[02:39:51.980 --> 02:39:55.880]   I think it's wonderful to talk about the history of the field
[02:39:55.880 --> 02:39:56.840]   and what was discovered.
[02:39:56.840 --> 02:39:58.340]   It's wonderful to talk about the present,
[02:39:58.340 --> 02:40:01.780]   but it's wonderful that you've put our eyes
[02:40:01.780 --> 02:40:04.140]   a bit into the future of what the technology
[02:40:04.140 --> 02:40:07.340]   for sleep enhancement and monitoring holds.
[02:40:07.340 --> 02:40:10.340]   So once again, thank you.
[02:40:10.340 --> 02:40:12.060]   - You're so welcome.
[02:40:12.060 --> 02:40:16.380]   - If folks haven't already seen or listened to episode one,
[02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:17.620]   highly recommend they do.
[02:40:17.620 --> 02:40:21.660]   And of course, we will be back soon with episode three,
[02:40:21.660 --> 02:40:25.040]   which is going to get into all the science
[02:40:25.040 --> 02:40:30.040]   and actionable protocols related to napping and caffeine
[02:40:30.040 --> 02:40:33.460]   and some other exciting things that I know
[02:40:33.460 --> 02:40:36.620]   impact people's daily lives and that they can get moving on
[02:40:36.620 --> 02:40:38.420]   should they choose right away.
[02:40:38.420 --> 02:40:40.280]   And by moving on, I mean to sleep.
[02:40:40.280 --> 02:40:43.500]   - Thank you again, a delight.
[02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.380]   Cannot wait for the next recording.
[02:40:45.380 --> 02:40:47.240]   - Thank you for joining me for today's episode
[02:40:47.240 --> 02:40:48.780]   with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[02:40:48.780 --> 02:40:50.980]   To learn more about Dr. Walker's research
[02:40:50.980 --> 02:40:52.620]   and to learn more about his book
[02:40:52.620 --> 02:40:53.900]   and his social media handles,
[02:40:53.900 --> 02:40:56.260]   please see the links in our show note captions.

[02:41:16.880 --> 02:41:18.140]   If you have any questions for me
[02:41:18.140 --> 02:41:20.740]   or comments about the podcast or topics or guests
[02:41:20.740 --> 02:41:23.180]   that you'd like me to feature on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:41:23.180 --> 02:41:25.660]   please put those in the comment section on YouTube.
[02:41:25.660 --> 02:41:27.580]   I do read all the comments.
[02:41:27.580 --> 02:41:29.580]   On many episodes of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:31.080]   we discuss supplements.
[02:41:31.080 --> 02:41:33.220]   While supplements aren't necessary for everybody,
[02:41:33.220 --> 02:41:35.260]   many people derive tremendous benefit from them
[02:41:35.260 --> 02:41:36.620]   for things like improving sleep,
[02:41:36.620 --> 02:41:38.620]   for hormone support, and for focus.
[02:41:38.620 --> 02:41:40.140]   To learn more about the supplements discussed
[02:41:40.140 --> 02:41:41.380]   on the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:41:41.380 --> 02:41:43.960]   go to livemomentous, spelled O-U-S,
[02:41:43.960 --> 02:41:46.820]   that's livemomentous.com/huberman.
[02:41:46.820 --> 02:41:49.060]   If you're not already following me on social media,
[02:41:49.060 --> 02:41:51.800]   I'm HubermanLab on all social media platforms.
[02:41:51.800 --> 02:41:55.280]   So that's Instagram, X, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Threads.
[02:41:55.280 --> 02:41:56.780]   And on all those platforms,
[02:41:56.780 --> 02:41:59.080]   I discuss science and science-related tools,
[02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:00.580]   some of which overlaps with the content
[02:42:00.580 --> 02:42:02.040]   of the Huberman Lab Podcast,
[02:42:02.040 --> 02:42:03.880]   but much of which is distinct from the content
[02:42:03.880 --> 02:42:05.380]   covered on the Huberman Lab Podcast.
[02:42:05.380 --> 02:42:08.680]   So again, it's Huberman Lab on all social media platforms.
[02:42:08.680 --> 02:42:09.840]   If you haven't already subscribed
[02:42:09.840 --> 02:42:11.580]   to our Neural Network newsletter,
[02:42:11.580 --> 02:42:14.460]   our Neural Network newsletter is a zero-cost newsletter
[02:42:14.460 --> 02:42:17.340]   that provides podcast summaries as well as protocols
[02:42:17.340 --> 02:42:19.820]   in the form of brief one-to-three-page PDFs
[02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:22.460]   that cover everything from neuroplasticity and learning
[02:42:22.460 --> 02:42:24.520]   to sleep to deliberate cold exposure
[02:42:24.520 --> 02:42:25.960]   and deliberate heat exposure.
[02:42:25.960 --> 02:42:28.980]   We have a foundational fitness protocol and much more,
[02:42:28.980 --> 02:42:30.960]   all of which, again, is completely zero cost.
[02:42:30.960 --> 02:42:34.020]   You simply go to HubermanLab.com, go to the menu tab,
[02:42:34.020 --> 02:42:35.260]   scroll down to newsletter,
[02:42:35.260 --> 02:42:37.660]   and by supplying your email, you can subscribe.
[02:42:37.660 --> 02:42:39.860]   I want to point out that we do not share your email
[02:42:39.860 --> 02:42:40.780]   with anybody.
[02:42:40.780 --> 02:42:42.120]   Thank you once again for joining me
[02:42:42.120 --> 02:42:44.260]   for today's discussion all about sleep
[02:42:44.260 --> 02:42:45.860]   with Dr. Matthew Walker.
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:47.860]   And last but certainly not least,
[02:42:47.860 --> 02:42:49.820]   thank you for your interest in science.
[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:52.400]   (upbeat music)
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:54.980]   (upbeat music)
