[00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.160]   Welcome to Bogle Heads on Investing, episode number 23.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.920]   Today, our special guest is Dr. Burton Malkiel,
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.920]   a Princeton economist and the author of A Random Walk
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.160]   Down Wall Street.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.760]   First published in 1973, this book
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.560]   was an inspiration for Jack Bogle
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.040]   to start the first index mutual fund.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:38.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.880]   Welcome, everyone.
[00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.680]   My name is Rick Ferry, and I'm the host
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.440]   of Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.240]   This podcast, as with all podcasts,
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.160]   is brought to you by the John C. Bogle Center
[00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.920]   for Financial Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.680]   that can be found at boglecenter.net.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.120]   Today, our special guest is Dr. Burton Malkiel.
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.920]   He needs no introduction to many of the Bogle Heads.
[00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.520]   Dr. Malkiel received his undergraduate and master's
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.360]   degree from Harvard University and then
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.800]   went on to Princeton University to receive his PhD, where he
[00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.520]   started a long and illustrious career.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.280]   Back in 1973, he wrote a book called A Random Walk Down Wall
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.320]   Street, where he called for the first index mutual fund
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.160]   to be created, which led to the index fund revolution.
[00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.360]   With no further ado, a man who needs no introduction
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.000]   to the Bogle Heads, Dr. Burton Malkiel.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.480]   Welcome, doctor.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.200]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.980]   It's a pleasure to have you on Bogle Heads on Investing.
[00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.880]   This is a podcast that a lot of people
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.800]   were widely anticipating.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.960]   And before we get into the nuts and bolts of investing,
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.320]   because we have a lot of topics to talk about,
[00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.000]   a lot of them come from your latest edition of A Random
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.960]   Walk Down Wall Street.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   And then there's other things that we'll be talking about.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.360]   But this will be an investing show.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.280]   But before we get into that, if you
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.440]   could tell us some of your early background,
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.800]   where you grew up, where you went to school,
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.760]   and how you got involved in the investment industry.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.400]   Well, I grew up in the city of Boston,
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.080]   in a part of Boston, Roxbury, Massachusetts.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.280]   I grew up in a tenement house.
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:36.720]   For some reason, I was always interested in numbers.
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.320]   And even though I had no money, and my family had no money
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.760]   to invest in the stock market, I knew the price of General
[00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.040]   Motors stock just about as well as I knew Ted Williams'
[00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800]   betting average.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.680]   So this is something, for some reason, that interested me,
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.280]   followed me through my youth.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.640]   I went to college and majored in economics,
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:14.040]   and then went to business school,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.520]   much to the regret of some of my economics tutors, who said,
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:25.080]   you're really a very good economics student.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.160]   You ought to go into the Academy.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:34.920]   And since I had grown up poor, I decided that the Academy
[00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:35.760]   wasn't for me.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.240]   I didn't want to continue to be poor.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.440]   I wanted to go to Wall Street, which had interested me
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.320]   since I was a little kid.
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:52.400]   And so I got a job with Smith Barney, the investment bank
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.880]   that's now part of Morgan Stanley.
[00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:58.440]   But Dr. Malkiel, this wasn't just any business school.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.040]   You received your bachelor's degree and MBA
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.960]   from Harvard University.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.880]   Well, that is true.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.560]   That is true.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.760]   Before I actually joined Smith Barney,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.480]   there was a draft at the time.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.040]   And a few of my Harvard Business School classmates
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.080]   and I received direct commissions in the US Army
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:26.440]   Finance Corps, where we put into effect at various Army
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.960]   posts around the world a computerized pay and accounting
[00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.160]   system.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.600]   But then I did go to Wall Street.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:41.160]   I was an investment banker for two to three years.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:48.440]   Did finally start investing myself and made enough money
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:52.160]   so that I was convinced then that I would not
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.720]   continue to be poor.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.920]   And the thought of possibly maybe getting
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:06.160]   a PhD in economics, since my college advisors had strongly
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.240]   urged me to do, was maybe something I should do.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.800]   And I went to New York University night school
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.600]   to try to do some courses.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.800]   But I found that it was simply impossible.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.640]   Because as an investment banker, we
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.960]   would be doing some due diligence for a company
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.600]   in Iowa or Chicago or the West Coast.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.400]   And I was missing 3/4 of my classes.
[00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.680]   Realized that that didn't work.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:45.080]   And I then took a leave of absence.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:48.120]   And I was living in Princeton, New Jersey at the time,
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.520]   and went to graduate school at Princeton.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.200]   I fully expected to go back to Wall Street.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.200]   But two things happened that I had not expected.
[00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:02.200]   One was that the people at Princeton
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.600]   said, gee, we'd like to hire you to teach.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.400]   And the second thing was that there
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:16.840]   was a scandal at Prudential Financial, where the CEO had
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.320]   been lending Prudential's money to companies
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:23.480]   with which he was affiliated.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.760]   And when this broke, he was fired.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:34.040]   And the New Jersey legislature decided that from now on,
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:40.040]   Prudential would have to have six public directors chosen
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:44.160]   by the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   The Chief Justice wanted to have an economist there,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.120]   interviewed me.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.560]   And even though I was just a fledgling economist
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:54.880]   at the time, he liked what I had to say.
[00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.320]   And I became a director of Prudential Financial.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:07.360]   And that made me decide, well, let me see if I like teaching.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.440]   I've now got a foot in business.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:16.640]   Maybe I can do both of these things at the same time.
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:20.160]   And the board membership of Prudential
[00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.360]   led to a number of board memberships.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.000]   And I enjoyed teaching.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.880]   I was able to research the stock market, which
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.320]   had interested me since I was a little boy.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.680]   And I then developed a life that, in my view,
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.960]   had the best of both worlds.
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:45.880]   So I was still in the business and financial community.
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:49.800]   And at the same time, I was able to work
[00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:55.840]   on the projects that interested me in financial markets.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.640]   That's really the quick story of how I came to do the things
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.160]   that I've done.
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:07.080]   It's interesting when I look at your bibliography of what
[00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:12.880]   you've written that early on in the '60s,
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.560]   you had written a few papers on the bond market
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.480]   and the term structure of interest rates.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.640]   A couple of papers.
[00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:23.240]   One of them was-- the first one was published in the Quarterly
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:25.280]   Journal of Economics.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:29.440]   Then you went on to write a book, your very first book,
[00:08:29.440 --> 00:08:32.160]   on options and option strategies.
[00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.040]   So it wasn't just the stock market.
[00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:36.280]   I mean, you were really expanding out
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.320]   into all of the financial markets at this time.
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.840]   Exactly.
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:45.360]   And was definitely interested in financial markets.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.000]   The early work that I had done was all technical
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.280]   because you do not get tenure at a first-class university
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.080]   by writing things that were popular.
[00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:03.720]   I wrote A Random Walk Down Wall Street in the early '70s
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:10.440]   and wrote it right after I was given tenure at Princeton.
[00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:12.920]   So I was always interested in doing
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:18.680]   things that would be more popular than the professional
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.200]   journal stuff that I did at the beginning.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:29.360]   But I only did that after I had tenure at Princeton University.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.920]   So let's go ahead and move on to A Random Walk Down Wall Street.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.880]   And I have in my hand your original first edition
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.680]   because right now you're up to the 12th edition.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.480]   That is correct.
[00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:45.400]   The original book itself in the 12th edition is still there.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's still at the beginning of the book for the most part.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.160]   And you've just been adding to the book
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.120]   as we have been moving along.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.760]   So I've read both the original edition.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   I've read other editions over time.
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.560]   And now the 12th edition, which I also have.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.880]   But I want to quote something here in your first edition.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.680]   You were an inspiration to many people,
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.760]   but particularly to Jack Bogle with the idea
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.240]   that what was needed is a index fund that just gives you
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.240]   the market return.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.800]   And here's what you wrote.
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.280]   Again, this was written in 1973.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.040]   That's when the book was published, 1973.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:30.240]   So you were actually thinking about this and writing about it
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:33.440]   or putting your words on paper even before then.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:34.480]   But here's what you wrote.
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.600]   This is on page 226.
[00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:41.240]   "What we need is a no-load minimum management fee mutual
[00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.360]   fund that simply buys the hundreds of stocks,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.920]   making up the broad stock market averages,
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.640]   and does no trading from security
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:53.040]   to security in an attempt to catch the winners.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.920]   Whenever below average performance
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:57.920]   on the part of any mutual fund is noticed,
[00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.160]   fund spokesmen are quick to point out
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.240]   you can't buy the averages.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:04.800]   It's time the public could."
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.000]   And that was really an inspiration,
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.720]   I believe, to Jack Bogle.
[00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.040]   How did you meet Jack Bogle?
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:16.560]   And tell me what this first discussion was about.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.520]   Let me first of all say two things.
[00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:22.040]   I appreciate your quoting that.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.080]   And I am certainly very pleased to have
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:32.680]   been one of the earliest people to recommend indexing.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.160]   But I appreciate being given the credit.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.640]   But I do think it's one thing for an academic
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.920]   to say crazy things.
[00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:47.440]   And believe me, the first reviews
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.000]   of my book by professionals said that it was the biggest
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.320]   piece of garbage in the world.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.440]   So it's one thing for an academic to do this.
[00:11:57.440 --> 00:12:02.080]   Jack Bogle deserves all the credit in the world
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:06.680]   because he bet his whole company on it.
[00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:11.320]   And yeah, I was early in recommending it.
[00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.000]   But he was the doer.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.400]   And believe me, this was a very unpopular idea.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.560]   As you may know the story that Jack
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:32.640]   had hoped to raise $150 million at least
[00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:38.320]   and hoped for $250 million in the initial public offering
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:41.040]   of the first index fund.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   They, in fact, raised $11 million.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:47.640]   It was called Bogle's Folly.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.040]   You talk about early conversations with Jack.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.400]   Sometimes I used to kid him that he and I
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:13:01.200]   were the only holders of the first index fund.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.800]   But just in terms of the chronology,
[00:13:05.800 --> 00:13:15.960]   I was in Washington in 1975 and '76
[00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:20.800]   on the President's Council of Economic Advisors.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:25.280]   I left Washington in January of '77.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:31.840]   And then Jack had asked me to go on the Vanguard board.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.640]   And I was a Vanguard board member for 28 years.
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:40.960]   And obviously, in terms of initial conversations,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.600]   Jack and I were certainly kindred spirits
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:51.400]   because both of us firmly believed and were both convinced
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:58.240]   that this was the absolutely best way for individuals
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.080]   to invest.
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.560]   And you were both about the same age, too.
[00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:04.040]   That is correct.
[00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:09.360]   Jack was a bit older, but Jack and I were roughly the same age.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:13.840]   And Jack and I both had the connection
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.440]   to Princeton University, where he
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:27.200]   was an extremely loyal and an extremely generous alumnus.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:30.600]   The index concept, great idea.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:34.080]   But it took so long before it caught on.
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:37.520]   In the early years, as you said, they only
[00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:41.000]   raised $11 million in the initial offering.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:44.360]   Now, a lot of that had to do, if I recall the story correctly,
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:48.960]   it was actually sold through brokerage companies.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.600]   And it was sold with a commission.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.160]   And the commission was a little bit lower than the commission
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:57.760]   to sell active managed funds.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:15:02.440]   So it didn't get any attention from the brokerage industry
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.160]   in many ways.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:06.200]   That is certainly correct.
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:14.440]   But it was also an idea that the brokerage community really
[00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:15.720]   didn't believe.
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:21.920]   I mean, there was still a view that the reason the broker was
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.320]   important for the customer is the broker
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:31.480]   would be able to find the mutual fund or the individual stocks
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:33.600]   that were going to outperform.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:40.600]   And so the view that an index fund was the way to go
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:46.640]   was pooh-poohed with the idea that who wants to be mediocre?
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:49.080]   And that was what the index fund was.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:52.400]   Well, this is a mediocre investment.
[00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.720]   This is average.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:57.720]   The fact of the matter is that index investing
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.160]   proved to be quite above average when
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:04.880]   you think of all the other investment products that
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.200]   were out there.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.520]   I looked at the data.
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:14.120]   In the first few years that the S&P 500, the first index trust,
[00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:16.800]   as it was called, was out.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:18.960]   And the first year, it was attempted
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.600]   to be sold through the brokerage firms.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:25.520]   But then it went no load in 1977, about a year later.
[00:16:25.520 --> 00:16:27.960]   And so Vanguard was out on its own selling it.
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.160]   But there was a period of time when
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:33.080]   there was volatility in the market.
[00:16:33.080 --> 00:16:37.180]   Stocks weren't doing very well during the late 1970s.
[00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.280]   In fact, Businessweek ran an article
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:41.200]   called The Death of Equities.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.160]   I mean, so everything was against this fund.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:48.160]   I mean, it was incredible that it actually survived.
[00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:50.320]   However, in around the beginning of the 1980s,
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:53.320]   say 1982, '83, when the market started coming back,
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:55.640]   the fund finally started to pick up assets.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:59.560]   And I believe it hit a billion dollars in assets
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.960]   in the late 1980s.
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.320]   It took, I think, 12 years before the S&P 500
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:06.840]   fund hit a billion dollars.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.260]   But by that time, I think Vanguard
[00:17:08.260 --> 00:17:11.680]   was already looking at doing other index funds as well.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.800]   And this was sort of the genius of Jack Bogle.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.840]   He wanted to index everything.
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:16.760]   Absolutely.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.400]   And Jack was the one who said, we really
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:25.400]   ought to be suspicious of the bond managers who tell you
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:28.560]   that they can outperform.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   Maybe we ought to have a bond index fund as well.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.600]   And do we need just the S&P 500 and what
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.280]   used to be the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index?
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:50.160]   Maybe what we ought to have is a real estate index, REITs.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.360]   And maybe we ought to have international indices.
[00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.160]   We ought to have an index that tracks
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:01.280]   IFA, Europe, Australia, and Far East.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.200]   So you're absolutely right.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:08.160]   And this was, I think, the genius of Jack Bogle,
[00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:11.720]   that there's no reason why indexing
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:17.400]   ought to be confined to simply the US stock market.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:23.040]   Indexing should work and does work in all asset classes.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:26.560]   When I interviewed Jack looking at the chronology of when
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:31.200]   different index funds were launched at Vanguard,
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:39.760]   it was actually 1996 by the time the last sort of major market
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:43.960]   index fund was launched, which was also, ironically,
[00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.200]   the year that he had heart issues
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.360]   and ended up having his heart transplant
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.440]   and ended up then resigning as the chairman.
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.360]   But at that point, 1996, a person could go to Vanguard,
[00:18:57.360 --> 00:18:59.760]   and you had a whole suite of index funds.
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:02.520]   You had the US market total market index fund.
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.200]   You had an international index fund, emerging markets index
[00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:05.700]   funds.
[00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:06.920]   You had a REIT index fund.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.600]   You had a bond index fund.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.480]   It was all there.
[00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:15.560]   You could do a all index portfolio now at Vanguard
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:16.800]   by 1996.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.360]   So I think that was just an incredible accomplishment
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:20.280]   to get to that point.
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:24.560]   Absolutely, and remember also, because of Jack,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:30.240]   we introduced a tax-exempt money market fund,
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.240]   introduced bond funds with different maturities
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:38.880]   so that you had a short term, an intermediate term,
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:41.480]   and a long term.
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:43.720]   From the standpoint of Vanguard, there
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:48.160]   was a whole host of products that was really
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   all that an individual investor needed.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.880]   I want to pivot here for a second
[00:19:53.880 --> 00:19:56.520]   and start talking about exchange-traded funds,
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:59.560]   because Jack did not like the idea.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.000]   That was one of the few instances
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.760]   where Jack and I disagreed.
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:09.560]   There's very little that we disagreed on,
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:14.120]   because as I said earlier, we were really kindred spirits.
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.760]   But you're absolutely right.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:21.200]   From Jack's point of view, exchange-traded funds
[00:20:21.200 --> 00:20:23.280]   were the instrument of the devil.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:26.960]   Like giving gasoline and matches to an arsonist or something
[00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:27.720]   like that.
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:30.640]   Well, as I remember, I can't tell you
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.640]   how many times Jack and I would have this argument where Jack
[00:20:35.640 --> 00:20:38.760]   would say, who in their right mind
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:42.760]   would want to buy the market at 10.30 in the morning
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.360]   and sell it at 1 o'clock in the afternoon?
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:50.040]   Anybody who thinks that they can do that and make money
[00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:52.160]   is absolutely crazy.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:56.400]   People are just going to cut their throats on these things.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:20:59.720]   They're an instrument of speculation.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:04.720]   And we will never do exchange-traded funds,
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.120]   because I, as a board member, had actually
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:09.280]   urged Vanguard to do them.
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:13.120]   And my argument to Jack was, Jack,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:19.240]   you don't think that buying and trading exchange-traded funds
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:25.960]   is something that is likely to be productive for people.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:28.800]   And I agree with you entirely.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.880]   But you and I both know there are some people who
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.480]   will still want to do this.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:41.000]   And when people do this in the context of a mutual fund,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.400]   they can create transactions costs, accounting costs,
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:50.840]   and possibly even potential tax costs for those
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:55.120]   who stay in the mutual fund.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.440]   It's much better for those people
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.680]   who want to try to do this to do it
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:04.440]   through an exchange-traded fund, where there are even
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.520]   some tax advantages of the exchange-traded funds.
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:12.040]   And for the buy-and-hold investor,
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.640]   an exchange-traded fund is terrific.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.720]   And you can do it at an even lower cost.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:21.000]   So that was the argument that we had.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.640]   And Jack was never, to the day he died,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:29.520]   never convinced that exchange-traded funds were
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.560]   worth it.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:36.160]   And had Jack stayed as CEO of Vanguard
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:39.800]   through his long and productive career,
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.000]   Vanguard probably never would have had exchange-traded funds.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:47.480]   I have to tell you, during the late '80s and '90s,
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:52.120]   I was working as a broker, first at Kidder Peabody,
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:54.840]   and then at Smith Barney, your old firm.
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:58.520]   And I had very little access to indexes.
[00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:03.240]   I had my aha moment about indexing around 1996,
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:07.200]   when I read Jack's book, Bogelan Mutual Funds.
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:11.960]   And I had also heard him speak at a CFA Society annual event.
[00:23:11.960 --> 00:23:13.560]   It was actually the first speaking event
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:16.280]   that he had after he had his heart transplant.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.280]   But I mean, I wanted access to Vanguard mutual funds.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.320]   But I could not get access when I was working at Smith Barney.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:27.160]   Having ETFs would have given me access,
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   given my clients access to these ETFs, to Vanguard funds.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.280]   But they weren't available.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.520]   Because Vanguard wouldn't pay for distribution, which
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:38.720]   I think was absolutely right.
[00:23:38.720 --> 00:23:43.040]   The only way that someone in the brokerage community
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:48.120]   who believed in this could give the client access
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:53.720]   to these wonderful index funds was through the ETF.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:58.200]   With Vanguard's credit, especially with the patent
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:02.200]   that Gus Sauter, who was the former chief investment
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:07.360]   officer, created, Vanguard didn't just create ETFs.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.840]   I mean, they actually created a patent
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:12.080]   where when they did launch ETFs--
[00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:14.240]   and they were called Vipers at the time.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.560]   They're not called that anymore.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:16.720]   They're just Vanguard ETFs.
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:21.200]   But I think it was 2001 or 2002 when they launched ETFs.
[00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:26.560]   They did them as a share class of their opened-end funds,
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.560]   which was unique.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:29.440]   It was patented.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.440]   No one has done that since.
[00:24:31.440 --> 00:24:36.480]   And what that did was make the mutual fund itself
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.200]   more tax-efficient, because the ETF was now part of that.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.400]   Absolutely.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:47.280]   And to the extent that there were flows out of the ETF,
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   what you could do is lay off the low-basis stock, which
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:57.960]   had the effect exactly what you said of making the mutual fund
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:24:59.320]   more tax-efficient.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:05.680]   Now, there is still a considerable amount
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.480]   of unrealized capital appreciation
[00:25:09.480 --> 00:25:11.480]   in the mutual fund.
[00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:18.800]   And to the extent that one can lower that, if, God forbid,
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:23.400]   everybody started to liquidate their mutual funds,
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.880]   a poor mutual fund holder might get a 1099
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.480]   at the end of the year saying, we
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:34.480]   realized the following capital gains on your behalf,
[00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:38.320]   and you owe some tax to the US government.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:42.880]   To the extent that you have the ETF as a share class,
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:47.520]   you are making the mutual fund more potentially tax-efficient.
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:52.080]   Now, this unrealized appreciation problem
[00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:56.840]   has so far been only a theoretical problem,
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:04.240]   because the funds and the ETF have continued to attract money
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:08.960]   from investors, and you have not had the liquidations that
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:13.280]   would create potential tax events.
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:17.440]   But it is a theoretical possibility,
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:20.040]   and to the extent that you can get rid
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:24.520]   of the low basis stock through the ETF,
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:31.240]   you are making the mutual fund a more efficient vehicle.
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:38.720]   Well, the interesting occurrence at Vanguard now seems to be--
[00:26:38.720 --> 00:26:41.480]   and I know you're no longer on the board of directors--
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.760]   but there seems to be a big or bigger
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   push to get people to invest in ETFs, as opposed
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:57.920]   to directly in mutual funds.
[00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.200]   People write about this on the Bogleheads forum
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.000]   quite frequently.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.160]   I feel that this is occurring.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:07.800]   I don't consider it a bad thing because of the benefit,
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:11.440]   the tax benefit that occurs for everybody.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:14.880]   If there becomes a parity, if you will,
[00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.400]   between the amount of money in the open-end mutual fund
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:20.640]   side and the amount of money in the ETF side,
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:27.520]   if there's redemptions on the open-end mutual fund side,
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:31.200]   you would sell the stock that is at a high-cost basis,
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.840]   basically that's at a loss, so that the fund could
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.560]   take a capital loss inside the fund.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:40.560]   And if there are redemptions on the ETF side,
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:44.000]   then you push out of the fund the low-cost basis stock.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.320]   Exactly, yes.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.600]   It's this double-edged way of cutting taxes.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:52.160]   And I just think it's a fantastic idea
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:53.840]   they came up with this years ago.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:58.240]   And I really don't know why other open-end mutual fund
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.640]   companies have not licensed this idea from Vanguard
[00:28:01.640 --> 00:28:02.800]   and done it themselves.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.680]   But it doesn't seem like anybody wants to pay
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:08.240]   Vanguard for the process.
[00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:09.800]   I think you're probably right.
[00:28:09.800 --> 00:28:12.440]   But I agree with everything you said.
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:15.600]   That's been a wonderful way of doing it.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.160]   And it's another reason why Vanguard's
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.760]   going into the ETF business, finally,
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:28.000]   has been a major plus for the firm.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.480]   Well, let's go ahead and get into your book,
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.000]   A Random Walk Down Wall Street.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.640]   And the latest edition, there's a lot of new stuff
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:38.000]   that you put in.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.160]   And this has been added over the years, various editions.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:45.880]   So the book is getting thicker.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:48.400]   Well, there's more and more going into the book.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:50.120]   Remember, the book was originally
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.680]   written as an investment guide.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:59.040]   And when you realize, from 1973 on,
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:01.680]   the whole investing world has changed.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:05.040]   There were no index funds in '73.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:09.040]   What I had recommended in '73 was
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:12.120]   buying some closed-end funds at a discount, which--
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:16.200]   and the discounts were something like 40% at the time.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   Those discounts are largely gone now.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.240]   But there were no index funds.
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.200]   There were no money market funds.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.800]   There were no tax-exempt money market funds.
[00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:29.280]   And in terms of the length of the book,
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:34.280]   it's actually been, for the last several editions,
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.200]   the length has not increased.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.800]   Because if there was new material added,
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.440]   I've tried to compress other parts of the book.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:55.160]   So it really isn't thicker than it was 10, 20 years ago.
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:57.600]   There have been a lot of new things that I could tell--
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:29:58.440]   Absolutely.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:29:59.320]   --went in there.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.880]   And one of the things you've talked more about
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.400]   in more recent editions is the value premium
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:09.560]   and high-dividend-yielding stocks.
[00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:16.120]   And could you tell us your views on, call it, factor investing?
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:18.680]   Well, let me make two points about that.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:21.840]   First of all, one of the reasons that I've
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.760]   become far more interested in dividend-paying stocks
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:36.560]   is that I really think we've got a very tough situation facing
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.240]   individual investors, and particularly
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:47.520]   facing retired investors for whom the original advice was
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:49.360]   very simple.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:53.520]   You need income, and you have a big chunk
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:59.360]   of bonds in your portfolio, both because of their stability
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:04.080]   and because bonds had been producing interest
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:07.440]   rates of 5%, 6%.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:11.760]   So the retired people could, without having
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:15.600]   to go to their brokers to buy and sell things,
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:21.360]   could have that nice income coming in regularly.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:23.520]   That doesn't occur anymore.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:27.760]   We're basically in a world where more than half
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:30.000]   of the sovereign debt in the world
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   sells at negative interest rates.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.760]   Interest rates for the 10-year Treasury in the United States
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.400]   is just over half of 1%.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.160]   We live in an era that's been called
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.560]   an era of financial repression.
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:52.120]   So what do you do as a retired individual?
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.280]   What can you do to get some income?
[00:31:56.280 --> 00:32:02.320]   And I do think that one of the, on a relative basis,
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:08.280]   more attractive parts of the US stock market
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:17.360]   are blue-chip companies that pay well-protected dividends.
[00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:23.040]   That strikes me as being a reasonable substitute
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:28.560]   for what otherwise would have been a bond portfolio that
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:32.040]   otherwise might have-- where I might have recommended
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:36.920]   a total bond market index fund.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:42.080]   The old kind of bond portfolio being something
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.480]   that you needed both for stability and for income
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:54.480]   doesn't work the way that it did in periods past.
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.320]   Let me now get to your point about factor investing.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:06.120]   I have been somewhat suspicious about being a one-factor
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:07.480]   investor.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:12.880]   While there's been a long-term history of value
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.760]   being better than growth, we know
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:17.120]   that we go through many years, including
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.040]   many of the recent years, where value investing has
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:25.560]   been absolutely terrible.
[00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:30.920]   When people like Rob are not, say, indexing is OK,
[00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:35.480]   but you want to do fundamental indexing, which basically
[00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:40.080]   is a way of tilting the portfolio toward value
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:44.360]   stocks and small stocks, that I think
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:50.120]   of that as a very good way of charging 50 basis
[00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:56.360]   points or more for something that is not and has not,
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:01.680]   over the long pull, been better than regular index funds.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:05.160]   Now, having said that, to the extent
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:09.760]   that one wants to be a factor investor,
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.240]   I think a multi-factor model may give you
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:24.680]   index-type performance with possibly a bit less volatility
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:27.800]   than a regular index fund.
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:32.560]   And so to the extent that one wants
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.600]   to consider factor investing, I don't think
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.760]   you do it by buying a value fund.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:44.840]   I don't think you do it by just buying a small-cap fund.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:49.520]   I don't think you do it by buying a low-volatility fund,
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.280]   because we know that on the individual factors,
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:57.400]   there will be long periods of underperformance.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.800]   But what we know about the factors
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:05.120]   is that they tend to be uncorrelated.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:12.640]   When one factor does poorly, another factor may do well.
[00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:17.200]   And what you're looking for in investing
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:23.840]   is a portfolio where everything doesn't happen at once.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:28.120]   Everything doesn't go down at once.
[00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.600]   And so I have a little bit of sympathy
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.880]   for a multi-factor approach if it's low cost.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:42.840]   And I think something like a Goldman Sachs ETF, which
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:50.120]   is a multi-factor ETF that has had a reasonable return,
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:54.920]   I don't think you're going to do much better, if at all,
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.560]   than a regular index fund.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:01.040]   And for most people, I'd say keep it simple.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:06.160]   But it is possible that a multi-factor approach could
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:12.680]   give you index-type returns with a bit less volatility
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:18.480]   and therefore give you a slightly higher Sharpe ratio,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:24.480]   which is basically the return divided by the volatility.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   So that if the volatility is a bit lower,
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.160]   you get a little bit higher Sharpe ratio.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.480]   To backtrack a little bit to clear it up,
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.120]   the high dividend yield approach to investing
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.800]   that you do advocate, especially for retirees,
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:41.480]   isn't because you expect higher returns
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:44.880]   through the factor side of higher dividend yielding
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.240]   stocks.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.160]   That's really two different arguments.
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.760]   One is just to get the higher dividend income.
[00:36:51.760 --> 00:36:55.000]   That's why you would do high dividend yielding stocks.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.680]   And by the way, Vanguard has a couple of really good high
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.720]   dividend yield.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.040]   Absolutely, right.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:05.600]   Those are exactly the kinds of things in the category
[00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:06.800]   that I would recommend.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:12.640]   And it is largely a transactions cost argument.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:16.120]   I mean, I believe in the old Modigliani-Miller
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:20.200]   theorem that dividends really don't matter.
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:23.840]   You could always create artificial dividends
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.040]   by selling off a few shares.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.320]   But both from the standpoint of the transactions cost
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.800]   and the bother for people of having
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:40.640]   to think about periodically looking at their portfolio
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.720]   and selling off a few shares periodically to get income,
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:48.640]   it's an ease of actually accomplishing what you want
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.120]   and a minimizing transactions cost strategy.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:53.640]   Very good.
[00:37:53.640 --> 00:37:55.840]   Well, thank you for clearing that up.
[00:37:55.840 --> 00:37:58.560]   By the way, if people were interested in doing
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:01.720]   multi-factor investing, which would include value
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.400]   and small cap, momentum and quality, all these--
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:10.040]   the factor zoo, Vanguard also has multi-factor ETFs,
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:11.440]   which are very low cost.
[00:38:11.440 --> 00:38:15.000]   Vanguard has recently introduced one.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.320]   That's absolutely right.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:22.560]   One new area that you have written about more recently
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:24.760]   and one of the companies that you're
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:27.120]   on the board for, which is Wealthfront,
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:32.440]   has developed and launched is a risk parity strategy.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.160]   Could you comment on risk parity?
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:39.800]   And you believe in it, but how strongly do you believe in it?
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:44.840]   Well, one of the interesting things about markets
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:50.840]   is that very safe assets may very well
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:56.200]   yield more than they should.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:02.600]   And let me make an analogy to the racetrack.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:08.960]   And I've actually done articles on racetrack betting.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.280]   And there's an empirical regularity
[00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.840]   that we know about racetrack betting
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.920]   that I will describe to you.
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:23.680]   If you bet on every horse in the race,
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:26.400]   you will have a winning ticket.
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:29.960]   And you will lose about 20% of your money.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.040]   Why do you lose 20% of your money?
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:37.240]   Because that's the track take.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:41.000]   When the track figures out the parimutuel pool,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.400]   it deducts 20% for their operating expenses
[00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:50.200]   for the taxes that they have to pay to the government.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:54.160]   And they don't give that back to you.
[00:39:54.160 --> 00:39:55.960]   So you lose about 20%.
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:02.000]   Now, let's say instead you bet on every favorite.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:06.400]   Well, it turns out you lose about 5% or 6% of your money.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:10.720]   Let's assume instead you bet on the longest shot in the race.
[00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:17.440]   You lose about 40% of your money, 50% of your money.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:21.240]   In other words, there's a bias in the odds
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:27.640]   where long shots go off at far less favorable odds
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.040]   than favorites do.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:33.680]   So it may be the same thing in the stock market
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:38.200]   and in the bond market, where safe assets actually
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:44.760]   yield more than they should if this was simply
[00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:52.000]   on an expected value basis the same kind of rate of return
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:57.640]   expectation for all classes of assets.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:03.000]   Well, if that's true, and there's maybe some long run
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:09.280]   evidence that it's true, then maybe the best thing to do
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:15.880]   is to buy some safe asset and leverage them so that they have
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:19.760]   the same volatility as the risky asset,
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:25.680]   but that they will then give you a higher rate of return.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:28.440]   Oh, that's an interesting observation.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.800]   And I think that's the argument for it.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.800]   As I say in the book, there is some evidence
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.240]   that, at least in the bond market,
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:42.200]   this has been a winning strategy.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:48.480]   If a few years ago you bought 2.5% 10-year treasuries
[00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:54.120]   and leveraged them by borrowing at 1% or less,
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:59.600]   you actually then got a much higher rate of return.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.440]   And the rate of return would have
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:07.160]   been better than buying the 30-year treasury bond.
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:11.040]   Now, so far that's worked well.
[00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:14.120]   It made money for people like Ray Dalio.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:18.960]   And you can't deny that it's worked well.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:22.280]   At Wealthfront, our risk parity fund
[00:42:22.280 --> 00:42:28.200]   has actually done better than Dalio's because our expense
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:34.720]   ratios are much lower than Dalio's expense ratios.
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:36.120]   So it has worked.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.920]   Now, as I point out in the book, it
[00:42:39.920 --> 00:42:44.320]   might continue to work as long as the Federal Reserve keeps
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.560]   pumping money into the economy at the same rate
[00:42:47.560 --> 00:42:49.880]   that they've been doing it in the past.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:54.640]   But God forbid we come to the other side of the COVID-19
[00:42:54.640 --> 00:42:57.920]   crisis, the world economy goes back
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:02.240]   to some semblance of normality, and we
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.320]   have a little bit of inflation with all the money floating
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:11.280]   around the world, this is a strategy that might not work.
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:15.000]   Dr. Malkiel, do you believe that the Powell put,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.760]   as it's called, the Fed buying up corporate bonds,
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:22.840]   buying up treasury bonds, is distorting
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:28.320]   this relationship between quality and return?
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:33.880]   Yeah, I do think that, as we say in the drug industry,
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:38.440]   there are some uncomfortable side effects.
[00:43:38.440 --> 00:43:47.120]   I am very worried about the explosion of corporate debt.
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:51.200]   I'm very worried about things I worry about today,
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:56.720]   that Hertz can raise equity money in bankruptcy,
[00:43:56.720 --> 00:44:01.600]   that when you look at institutions like Robinhood
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:06.760]   and find that Hertz was the leading stock that people
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:12.800]   had in their trading account when it went from 1 to 5,
[00:44:12.800 --> 00:44:17.640]   I think those are very undesirable side effects.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:22.200]   And on the one hand, there's no question
[00:44:22.200 --> 00:44:26.400]   that COVID-19 produced an enormous crisis.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.600]   We had to do something extraordinary.
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:34.720]   So I don't fault the Fed with what it's done,
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:40.080]   but I count me as somewhat worried
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:47.280]   that there are side effects, and one should not ignore them.
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:50.040]   I'm going to do a quick lightning round on Boglehead,
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:53.320]   other Boglehead questions, just to wrap it up.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:57.080]   If you don't mind, it'll just take a few minutes.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:45:02.000]   A safe withdrawal rate has been touted at 4%.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Are we still at 4%?
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:04.960]   I don't think so.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:09.320]   I think, again, this is one of the unfortunate side
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:13.840]   effects of what has gone on with monetary policy
[00:45:13.840 --> 00:45:15.600]   around the world.
[00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:20.240]   The base rate, if you think of the sovereign rate
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:25.120]   from sovereigns like the United States and Germany,
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:28.760]   the EU, that have the least risk,
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:33.960]   are essentially zero, so that the whole base of returns
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:35.880]   starts at zero.
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:39.360]   And even if the risk premium on equities
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.280]   continued to be 5%, which it's been historically,
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.800]   according to the Ibbotson data, then equities
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:52.680]   would give you 5% or maybe 5 and 1/2%.
[00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:58.040]   So you will not preserve the real value of an endowment
[00:45:58.040 --> 00:46:00.720]   with a 4% withdrawal rate.
[00:46:00.720 --> 00:46:04.920]   The appropriate rate is clearly lower.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:09.240]   And I think that institutions that
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:14.480]   retain the 4%, 5%, 6% withdrawal rates
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:22.520]   are not living in what is, in my view, the appropriate world.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:25.080]   But my clients, they tend to use 3%.
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:26.400]   Would you agree that 3%--
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.480]   Yours is much better than 4%.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.240]   OK.
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:31.720]   Well, that leads us into another question by the Bogleheads.
[00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.040]   And that is, in your book, you talk
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.720]   about the allocation between stocks and bonds
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:40.160]   for different age groups.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.680]   And you say, for people who are in their 60s,
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:50.120]   they should have 60% to 80% stocks, 70s, 40% to 60% stocks,
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:52.840]   80s, 30% to 50% stocks.
[00:46:52.840 --> 00:46:57.580]   Has that changed in this new world that we're in?
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.120]   If you look back at the additions,
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:03.720]   I have increased the stock allocation
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:08.960]   and reduced the bond allocation.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:16.760]   And frankly, if I were writing the 13th edition right now,
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:20.400]   under today's circumstances, I would probably
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:24.840]   increase the stock allocation and reduce the bond allocation
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:28.080]   a little further.
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.160]   ESG, Environmental, Social, and Governance,
[00:47:31.160 --> 00:47:34.880]   seems to be more popular here in the United States.
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:37.080]   Well, what is your feeling on ESG?
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.280]   And if you could, could you address
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:43.480]   the expected returns of ESG versus the expected returns
[00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:45.740]   of, say, just the market?
[00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:48.880]   Well, let me take the second question first.
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:53.360]   While ESG investing has recently,
[00:47:53.360 --> 00:47:57.120]   like in the first quarter of 2020,
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:00.440]   ESG funds have done a little better than regular index
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:05.720]   funds, the reason being that they avoid all oil companies.
[00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:09.000]   And as you know, the oil companies
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.480]   have not been the place to be investing in the first quarter.
[00:48:13.480 --> 00:48:17.240]   However, over the longer run, there
[00:48:17.240 --> 00:48:21.720]   is no credible evidence that ESG investing will give you
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:24.200]   a higher rate of return.
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:26.720]   There have been some periods where it has,
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:30.360]   some periods where it's given you a lower rate of return,
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:34.360]   but there's no credible evidence that you'll
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:40.120]   be helping the world will give you a higher rate of return.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:42.080]   In fact, quite the opposite.
[00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:47.240]   If, for example, oil companies are permanently lower
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:51.840]   because many institutions avoid them,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:55.080]   then they will probably give you a higher rate of return
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:57.120]   over the long haul.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:49:01.800]   If a particular type of company is hated and therefore
[00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:06.880]   sells at a lower valuation than it deserves,
[00:49:06.880 --> 00:49:10.040]   it's going to give you a higher rate of return in the future.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.080]   Not a lower rate of return.
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.000]   So number one, don't think you can do this
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.680]   and you can both feel good and you're
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.280]   sure of getting a higher rate of return.
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:27.080]   Secondly, I'm very suspicious that you really
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:30.840]   ought to feel good about buying an ESG fund.
[00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:33.680]   There are various institutions that
[00:49:33.680 --> 00:49:36.920]   give companies ESG ratings.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:38.920]   They're wildly different.
[00:49:38.920 --> 00:49:42.440]   Some people will give you a high ESG rating.
[00:49:42.440 --> 00:49:45.240]   Some will give you a low ESG rating.
[00:49:45.240 --> 00:49:47.800]   You ought to really look at what you're owning.
[00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:52.120]   It's not at all clear that if you look at these things
[00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.760]   that you ought to feel good.
[00:49:53.760 --> 00:49:57.000]   For example, one of the companies
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:01.400]   that gets a very low ESG rating is
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:05.680]   Kinder Morgan, a natural gas pipeline company.
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.240]   Now, it gets a low rating because it's carbon.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:13.640]   On the other hand, to the extent that we use natural gas rather
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:17.120]   than coal, this will be great for the environment.
[00:50:17.120 --> 00:50:20.240]   We're never going to get rid of carbon completely.
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:24.360]   As an interim step, you're much better burning natural gas
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.280]   than burning oil.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:30.380]   It's much better transmitting this through pipelines
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.000]   rather than through trucks or through rails
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:40.120]   where there can be accidents and where the trucks are generally
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:45.840]   burning fuel to transmit oil or natural gas.
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.600]   So is Kinder Morgan really a very bad company,
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:53.480]   or is it one of the better companies?
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:57.200]   I think you can do that with a lot of those companies
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:00.200]   that get terrible ESG scores.
[00:51:00.200 --> 00:51:04.200]   Now, what about the companies that get great ESG scores?
[00:51:04.200 --> 00:51:07.960]   If you look at what you're holding in an ESG fund,
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:10.720]   one of the big holdings is Facebook.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:16.920]   Well, should you feel very good about holding Facebook or not?
[00:51:16.920 --> 00:51:21.440]   I don't know that I'm going to feel any better in my portfolio
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:27.600]   because I hold Facebook and Twitter than if I don't.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.720]   Now, it's true, there's very little carbon output
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:32.120]   from Facebook.
[00:51:32.120 --> 00:51:35.560]   But again, I'm very suspicious that you
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:40.640]   ought to feel better about holding these portfolios.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:45.360]   And I think if this continues to grow in popularity,
[00:51:45.360 --> 00:51:48.120]   it's much more likely that they will give you
[00:51:48.120 --> 00:51:51.120]   lower rates of return in the future
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.720]   rather than higher rates of return.
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:56.280]   And so neither should you feel good,
[00:51:56.280 --> 00:52:00.720]   nor should you expect to get an attractive rate of return
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:04.480]   by buying an ESG fund.
[00:52:04.480 --> 00:52:08.920]   Direct indexing is growing in popularity,
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:13.360]   which is very simply, instead of buying an index fund,
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:17.880]   people are buying or companies are buying individual stocks
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:21.480]   for you, say all the stocks in the S&P 500,
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.480]   and selling each individual stock that
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:29.040]   may be at a loss to generate larger capital losses
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:32.800]   than you could generate if you just had index funds
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:35.480]   and the market went down and you did tax-loss harvesting.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:38.440]   Now, I find that this works well with people
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:42.280]   who may have sold an asset and have a large capital gain,
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:46.640]   but it leaves you with 500 individual stocks
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.520]   and probably a lot of tax problems
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:50.320]   later on down the road.
[00:52:50.320 --> 00:52:53.200]   So even though I'm expressing my concerns about direct indexing,
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:56.440]   could you tell me, how do you feel about direct indexing?
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:53:00.920]   No, I'm actually more of a fan of direct indexing.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:03.040]   And we do this at Wealthfront.
[00:53:03.040 --> 00:53:06.000]   The surest way of getting an alpha
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:13.440]   is not by picking stocks, but by getting an after-tax alpha.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:15.880]   In my own Wealthfront account, it's
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:21.000]   been used to offset some capital gains from some
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:25.760]   of the real estate funds and real estate index funds
[00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.440]   that I own.
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:32.000]   And I think it's actually a very good thing.
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.320]   With respect to the longer run, are you, in fact,
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:42.560]   then just getting rid of all of your losses
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:45.680]   and your portfolio will then have
[00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:50.520]   larger and larger unrealized capital gains?
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:51.880]   I would say this.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:56.880]   Unless we change the tax law where, at depth,
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:01.680]   there is no writing up of your assets
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:06.480]   where you have to realize the capital gains,
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:14.000]   but in fact, what you do is just write the value, the basis up,
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:19.080]   then you avoid the long run problem of your portfolios
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:24.480]   will tend to have more unrealized capital gains.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.720]   Now, if they change the tax law, I'd
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:29.480]   agree with you that in the longer run,
[00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:32.080]   you're going to pay some price.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:39.400]   But do remember that avoiding capital gains for several years
[00:54:39.400 --> 00:54:44.200]   has an advantage, even if you later have to pay the tax,
[00:54:44.200 --> 00:54:49.840]   because a dollar today is worth more than $1.10 or 20 years
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.200]   from now.
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:55.480]   I would agree with you with no disrespect.
[00:54:55.480 --> 00:54:58.320]   At your age, direct indexing would make a lot of sense
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:01.320]   if you had capital gains.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:04.000]   However, I'm not sure if direct indexing makes sense
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:09.240]   for a 35-year-old who sold their app company for $10 million
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:12.800]   to do it because they sort of get saddled and stuck
[00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:17.520]   in these 500 stocks for 50, 60 years,
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:22.360]   and they have to pay fees on the portfolio to maintain it.
[00:55:22.360 --> 00:55:22.960]   And that is--
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:23.560]   Well, it's OK.
[00:55:23.560 --> 00:55:25.840]   We can agree on absolutely everything.
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:26.680]   OK.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:28.200]   Very good.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:29.400]   OK, one last question.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:33.560]   This has to do with your view on China.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:41.080]   You co-authored a book on China, which came out in 2008.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:45.560]   China has not performed well since that time,
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:49.160]   because the question was this huge 500% run-up
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:51.880]   in the couple of years prior to the book being published.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:54.920]   But how do you still feel about China?
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:57.840]   I think the problem, and what's actually
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.120]   been disappointing about President Xi,
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:06.080]   is China's growth has almost entirely
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:11.600]   been on the private sector, not the sector
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:15.120]   of government-owned enterprises.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:18.800]   The overall indices have done very poorly
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:24.480]   because the government-owned enterprises have been terrible.
[00:56:24.480 --> 00:56:30.360]   But the private enterprises, the Tencent, the Baidu's,
[00:56:30.360 --> 00:56:36.520]   the Alibaba's, those have done particularly well.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:39.320]   You know, you have to look at what's in an index.
[00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:46.160]   The problem is that the index, like the FXI, has not done well.
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:52.640]   And it's not done well because of the state-owned enterprises.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   The private companies, though, have done well.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:56:59.000]   And I am still optimistic about them.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.400]   And to just give you an idea of how you could get just
[00:57:03.400 --> 00:57:06.120]   the private stuff, there's an ETF
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:11.840]   called EMQQ, which has the Alibaba's and the Tencent's,
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.360]   and in fact, all of the internet companies in China
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.040]   that have done particularly well.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:27.200]   So I think the answer is, I am still optimistic about China,
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:31.360]   but not the whole economy, because I
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:36.200]   think that President Xi has been, unfortunately,
[00:57:36.200 --> 00:57:39.160]   emphasizing the state-owned enterprises.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:42.640]   And I think that's a big mistake.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:47.920]   And it's one of the reasons why China's overall growth will not
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.680]   be anything like it's been in the past.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.360]   Dr. Valkeel, it's been a real pleasure.
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:57.120]   We could go on for another two hours easily.
[00:57:57.120 --> 00:57:59.440]   Thank you so much for being on the Bogle Heads on Investing
