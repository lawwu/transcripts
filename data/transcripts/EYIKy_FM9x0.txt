[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040]   The following is a conversation with Michael I. Jordan,
[00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.360]   a professor at Berkeley
[00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.220]   and one of the most influential people
[00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.800]   in the history of machine learning,
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.560]   statistics and artificial intelligence.
[00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.640]   He has been cited over 170,000 times
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.720]   and has mentored many of the world-class researchers
[00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.400]   defining the field of AI today,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.800]   including Andrew Ng, Zubin Garamani,
[00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.600]   Ben Tasker and Yoshua Bengio.
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.480]   All of this to me is as impressive as the over 32,000 points
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.600]   in the six NBA championships
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.780]   of the Michael J. Jordan of basketball fame.
[00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.280]   There's a non-zero probability
[00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.320]   that I talked to the other Michael Jordan,
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.640]   given my connection to
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.120]   and love of the Chicago Bulls in the '90s,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.720]   but if I had to pick one,
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.640]   I'm going with the Michael Jordan
[00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.200]   of statistics and computer science,
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.800]   or as Jan LeCun calls him,
[00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.880]   the Miles Davis of machine learning.
[00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.160]   In his blog post titled,
[00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.320]   "Artificial Intelligence,
[00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.320]   "the revolution hasn't happened yet,"
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.760]   Michael argues for broadening the scope
[00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.040]   of the artificial intelligence field.
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.080]   In many ways, the underlying spirit of this podcast
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.200]   is the same, to see artificial intelligence
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.320]   as a deeply human endeavor,
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.240]   to not only engineer algorithms and robots,
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.240]   but to understand and empower human beings
[00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.640]   at all levels of abstraction,
[00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.760]   from the individual to our civilization as a whole.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.440]   This is the Artificial Intelligence Podcast.
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.840]   If you enjoy it, subscribe on YouTube,
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.720]   give it five stars at Apple Podcast,
[00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.080]   support it on Patreon,
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.200]   or simply connect with me on Twitter,
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.720]   @LexFriedman, spelled F-R-I-D-M-A-N.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.080]   As usual, I'll do one or two minutes of ads now,
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.520]   and never any ads in the middle
[00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.760]   that can break the flow of the conversation.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.240]   I hope that works for you
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.520]   and doesn't hurt the listening experience.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.040]   This show is presented by Cash App,
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.320]   the number one finance app in the App Store.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.960]   When you get it, use code LEXPODCAST.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.040]   Cash App lets you send money to friends,
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.480]   buy Bitcoin, and invest in the stock market
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.640]   with as little as $1.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.040]   Since Cash App does fractional share trading,
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.640]   let me mention that the order execution algorithm
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.240]   that works behind the scenes
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.280]   to create the abstraction of the fractional orders
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.960]   is, to me, an algorithmic marvel.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.320]   So big props for the Cash App engineers
[00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.080]   for solving a hard problem
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.760]   that, in the end, provides an easy interface
[00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.680]   that takes a step up to the next layer of abstraction
[00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.200]   over the stock market,
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.200]   making trading more accessible for new investors
[00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.360]   and diversification much easier.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.320]   So once again, if you get Cash App
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.080]   from the App Store or Google Play
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.800]   and use the code LEXPODCAST, you'll get $10,
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.600]   and Cash App will also donate $10 to Thirst,
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.240]   one of my favorite organizations
[00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.800]   that is helping to advance robotics and STEM education
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   for young people around the world.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:01.380]   And now, here's my conversation with Michael I. Jordan.
[00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.200]   Given that you're one of the greats in the field of AI,
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.800]   machine learning, computer science, and so on,
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.360]   you're trivially called the Michael Jordan
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.120]   of machine learning.
[00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.600]   Although, as you know, you were born first,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.040]   so technically MJ is the Michael I. Jordan of basketball,
[00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.160]   but anyway, my favorite is Yan LeCun
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.280]   calling you the Miles Davis of machine learning,
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.100]   because as he says, you reinvent yourself periodically
[00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.200]   and sometimes leave fans scratching their heads
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.400]   after you change direction.
[00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:37.120]   So can you put, at first, your historian hat on
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.520]   and give a history of computer science and AI
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.280]   as you saw it, as you experienced it,
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.160]   including the four generations of AI successes
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:48.520]   that I've seen you talk about?
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:49.480]   - Sure.
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.880]   Yeah, first of all, I much prefer Yan's metaphor.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.600]   Miles Davis was a real explorer in jazz
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.860]   and he had a coherent story.
[00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.240]   So I think I have one, but it's not just the one you lived,
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.800]   it's the one you think about later,
[00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.560]   what a good historian does is they look back
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.800]   and they revisit.
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.120]   I think what's happening right now is not AI.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.440]   That was an intellectual aspiration.
[00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.480]   That's still alive today as an aspiration.
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.440]   But I think this is akin to the development
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.380]   of chemical engineering from chemistry
[00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.780]   or electrical engineering from electromagnetism.
[00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.200]   So if you go back to the '30s or '40s,
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.920]   there wasn't yet chemical engineering.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.520]   There was chemistry, there was fluid flow,
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.180]   there was mechanics and so on.
[00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.360]   But people pretty clearly viewed interesting goals
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.220]   to try to build factories that make chemicals products
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.960]   and do it viably, safely, make good ones, do it at scale.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.880]   So people started to try to do that, of course,
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.000]   and some factories worked, some didn't,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.980]   some were not viable, some exploded.
[00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.840]   But in parallel, developed a whole field
[00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.880]   called chemical engineering.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.160]   Chemical engineering is a field.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.960]   It's no bones about it.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.520]   It has theoretical aspects to it.
[00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.640]   It has practical aspects.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.520]   It's not just engineering, quote unquote.
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.520]   It's the real thing, real concepts are needed.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.600]   Same thing with electrical engineering.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.960]   There was Maxwell's equations, which in some sense
[00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:16.380]   were everything you need to know about electromagnetism,
[00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:17.980]   but you needed to figure out how to build circuits,
[00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.680]   how to build modules, how to put them together,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.620]   how to bring electricity from one point to another
[00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.220]   safely and so on and so forth.
[00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.100]   So a whole field developed called electrical engineering.
[00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.940]   I think that's what's happening right now,
[00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.500]   is that we have a proto-field, which is statistics,
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.380]   compute more of the theoretical side of it,
[00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.180]   algorithmic side of it, computer science.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.860]   That was enough to start to build things,
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.780]   but what things?
[00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.260]   Systems that bring value to human beings
[00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.020]   and use human data and mix in human decisions.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:47.260]   The engineering side of that is all ad hoc.
[00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.420]   That's what's emerging.
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:50.420]   In fact, if you want to call machine learning a field,
[00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:51.340]   I think that's what it is.
[00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.260]   That's a proto-form of engineering based on statistical
[00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.500]   and computational ideas of previous generations.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.460]   - But do you think there's something deeper about AI
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.740]   in his dreams and aspirations as compared
[00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.780]   to chemical engineering and electrical engineering?
[00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.460]   - Well, the dreams and aspirations may be,
[00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.020]   but those are 500 years from now.
[00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:09.620]   I think that that's like the Greeks sitting there
[00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.820]   and saying it would be neat to get to the moon someday.
[00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:12.940]   - Right.
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:16.100]   - I think we have no clue how the brain does computation.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.940]   We're just a clueless.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.180]   We're even worse than the Greeks
[00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.620]   on most anything interesting scientifically of our era.
[00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.220]   - Can you linger on that just for a moment
[00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:28.500]   because you stand not completely unique,
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.260]   but a little bit unique in the clarity of that.
[00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:34.820]   Can you elaborate your intuition of why we,
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.660]   like where we stand in our understanding of the human brain?
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:39.660]   And a lot of people say, scientists say,
[00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:41.740]   we're not very far in understanding the human brain,
[00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.620]   but you're saying we're in the dark here.
[00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.220]   - Well, I know I'm not unique.
[00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.300]   I don't even think in the clarity,
[00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.940]   but if you talk to real neuroscientists
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.620]   that really study real synapses or real neurons,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.140]   they agree, they agree.
[00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.700]   It's a hundreds of year task
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.260]   and they're building it up slowly and surely.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:00.840]   What the signal is there is not clear.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.600]   We have all of our metaphors.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.460]   We think it's electrical, maybe it's chemical.
[00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:06.620]   It's a whole soup.
[00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.420]   It's ions and proteins and it's a cell.
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:11.060]   And that's even around like a single synapse.
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.780]   If you look at a electron micrograph of a single synapse,
[00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.820]   it's a city of its own.
[00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:18.420]   And that's one little thing on a dendritic tree,
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:19.980]   which is extremely complicated,
[00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:21.900]   you know, electrochemical thing.
[00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.060]   And it's doing these spikes and voltages
[00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.100]   are even flying around and then proteins are taking that
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:29.380]   and taking it down into the DNA and who knows what.
[00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.700]   So it is the problem of the next few centuries.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.240]   It is fantastic.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.900]   But we have our metaphors about it.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.100]   Is it an economic device?
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.420]   Is it like the immune system?
[00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:39.780]   Or is it like a layered, you know, set of,
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.980]   you know, arithmetic computations?
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:44.740]   We have all these metaphors and they're fun.
[00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:48.060]   But that's not real science per se.
[00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.980]   There is neuroscience.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:50.500]   That's not neuroscience.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.540]   All right, that's like the Greeks speculating
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.460]   about how to get to the moon.
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:55.180]   Fun, right?
[00:07:55.180 --> 00:07:57.900]   And I think that I like to say this fairly strongly
[00:07:57.900 --> 00:07:59.140]   'cause I think a lot of young people
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:00.780]   think that we're on the verge.
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:03.140]   Because a lot of people who don't talk about it clearly
[00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:04.860]   let it be understood that yes,
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.460]   we kind of, this is brain inspired.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:07.740]   We're kind of close.
[00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.100]   You know, breakthroughs are on the horizon.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.020]   And unscrupulous people sometimes
[00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:13.520]   who need money for their labs.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.460]   As I'm saying, unscrupulous.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.180]   But people will oversell.
[00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.140]   I need money for my lab.
[00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:22.580]   I'm studying computational neuroscience.
[00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:23.780]   I'm gonna oversell it.
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.140]   And so there's been too much of that.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:28.300]   - So let's step into the gray area
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:31.060]   between metaphor and engineering with,
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.660]   I'm not sure if you're familiar
[00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:35.360]   with brain computer interfaces.
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.900]   So a company like Elon Musk has Neuralink
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:42.620]   that's working on putting electrodes into the brain
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:43.940]   and trying to be able to read,
[00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:46.260]   both read and send electrical signals.
[00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:51.260]   Just as you said, even the basic mechanism of communication
[00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:55.100]   in the brain is not something we understand.
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.980]   But do you hope without understanding
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.780]   the fundamental principles of how the brain works,
[00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:04.200]   we'll be able to do something interesting
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.460]   at that gray area of metaphor?
[00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:07.300]   - It's not my area.
[00:09:07.300 --> 00:09:09.860]   So I hope in the sense like anybody else hopes
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:12.540]   for some interesting things to happen from research.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:14.760]   I would expect more something like Alzheimer's
[00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.100]   will get figured out from modern neuroscience.
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.900]   That, you know, there's a lot of human suffering
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:20.620]   based on brain disease.
[00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:23.220]   And we throw things like lithium at the brain,
[00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.060]   it kind of works.
[00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.700]   No one has a clue why.
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:28.020]   That's not quite true, but you know, mostly we don't know.
[00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.740]   And that's even just about the biochemistry of the brain
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.920]   and how it leads to mood swings and so on.
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.620]   How thought emerges from that.
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.060]   We just, we were really, really completely dim.
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:39.900]   So that you might wanna hook up electrodes
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.620]   and try to do some signal processing on that
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:43.100]   and try to find patterns.
[00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.500]   Fine, you know, by all means go for it.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:47.580]   It's just not scientific at this point.
[00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:50.500]   It's just, so it's like kind of sitting in a satellite
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.100]   and watching the emissions from a city
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.140]   and trying to infer things about the microeconomy,
[00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:57.420]   even though you don't have microeconomic concepts.
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:58.820]   I mean, it's really that kind of thing.
[00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.720]   And so yes, can you find some signals
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.380]   that do something interesting or useful?
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:06.400]   Can you control a cursor or mouse with your brain?
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:07.740]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:11.180]   You know, and I can imagine business models based on that.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:14.020]   And even, you know, medical applications of that.
[00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:16.300]   But from there to understanding algorithms
[00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.060]   that allow us to really tie in deeply
[00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:20.580]   to from the brain to the computer,
[00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:22.580]   you know, I just, no, I don't agree with Elon Musk.
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.740]   I don't think that's even, that's not for our generation.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:26.440]   It's not even for the century.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.780]   - So just in hopes of getting you to dream,
[00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:34.460]   you've mentioned Kolmogorov and Turing might pop up.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.380]   Do you think that there might be breakthroughs
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.340]   that will get you to sit back in five, 10 years
[00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:43.900]   and say, wow.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:45.220]   - Oh, I'm sure there will be,
[00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.220]   but I don't think that there'll be demos that impress me.
[00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.500]   I don't think that having a computer call a restaurant
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.340]   and pretend to be a human is a breakthrough.
[00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.660]   And people, you know, some people present it as such.
[00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:01.540]   It's imitating human intelligence.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.740]   It's even putting coughs in the thing
[00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.020]   to make a bit of a PR stunt.
[00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.060]   And so fine, the world runs on those things too.
[00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.780]   And I don't want to diminish all the hard work
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.340]   and engineering that goes behind things like that
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.660]   and the ultimate value to the human race.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.620]   But that's not scientific understanding.
[00:11:19.620 --> 00:11:22.020]   And I know the people that work on these things,
[00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:23.580]   they are after scientific understanding.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:25.300]   You know, in the meantime, they've got to kind of,
[00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.260]   you know, the train's got to run
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.580]   and they got mouths to feed and they got things to do.
[00:11:28.580 --> 00:11:30.500]   And there's nothing wrong with all that.
[00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.500]   I would call that though, just engineering.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.780]   And I want to distinguish that
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.820]   between an engineering field
[00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:35.980]   like electrical engineering,
[00:11:35.980 --> 00:11:38.940]   that originally emerged, that had real principles
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:39.900]   and you really know what you're doing
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.760]   and you have a little scientific understanding,
[00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:43.580]   maybe not even complete.
[00:11:43.580 --> 00:11:44.860]   So it became more predictable
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:46.940]   and it was really gave value to human life
[00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.620]   because it was understood.
[00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:52.460]   And so we don't want to muddle too much these waters
[00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.140]   of what we're able to do versus what we really can do
[00:11:56.140 --> 00:11:57.980]   in a way that's going to impress the next.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:11:59.420]   So I don't need to be wowed,
[00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:02.200]   but I think that someone comes along in 20 years,
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:06.620]   a younger person who's absorbed all the technology
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:07.840]   and for them to be wowed,
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.460]   I think they have to be more deeply impressed.
[00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.100]   A young Kolmogorov would not be wowed
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:12.820]   by some of the stunts that you see right now
[00:12:12.820 --> 00:12:13.860]   coming from the big companies.
[00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:15.980]   - The demos, but do you think the breakthroughs
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:18.180]   from Kolmogorov would be,
[00:12:18.180 --> 00:12:19.540]   and give this question a chance,
[00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:21.940]   do you think there'll be in the scientific
[00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.020]   fundamental principles arena
[00:12:24.020 --> 00:12:25.460]   or do you think it's possible
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:28.220]   to have fundamental breakthroughs in engineering?
[00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.020]   Meaning, I would say some of the things
[00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:34.620]   that Elon Musk is working with SpaceX and then others
[00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:37.220]   sort of trying to revolutionize the fundamentals
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.940]   of engineering, of manufacturing,
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:42.680]   of saying here's a problem we know how to do a demo of
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.580]   and actually taking it to scale.
[00:12:44.580 --> 00:12:46.980]   - Yeah, so there's gonna be all kinds of breakthroughs.
[00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.320]   I just don't like that terminology.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.700]   I'm a scientist and I work on things day in and day out
[00:12:50.700 --> 00:12:51.540]   and things move along
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.340]   and eventually say, wow, something happened,
[00:12:53.340 --> 00:12:55.900]   but I don't like that language very much.
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:59.360]   Also, I don't like to prize theoretical breakthroughs
[00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:01.060]   over practical ones.
[00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.620]   I tend to be more of a theoretician
[00:13:02.620 --> 00:13:05.640]   and I think there's lots to do in that arena right now.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.180]   And so I wouldn't point to the Kolmogorovs,
[00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:09.700]   I might point to the Edisons of the era
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:11.680]   and maybe Musk is a bit more like that.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.580]   But Musk, God bless him, also will say things about AI
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.020]   that he knows very little about
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:22.140]   and he leads people astray when he talks about things
[00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:23.540]   he doesn't know anything about.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:26.180]   Trying to program a computer to understand natural language,
[00:13:26.180 --> 00:13:28.740]   to be involved in a dialogue like we're having right now,
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.380]   ain't gonna happen in our lifetime.
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:32.500]   You could fake it, you can mimic,
[00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:35.980]   sort of take old sentences that humans use and retread them,
[00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:37.580]   but the deep understanding of language,
[00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:38.500]   no, it's not gonna happen.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.580]   And so from that, I hope you can perceive that deeper,
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:43.580]   yet deeper kind of aspects of intelligence
[00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:44.420]   are not gonna happen.
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:45.660]   Now, will there be breakthroughs?
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.060]   I think that Google was a breakthrough.
[00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.620]   I think Amazon's a breakthrough.
[00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:51.220]   I think Uber is a breakthrough.
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:54.660]   Bring value to human beings at scale in brand new ways
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:56.900]   based on data flows and so on.
[00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:58.660]   A lot of these things are slightly broken
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:14:01.780]   because there's not a kind of a engineering field
[00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:04.180]   that takes economic value in context of data
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:07.480]   and at planetary scale and worries about
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:09.460]   all the externalities, the privacy.
[00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.980]   You know, we don't have that field,
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.980]   so we don't think these things through very well.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.180]   But I see that as emerging and that will be,
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:17.380]   looking back from 100 years,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.220]   that will be a breakthrough in this era,
[00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.340]   just like electrical engineering was a breakthrough
[00:14:21.340 --> 00:14:22.860]   in the early part of the last century
[00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:24.500]   and chemical engineering was a breakthrough.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   - So the scale, the markets that you talk about
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.460]   and we'll get to, will be seen as sort of breakthrough.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:31.820]   And we're in the very early days
[00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.860]   of really doing interesting stuff there.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:34.820]   And we'll get to that,
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:37.300]   but it's just taking a quick step back.
[00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.140]   Can you give, we kind of threw off the historian hat.
[00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.420]   I mean, you briefly said that the history of AI
[00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:48.820]   kind of mimics the history of chemical engineering,
[00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:50.300]   but-- - I keep saying machine learning,
[00:14:50.300 --> 00:14:51.260]   you keep wanting to say AI,
[00:14:51.260 --> 00:14:54.300]   just to let you know, I don't, you know, I resist that.
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:55.340]   I don't think this is about,
[00:14:55.340 --> 00:15:00.340]   AI really was John McCarthy as almost a philosopher
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:01.740]   saying, "Wouldn't it be cool
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.380]   "if we could put thought in a computer?
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:06.180]   "If we could mimic the human capability to think
[00:15:06.180 --> 00:15:09.700]   "or put intelligence in in some sense into a computer?"
[00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:11.860]   That's an interesting philosophical question
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.540]   and he wanted to make it more than philosophy.
[00:15:13.540 --> 00:15:15.260]   He wanted to actually write down logical formula
[00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:17.220]   and algorithms that would do that.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.860]   And that is a perfectly valid, reasonable thing to do.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:21.860]   That's not what's happening in this era.
[00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:25.380]   - So the reason I keep saying AI actually,
[00:15:25.380 --> 00:15:27.380]   and I'd love to hear what you think about it,
[00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.420]   machine learning has a very particular set
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:33.140]   of methods and tools.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:36.220]   - Maybe your version of it is that mine doesn't.
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:37.700]   - No, it doesn't. - Mine is very, very open.
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.060]   It does optimization, it does sampling, it does--
[00:15:40.060 --> 00:15:42.460]   - So systems that learn is what machine learning is.
[00:15:42.460 --> 00:15:44.420]   - Systems that learn and make decisions.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.460]   - And make decisions.
[00:15:45.460 --> 00:15:48.620]   So it's not just pattern recognition and finding patterns.
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:50.820]   It's all about making decisions in real worlds
[00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:52.420]   and having close feedback loops.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.300]   - So something like symbolic AI, expert systems,
[00:15:55.300 --> 00:15:58.220]   reasoning systems, knowledge-based representation,
[00:15:58.220 --> 00:16:00.020]   all of those kinds of things, search,
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:03.620]   does that neighbor fit into what you think
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:04.620]   of as machine learning?
[00:16:04.620 --> 00:16:06.140]   - So I don't even like the word machine learning.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.940]   I think that with the field you're talking about
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.140]   is all about making large collections of decisions
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.900]   under uncertainty by large collections of entities.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.740]   - Yes. - Right?
[00:16:13.740 --> 00:16:15.980]   And there are principles for that at that scale.
[00:16:15.980 --> 00:16:18.100]   You don't have to say the principles are for a single entity
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:20.480]   that's making decisions, a single agent or a single human.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.900]   It really immediately goes to the network of decisions.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:24.060]   - Is a good word for that or no?
[00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:25.280]   - No, there's no good words for any of this.
[00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:27.140]   That's kind of part of the problem.
[00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.940]   So we can continue the conversation to use AI for all that.
[00:16:29.940 --> 00:16:32.860]   I just want to kind of raise a flag here
[00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.020]   that this is not about, we don't know what intelligence is
[00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:38.060]   and real intelligence.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:40.060]   We don't know much about abstraction and reasoning
[00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:40.940]   at the level of humans.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.780]   We don't have a clue.
[00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:44.300]   We're not trying to build that because we don't have a clue.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.180]   Eventually it may emerge.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.380]   I don't know if there'll be breakthroughs
[00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:50.020]   but eventually we'll start to get glimmers of that.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:51.860]   It's not what's happening there right now.
[00:16:51.860 --> 00:16:52.820]   We're taking data,
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:16:54.540]   we're trying to make good decisions based on that.
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:55.360]   We're trying to do a scale,
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.700]   we're trying to do it economically viably.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.160]   We're trying to build markets.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.780]   We're trying to keep value at that scale.
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.700]   And aspects of this will look intelligent.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.980]   They will look, computers were so dumb before.
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:08.100]   They will seem more intelligent.
[00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:09.800]   We will use that buzzword of intelligence.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.200]   So we can use it in that sense.
[00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:14.860]   But, so machine learning, you can scope it narrowly
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:17.820]   as just learning from data and pattern recognition.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.440]   But whatever, when I talk about these topics,
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:21.820]   maybe data science is another word
[00:17:21.820 --> 00:17:23.580]   you could throw in the mix.
[00:17:23.580 --> 00:17:25.820]   It really is important that the decisions are,
[00:17:25.820 --> 00:17:28.100]   as part of it, it's consequential decisions
[00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:29.020]   in the real world.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:30.780]   Am I gonna have a medical operation?
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:33.100]   Am I gonna drive down the street?
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:35.060]   Things that, where there's scarcity.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.940]   Things that impact other human beings
[00:17:36.940 --> 00:17:39.260]   or other, the environment and so on.
[00:17:39.260 --> 00:17:40.740]   How do I do that based on data?
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.640]   How do I do that adaptively?
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.760]   How do I use computers to help
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.880]   those kind of things go forward?
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.540]   Whatever you wanna call that.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:46.380]   So let's call it AI.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.420]   Let's agree to call it AI.
[00:17:47.420 --> 00:17:51.980]   But it's, let's not say that what the goal of that is
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:52.920]   is intelligence.
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:54.800]   The goal of that is really good working systems
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.540]   at planetary scale that we've never seen before.
[00:17:56.540 --> 00:17:59.260]   - So reclaim the word AI from the Dartmouth conference
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.340]   from many decades ago of the dream of human--
[00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.160]   - I don't wanna reclaim it.
[00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:03.000]   I want a new word.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:04.180]   I think it was a bad choice.
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:07.080]   I mean, if you read one of my little things,
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:10.360]   the history was basically that McCarthy needed a new name
[00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:12.160]   'cause cybernetics already existed.
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.840]   And he didn't like, you know,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.280]   no one really liked Norbert Wiener.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.320]   Norbert Wiener was kind of an island to himself.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.640]   And he felt that he had encompassed all this.
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:21.120]   And in some sense he did.
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.040]   You look at the language of cybernetics,
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.320]   it was everything we're talking about.
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:26.040]   It was control theory and signal processing
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:27.620]   and some notions of intelligence
[00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:29.720]   and closed feedback loops and data.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:30.800]   It was all there.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.360]   It's just not a word that lived on partly
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.120]   'cause of the maybe the personalities.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:35.720]   But McCarthy needed a new word to say,
[00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:36.780]   I'm different from you.
[00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.400]   I'm not part of your show.
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.640]   I got my own.
[00:18:39.640 --> 00:18:41.520]   Invented this word.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:43.320]   And again, as a kind of a,
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:45.440]   thinking forward about the movies
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.240]   that would be made about it,
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.600]   it was a great choice.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:50.840]   But thinking forward about creating a sober academic
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:52.760]   and real world discipline, it was a terrible choice
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:54.880]   because it led to promises that are not true,
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.240]   that we understand.
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.680]   We understand artificial perhaps,
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.280]   but we don't understand intelligence.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:00.400]   - As a small tangent,
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.320]   because you're one of the great personalities
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.160]   of machine learning, whatever the heck you call the field,
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:09.520]   do you think science progresses by personalities
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:11.880]   or by the fundamental principles and theories
[00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:15.040]   and research that's outside of personalities?
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:15.880]   - Yeah, both.
[00:19:15.880 --> 00:19:17.600]   And I wouldn't say there should be one kind of personality.
[00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.440]   I have mine and I have my preferences
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:23.520]   and I have a kind of network around me that feeds me
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:25.560]   and some of them agree with me and some of them disagree,
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:28.300]   but all kinds of personalities are needed.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.800]   Right now, I think the personality
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:31.000]   that it's a little too exuberant,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.760]   a little bit too ready to promise the moon
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:34.720]   is a little bit too much in ascendance.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.080]   And I do think that there's some good to that.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.600]   It certainly attracts lots of young people to our field,
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.480]   but a lot of those people come in with strong misconceptions
[00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:45.200]   and they have to then unlearn those
[00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:48.240]   and then find something to do.
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:51.480]   And so I think there's just gotta be some multiple voices
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.760]   and I wasn't hearing enough of the more sober voice.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:58.200]   - So as a continuation of a fun tangent
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:00.460]   and speaking of vibrant personalities,
[00:20:00.460 --> 00:20:05.080]   what would you say is the most interesting disagreement
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:06.400]   you have with Jan LeCun?
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:09.880]   - So Jan's an old friend and I just say
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.360]   that I don't think we disagree about very much really.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.320]   He and I both kind of have a let's build it kind of mentality
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:21.280]   and does it work kind of mentality and kind of concrete.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.720]   We both speak French and we speak French more together
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:25.640]   and we have a lot in common.
[00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:30.320]   And so if one wanted to highlight a disagreement,
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.840]   it's not really a fundamental one.
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:34.900]   I think it's just kind of where we're emphasizing.
[00:20:34.900 --> 00:20:38.360]   Jan has emphasized pattern recognition
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:40.920]   and has emphasized prediction.
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:45.320]   And it's interesting to try to take that as far as you can.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.600]   If you could do perfect prediction,
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:49.300]   what would that give you kind of as a thought experiment?
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:54.920]   And I think that's way too limited.
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:20:56.600]   We cannot do perfect prediction.
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:57.840]   We will never have the data sets
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:59.560]   that allow me to figure out what you're about ready to do,
[00:20:59.560 --> 00:21:00.760]   what question you're gonna ask next.
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:01.600]   I have no clue.
[00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:02.900]   I will never know such things.
[00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:06.140]   Moreover, most of us find ourselves during the day
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:09.220]   in all kinds of situations we had no anticipation of
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:13.240]   that are kind of various, novel in various ways.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.200]   And in that moment, we want to think through what we want.
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:18.940]   And also there's gonna be market forces acting on us.
[00:21:18.940 --> 00:21:20.920]   I'd like to go down that street, but now it's full
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.320]   because there's a crane in the street.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:23.780]   I gotta think about that.
[00:21:23.780 --> 00:21:26.120]   I gotta think about what I might really want here.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:28.000]   And I gotta sort of think about how much it costs me
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.120]   to do this action versus this action.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:32.860]   I gotta think about the risks involved.
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:34.580]   A lot of our current pattern recognition
[00:21:34.580 --> 00:21:36.940]   and prediction systems don't do any risk evaluations.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.980]   They have no error bars.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:41.060]   I gotta think about other people's decisions around me.
[00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:43.500]   I gotta think about a collection of my decisions.
[00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.740]   Even just thinking about like a medical treatment.
[00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:48.740]   I'm not gonna take the prediction of a neural net
[00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:51.020]   about my health, about something consequential.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:52.180]   I might about ready to have a heart attack
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:54.380]   because some number is over 0.7.
[00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:55.820]   Even if you had all the data in the world
[00:21:55.820 --> 00:21:58.820]   that's ever been collected about heart attacks,
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.920]   better than any doctor ever had,
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:02.620]   I'm not gonna trust the output of that neural net
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:03.900]   to predict my heart attack.
[00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.460]   I'm gonna wanna ask what if questions around that.
[00:22:06.460 --> 00:22:08.420]   I'm gonna wanna look at some other possible data
[00:22:08.420 --> 00:22:10.420]   I didn't have, causal things.
[00:22:10.420 --> 00:22:12.340]   I'm gonna wanna have a dialogue with a doctor
[00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:13.780]   about things we didn't think about
[00:22:13.780 --> 00:22:14.980]   when we gathered the data.
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:16.700]   I could go on and on.
[00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:17.580]   I hope you can see.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.260]   And I think that if you say prediction is everything,
[00:22:20.260 --> 00:22:23.160]   that you're missing all of this stuff.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.340]   And so prediction plus decision-making is everything,
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:28.100]   but both of them are equally important.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.020]   And so the field has emphasized prediction.
[00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:33.460]   Aeon, rightly so, has seen how powerful that is.
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:35.700]   But at the cost of people not being aware
[00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:37.300]   that decision-making is where the rubber really
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:39.460]   hits the road, where human lives are at stake,
[00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.120]   where risks are being taken,
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.300]   where you gotta gather more data,
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:43.580]   you gotta think about the error bars,
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:45.020]   you gotta think about the consequences
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:45.900]   of your decisions on others,
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.460]   you gotta think about the economy around your decisions,
[00:22:47.460 --> 00:22:48.980]   blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:50.320]   I'm not the only one working on those,
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.980]   but we're a smaller tribe.
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:53.740]   And right now we're not the one
[00:22:53.740 --> 00:22:56.020]   that people talk about the most.
[00:22:56.020 --> 00:22:58.700]   But if you go out in the real world, in industry,
[00:22:58.700 --> 00:23:01.300]   at Amazon, I'd say half the people there
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.140]   are working on decision-making
[00:23:02.140 --> 00:23:04.780]   and the other half are doing the pattern recognition.
[00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:05.620]   It's important.
[00:23:05.620 --> 00:23:07.660]   - And the words of pattern recognition and prediction,
[00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:11.020]   I think the distinction there, not to linger on words,
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.780]   but the distinction there is more a constraint
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.340]   sort of in the lab data set versus decision-making
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.320]   is talking about consequential decisions in the real world
[00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:23.380]   under the messiness and the uncertainty of the real world.
[00:23:23.380 --> 00:23:25.300]   And just the whole of it,
[00:23:25.300 --> 00:23:27.140]   the whole mess of it that actually touches human beings
[00:23:27.140 --> 00:23:29.180]   and scale, like you said, market forces,
[00:23:29.180 --> 00:23:30.700]   that's the distinction.
[00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:33.580]   - It helps add that perspective, that broader perspective.
[00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:35.620]   You're right, I totally agree.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:37.380]   On the other hand, if you're a real prediction person,
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:38.540]   of course you want it to be in the real world,
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:39.700]   you wanna predict real world events.
[00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:43.100]   I'm just saying that's not possible with just data sets,
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:44.780]   that it has to be in the context of
[00:23:44.780 --> 00:23:47.340]   strategic things that someone's doing,
[00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:48.260]   data they might gather,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.100]   things they could have gathered,
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:50.540]   the reasoning process around data.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:51.860]   It's not just taking data
[00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.480]   and making predictions based on the data.
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:56.760]   - So one of the things that you're working on,
[00:23:56.760 --> 00:23:58.060]   I'm sure there's others working on it,
[00:23:58.060 --> 00:24:02.060]   but I don't hear often it talked about,
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.700]   especially in the clarity that you talk about it,
[00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:06.420]   and I think it's both the most exciting
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.500]   and the most concerning area of AI
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.460]   in terms of decision-making.
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:12.820]   So you've talked about AI systems
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.500]   that help make decisions that scale in a distributed way,
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:17.800]   millions, billions decisions,
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:19.600]   and sort of markets of decisions.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:21.380]   Can you, as a starting point,
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.140]   sort of give an example of a system
[00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.660]   that you think about when you're thinking
[00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:27.620]   about these kinds of systems?
[00:24:27.620 --> 00:24:28.500]   - Yeah, so first of all,
[00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:30.160]   you're absolutely getting into some territory
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:32.240]   which I will be beyond my expertise,
[00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:33.580]   and there are lots of things
[00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:35.580]   that are gonna be very not obvious to think about.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:38.860]   Just like, again, I like to think about history a little bit
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:40.740]   but think about, put yourself back in the '60s,
[00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:41.940]   there was kind of a banking system
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.340]   that wasn't computerized really.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.920]   There was database theory emerging.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:47.500]   And database people had to think about
[00:24:47.500 --> 00:24:49.100]   how do I actually not just move data around
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:52.640]   but actual money and have it be valid
[00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:54.560]   and have transactions at ATMs happen
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:57.760]   that are actually all valid and so on and so forth.
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.140]   So that's the kind of issues you get into
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.980]   when you start to get serious about things like this.
[00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.020]   I like to think about,
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.580]   as kind of almost a thought experiment,
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:07.740]   to help me think something simpler,
[00:25:07.740 --> 00:25:10.300]   which is the music market.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:13.340]   'Cause there is, to first order,
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:16.300]   there is no music market in the world right now,
[00:25:16.300 --> 00:25:18.620]   in our country, for sure.
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:20.060]   There are something called,
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.700]   things called record companies,
[00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:23.140]   and they make money,
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:26.600]   and they prop up a few really good musicians
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:27.920]   and make them superstars,
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.820]   and they all make huge amounts of money.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.760]   But there's a long tail of huge numbers of people
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:34.320]   that make lots and lots of really good music
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.940]   that is actually listened to by more people
[00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.100]   than the famous people.
[00:25:37.100 --> 00:25:42.680]   They are not in a market, they cannot have a career.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.800]   They do not make money.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.360]   - The creators, the creators, right.
[00:25:45.360 --> 00:25:47.640]   - The creators, the so-called influencers or whatever,
[00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.280]   that diminishes who they are, right?
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:52.140]   So there are people who make extremely good music,
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:55.220]   especially in the hip hop or Latin world these days.
[00:25:55.220 --> 00:25:56.220]   They do it on their laptop,
[00:25:56.220 --> 00:25:58.700]   that's what they do on the weekend,
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:00.940]   and they have another job during the week,
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.420]   and they put it up on SoundCloud or other sites.
[00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:04.780]   Eventually, it gets streamed,
[00:26:04.780 --> 00:26:06.020]   it down gets turned into bits.
[00:26:06.020 --> 00:26:07.460]   It's not economically valuable,
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.900]   the information is lost.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.260]   It gets put up there, people stream it.
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:13.700]   You walk around in a big city,
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:15.140]   you see people with headphones,
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:17.140]   especially young kids listening to music all the time.
[00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:18.140]   If you look at the data,
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:20.400]   very little of the music they're listening to
[00:26:20.400 --> 00:26:21.840]   is the famous people's music,
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.760]   and none of it's old music, it's all the latest stuff.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:26.060]   But the people who made that latest stuff
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.360]   are like some 16-year-old somewhere
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.740]   who will never make a career out of this,
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:30.000]   who will never make money.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:31.440]   Of course, there'll be a few counter examples.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:33.560]   The record companies incentivize to pick out a few
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:35.160]   and highlight them.
[00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:37.600]   Long story short, there's a missing market there.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:40.200]   There is not a consumer-producer relationship
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:42.300]   at the level of the actual creative acts.
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:45.680]   The pipelines and Spotify's of the world
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:47.960]   that take this stuff and stream it along,
[00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:50.620]   they make money off of subscriptions or advertising
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:52.340]   and those things, they're making the money.
[00:26:52.340 --> 00:26:54.220]   And then they will offer bits and pieces of it
[00:26:54.220 --> 00:26:56.220]   to a few people, again, to highlight that,
[00:26:56.220 --> 00:26:58.620]   simulate a market.
[00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:00.620]   Anyway, a real market would be,
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.180]   if you're a creator of music,
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:04.240]   that you actually are somebody who's good enough
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.180]   that people wanna listen to you,
[00:27:06.180 --> 00:27:07.780]   you should have the data available to you.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.460]   There should be a dashboard
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.340]   showing a map of the United States,
[00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:12.220]   showing last week,
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.580]   here's all the places your songs were listened to.
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.060]   It should be transparent,
[00:27:17.100 --> 00:27:19.580]   vettable so that if someone down in Providence
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:21.900]   sees that you're being listened to 10,000 times
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.060]   in Providence, that they know that's real data,
[00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.260]   you know it's real data,
[00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:27.220]   they will have you come give a show down there.
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:28.460]   They will broadcast to the people
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.300]   who've been listening to you that you're coming.
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:31.140]   If you do this right,
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.380]   you could go down there and make $20,000.
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:37.000]   You do that three times a year, you start to have a career.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.460]   So in this sense, AI creates jobs.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:40.660]   It's not about taking away human jobs,
[00:27:40.660 --> 00:27:43.340]   it's creating new jobs because it creates a new market.
[00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:44.300]   Once you've created a market,
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.740]   you've now connected up producers and consumers.
[00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:48.180]   The person who's making the music
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.820]   can say to someone who comes to their shows a lot,
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:53.060]   "Hey, I'll play at your daughter's wedding for $10,000."
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:55.100]   You'll say 8,000, they'll say 9,000.
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.940]   Then again, you can now get an income up to $100,000.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.100]   You're not gonna be a millionaire.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:01.940]   All right?
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.020]   And now even think about really the value of music
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:06.660]   is in these personal connections,
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.380]   even so much so that a young kid wants to wear a T-shirt
[00:28:11.380 --> 00:28:14.740]   with their favorite musician's signature on it, right?
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:16.820]   So if they listen to the music on the internet,
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:18.140]   the internet should be able to provide them
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:19.420]   with a button that they push
[00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.740]   and the merchandise arrives the next day.
[00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:22.900]   We can do that, right?
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:24.300]   And now why should we do that?
[00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:26.340]   Well, because the kid who bought the shirt will be happy,
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:29.500]   but more the person who made the music will get the money.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:32.260]   There's no advertising needed, right?
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.160]   So you can create markets between producers and consumers,
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:39.060]   take 5% cut, your company will be perfectly sound,
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:40.540]   it'll go forward into the future
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:41.820]   and it will create new markets
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:43.620]   and that raises human happiness.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:46.700]   Now, this seems like it was easy,
[00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:47.780]   just create this dashboard,
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:49.140]   kind of create some connections and all that.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.860]   But if you think about Uber or whatever,
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.980]   you think about the challenges in the real world
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:53.900]   of doing things like this.
[00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:56.100]   And there are actually new principles gonna be needed.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:57.980]   You're trying to create a new kind of two-way market
[00:28:57.980 --> 00:28:59.880]   at a different scale that's ever been done before.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:04.660]   There's gonna be unwanted aspects of the market,
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.780]   there'll be bad people,
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.500]   the data will get used in the wrong ways,
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.460]   it'll fail in some ways, it won't deliver value.
[00:29:11.460 --> 00:29:12.520]   You have to think that through,
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.460]   just like anyone who ran a big auction
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:17.180]   or ran a big matching service in economics,
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.780]   will think these things through.
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:21.300]   And so that maybe doesn't get at all the huge issues
[00:29:21.300 --> 00:29:22.620]   that can arise when you start to create markets,
[00:29:22.620 --> 00:29:25.740]   but it starts, at least for me, solidify my thoughts
[00:29:25.740 --> 00:29:28.540]   and allow me to move forward in my own thinking.
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.140]   - Yeah, so I talked to, had a research at Spotify,
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:33.420]   actually, I think their long-term goal, they've said,
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:36.660]   is to have at least one million creators
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:41.020]   make a comfortable living putting on Spotify.
[00:29:41.020 --> 00:29:46.020]   So, and I think you articulate a really nice vision
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:51.200]   of the world and the digital,
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.400]   in the cyberspace of markets.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:57.500]   What do you think companies like Spotify or YouTube
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:02.500]   or Netflix can do to create such markets?
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.360]   Is it an AI problem?
[00:30:05.360 --> 00:30:06.840]   Is it an interface problem?
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.440]   So interface design?
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:13.080]   Is it some other kind of, is it an economics problem?
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.600]   Who should they hire to solve these problems?
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:17.400]   - Well, part of it's not just top-down.
[00:30:17.400 --> 00:30:18.940]   So the Silicon Valley has this attitude
[00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:19.960]   that they know how to do it.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:21.200]   They will create the system,
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.720]   just like Google did with the search box,
[00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.920]   that will be so good that they'll just,
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:26.000]   everyone will adopt that, right?
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.680]   It's not, it's everything you said,
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:31.200]   but really, I think missing that kind of culture.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:32.920]   All right, so it's literally that 16-year-old
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.720]   who's able to create the songs.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.940]   You don't create that as a Silicon Valley entity.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.260]   You don't hire them per se, right?
[00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.680]   You have to create an ecosystem in which they are wanted
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:44.340]   and that they're belong, right?
[00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.220]   And so you have to have some cultural credibility
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:47.500]   to do things like this.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.340]   You know, Netflix, to their credit,
[00:30:49.340 --> 00:30:50.980]   wanted some of that sort of credibility.
[00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:53.020]   They created shows, you know, content.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:53.900]   They call it content.
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.700]   It's such a terrible word, but it's culture, right?
[00:30:56.700 --> 00:30:59.020]   And so with movies, you can kind of go give
[00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:00.860]   a large sum of money to somebody
[00:31:00.860 --> 00:31:03.340]   graduating from the USC film school.
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:04.400]   It's a whole thing of its own,
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.200]   but it's kind of like rich white people's thing to do.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.780]   You know, and American culture has not been so much
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:11.700]   about rich white people.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:13.100]   It's been about all the immigrants,
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:16.820]   all the Africans who came and brought that culture
[00:31:16.820 --> 00:31:20.900]   and those rhythms to this world
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:22.660]   and created this whole new thing, you know,
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:23.660]   American culture.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.780]   And so companies can't artificially create that.
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:28.340]   They can't just say, "Hey, we're here.
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:29.780]   We're gonna buy it up."
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:31.140]   You got a partner.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.640]   And so, but anyway, you know,
[00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.260]   not to denigrate, these companies are all trying
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.660]   and they should, and I'm sure they're asking these questions
[00:31:38.660 --> 00:31:40.100]   and some of them are even making an effort,
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.820]   but it is partly a respect the culture
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:44.380]   as you are as a technology person.
[00:31:44.380 --> 00:31:49.380]   You got to blend your technology with cultural meaning.
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:52.220]   - How much of a role do you think the algorithm,
[00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:55.180]   so machine learning has in connecting the consumer
[00:31:55.180 --> 00:31:58.660]   to the creator, sort of the recommender system
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:31:59.500]   aspect of this?
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:00.780]   - Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.780]   I think pretty high.
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.820]   There's no magic in the algorithms,
[00:32:04.820 --> 00:32:07.260]   but a good recommender system is way better
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:08.860]   than a bad recommender system.
[00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:11.700]   And recommender systems was a billion dollar industry
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:13.800]   back even 10, 20 years ago.
[00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:17.380]   And it continues to be extremely important going forward.
[00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:18.760]   - What's your favorite recommender system,
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:19.740]   just so we can put something?
[00:32:19.740 --> 00:32:21.380]   - Well, just historically, I was one of the,
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:22.860]   you know, when I first went to Amazon,
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:24.460]   I first didn't like Amazon
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:26.300]   'cause they put the book people are out of business,
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:27.140]   the library, you know,
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.240]   the local booksellers went out of business.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.300]   I've come to accept that there, you know,
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:34.180]   there probably are more books being sold now
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:36.580]   and poor people reading them than ever before.
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:39.340]   And then local books stores are coming back.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:41.480]   So, you know, that's how economics sometimes work.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.780]   You go up and you go down.
[00:32:42.780 --> 00:32:46.300]   But anyway, when I finally started going there
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.460]   and I bought a few books,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:49.900]   I was really pleased to see another few books
[00:32:49.900 --> 00:32:52.100]   being recommended to me that I never would have thought of.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.300]   And I bought a bunch of them.
[00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:55.220]   So they obviously had a good business model,
[00:32:55.220 --> 00:32:56.120]   but I learned things.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.440]   And I still to this day kind of browse using that service.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.780]   And I think lots of people get a lot, you know,
[00:33:03.780 --> 00:33:05.780]   that is a good aspect of a recommendation system.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.960]   I'm learning from my peers in an indirect way.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.860]   And their algorithms are not meant to have them impose
[00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:13.860]   what we learn.
[00:33:13.860 --> 00:33:16.600]   It really is trying to find out what's in the data.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.620]   It doesn't work so well for other kinds of entities,
[00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:20.880]   but that's just the complexity of human life like shirts.
[00:33:20.880 --> 00:33:23.780]   You know, I'm not gonna get recommendations on shirts.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.180]   But that's interesting.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:29.900]   If you try to recommend restaurants,
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:33.420]   it's hard, it's hard to do it at scale.
[00:33:33.420 --> 00:33:37.440]   But a blend of recommendation systems
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:42.140]   with other economic ideas, matchings and so on
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:45.200]   is really, really still very open research wise.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:46.380]   And there's new companies that are gonna emerge
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.360]   that do that well.
[00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:52.180]   - What do you think is going to the messy, difficult land
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:54.420]   of say politics and things like that,
[00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:56.220]   that YouTube and Twitter have to deal with
[00:33:56.220 --> 00:33:58.340]   in terms of recommendation systems,
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:01.020]   being able to suggest, I think Facebook
[00:34:01.020 --> 00:34:02.980]   just launched Facebook News.
[00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.580]   So they're having, recommend the kind of news
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.340]   that are most likely for you to be interesting.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:12.340]   You think this is a AI solvable,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:13.580]   again, whatever term you wanna use.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.860]   Do you think it's a solvable problem for machines
[00:34:15.860 --> 00:34:18.660]   or is this a deeply human problem that's unsolvable?
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:20.260]   - So I don't even think about it that level.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.440]   I think that what's broken with some of these companies,
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:25.300]   it's all monetization by advertising.
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.020]   They're not, at least Facebook, I wanna critique them,
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.340]   that they didn't really try to connect a producer
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:32.660]   and a consumer in an economic way.
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:34.620]   No one wants to pay for anything.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:37.260]   And so they all, starting with Google, then Facebook,
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:40.280]   they went back to the playbook of the television companies
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:41.380]   back in the day.
[00:34:41.380 --> 00:34:43.180]   No one wanted to pay for this signal.
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:45.700]   They will pay for the TV box, but not for the signal,
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:47.100]   at least back in the day.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.860]   And so advertising kind of filled that gap
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:50.380]   and advertising was new and interesting
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:52.740]   and it somehow didn't take over our lives quite.
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:56.260]   Fast forward, Google provides a service
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:58.300]   that people don't wanna pay for.
[00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:02.380]   And so somewhat surprisingly in the '90s,
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:04.260]   they made, ended up making huge amounts.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:05.620]   They cornered the advertising market.
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:08.340]   It didn't seem like that was gonna happen, at least to me.
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:10.060]   These little things on the right-hand side of the screen
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:12.220]   just did not seem all that economically interesting,
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:14.340]   but that companies had maybe no other choice.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.780]   The TV market was going away and billboards and so on.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.620]   So they got it.
[00:35:19.620 --> 00:35:22.940]   And I think that sadly that Google just has,
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.980]   it was doing so well with that and making such money,
[00:35:24.980 --> 00:35:27.180]   it didn't think much more about how, wait a minute,
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.780]   is there a producer-consumer relationship
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:29.620]   to be set up here?
[00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.860]   Not just between us and the advertisers,
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:32.860]   market to be created.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:35.060]   Is there an actual market between the producer and consumer?
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:35.940]   They're the producers,
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.380]   the person who created that video clip,
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.980]   the person that made that website,
[00:35:38.980 --> 00:35:40.620]   the person who could make more such things,
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:43.620]   the person who could adjust it as a function of demand,
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:44.940]   the person on the other side
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:47.100]   who's asking for different kinds of things.
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.980]   So you see glimmers of that now,
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.540]   there's influencers and there's kind of
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.940]   a little glimmering of a market,
[00:35:51.940 --> 00:35:53.580]   but it should have been done 20 years ago.
[00:35:53.580 --> 00:35:54.420]   It should have been thought about.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:55.820]   It should have been created in parallel
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.020]   with the advertising ecosystem.
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:35:59.820]   And then Facebook inherited that.
[00:35:59.820 --> 00:36:02.980]   And I think they also didn't think very much about that.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.180]   So fast forward and now they are making huge amounts
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.700]   of money off of advertising.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:09.780]   And the news thing and all these clicks
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.460]   is just feeding the advertising.
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:13.540]   It's all connected up to the advertising.
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:15.500]   So you want more people to click on certain things
[00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.460]   because that money flows to you, Facebook.
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:19.980]   You're very much incentivized to do that.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:22.220]   And when you start to find it's breaking,
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.060]   so people were telling you,
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.060]   well, we're getting into some troubles,
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:27.500]   you try to adjust it with your smart AI algorithms, right?
[00:36:27.500 --> 00:36:28.940]   And figure out what are bad clicks.
[00:36:28.940 --> 00:36:31.060]   So maybe it shouldn't be click-through rate.
[00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:33.740]   I find that pretty much hopeless.
[00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:35.940]   It does get into all the complexity of human life
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:38.460]   and you can try to fix it, you should,
[00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:40.700]   but you could also fix the whole business model.
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:42.460]   And the business model is that really,
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.140]   what are, are there some human producers
[00:36:44.140 --> 00:36:45.220]   and consumers out there?
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:47.020]   Is there some economic value to be liberated
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:48.580]   by connecting them directly?
[00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:50.700]   Is it such that it's so valuable
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:53.060]   that people will be willing to pay for it?
[00:36:53.060 --> 00:36:53.900]   All right.
[00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:54.740]   - Micro payments, like small payments.
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:56.500]   - Micro, but even after you micro,
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:36:58.740]   so I like the example, suppose I'm going,
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.940]   next week I'm going to India,
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:02.460]   never been to India before, right?
[00:37:02.460 --> 00:37:05.220]   I have a couple of days in Mumbai.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.740]   I have no idea what to do there, right?
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.740]   And I could go on the web right now and search.
[00:37:08.740 --> 00:37:10.060]   It's gonna be kind of hopeless.
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.140]   I'm not gonna find, you know,
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:14.740]   I'll have lots of advertisers in my face, right?
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:16.900]   What I really wanna do is broadcast to the world
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.500]   that I am going to Mumbai
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:21.820]   and have someone on the other side of a market look at me
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:23.940]   and there's a recommendation system there.
[00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:25.180]   So they're not looking at all possible people
[00:37:25.180 --> 00:37:26.020]   coming to Mumbai.
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:27.620]   They're looking at the people who are relevant to them.
[00:37:27.620 --> 00:37:28.740]   So someone my age group,
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.860]   someone who kind of knows me in some level.
[00:37:31.860 --> 00:37:33.340]   I give up a little privacy by that,
[00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:35.020]   but I'm happy because what I'm gonna get back
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.140]   is this person can make a little video for me
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:38.860]   or they're gonna write a little two page paper
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:40.740]   on here's the cool things that you want to do
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:43.180]   in Mumbai this week, especially, right?
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.020]   I'm gonna look at that.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:45.140]   I'm not gonna pay a micro payment.
[00:37:45.140 --> 00:37:47.780]   I'm gonna pay, you know, $100 or whatever for that.
[00:37:47.780 --> 00:37:48.700]   It's real value.
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:50.500]   It's like journalism.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.260]   And as a non-subscription,
[00:37:52.260 --> 00:37:54.620]   it's that I'm gonna pay that person in that moment.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.540]   Company's gonna take 5% of that.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:57.700]   And that person has now got it.
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.900]   It's a gig economy, if you will,
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:00.340]   but, you know, done for it, you know,
[00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:02.420]   thinking about a little bit behind YouTube,
[00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:03.260]   there was actually people
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.860]   who could make more of those things.
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:06.140]   If they were connected to a market,
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.900]   they would make more of those things independently.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:08.900]   You don't have to tell them what to do.
[00:38:08.900 --> 00:38:11.400]   You don't have to incentivize them any other way.
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.580]   And so, yeah, these companies,
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:15.660]   I don't think I've thought long and heard about that.
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:18.060]   So I do distinguish on, you know,
[00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:19.020]   Facebook on the one side
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:20.460]   who's just not thought about these things at all.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:23.620]   I think thinking that AI will fix everything.
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:25.260]   And Amazon thinks about them all the time
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:26.500]   because they were already out in the real world.
[00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:28.020]   They were delivering packages to people's doors.
[00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.380]   They were worried about a market.
[00:38:29.380 --> 00:38:30.220]   They were worried about sellers.
[00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:31.140]   And, you know, they worry
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.520]   and some things they do are great.
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:33.500]   Some things maybe not so great,
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:36.300]   but, you know, they're in that business model.
[00:38:36.300 --> 00:38:38.420]   And then I'd say Google sort of hovers somewhere in between.
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:41.460]   I don't think for a long, long time they got it.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.400]   I think they probably see that YouTube
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.820]   is more pregnant with possibility
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:47.140]   than they might've thought
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.740]   and that they're probably heading that direction.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.380]   But, you know, Silicon Valley has been dominated
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.100]   by the Google, Facebook kind of mentality
[00:38:54.100 --> 00:38:55.660]   and the subscription and advertising.
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:58.500]   And that's the core problem, right?
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:01.620]   The fake news actually rides on top of that
[00:39:01.620 --> 00:39:03.580]   'cause it means that you're monetizing
[00:39:03.580 --> 00:39:04.420]   with clip through rate.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:05.580]   And that is the core problem.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.780]   You got to remove that.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:09.620]   - So advertisement, if we're gonna linger on that,
[00:39:09.620 --> 00:39:11.220]   I mean, that's an interesting thesis.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:14.940]   I don't know if everyone really deeply thinks about that.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.560]   So you're right.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:19.220]   The thought is the advertising model
[00:39:19.220 --> 00:39:20.260]   is the only thing we have,
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:21.460]   the only thing we'll ever have.
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:23.500]   So we have to fix,
[00:39:23.500 --> 00:39:25.900]   we have to build algorithms that,
[00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:28.740]   despite that business model,
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.740]   you know, find the better angels of our nature
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:34.640]   and do good by society and by the individual.
[00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:37.060]   But you think we can slowly,
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:38.660]   you think, first of all,
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.960]   there's a difference between should and could.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:44.740]   So you're saying we should slowly move away
[00:39:44.740 --> 00:39:45.940]   from the advertising model
[00:39:45.940 --> 00:39:47.180]   and have a direct connection
[00:39:47.180 --> 00:39:49.660]   between the consumer and the creator.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:51.700]   The question I also have is,
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:55.300]   can we, because the advertising model is so successful now
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:58.460]   in terms of just making a huge amount of money
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:40:00.540]   and therefore being able to build a big company
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:02.900]   that provides, has really smart people working
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:04.140]   that create a good service.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.460]   Do you think it's possible?
[00:40:05.460 --> 00:40:08.020]   And just to clarify, you think we should move away?
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:08.980]   - Well, I think we should, yeah.
[00:40:08.980 --> 00:40:10.820]   But we is, you know, not me.
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:11.980]   - Society.
[00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:13.980]   - Yeah, well, the companies.
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.340]   I mean, so first of all, full disclosure,
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:16.940]   I'm doing a day a week at Amazon
[00:40:16.940 --> 00:40:18.820]   'cause I kind of want to learn more about how they do things.
[00:40:18.820 --> 00:40:20.980]   So, you know, I'm not speaking for Amazon in any way,
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:22.820]   but, you know, I did go there
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:24.820]   because I actually believe they get a little bit of this
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:26.140]   or trying to create these markets.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.860]   - And they don't really use,
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:29.580]   advertisement is not a crucial part of it.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:30.420]   - That's a good question.
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:32.500]   So it has become not crucial,
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:33.900]   but it's become more and more present
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:35.260]   if you go to Amazon website.
[00:40:35.260 --> 00:40:37.980]   And, you know, without revealing too many deep secrets
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.740]   about Amazon, I can tell you that, you know,
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:41.060]   a lot of people in the company question this
[00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.480]   and there's a huge questioning going on.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:45.580]   You do not want a world where there's zero advertising.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:47.620]   That actually is a bad world, okay?
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:49.180]   So here's a way to think about it.
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.720]   You're a company that like Amazon
[00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.860]   is trying to bring products to customers, right?
[00:40:54.860 --> 00:40:55.700]   And the customer,
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.300]   and then you get more, you want to buy a vacuum cleaner,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.420]   say, you want to know what's available for me.
[00:40:59.420 --> 00:41:00.820]   And, you know, it's not gonna be that obvious.
[00:41:00.820 --> 00:41:02.140]   You have to do a little bit of work at it.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:04.540]   The recommendation system will sort of help, right?
[00:41:04.540 --> 00:41:06.580]   But now suppose this other person over here
[00:41:06.580 --> 00:41:07.780]   has just made the world, you know,
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:08.900]   they spent a huge amount of energy.
[00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:09.740]   They had a great idea.
[00:41:09.740 --> 00:41:10.740]   They made a great vacuum cleaner.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:12.340]   They know, they really did it.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:13.180]   They nailed it.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:14.460]   It's an MIT, you know, whiz kid
[00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:16.540]   that made a great new vacuum cleaner, right?
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:18.140]   It's not gonna be in the recommendation system.
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.180]   No one will know about it.
[00:41:19.180 --> 00:41:20.740]   The algorithms will not find it
[00:41:20.740 --> 00:41:24.180]   and AI will not fix that, okay, at all, right?
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:26.280]   How do you allow that vacuum cleaner
[00:41:26.280 --> 00:41:29.460]   to start to get in front of people, be sold?
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.580]   Well, advertising.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:31.900]   And here what advertising is,
[00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:35.480]   it's a signal that you believe in your product enough
[00:41:35.480 --> 00:41:37.340]   that you're willing to pay some real money for it.
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:39.500]   And to me as a consumer, I look at that signal.
[00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:40.620]   I say, well, first of all,
[00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.780]   I know these are not just cheap little ads
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.000]   'cause we have now right now.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.380]   I know that, you know, these are super cheap, you know,
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.660]   pennies.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.140]   If I see an ad where it's actually,
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:51.020]   I know the company is only doing a few of these
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.220]   and they're making, you know, real money is kind of flowing
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.140]   and I see an ad, I may pay more attention to it.
[00:41:55.140 --> 00:41:57.300]   And I actually might want that because I see,
[00:41:57.300 --> 00:41:59.900]   hey, that guy spent money on his vacuum cleaner.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:02.260]   Oh, maybe there's something good there.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:03.180]   So I will look at it.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:05.380]   And so that's part of the overall information flow
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:06.540]   in a good market.
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:08.060]   So advertising has a role.
[00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:10.500]   But the problem is, of course,
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.260]   that that signal is now completely gone
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.720]   because it just, you know,
[00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:15.120]   dominated by these tiny little things
[00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:17.320]   that add up to big money for the company.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:20.400]   You know, so I think it will change
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.440]   because the societies just don't, you know,
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:24.680]   stick with things that annoy a lot of people.
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.360]   And advertising currently annoys people
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.360]   more than it provides information.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.720]   So I think that a Google probably is smart enough
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:33.580]   to figure out that this is a dead, this is a bad model,
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:35.040]   even though it's a huge amount of money
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:35.960]   and they'll have to figure out
[00:42:35.960 --> 00:42:37.920]   how to pull it away from it slowly.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.800]   And I'm sure the CEO there will figure it out,
[00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:42.040]   but they need to do it.
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:44.100]   And they needed it to,
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:46.100]   so if you reduce advertising, not to zero,
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.780]   but you reduce it at the same time you bring up
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.580]   producer, consumer, actual real value being delivered,
[00:42:51.580 --> 00:42:52.900]   so real money is being paid,
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:54.580]   and they take a 5% cut,
[00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:56.340]   that 5% could start to get big enough
[00:42:56.340 --> 00:42:58.020]   to cancel out the lost revenue
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:00.060]   from the kind of the poor kind of advertising.
[00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.260]   And I think that a good company will do that,
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.240]   will realize that.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.580]   And their company, you know, Facebook,
[00:43:06.580 --> 00:43:08.140]   you know, again, God bless them.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:10.980]   They bring, you know, grandmothers, you know,
[00:43:11.800 --> 00:43:14.600]   they bring children's pictures into grandmothers' lives,
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:15.680]   it's fantastic.
[00:43:15.680 --> 00:43:19.240]   But they need to think of a new business model.
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:22.240]   And that's the core problem there.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.280]   Until they start to connect producer, consumer,
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.560]   I think they will just continue to make money
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:28.480]   and then buy the next social network company
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.840]   and then buy the next one.
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:31.640]   And the innovation level will not be high
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:34.800]   and the health issues will not go away.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:38.360]   - So I apologize that we kind of returned to words.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:40.940]   I don't think the exact terms matter,
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:43.580]   but in sort of defense of advertisement,
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:49.140]   don't you think the kind of direct connection
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:53.520]   between consumer and creator, producer,
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:57.440]   is the best, like the,
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:00.840]   is what advertisement strives to do, right?
[00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:04.760]   So that is best advertisement is literally now,
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:06.740]   Facebook is listening to our conversation
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:08.440]   and heard that you're going to India
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:11.340]   and will be able to actually start automatically
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:13.140]   for you making these connections
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.460]   and start giving this offer.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:18.420]   So like, I apologize if it's just a matter of terms,
[00:44:18.420 --> 00:44:19.820]   but just to draw a distinction,
[00:44:19.820 --> 00:44:21.300]   is it possible to make advertisements
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.120]   just better and better and better algorithmically
[00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:25.540]   to where it actually becomes a connection,
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.780]   almost a direct connection? - That's a good question.
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:28.220]   So let's put it on the, push it on.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.720]   First of all, what we just talked about,
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:32.500]   I was defending advertising, okay?
[00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.980]   So I was defending it as a way to get signals into a market
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.620]   that don't come any other way, especially algorithmically.
[00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:39.360]   It's a sign that someone spent money on it.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:41.520]   It's a sign they think it's valuable.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:43.080]   And if I think that if other things,
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.520]   someone else thinks it's valuable,
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.400]   then if I trust other people, I might be willing to listen.
[00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:49.680]   I don't trust that Facebook though,
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:51.880]   who's an intermediary between this.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.380]   I don't think they care about me, okay?
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.560]   I don't think they do.
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:59.440]   And I find it creepy that they know I'm going to India
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.080]   next week because of our conversation.
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:01.920]   - Why do you think that is?
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:05.760]   Can we, so what, can you just put your PR hat on?
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.000]   (laughing)
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.500]   Why do you think you find Facebook creepy
[00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:14.100]   and not trust them as do majority of the population?
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.280]   So they're, out of the Silicon Valley companies,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.640]   I saw like, not approval rate,
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:21.240]   but there's ranking of how much people trust companies
[00:45:21.240 --> 00:45:23.020]   and Facebook is in the gutter.
[00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:25.480]   - In the gutter, including people inside of Facebook.
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:27.800]   - So what do you attribute that to?
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.640]   Because when I--
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:29.980]   - Come on, you don't find it creepy
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:31.840]   that right now we're talking that I might walk out
[00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.720]   on the street right now that some unknown person
[00:45:33.720 --> 00:45:35.880]   who I don't know kind of comes up to me and says,
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.520]   "I hear you're going to India."
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:38.800]   I mean, that's not even Facebook.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.600]   That's just a, I want transparency in human society.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.580]   I want to have, if you know something about me,
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.980]   there's actually some reason you know something about me.
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:48.720]   That's something that if I look at it later
[00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:51.460]   and audit it kind of, I approve.
[00:45:51.460 --> 00:45:54.480]   You know something about me 'cause you care in some way.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.080]   There's a caring relationship even,
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:58.000]   or an economic one or something.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.040]   Not just that you're someone who could exploit it
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:02.120]   in ways I don't know about or care about
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.160]   or I'm troubled by or whatever.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.200]   And we're in a world right now
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.640]   where that happens way too much.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:11.560]   And that Facebook knows things about a lot of people
[00:46:11.560 --> 00:46:14.760]   and could exploit it and does exploit it at times.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:16.800]   I think most people do find that creepy.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:17.640]   It's not for them.
[00:46:17.640 --> 00:46:20.040]   It's not that Facebook does not do it
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:23.320]   'cause they care about them, right, in any real sense.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:24.160]   And they shouldn't.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:26.680]   They should not be a big brother caring about us.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.760]   That is not the role of a company like that.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.800]   - Why not?
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:32.200]   Not the big brother part, but the caring, the trusting.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.500]   I mean, don't those companies,
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.600]   just to linger on it because a lot of companies
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:38.360]   have a lot of information about us.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:41.120]   I would argue that there's companies like Microsoft
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:44.320]   that has more information about us than Facebook does.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.920]   And yet we trust Microsoft more.
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:47.400]   - Well, Microsoft is pivoting.
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:49.920]   Microsoft, you know, under Satya Nadella has decided
[00:46:49.920 --> 00:46:51.120]   this is really important.
[00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:53.080]   We don't wanna do creepy things.
[00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:54.400]   Really want people to trust us
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.200]   to actually only use information in ways
[00:46:56.200 --> 00:46:59.200]   that they really would approve of, that we don't decide.
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.120]   Right?
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.660]   And I'm just kind of adding that the health of a market
[00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:07.620]   is that when I connect to someone who, producer, consumer,
[00:47:07.620 --> 00:47:09.060]   it's not just a random producer or consumer.
[00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:10.540]   It's people who see each other.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.460]   They don't like each other,
[00:47:11.460 --> 00:47:13.620]   but they sense that if they transact,
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:15.900]   some happiness will go up on both sides.
[00:47:15.900 --> 00:47:18.060]   If a company helps me to do that
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:22.700]   in moments that I choose, of my choosing, then fine.
[00:47:22.700 --> 00:47:25.180]   So, and also think about the difference between,
[00:47:25.180 --> 00:47:28.460]   you know, browsing versus buying, right?
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.420]   There are moments in my life
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:31.760]   I just wanna buy, you know, a gadget or something.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.080]   I need something for that moment.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.920]   I need some ammonia for my house or something,
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:36.520]   'cause I got a problem, a spill.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.280]   I wanna just go in.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.080]   I don't wanna be advertised at that moment.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.320]   I don't wanna be led down various, you know,
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:43.160]   that's annoying.
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:45.280]   I want to just go and have it be extremely easy
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.320]   to do what I want.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.800]   Other moments I might say, no, it's like,
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:52.440]   today I'm going to the shopping mall.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:53.880]   I wanna walk around and see things
[00:47:53.880 --> 00:47:55.480]   and see people and be exposed to stuff.
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.800]   So I want control over that though.
[00:47:56.800 --> 00:48:00.000]   I don't want the company's algorithms to decide for me.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.200]   Right, and I think that's the thing.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:02.460]   There's a total loss of control
[00:48:02.460 --> 00:48:04.880]   if Facebook thinks they should take the control from us
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:06.040]   of deciding when we want to have
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.520]   certain kinds of information, when we don't,
[00:48:07.520 --> 00:48:09.060]   what information that is,
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.960]   how much it relates to what they know about us
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:13.200]   that we didn't really want them to know about us.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:15.880]   They're not, I don't want them to be helping me in that way.
[00:48:15.880 --> 00:48:17.040]   I don't want them to be helping them
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:19.640]   by they decide, they have control over
[00:48:19.640 --> 00:48:22.200]   what I want and when.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.040]   - I totally agree.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.560]   So Facebook, by the way, I have this optimistic thing
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.520]   where I think Facebook has the kind of personal information
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:32.400]   about us that could create a beautiful thing.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:36.600]   So I'm really optimistic of what Facebook could do.
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.240]   It's not what it's doing, but what it could do.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:40.080]   - I don't see that.
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:42.040]   I think that optimism is misplaced
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.720]   because you have to have a business model
[00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:44.560]   behind these things.
[00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.380]   - Yes, no, you have to.
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:48.340]   - Create a beautiful thing is really, let's be clear.
[00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:51.000]   It's about something that people would value.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.720]   And I don't think they have that business model.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:55.680]   And I don't think they will suddenly discover it
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:58.920]   by what, you know, a long hot shower.
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:59.760]   - I disagree.
[00:48:59.760 --> 00:49:02.600]   I disagree in terms of you can discover
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.680]   a lot of amazing things in a shower.
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:05.520]   So.
[00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.360]   - I didn't say that.
[00:49:06.360 --> 00:49:07.200]   I said, they won't come.
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:08.020]   - They won't.
[00:49:08.020 --> 00:49:08.860]   - They won't do it.
[00:49:08.860 --> 00:49:09.680]   In the shower.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:11.300]   I think a lot of other people will discover it.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:14.400]   I think that this, so I should also, full disclosure,
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.720]   there's a company called United Masters,
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:16.600]   which I'm on their board,
[00:49:16.600 --> 00:49:18.240]   and they've created this music market.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:20.480]   They have 100,000 artists now signed on.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.400]   And they've done things like gone to the NBA
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:25.520]   and the NBA, the music you find behind NBA clips right now
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.800]   is their music, right?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:29.240]   That's a company that had the right business model
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:31.360]   in mind from the get go, right?
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.620]   Executed on that.
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:35.320]   And from day one, there was value brought to,
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.280]   so here you have a kid who made some songs
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:40.720]   who suddenly their songs are on the NBA website, right?
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:43.120]   That's real economic value to people.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:45.400]   And so, you know.
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:49.200]   - So you and I differ on the optimism of being able to
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:54.200]   sort of change the direction of the Titanic, right?
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:55.180]   So I.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.920]   - Yeah, I'm older than you,
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:49:58.960]   so I've seen some of the Titanic's crash.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.080]   - Got it.
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.240]   But, and just to elaborate,
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.520]   'cause I totally agree with you,
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:06.040]   and I just want to know how difficult
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.560]   you think this problem is of,
[00:50:07.560 --> 00:50:11.440]   so for example, I want to read some news.
[00:50:11.440 --> 00:50:14.320]   And I would, there's a lot of times in the day
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:17.640]   where something makes me either smile or think in a way
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:21.040]   where I like consciously think this really gave me value.
[00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.440]   Like I sometimes listen to the Daily Podcast
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:25.720]   and the New York Times,
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.240]   way better than the New York Times themselves, by the way,
[00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:29.140]   for people listening.
[00:50:29.140 --> 00:50:31.660]   That's like real journalism is happening for some reason
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.640]   in the podcast space, it doesn't make sense to me.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.400]   But often I listen to it 20 minutes,
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.720]   and I would be willing to pay for that,
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:41.680]   like $5, $10 for that experience.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.920]   And how difficult, that's kind of what you're getting at,
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.800]   is that little transaction.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.200]   How difficult is it to create a frictionless system
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:53.360]   like Uber has, for example, for other things?
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:55.240]   What's your intuition there?
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:57.560]   - So first of all, I pay little bits of money to,
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.240]   you know, there's something called Quartz
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:00.360]   that does financial things.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:04.400]   I like Medium as a site, I don't pay there, but I would.
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.440]   - You had a great post on Medium,
[00:51:06.440 --> 00:51:10.360]   I would have loved to pay you a dollar and not others.
[00:51:10.360 --> 00:51:11.720]   - I wouldn't have wanted it per se,
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:14.680]   because there should be also sites
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:16.120]   where that's not actually the goal.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.520]   The goal is to actually have a broadcast channel
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.720]   that I monetize in some other way if I chose to.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.080]   I mean, I could now, people know about it,
[00:51:23.080 --> 00:51:26.160]   I could, I'm not doing it, but that's fine with me.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:28.360]   Also, the musicians who are making all this music,
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.120]   I don't think the right model is that you pay
[00:51:30.120 --> 00:51:32.360]   a little subscription fee to them, all right?
[00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.600]   Because people can copy the bits too easily,
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.120]   and it's just not that, that's not where the value is.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:37.840]   The value is that a connection was made
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:41.000]   between real human beings, then you can follow up on that,
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:42.840]   all right, and create yet more value.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:44.080]   So no, I think--
[00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:46.520]   - There's a lot of open questions here.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:47.960]   - A lot of open questions, but also, yeah,
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.600]   I do want good recommendation systems
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.040]   that recommend cool stuff to me, but it's pretty hard,
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.160]   right, I don't like them to recommend stuff
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:51:55.840]   just based on my browsing history.
[00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.120]   I don't like them to base it on stuff
[00:51:57.120 --> 00:51:58.600]   they know about me, quote, unquote.
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:00.760]   What's unknown about me is the most interesting.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:03.520]   - So this is the really interesting question.
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:05.880]   We may disagree, maybe not.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:09.120]   I think that I love recommender systems,
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.000]   and I wanna give them everything about me
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:13.480]   in a way that I trust.
[00:52:13.480 --> 00:52:15.640]   - Yeah, but you don't, because, so for example,
[00:52:15.640 --> 00:52:18.360]   this morning, I clicked on, I was pretty sleepy
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.920]   this morning, I clicked on a story
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.400]   about the Queen of England, right?
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.480]   I do not give a damn about the Queen of England.
[00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.480]   I really do not, but it was clickbait.
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:30.320]   It kinda looked funny, and I had to say,
[00:52:30.320 --> 00:52:31.560]   "What the heck are they talking about there?"
[00:52:31.560 --> 00:52:33.960]   I don't wanna have my life heading that direction.
[00:52:33.960 --> 00:52:36.080]   Now that's in my browsing history.
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.400]   The system, and any reasonable system,
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:39.240]   will think that I care about the Queen of England.
[00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:40.560]   - That's browsing history.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.840]   - Right, but you're saying all the trace,
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:44.320]   all the digital exhaust, or whatever,
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.920]   that's been kind of the model, is if you collect
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:48.880]   all this stuff, you're gonna figure all of us out.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:50.420]   Well, if you're trying to figure out one person,
[00:52:50.420 --> 00:52:52.600]   like Trump or something, maybe you could figure him out,
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:56.200]   but if you're trying to figure out 500 million people,
[00:52:56.200 --> 00:52:57.920]   no way, no way.
[00:52:57.920 --> 00:52:58.760]   - Do you think so?
[00:52:58.760 --> 00:52:59.600]   - No, I think so.
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:01.800]   I think we are, humans are just amazingly rich
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:02.640]   and complicated.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:03.880]   Every one of us has our little quirks.
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:05.880]   Every one of us has our little things that could intrigue us
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:07.840]   that we don't even know will intrigue us,
[00:53:07.840 --> 00:53:09.880]   and there's no sign of it in our past,
[00:53:09.880 --> 00:53:12.860]   but by God, there it comes, and you fall in love with it,
[00:53:12.860 --> 00:53:14.480]   and I don't want a company trying to figure that out
[00:53:14.480 --> 00:53:15.760]   for me and anticipate that.
[00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:16.600]   - Okay, well let me--
[00:53:16.600 --> 00:53:18.480]   - I want them to provide a forum, a market,
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:22.080]   a place that I kind of go, and by hook or by crook,
[00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:22.920]   this happens.
[00:53:22.920 --> 00:53:26.040]   I'm walking down the street, and I hear some Chilean music
[00:53:26.040 --> 00:53:27.640]   being played, and I never knew I liked Chilean music,
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:30.360]   but wow, so there is that side, and I want them
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:34.760]   to provide a limited, but interesting place to go, right?
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.920]   And so don't try to use your AI to kind of figure me out
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.280]   and then put me in a world where you figured me out.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:45.040]   No, create spaces for human beings
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:48.440]   where our creativity and our style will be enriched
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.880]   and come forward, and it'll be a lot of more transparency.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.360]   I won't have people randomly, anonymously
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.240]   putting comments up, and I'll special,
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:58.320]   based on stuff they know about me, facts that you know.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.800]   We are so broken right now, especially if you're a celebrity,
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.920]   but it's about anybody that, anonymous people
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:06.560]   are hurting lots and lots of people right now,
[00:54:06.560 --> 00:54:08.560]   and that's part of this thing that Silicon Valley
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:11.000]   is thinking that just collect all this information
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.400]   and use it in a great way.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:15.520]   So no, I'm not a pessimist, I'm very much an optimist
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:17.680]   by nature, but I think that's just been the wrong path
[00:54:17.680 --> 00:54:19.840]   for the whole technology to take.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:23.480]   Be more limited, create, let humans rise up.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.600]   Don't try to replace them, that's the AI mantra.
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:30.320]   Don't try to anticipate them, don't try to predict them,
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:33.280]   'cause you're not gonna be able to do those things,
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.600]   you're gonna make things worse.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:38.520]   - Okay, so right now, just give this a chance,
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.040]   right now the recommender systems are the creepy people
[00:54:42.040 --> 00:54:45.360]   in the shadow watching your every move.
[00:54:45.360 --> 00:54:47.680]   So they're looking at traces of you,
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:50.240]   they're not directly interacting with you.
[00:54:50.240 --> 00:54:52.920]   Sort of your close friends and family,
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.000]   the way they know you is by having conversation,
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.320]   by actually having interactions back and forth.
[00:54:57.320 --> 00:55:00.680]   Do you think there's a place for recommender systems,
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:03.200]   sort of to step, 'cause you just emphasized the value
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.800]   of human to human connection, but just give it a chance,
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.360]   AI human connection, is there a role for an AI system
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.880]   to have conversations with you, in terms of,
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:14.720]   to try to figure out what kind of music you like,
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   not by just watching what you listen to,
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:18.200]   but actually having a conversation,
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.600]   natural language or otherwise.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.840]   - Yeah, so I'm not against it,
[00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:23.040]   I just wanted to push back against,
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:25.120]   maybe you're saying you have autism for Facebook,
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:28.720]   so there I think it's misplaced, but I think that--
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:30.280]   - I'm the one guy defending Facebook.
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:34.000]   - Yeah, no, so good for you, go for it.
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:34.840]   - That's a hard spot to be.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.440]   - Yeah, no, good, human interaction on our daily,
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:39.660]   the context around me in my own home is something
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:41.320]   that I don't want some big company to know about at all,
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:42.360]   but I would be more than happy
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.080]   to have technology help me with it.
[00:55:44.080 --> 00:55:45.240]   - Which kind of technology?
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:46.320]   - Well, you know, just--
[00:55:46.320 --> 00:55:47.640]   - Alexa, Amazon.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:49.240]   - Well, Alexa's done right,
[00:55:49.240 --> 00:55:50.800]   I think Alexa's a research platform right now,
[00:55:50.800 --> 00:55:53.640]   more than anything else, but Alexa done right,
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.600]   could do things like, I leave the water running in my garden
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:59.120]   and I say, "Hey, Alexa, the water's running in my garden,"
[00:55:59.120 --> 00:56:00.640]   and even have Alexa figure out that that means
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:03.520]   when my wife comes home that she should be told about that.
[00:56:03.520 --> 00:56:05.920]   That's a little bit of a reasoning, I would call that AI,
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:08.280]   and by any kind of stretch, it's a little bit of reasoning,
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.820]   and it actually kind of would make my life
[00:56:09.820 --> 00:56:10.820]   a little easier and better,
[00:56:10.820 --> 00:56:13.400]   and I wouldn't call this a wow moment,
[00:56:13.400 --> 00:56:16.440]   but I kind of think that overall rises human happiness up
[00:56:16.440 --> 00:56:18.280]   to have that kind of thing.
[00:56:18.280 --> 00:56:21.460]   - But not when you're lonely, Alexa knowing loneliness--
[00:56:21.460 --> 00:56:24.840]   - No, no, I don't want Alexa to feel intrusive,
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.420]   and I don't want just the designer of the system
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.480]   to kind of work all this out,
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.080]   I really wanna have a lot of control,
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:32.340]   and I want transparency and control,
[00:56:32.340 --> 00:56:34.480]   and if a company can stand up and give me that
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:36.520]   in the context of new technology,
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:37.360]   I think they're gonna, first of all,
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.760]   be way more successful than our current generation,
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.640]   and like I said, I was mentioning Microsoft earlier,
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:43.300]   I really think they're pivoting
[00:56:43.300 --> 00:56:45.060]   to kind of be the trusted old uncle,
[00:56:45.060 --> 00:56:47.680]   but I think that they get that this is the way to go,
[00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:49.840]   that if you let people find technology
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:51.320]   empowers them to have more control
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.840]   and have control not just over privacy,
[00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:56.440]   but over this rich set of interactions,
[00:56:56.440 --> 00:56:58.120]   that people are gonna like that a lot more,
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:00.360]   and that's the right business model going forward.
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.240]   - What does control over privacy look like?
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.600]   Do you think you should be able to just view
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.960]   all the data that--
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   - No, it's much more than that.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.760]   I mean, first of all, it should be an individual decision.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:09.200]   Some people don't want privacy,
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:10.600]   they want their whole life out there,
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:11.760]   other people's want it.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:16.880]   Privacy is not a zero one, it's not a legal thing,
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:20.320]   it's not just about which data is available, which is not.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:24.160]   I like to recall to people that a couple hundred years ago,
[00:57:24.160 --> 00:57:25.960]   everyone, there was not really big cities,
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:28.720]   everyone lived in on the countryside and villages,
[00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:30.840]   and in villages, everybody knew everything about you,
[00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:33.400]   very, you didn't have any privacy, is that bad?
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:34.880]   Are we better off now?
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:37.880]   Well, arguably no, because what did you get for that loss
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:40.520]   of at least certain kinds of privacy?
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:43.160]   Well, people helped each other,
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.080]   because they know everything about you,
[00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.400]   they know something bad's happening,
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:46.640]   they will help you with that, right?
[00:57:46.640 --> 00:57:47.680]   And now you live in a big city,
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:49.640]   no one knows about you, you get no help.
[00:57:49.640 --> 00:57:52.720]   So it kind of depends, the answer.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.360]   I want certain people who I trust,
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:56.360]   and there should be relationships,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:57:57.680]   I should kind of manage all those,
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:57:59.040]   but who knows what about me,
[00:57:59.040 --> 00:58:01.200]   I should have some agency there.
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:03.720]   I shouldn't just be adrift in a sea of technology
[00:58:03.720 --> 00:58:04.720]   where I have no agency.
[00:58:04.720 --> 00:58:08.480]   I don't wanna go reading things and checking boxes.
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:09.960]   So I don't know how to do that,
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:11.880]   and I'm not a privacy researcher per se,
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:14.320]   I recognize the vast complexity of this,
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:15.280]   it's not just technology,
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:18.680]   it's not just legal scholars meeting technologists,
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:20.840]   there's gotta be kind of a whole layers around it.
[00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:24.120]   And so when I alluded to this emerging engineering field,
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:25.360]   this is a big part of it.
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:28.400]   When electrical engineering came,
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.640]   I'm not went around at the time,
[00:58:29.640 --> 00:58:33.280]   but you just didn't plug electricity into walls
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:34.120]   and all kind of worked,
[00:58:34.120 --> 00:58:36.160]   you don't have to have like underwriters laboratory
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:37.600]   that reassured you that that plugs
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:39.560]   not gonna burn up your house,
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.680]   and that that machine will do this and that and everything,
[00:58:41.680 --> 00:58:44.480]   there'll be whole people who can install things,
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:46.280]   there'll be people who can watch the installers,
[00:58:46.280 --> 00:58:47.800]   there'll be a whole layers,
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:49.760]   an onion of these kinds of things.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:52.960]   And for things as deeply interesting as privacy,
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:55.840]   which is as least as interesting as electricity,
[00:58:55.840 --> 00:58:57.520]   that's gonna take decades to kind of work out,
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:59.360]   but it's gonna require a lot of new structures
[00:58:59.360 --> 00:59:00.240]   that we don't have right now,
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.160]   so it's getting hard to talk about it.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.960]   - And you're saying there's a lot of money to be made
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.000]   if you get it right, so--
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:05.840]   - Absolutely. - It's something
[00:59:05.840 --> 00:59:07.000]   you should look at. - A lot of money to be made
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:08.800]   and all these things that provide human services
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:12.280]   and people recognize them as useful parts of their lives.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:15.760]   So yeah, the dialect sometimes goes
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:18.480]   from the exuberant technologists
[00:59:18.480 --> 00:59:20.680]   to the no technology is good kind of,
[00:59:20.680 --> 00:59:23.040]   and that's in our public discourse,
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:25.680]   and newsrooms you see too much of this kind of thing.
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:27.680]   And the sober discussions in the middle,
[00:59:27.680 --> 00:59:29.080]   which are the challenging ones to have
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:31.280]   are where we need to be having our conversations.
[00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:35.080]   And actually there's not many forum for those.
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:39.000]   That's kind of what I would look for.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.120]   Maybe I could go and I could read a comment section
[00:59:41.120 --> 00:59:42.560]   of something and it would actually be
[00:59:42.560 --> 00:59:44.480]   this kind of dialogue going back and forth.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:45.680]   You don't see much of this, right?
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.640]   - Which is why actually there's a resurgence
[00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:49.120]   of podcasts out of all,
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:51.760]   because people are really hungry for conversation.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:55.680]   But technology is not helping much,
[00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:58.680]   so comment sections of anything, including YouTube,
[00:59:58.680 --> 00:59:59.520]   - Yeah.
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:00.920]   - Is not hurting. - Or hurting.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:03.280]   - And not helping. - Or hurting, yeah.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:05.920]   - And you think technically speaking,
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:07.840]   it's possible to help?
[01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:08.920]   - I don't know the answers,
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:13.080]   but it's a less anonymity, a little more locality,
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:15.520]   worlds that you kind of enter in
[01:00:15.520 --> 01:00:17.400]   and you trust the people there in those worlds
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.280]   so that when you start having a discussion,
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.920]   not only is that people not gonna hurt you,
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:22.880]   but it's not gonna be a total waste of your time,
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.800]   'cause there's a lot of wasting of time.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:26.760]   A lot of us, I pulled out of Facebook early on
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.720]   'cause it was clearly gonna waste a lot of my time,
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:31.000]   even though there was some value.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.840]   And so yeah, worlds that are somehow you enter in
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:34.720]   and you know what you're getting
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:36.720]   and it kind of appeals to you,
[01:00:36.720 --> 01:00:37.680]   new things might happen,
[01:00:37.680 --> 01:00:40.680]   but you kind of have some trust in that world.
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:43.600]   - And there's some deep, interesting, complex,
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.280]   psychological aspects around anonymity,
[01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:47.880]   how that changes human behavior.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:49.760]   - Indeed. - That's quite dark.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:50.640]   - Quite dark, yeah.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.280]   I think a lot of us are,
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.240]   especially those of us who really love
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.440]   the advent of technology.
[01:00:55.440 --> 01:00:56.760]   I loved social networks when they came out.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:59.400]   I was just, I didn't see any negatives there at all.
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:01.720]   But then I started seeing comment sections,
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.640]   I think it was maybe CNN or something,
[01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.840]   and I started to go, wow, this darkness,
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.760]   I just did not know about,
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.840]   and our technology is now amplifying it.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.760]   - So sorry for the big philosophical question,
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.880]   but on that topic, do you think human beings,
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:17.320]   'cause you've also, out of all things,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.140]   had a foot in psychology too,
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:23.680]   do you think human beings are fundamentally good?
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:28.200]   Like all of us have good intent that could be mind,
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:33.000]   or is it, depending on context and environment,
[01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.840]   everybody could be evil?
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:37.560]   - So my answer is fundamentally good,
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:39.040]   but fundamentally limited.
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:41.240]   All of us have very, you know, blinkers on.
[01:01:41.240 --> 01:01:43.840]   We don't see the other person's pain that easily.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:46.600]   We don't see the other person's point of view that easily.
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:49.680]   We're very much in our own head, in our own world.
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:51.960]   And on my good days, I think that technology
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.000]   could open us up to more perspectives,
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.540]   and more less blinkered, and more understanding.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:58.280]   You know, a lot of wars in human history
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:01:59.840]   happened because of just ignorance.
[01:01:59.840 --> 01:02:01.960]   They didn't, they thought the other person was doing this,
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:03.080]   well, the other person wasn't doing this,
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:05.200]   and we have huge amounts of that.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:07.220]   But in my lifetime, I've not seen technology
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.080]   really help in that way yet.
[01:02:09.080 --> 01:02:12.240]   And I do believe in that, but you know,
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.200]   no, I think fundamentally humans are good.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.320]   People suffer, people have grievances,
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:17.520]   people have grudges, and those things
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.880]   cause them to do things they probably wouldn't want.
[01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.360]   They regret it often.
[01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:25.760]   So no, I think it's, you know,
[01:02:25.760 --> 01:02:28.520]   part of the progress of technology is to indeed allow it
[01:02:28.520 --> 01:02:30.200]   to be a little easier to be the real good person
[01:02:30.200 --> 01:02:31.760]   you actually are.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:35.740]   - Well, but do you think individual human life,
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:40.140]   or society, could be modeled as an optimization problem?
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:43.460]   - Not the way I think, typically.
[01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:44.300]   I mean, that's, you're talking about
[01:02:44.300 --> 01:02:46.320]   one of the most complex phenomena in the whole,
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:47.520]   you know, in all of the universe.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.720]   - Which the individual human life, or society,
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.160]   as a whole. - Both, both.
[01:02:51.160 --> 01:02:54.280]   I mean, individual human life is amazingly complex.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:02:57.240]   And so, you know, optimization is kind of
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:58.520]   just one branch of mathematics
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.880]   that talks about certain kind of things.
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:02.120]   And it just feels way too limited
[01:03:02.120 --> 01:03:04.280]   for the complexity of such things.
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:06.680]   - What properties of optimization problems,
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:09.960]   do you think most interesting problems
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:12.200]   that could be solved through optimization,
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:14.320]   what kind of properties does that surface have?
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:17.520]   Non-convexity, convexity, linearity,
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.960]   all those kinds of things, saddle points.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.080]   - Well, so optimization's just one piece of mathematics.
[01:03:22.080 --> 01:03:24.600]   You know, there's like, just even in our era,
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.040]   we're aware that, say, sampling is coming up,
[01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:30.720]   examples of something, coming up with a distribution.
[01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.720]   - What's optimization, what's sampling?
[01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.840]   - Well, you can, if you're a kind of,
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:35.680]   a certain kind of mathematician,
[01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:37.320]   you can try to blend them and make them
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:38.560]   seem to be sort of the same thing.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:40.180]   But optimization is, roughly speaking,
[01:03:40.180 --> 01:03:43.920]   trying to find a point that, a single point,
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:47.340]   that is the optimum of a criterion function of some kind.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:51.640]   And sampling is trying to, from that same surface,
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:54.080]   treat that as a distribution or a density
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:56.760]   and find points that have high density.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:04:01.360]   So I want the entire distribution in a sampling paradigm
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.360]   and I want the single point that's the best point
[01:04:04.360 --> 01:04:07.520]   in the optimization paradigm.
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:08.840]   Now, if you were optimizing
[01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:11.100]   in the space of probability measures,
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.280]   the output of that could be a whole probability distribution.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.480]   So you can start to make these things the same.
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:17.160]   But in mathematics, if you go too high up
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:19.520]   that kind of abstraction, you start to lose
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:22.800]   the ability to do the interesting theorems.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:23.760]   So you kind of don't try to,
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:25.920]   you don't try to overly, over-abstract.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:30.120]   - So, as a small tangent, what kind of world view
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:31.360]   do you find more appealing?
[01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:35.320]   One that is deterministic or stochastic?
[01:04:35.320 --> 01:04:37.160]   - Well, that's easy.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:38.400]   I mean, I'm a statistician.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.400]   The world is highly stochastic.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:41.240]   I don't know what's gonna happen
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.480]   in the next five minutes, right?
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.920]   'Cause what you're gonna ask, what we're gonna do,
[01:04:43.920 --> 01:04:45.240]   what I'll say. - Due to the uncertainty.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.280]   Due to the-- - Massive uncertainty.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:48.760]   You know, massive uncertainty.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:51.400]   And so the best I can do is have kind of rough sense
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.160]   or probability distribution on things
[01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:56.560]   and somehow use that in my reasoning about what to do now.
[01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:02.620]   - So how does the distributed at scale,
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.780]   when you have multi-agent systems,
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:10.440]   look like, so optimization can optimize sort of,
[01:05:10.440 --> 01:05:12.440]   it makes a lot more sense.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:15.160]   Sort of, at least from my, from a robotics perspective,
[01:05:15.160 --> 01:05:17.080]   for a single robot, for a single agent,
[01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:19.340]   trying to optimize some objective function.
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:22.640]   When you start to enter the real world,
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:25.240]   this game-theoretic concept starts popping up.
[01:05:25.240 --> 01:05:30.520]   That, how do you see optimization in this?
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:32.360]   'Cause you've talked about markets and the scale.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.840]   What does that look like?
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:34.960]   Do you see it as optimization?
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.080]   Do you see it as sampling?
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:37.880]   Do you see, like how should you--
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:39.320]   - Yeah, these all blend together.
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.200]   And a system designer thinking about
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.520]   how to build an incentivized system
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.800]   will have a blend of all these things.
[01:05:44.800 --> 01:05:47.700]   So, a particle in a potential well
[01:05:47.700 --> 01:05:50.560]   is optimizing a functional called a Lagrangian.
[01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:51.840]   The particle doesn't know that.
[01:05:51.840 --> 01:05:54.600]   There's no algorithm running that does that.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:55.640]   It just happens.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:57.440]   So it's a description mathematically of something
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.760]   that helps us understand as analysts what's happening.
[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:02.760]   And so the same thing will happen when we talk about
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:04.120]   mixtures of humans and computers
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:05.880]   and markets and so on and so forth.
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:06.880]   There'll be certain principles
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:08.160]   that allow us to understand what's happening
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:09.620]   and whether or not the actual algorithms
[01:06:09.620 --> 01:06:12.860]   are being used by any sense is not clear.
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:16.760]   Now, at some point I may have set up a multi-agent
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:18.960]   or market kind of system.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:21.000]   And I'm now thinking about an individual agent
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:22.320]   in that system.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:23.840]   And they're asked to do some task
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.800]   and they're incentivized in some way.
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:27.800]   They get certain signals and they have some utility.
[01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:29.400]   Maybe what they will do at that point
[01:06:29.400 --> 01:06:30.800]   is they just won't know the answer.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:33.240]   They may have to optimize to find an answer.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.160]   So an optus could be embedded inside of an overall market.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:39.760]   And game theory is very, very broad.
[01:06:39.760 --> 01:06:41.860]   It is often studied very narrowly
[01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:43.940]   for certain kinds of problems.
[01:06:43.940 --> 01:06:45.100]   But it's roughly speaking,
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:47.780]   there's just the, I don't know what you're gonna do.
[01:06:47.780 --> 01:06:49.620]   So I kind of anticipate that a little bit
[01:06:49.620 --> 01:06:51.460]   and you anticipate what I'm anticipating.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:53.260]   And we kind of go back and forth in our own minds.
[01:06:53.260 --> 01:06:55.260]   We run kind of thought experiments.
[01:06:55.260 --> 01:06:56.900]   - You've talked about this interesting point
[01:06:56.900 --> 01:06:58.700]   in terms of game theory.
[01:06:58.700 --> 01:07:01.220]   You know, most optimization problems
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:02.700]   really hate saddle points.
[01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:04.660]   Maybe you can describe what saddle points are.
[01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:07.080]   But I've heard you kind of mentioned
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.600]   that there's a branch of optimization
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:13.840]   that you could try to explicitly look for saddle points
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:14.920]   as a good thing.
[01:07:14.920 --> 01:07:15.760]   - Oh, not optimization.
[01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:16.760]   That's just game theory.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:20.320]   So there's all kinds of different equilibrium game theory.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:22.960]   And some of them are highly explanatory behavior.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:24.680]   They're not attempting to be algorithmic.
[01:07:24.680 --> 01:07:26.080]   They're just trying to say,
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.480]   if you happen to be at this equilibrium,
[01:07:28.480 --> 01:07:29.720]   you would see certain kind of behavior.
[01:07:29.720 --> 01:07:30.840]   And we see that in real life.
[01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:32.400]   That's what an economist wants to do,
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.120]   especially a behavioral economist.
[01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:39.940]   In continuous differential game theory,
[01:07:39.940 --> 01:07:42.380]   you're in continuous spaces.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:44.340]   Some of the simplest equilibria are saddle points.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.300]   A Nash equilibrium is a saddle point.
[01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.340]   It's a special kind of saddle point.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:50.540]   So classically in game theory,
[01:07:50.540 --> 01:07:52.540]   you are trying to find Nash equilibrium.
[01:07:52.540 --> 01:07:53.980]   And in algorithmic game theory,
[01:07:53.980 --> 01:07:56.100]   you're trying to find algorithms that would find them.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.740]   And so you're trying to find saddle points.
[01:07:57.740 --> 01:08:00.580]   I mean, so that's literally what you're trying to do.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:01.800]   But, you know, any economist knows
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:04.100]   that Nash equilibria have their limitations.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.460]   They are definitely not that explanatory
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.100]   in many situations.
[01:08:08.100 --> 01:08:10.220]   They're not what you really want.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.980]   There's other kind of equilibria.
[01:08:11.980 --> 01:08:13.680]   And there's names associated with these
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.900]   'cause they came from history
[01:08:14.900 --> 01:08:15.940]   with certain people working on them,
[01:08:15.940 --> 01:08:17.940]   but there'll be new ones emerging.
[01:08:17.940 --> 01:08:21.060]   So, you know, one example is a Stackelberg equilibrium.
[01:08:21.060 --> 01:08:24.060]   So, you know, Nash, you and I are both playing this game
[01:08:24.060 --> 01:08:25.760]   against each other or for each other,
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:27.120]   maybe it's cooperative.
[01:08:27.120 --> 01:08:28.540]   And we're both gonna think it through,
[01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:29.380]   and then we're gonna decide
[01:08:29.380 --> 01:08:32.460]   and we're gonna do our thing simultaneously.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.500]   You know, and a Stackelberg,
[01:08:33.500 --> 01:08:34.640]   no, I'm gonna be the first mover.
[01:08:34.640 --> 01:08:35.780]   I'm gonna make a move.
[01:08:35.780 --> 01:08:36.920]   You're gonna look at my move,
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.300]   and then you're gonna make yours.
[01:08:38.300 --> 01:08:40.640]   Now, since I know you're gonna look at my move,
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:42.100]   I anticipate what you're gonna do.
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.660]   And so I don't do something stupid.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.860]   But then I know that you are also anticipating me.
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:48.440]   So we're kind of going back and forth in line.
[01:08:48.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   But there is then a first mover thing.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.580]   And so those are different equilibria, all right?
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:57.140]   And so just mathematically, yeah,
[01:08:57.140 --> 01:08:58.620]   these things have certain topologies
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:00.140]   and certain shapes that are like salivating,
[01:09:00.140 --> 01:09:01.540]   algorithmically or dynamically,
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:02.780]   how do you move towards them?
[01:09:02.780 --> 01:09:04.460]   How do you move away from things?
[01:09:04.460 --> 01:09:07.540]   You know, so some of these questions have answers,
[01:09:07.540 --> 01:09:09.380]   they've been studied, others do not.
[01:09:09.380 --> 01:09:11.780]   And especially if it becomes stochastic,
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:13.220]   especially if there's large numbers
[01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:14.420]   of decentralized things,
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:16.780]   there's just, you know, young people getting in this field
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:17.780]   who kind of think it's all done
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:19.700]   because we have, you know, TensorFlow.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:21.920]   Well, no, these are all open problems,
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.540]   and they're really important and interesting.
[01:09:23.540 --> 01:09:25.060]   And it's about strategic settings.
[01:09:25.060 --> 01:09:26.380]   How do I collect data?
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:27.980]   Suppose I don't know what you're gonna do
[01:09:27.980 --> 01:09:29.860]   'cause I don't know you very well, right?
[01:09:29.860 --> 01:09:31.060]   Well, I gotta collect data about you.
[01:09:31.060 --> 01:09:33.200]   So maybe I wanna push you in a part of the space
[01:09:33.200 --> 01:09:35.580]   where I don't know much about you so I can get data.
[01:09:35.580 --> 01:09:38.540]   And then later I'll realize that you'll never go there
[01:09:38.540 --> 01:09:39.740]   'cause of the way the game is set up.
[01:09:39.740 --> 01:09:41.580]   But you know, that's part of the overall,
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:43.780]   you know, data analysis context.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:46.340]   - Even the game of poker is a fascinating space.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.540]   Whenever there's any uncertainty,
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:50.820]   a lack of information, it's a super exciting space.
[01:09:50.820 --> 01:09:52.300]   - Yeah.
[01:09:52.300 --> 01:09:55.340]   - Just lingering on optimization for a second.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.860]   So if we look at deep learning,
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.500]   it's essentially minimization
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:01.460]   of a complicated loss function.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.100]   So is there something insightful or hopeful
[01:10:04.100 --> 01:10:07.500]   that you see in the kinds of function surface
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:09.580]   that loss functions, that deep learning
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:13.780]   in the real world is trying to optimize over?
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:15.380]   Is there something interesting?
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:18.860]   Is it just the usual kind of problems of optimization?
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.940]   - I think from an optimization point of view,
[01:10:21.940 --> 01:10:24.060]   that surface virtual, it's pretty smooth.
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:28.060]   And secondly, if it's over parameterized,
[01:10:28.060 --> 01:10:31.340]   there's kind of lots of paths down to reasonable optima.
[01:10:31.340 --> 01:10:34.500]   And so kind of the getting downhill to an optima
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:37.180]   is viewed as not as hard as you might have expected
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:38.380]   in high dimensions.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:42.300]   The fact that some optima tend to be really good ones
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.380]   and others not so good, and you tend to,
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.660]   sometimes you find the good ones
[01:10:45.660 --> 01:10:48.320]   is sort of still needs explanation.
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:50.380]   - Yes, that's a total mystery.
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:51.940]   - But the particular surface is coming
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:53.580]   from the particular generation of neural nets,
[01:10:53.580 --> 01:10:56.180]   I kind of suspect those will change.
[01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:58.420]   In 10 years, it will not be exactly those surfaces,
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.780]   there'll be some others that are,
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.380]   and optimization theory will help contribute
[01:11:01.380 --> 01:11:03.880]   to why other surfaces or why other algorithms.
[01:11:03.880 --> 01:11:07.220]   Layers of arithmetic operations
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.820]   with a little bit of non-linearity,
[01:11:08.820 --> 01:11:10.980]   that's not, that didn't come from neuroscience per se.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.260]   I mean, maybe in the minds of some of the people
[01:11:12.260 --> 01:11:13.580]   working on it, they were thinking,
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.700]   you know, about brains, but they were arithmetic circuits
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.260]   in all kinds of fields, you know,
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:20.340]   computer science control theory and so on.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:22.620]   And that layers of these could transform things
[01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:24.580]   in certain ways, and that if it's smooth,
[01:11:24.580 --> 01:11:27.660]   maybe you could find parameter values,
[01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:32.060]   you know, is a sort of big discovery
[01:11:32.060 --> 01:11:34.860]   that it's working, it's able to work at this scale.
[01:11:34.860 --> 01:11:38.600]   But I don't think that we're stuck with that,
[01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.060]   and we're certainly not stuck with that
[01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.020]   'cause we're understanding the brain.
[01:11:42.020 --> 01:11:44.020]   - So in terms of, on the algorithm side,
[01:11:44.020 --> 01:11:46.420]   sort of gradient descent, do you think we're stuck
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:49.180]   with gradient descent, is variance of it,
[01:11:49.180 --> 01:11:50.900]   what variance do you find interesting,
[01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.380]   or do you think there'll be something else
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:56.940]   invented that is able to walk all over
[01:11:56.940 --> 01:11:59.580]   these optimization spaces in more interesting ways?
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:01.820]   - So there's a co-design of the surface,
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:04.580]   and there are the architecture and the algorithm.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.860]   So if you just ask if we stay with the kind
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:07.940]   of architectures that we have now,
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:10.100]   not just neural nets, but, you know,
[01:12:10.100 --> 01:12:11.500]   phase retrieval architectures,
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.740]   or matrix completion architectures and so on,
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:16.540]   you know, I think we've kind of come to a place
[01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:19.660]   where, yeah, a stochastic gradient algorithms
[01:12:19.660 --> 01:12:23.220]   are dominant, and there are versions,
[01:12:23.220 --> 01:12:25.780]   you know, that are a little better than others,
[01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:27.700]   they, you know, have more guarantees,
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:29.140]   they're more robust, and so on,
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:31.100]   and there's ongoing research to kind of figure out
[01:12:31.100 --> 01:12:34.140]   which is the best algorithm for which situation.
[01:12:34.140 --> 01:12:35.740]   But I think that that'll start to co-evolve,
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:37.780]   that that'll put pressure on the actual architecture,
[01:12:37.780 --> 01:12:39.540]   and so we shouldn't do it in this particular way,
[01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:40.700]   we should do it in a different way,
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.100]   'cause this other algorithm is now available
[01:12:42.100 --> 01:12:43.700]   if you do it in a different way.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:48.660]   So that I can't really anticipate,
[01:12:48.660 --> 01:12:51.100]   that co-evolution process, but, you know,
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.340]   gradients are amazing mathematical objects,
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:58.820]   they have a lot of people who sort of study them
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.500]   more deeply mathematically, are kind of shocked
[01:13:01.500 --> 01:13:03.620]   about what they are and what they can do.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:05.780]   I mean, think about it this way,
[01:13:05.780 --> 01:13:07.140]   if, suppose that I tell you,
[01:13:07.140 --> 01:13:10.500]   if you move along the x-axis, you get, you know,
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:13.340]   you go uphill in some objective by, you know, three units,
[01:13:13.340 --> 01:13:15.380]   whereas if you move along the y-axis,
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.940]   you go uphill by seven units, right?
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:19.820]   Now I'm gonna only allow you to move a certain,
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:22.260]   you know, unit distance, all right?
[01:13:22.260 --> 01:13:23.300]   What are you gonna do?
[01:13:23.300 --> 01:13:25.540]   Well, the most people will say,
[01:13:25.540 --> 01:13:26.620]   I'm gonna go along the y-axis,
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.580]   I'm getting the biggest bang for my buck,
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.140]   you know, and my buck is only one unit,
[01:13:30.140 --> 01:13:33.420]   so I'm gonna put all of it in the y-axis, right?
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:37.140]   And why should I even take any of my strength,
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:39.420]   my step size, and put any of it in the x-axis,
[01:13:39.420 --> 01:13:41.380]   'cause I'm getting less bang for my buck?
[01:13:41.380 --> 01:13:45.100]   That seems like a completely, you know, clear argument,
[01:13:45.100 --> 01:13:47.460]   and it's wrong, 'cause the gradient direction
[01:13:47.460 --> 01:13:49.180]   is not to go along the y-axis,
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.660]   it's to take a little bit of the x-axis.
[01:13:51.660 --> 01:13:55.140]   And that, to understand that, you have to know some math,
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:58.340]   and so even a, you know, a trivial,
[01:13:58.340 --> 01:14:00.300]   so-called operator-like gradient is not trivial,
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:02.220]   and so, you know, exploiting its properties
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:03.900]   is still very, very important.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.260]   Now we know that just periodic descent
[01:14:05.260 --> 01:14:06.300]   has got all kinds of problems.
[01:14:06.300 --> 01:14:07.500]   It gets stuck in many ways,
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:08.820]   and it doesn't have, you know,
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:10.820]   good dimension dependence and so on.
[01:14:10.820 --> 01:14:13.060]   So my own line of work recently
[01:14:13.060 --> 01:14:15.460]   has been about what kinds of stochasticity,
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:16.740]   how can we get dimension dependence,
[01:14:16.740 --> 01:14:19.100]   how can we do the theory of that?
[01:14:19.100 --> 01:14:20.660]   And we've come up with pretty favorable results
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:22.580]   with certain kinds of stochasticity.
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:24.740]   We have sufficient conditions, generally.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.700]   We know if you do this, we will give you a good guarantee.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:29.980]   We don't have necessary conditions
[01:14:29.980 --> 01:14:32.140]   that it must be done a certain way in general.
[01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:35.020]   - So stochasticity, how much randomness to inject
[01:14:35.020 --> 01:14:38.220]   into the walking along the gradient?
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.860]   - And what kind of randomness?
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:42.140]   - Why is randomness good in this process?
[01:14:42.140 --> 01:14:44.220]   Why is stochasticity good?
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:46.700]   - Yeah, so I can give you simple answers,
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.700]   but in some sense, again, it's kind of amazing.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:52.660]   Stochasticity just, you know,
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:55.420]   particular features of a surface that could have hurt you
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:14:58.020]   if you were doing one thing deterministically
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.380]   won't hurt you because, you know, by chance,
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:03.260]   you know, there's very little chance that you would get hurt.
[01:15:03.260 --> 01:15:08.260]   And, you know, so here stochasticity, you know,
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:10.820]   it just kind of saves you
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:14.260]   from some of the particular features of surfaces that,
[01:15:14.260 --> 01:15:17.220]   you know, in fact, if you think about, you know,
[01:15:17.220 --> 01:15:19.300]   surfaces that are discontinuous in a first derivative,
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:21.940]   like, you know, absolute value function,
[01:15:21.940 --> 01:15:23.500]   you will go down and hit that point
[01:15:23.500 --> 01:15:25.260]   where there's non-differentiability, right?
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:27.220]   And if you're running a deterministic algorithm,
[01:15:27.220 --> 01:15:30.060]   at that point, you can really do something bad, right?
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:32.140]   Whereas stochasticity just means it's pretty unlikely
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:35.620]   that's gonna happen, that you're gonna hit that point.
[01:15:35.620 --> 01:15:37.940]   So, you know, it's again, non-trivial to analyze,
[01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:41.740]   but especially in higher dimensions, also stochasticity,
[01:15:41.740 --> 01:15:43.260]   our intuition isn't very good about it,
[01:15:43.260 --> 01:15:45.540]   but it has properties that kind of are very appealing
[01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:49.140]   in high dimensions for kind of law of large number reasons.
[01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:51.340]   So it's all part of the mathematics,
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:52.600]   that's what's fun to work in the field
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:55.300]   is that you get to try to understand this mathematics.
[01:15:55.300 --> 01:15:58.580]   But long story short, you know,
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:16:00.920]   partly empirically it was discovered stochastic gradient
[01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:02.500]   is very effective in theory,
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.060]   kind of followed, I'd say, that,
[01:16:05.060 --> 01:16:07.860]   but I don't see that we're getting clearly out of that.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:11.580]   - What's the most beautiful, mysterious,
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:15.580]   or profound idea to you in optimization?
[01:16:15.580 --> 01:16:18.580]   - I don't know the most, but let me just say that,
[01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:21.620]   you know, Nesterov's work on Nesterov acceleration to me
[01:16:21.620 --> 01:16:24.660]   is pretty surprising and pretty deep.
[01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:27.260]   - Can you elaborate?
[01:16:27.260 --> 01:16:29.980]   - Well, Nesterov acceleration is just that,
[01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:32.300]   suppose that we are gonna use gradients
[01:16:32.300 --> 01:16:34.260]   to move around into space, for the reasons I've alluded to,
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.020]   there are nice directions to move.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:38.580]   And suppose that I tell you
[01:16:38.580 --> 01:16:40.140]   that you're only allowed to use gradients,
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.740]   you're not gonna be allowed to,
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.820]   you see this local person that can only sense
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:46.300]   kind of a change in the surface.
[01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:48.940]   But I'm gonna give you kind of a computer
[01:16:48.940 --> 01:16:50.860]   that's able to store all your previous gradients,
[01:16:50.860 --> 01:16:53.860]   and so you start to learn something about the surface.
[01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:57.180]   And I'm gonna restrict you to maybe move in the direction
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.300]   of like a linear span of all the gradients,
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:00.260]   so you can't kind of just move
[01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:02.740]   in some arbitrary direction, right?
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.620]   So now we have a well-defined mathematical complexity model,
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:07.980]   there's a certain classes of algorithms that can do that,
[01:17:07.980 --> 01:17:09.020]   and others that can't.
[01:17:09.180 --> 01:17:11.340]   And we can ask for certain kinds of surfaces,
[01:17:11.340 --> 01:17:13.700]   how fast can you get down to the optimum?
[01:17:13.700 --> 01:17:14.900]   So there's answers to these,
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:19.460]   so for a smooth convex function, there's an answer,
[01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:22.020]   which is one over the number of steps squared,
[01:17:22.020 --> 01:17:24.380]   is that you will be within a ball of that size
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.140]   after K steps.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:31.420]   Gradient descent in particular has a slower rate,
[01:17:31.420 --> 01:17:33.780]   it's one over K, okay?
[01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:37.380]   So you could ask, is gradient descent actually,
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.900]   even though we know it's a good algorithm,
[01:17:38.900 --> 01:17:40.220]   is it the best algorithm?
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:42.140]   And the answer is no.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.820]   Well, not clear yet,
[01:17:43.820 --> 01:17:47.180]   because one over K squared is a lower bound,
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:49.580]   that's provably the best you can do,
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.620]   gradient is one over K, but is there something better?
[01:17:52.620 --> 01:17:55.420]   And so I think it's a surprise to most,
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:58.100]   though Nesterov discovered a new algorithm
[01:17:58.100 --> 01:18:01.260]   that has got two pieces to it, it uses two gradients,
[01:18:01.260 --> 01:18:06.260]   and puts those together in a certain kind of obscure way,
[01:18:06.260 --> 01:18:09.260]   and the thing doesn't even move downhill all the time,
[01:18:09.260 --> 01:18:11.460]   it sometimes goes back uphill.
[01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:13.100]   And if you're a physicist, that kind of makes some sense,
[01:18:13.100 --> 01:18:14.540]   you're building up some momentum,
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:16.380]   and that is kind of the right intuition,
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.060]   but that intuition is not enough to understand
[01:18:19.060 --> 01:18:21.020]   kind of how to do it and why it works.
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.580]   But it does, it achieves one over K squared,
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:26.940]   and it has a mathematical structure,
[01:18:26.940 --> 01:18:28.620]   and it's still kind of, to this day,
[01:18:28.620 --> 01:18:29.660]   a lot of us are writing papers
[01:18:29.660 --> 01:18:32.460]   and trying to explore that and understand it.
[01:18:32.460 --> 01:18:35.100]   So there are lots of cool ideas in optimization,
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:37.380]   but just kind of using gradients, I think, is number one,
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:41.500]   that goes back 150 years, and then Nesterov, I think,
[01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:43.460]   has made a major contribution with this idea.
[01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:45.220]   - So like you said, gradients themselves
[01:18:45.220 --> 01:18:47.460]   are in some sense mysterious.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:48.300]   - Yeah.
[01:18:48.300 --> 01:18:50.220]   - They're not as trivial as--
[01:18:50.220 --> 01:18:51.060]   - Not as trivial.
[01:18:51.060 --> 01:18:51.900]   - Mathematically speaking.
[01:18:51.900 --> 01:18:54.020]   - Coordinate descent is more of a trivial one,
[01:18:54.020 --> 01:18:55.300]   you just pick one of the coordinates--
[01:18:55.300 --> 01:18:56.900]   - That's how we think, that's how our human minds--
[01:18:56.900 --> 01:18:58.020]   - That's how our human minds think,
[01:18:58.020 --> 01:18:59.980]   and gradients are not that easy
[01:18:59.980 --> 01:19:01.780]   for our human mind to grapple with.
[01:19:03.180 --> 01:19:07.140]   - An absurd question, but what is statistics?
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:09.780]   - So here it's a little bit,
[01:19:09.780 --> 01:19:12.100]   it's somewhere between math and science and technology,
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:13.340]   it's somewhere in that convex hole.
[01:19:13.340 --> 01:19:15.900]   So it's a set of principles that allow you
[01:19:15.900 --> 01:19:18.820]   to make inferences that have got some reason to be believed,
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:21.340]   and also principles that allow you to make decisions
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:23.300]   where you can have some reason to believe
[01:19:23.300 --> 01:19:25.020]   you're not gonna make errors.
[01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:26.460]   So all of that requires some assumptions
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:27.540]   about what do you mean by an error,
[01:19:27.540 --> 01:19:30.060]   what do you mean by the probabilities,
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:34.260]   but after you start making some of those assumptions,
[01:19:34.260 --> 01:19:37.900]   you're led to conclusions that yes,
[01:19:37.900 --> 01:19:40.700]   I can guarantee that if you do this in this way,
[01:19:40.700 --> 01:19:43.460]   your probability of making an error will be small.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:46.100]   Your probability of continuing to not make errors
[01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:47.580]   over time will be small,
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:50.420]   and probability you found something that's real
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:52.580]   will be small, will be high.
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.460]   - So decision making is a big part of that.
[01:19:54.460 --> 01:19:55.660]   - Decision making is a big part, yeah.
[01:19:55.660 --> 01:19:58.460]   So the original, so statistics,
[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:01.220]   short history was that it goes back,
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:04.860]   as a formal discipline, 250 years or so.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:06.420]   It was called inverse probability,
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:09.740]   because around that era, probability was developed
[01:20:09.740 --> 01:20:13.300]   especially to explain gambling situations.
[01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:15.340]   - Of course, interesting.
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:18.180]   - So you would say, well, given the state of nature is this,
[01:20:18.180 --> 01:20:19.140]   there's a certain roulette board
[01:20:19.140 --> 01:20:20.860]   that has a certain mechanism in it,
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:23.420]   what kind of outcomes do I expect to see?
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:26.820]   And especially if I do things long amounts of time,
[01:20:26.820 --> 01:20:27.660]   what outcomes will I see?
[01:20:27.660 --> 01:20:30.500]   And the physicists started to pay attention to this.
[01:20:30.500 --> 01:20:31.940]   And then people said, well, given,
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:33.380]   let's turn the problem around.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.260]   What if I saw certain outcomes,
[01:20:35.260 --> 01:20:37.340]   could I infer what the underlying mechanism was?
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:38.420]   That's an inverse problem.
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:39.860]   And in fact, for quite a while,
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:41.900]   statistics was called inverse probability.
[01:20:41.900 --> 01:20:43.820]   That was the name of the field.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:47.340]   And I believe that it was Laplace
[01:20:47.340 --> 01:20:49.420]   who was working in Napoleon's government,
[01:20:49.420 --> 01:20:53.020]   who needed to do a census of France,
[01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:54.220]   learn about the people there.
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:55.900]   So he went and got and gathered data,
[01:20:55.900 --> 01:20:59.940]   and he analyzed that data to determine policy,
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.820]   and said, well, let's call this field
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.540]   that does this kind of thing statistics,
[01:21:04.540 --> 01:21:07.340]   'cause the word state is in there.
[01:21:07.340 --> 01:21:08.620]   In French, that's état,
[01:21:08.620 --> 01:21:11.920]   but it's the study of data for the state.
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:14.580]   So anyway, that caught on,
[01:21:14.580 --> 01:21:17.100]   and it's been called statistics ever since.
[01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:20.420]   But by the time it got formalized,
[01:21:20.420 --> 01:21:21.860]   it was sort of in the 30s.
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:24.340]   And around that time,
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:27.340]   there was game theory and decision theory developed nearby.
[01:21:27.340 --> 01:21:29.780]   People in that era didn't think of themselves
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.620]   as either computer science or statistics
[01:21:31.620 --> 01:21:32.620]   or control or econ.
[01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.380]   They were all of the above.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:36.540]   And so, von Neumann is developing game theory,
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:39.180]   but also thinking of that as decision theory.
[01:21:39.180 --> 01:21:42.420]   Wald is an econometrician developing decision theory,
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.820]   and then turning that into statistics.
[01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:45.980]   And so it's all about,
[01:21:45.980 --> 01:21:48.740]   here's not just data and you analyze it.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:50.100]   Here's a loss function.
[01:21:50.100 --> 01:21:50.940]   Here's what you care about.
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.860]   Here's the question you're trying to ask.
[01:21:52.860 --> 01:21:54.780]   Here is a probability model,
[01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:56.340]   and here is the risk you will face
[01:21:56.340 --> 01:21:57.900]   if you make certain decisions.
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:02.960]   And to this day, in most advanced statistical curricula,
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:05.300]   you teach decision theory as the starting point.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:07.300]   And then it branches out into the two branches
[01:22:07.300 --> 01:22:08.380]   of Bayesian and Frequentist.
[01:22:08.380 --> 01:22:10.500]   But it's all about decisions.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:16.180]   - In statistics, what is the most beautiful,
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:20.060]   mysterious, maybe surprising idea that you've come across?
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.280]   - Yeah, good question.
[01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:27.500]   I mean, there's a bunch of surprising ones.
[01:22:27.500 --> 01:22:29.540]   There's something that's way too technical for this thing,
[01:22:29.540 --> 01:22:31.380]   but something called James Stein estimation,
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:33.500]   which is kind of surprising
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:35.900]   and really takes time to wrap your head around.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:37.100]   - Can you try to maybe--
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:39.900]   - Nah, I think I don't even wanna try.
[01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:41.980]   Let me just say a colleague,
[01:22:41.980 --> 01:22:43.460]   Stephen Stickler at University of Chicago
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:45.940]   wrote a really beautiful paper on James Stein estimation,
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:48.380]   which just helps to, it's viewed as a paradox.
[01:22:48.380 --> 01:22:50.600]   It kind of defeats the mind's attempts to understand it,
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:53.560]   but you can, and Steve has a nice perspective on that.
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:58.360]   So one of the troubles with statistics
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:23:00.700]   is that it's like in physics, or in quantum physics,
[01:23:00.700 --> 01:23:02.420]   you have multiple interpretations.
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:04.700]   There's a wave and particle duality in physics.
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:07.220]   And you get used to that over time,
[01:23:07.220 --> 01:23:08.500]   but it still kind of haunts you
[01:23:08.500 --> 01:23:11.660]   that you don't really quite understand the relationship.
[01:23:11.660 --> 01:23:14.020]   The electron's a wave and electron's a particle.
[01:23:14.020 --> 01:23:16.660]   Well, the same thing happens here.
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:19.060]   There's Bayesian ways of thinking in Frequentist,
[01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:20.420]   and they are different.
[01:23:20.420 --> 01:23:23.780]   They sometimes become sort of the same in practice,
[01:23:23.780 --> 01:23:24.880]   but they are physically different.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.600]   And then in some practice, they are not the same at all.
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:30.360]   They give you rather different answers.
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:32.920]   And so it is very much like wave and particle duality,
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:34.280]   and that is something you have to kind of
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:35.720]   get used to in the field.
[01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.600]   - Can you define Bayesian in Frequentist?
[01:23:37.600 --> 01:23:38.860]   - Yeah, in decision theory, you can make,
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:41.240]   I have a video that people could see.
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:43.200]   It's called Are You a Bayesian or a Frequentist?
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:45.980]   And kind of help try to make it really clear.
[01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:47.060]   It comes from decision theory.
[01:23:47.060 --> 01:23:51.300]   So, decision theory, you're talking about loss functions,
[01:23:51.300 --> 01:23:55.180]   which are a function of data X and parameter theta.
[01:23:55.180 --> 01:23:56.980]   They're a function of two arguments.
[01:23:56.980 --> 01:23:59.820]   Neither one of those arguments is known.
[01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:02.820]   You don't know the data a priori, it's random,
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.380]   and the parameter's unknown.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.220]   So you have this function of two things you don't know,
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.180]   and you're trying to say, I want that function to be small.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.240]   I want small loss.
[01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:13.340]   Well, what are you gonna do?
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.100]   So you sort of say, well, I'm gonna average
[01:24:15.100 --> 01:24:17.900]   over these quantities or maximize over them or something
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:21.940]   so that I turn that uncertainty into something certain.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:25.380]   So you could look at the first argument and average over it,
[01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:26.900]   or you could look at the second argument, average over it.
[01:24:26.900 --> 01:24:27.900]   That's Bayesian Frequentist.
[01:24:27.900 --> 01:24:32.140]   So the Frequentist says, I'm gonna look at the X, the data,
[01:24:32.140 --> 01:24:33.660]   and I'm gonna take that as random,
[01:24:33.660 --> 01:24:35.220]   and I'm gonna average over the distribution.
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:38.540]   So I take the expectation of loss under X.
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:40.540]   Theta's held fixed, right?
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:41.980]   That's called the risk.
[01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:44.980]   And so it's looking at all the datasets you could get,
[01:24:44.980 --> 01:24:48.140]   and saying how well will a certain procedure do
[01:24:48.140 --> 01:24:50.020]   under all those datasets?
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:52.500]   That's called a Frequentist guarantee.
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:54.080]   So I think it is very appropriate
[01:24:54.080 --> 01:24:55.900]   when you're building a piece of software,
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.000]   and you're shipping it out there,
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:59.200]   and people are using it on all kinds of datasets.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.860]   You wanna have a stamp, a guarantee on it
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.660]   that has people running on many, many datasets
[01:25:02.660 --> 01:25:03.700]   that you never even thought about,
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:06.180]   that 95% of the time it will do the right thing.
[01:25:06.180 --> 01:25:08.440]   Perfectly reasonable.
[01:25:08.440 --> 01:25:11.720]   The Bayesian perspective says, well, no,
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:13.700]   I'm gonna look at the other argument of the loss function,
[01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:14.980]   the theta part, okay?
[01:25:14.980 --> 01:25:17.500]   That's unknown, and I'm uncertain about it.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:20.700]   So I could have my own personal probability for what it is.
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:22.140]   How many tall people are there out there?
[01:25:22.140 --> 01:25:24.020]   I'm trying to infer the average height of the population.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:27.320]   Well, I have an idea of roughly what the height is.
[01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:32.060]   So I'm gonna average over the theta.
[01:25:32.060 --> 01:25:35.420]   So now that loss function has only now, again,
[01:25:35.420 --> 01:25:37.100]   one argument's gone.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:38.780]   Now it's a function of X.
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:40.340]   And that's what a Bayesian does, is they say,
[01:25:40.340 --> 01:25:42.340]   well, let's just focus on a particular X we got,
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:44.940]   the dataset we got, we condition on that.
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:48.100]   Condition on the X, I say something about my loss.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:50.300]   That's a Bayesian approach to things.
[01:25:50.300 --> 01:25:53.220]   And the Bayesian will argue that it's not relevant
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:25:55.840]   to look at all the other datasets you could have gotten
[01:25:55.840 --> 01:25:58.640]   and average over them, the frequentist approach.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.940]   It's really only the datasets you got, all right?
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:03.500]   And I do agree with that,
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:05.140]   especially in situations where you're working
[01:26:05.140 --> 01:26:07.540]   with a scientist, you can learn a lot about the domain,
[01:26:07.540 --> 01:26:09.540]   and you're really only focused on certain kinds of data,
[01:26:09.540 --> 01:26:12.280]   and you've gathered your data, and you make inferences.
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:15.940]   I don't agree with it though, in the sense that
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:18.100]   there are needs for frequentist guarantees.
[01:26:18.100 --> 01:26:19.940]   You're writing software, people are using it out there,
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:20.820]   you wanna say something.
[01:26:20.820 --> 01:26:23.220]   So these two things have got to fight each other a little bit
[01:26:23.220 --> 01:26:24.780]   but they have to blend.
[01:26:24.780 --> 01:26:26.700]   So long story short, there's a set of ideas
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:27.540]   that are right in the middle,
[01:26:27.540 --> 01:26:29.540]   that are called empirical Bayes.
[01:26:29.540 --> 01:26:31.500]   And empirical Bayes sort of starts
[01:26:31.500 --> 01:26:33.540]   with the Bayesian framework.
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:37.340]   It's kind of arguably philosophically more,
[01:26:38.300 --> 01:26:40.420]   reasonable and kosher.
[01:26:40.420 --> 01:26:43.380]   Write down a bunch of the math that kind of flows from that,
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:45.340]   and then realize there's a bunch of things you don't know,
[01:26:45.340 --> 01:26:46.660]   because it's the real world,
[01:26:46.660 --> 01:26:47.940]   and you don't know everything,
[01:26:47.940 --> 01:26:50.060]   so you're uncertain about certain quantities.
[01:26:50.060 --> 01:26:52.100]   At that point ask, is there a reasonable way
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.740]   to plug in an estimate for those things?
[01:26:54.740 --> 01:26:56.500]   Okay, and in some cases,
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.780]   there's quite a reasonable thing to do, to plug in.
[01:26:59.780 --> 01:27:01.740]   There's a natural thing you can observe in the world
[01:27:01.740 --> 01:27:03.140]   that you can plug in,
[01:27:03.140 --> 01:27:04.620]   and then do a little bit more mathematics
[01:27:04.620 --> 01:27:06.340]   and assure yourself it's really good.
[01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:08.700]   - So based on math or based on human expertise,
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:09.980]   what are good--
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:10.820]   - They're both going in.
[01:27:10.820 --> 01:27:11.860]   The Bayesian framework allows you
[01:27:11.860 --> 01:27:13.660]   to put a lot of human expertise in.
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:17.820]   But the math kind of guides you along that path,
[01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:18.980]   and then kind of reassures you at the end,
[01:27:18.980 --> 01:27:20.460]   you could put that stamp of approval.
[01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.660]   Under certain assumptions, this thing will work.
[01:27:22.660 --> 01:27:24.780]   So you asked the question, what's my favorite,
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:26.020]   what's the most surprising nice idea?
[01:27:26.020 --> 01:27:27.620]   So one that is more accessible
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:29.620]   is something called false discovery rate,
[01:27:29.620 --> 01:27:34.380]   which is you're making not just one hypothesis test,
[01:27:34.380 --> 01:27:35.300]   you're making one decision,
[01:27:35.300 --> 01:27:37.020]   you're making a whole bag of them.
[01:27:37.020 --> 01:27:39.300]   And in that bag of decisions,
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.100]   you look at the ones where you made a discovery,
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:43.740]   you announced that something interesting had happened.
[01:27:43.740 --> 01:27:46.980]   All right, that's gonna be some subset of your big bag.
[01:27:46.980 --> 01:27:48.420]   In the ones you made a discovery,
[01:27:48.420 --> 01:27:50.660]   which subset of those are bad,
[01:27:50.660 --> 01:27:53.180]   there are false, false discoveries.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:55.080]   You'd like the fraction of your false discoveries
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:57.460]   among your discoveries to be small.
[01:27:57.460 --> 01:28:00.740]   That's a different criterion than accuracy or precision
[01:28:00.740 --> 01:28:02.780]   or recall or sensitivity and specificity.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:04.700]   It's a different quantity.
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:06.740]   Those latter ones are almost all of them
[01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.900]   have more of a frequentist flavor.
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:13.700]   They say, given the truth is that the null hypothesis is true
[01:28:13.700 --> 01:28:15.700]   here's what accuracy I would get.
[01:28:15.700 --> 01:28:17.060]   Or given that the alternative is true,
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:18.500]   here's what I would get.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:19.580]   So it's kind of going forward
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:22.300]   from the state of nature to the data.
[01:28:22.300 --> 01:28:23.760]   The Bayesian goes the other direction
[01:28:23.760 --> 01:28:25.780]   from the data back to the state of nature.
[01:28:25.780 --> 01:28:28.100]   And that's actually what false discovery rate is.
[01:28:28.100 --> 01:28:30.540]   It says, given you made a discovery,
[01:28:30.540 --> 01:28:32.500]   okay, that's conditioned on your data,
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:34.940]   what's the probability of the hypothesis?
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.500]   It's going the other direction.
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.500]   And so the classical frequency look at that.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:42.440]   So I can't know that there's some priors needed in that.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:45.820]   And the empirical Bayesian goes ahead and plows forward
[01:28:45.820 --> 01:28:47.580]   and starts writing down these formulas
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:49.300]   and realizes at some point,
[01:28:49.300 --> 01:28:50.820]   some of those things can actually be estimated
[01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:52.500]   in a reasonable way.
[01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:54.180]   And so it's a beautiful set of ideas.
[01:28:54.180 --> 01:28:56.580]   So this kind of line of argument has come out.
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:28:57.860]   It's not certainly mine,
[01:28:57.860 --> 01:29:02.260]   but it sort of came out from Robbins around 1960.
[01:29:02.260 --> 01:29:04.980]   Brad Efron has written beautifully about this
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.260]   in various papers and books.
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:11.260]   And the FDR is, you know, Ben Yamini in Israel,
[01:29:11.260 --> 01:29:14.700]   John Story did this Bayesian interpretation and so on.
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:16.940]   So I've just absorbed these things over the years
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:19.840]   and find it a very healthy way to think about statistics.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:23.220]   - Let me ask you about intelligence
[01:29:23.220 --> 01:29:28.180]   to jump slightly back out into philosophy, perhaps.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.080]   You said that, maybe you can elaborate,
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:33.980]   but you said that defining just even the question
[01:29:33.980 --> 01:29:38.720]   of what is intelligence is a very difficult question.
[01:29:38.720 --> 01:29:40.020]   Is it a useful question?
[01:29:40.020 --> 01:29:41.900]   Do you think we'll one day understand
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:44.800]   the fundamentals of human intelligence and what it means?
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:50.800]   You know, have good benchmarks for general intelligence
[01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.420]   that we put before our machines.
[01:29:53.420 --> 01:29:55.380]   - So I don't work on these topics so much.
[01:29:55.380 --> 01:29:58.500]   You're really asking a question for a psychologist, really.
[01:29:58.500 --> 01:30:00.900]   And I studied some, but I don't consider myself
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:03.400]   at least an expert at this point.
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:06.120]   You know, a psychologist aims to understand
[01:30:06.120 --> 01:30:07.560]   human intelligence, right?
[01:30:07.560 --> 01:30:09.560]   And I think many psychologists I know
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:10.800]   are fairly humble about this.
[01:30:10.800 --> 01:30:14.040]   They might try to understand how a baby understands,
[01:30:14.040 --> 01:30:16.000]   you know, whether something's a solid or liquid
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.400]   or whether something's hidden or not.
[01:30:18.400 --> 01:30:22.880]   And maybe how a child starts to learn the meaning
[01:30:22.880 --> 01:30:25.040]   of certain words, what's a verb, what's a noun,
[01:30:25.040 --> 01:30:27.700]   and also, you know, slowly but surely
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:29.220]   trying to figure out things.
[01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:33.300]   But humans' ability to take a really complicated
[01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:35.860]   environment, reason about it, abstract about it,
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:39.200]   find the right abstractions, communicate about it,
[01:30:39.200 --> 01:30:41.840]   interact, and so on, is just, you know,
[01:30:41.840 --> 01:30:45.300]   really staggeringly rich and complicated.
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:49.060]   And so, you know, I think in all humility,
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:51.380]   we don't think we're kind of aiming for that
[01:30:51.380 --> 01:30:52.300]   in the near future.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:54.040]   And certainly a psychologist doing experiments
[01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:56.660]   with babies in the lab or with people talking
[01:30:56.660 --> 01:30:58.680]   has a much more limited aspiration.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:00.300]   And, you know, Kahneman-Dvorsky would look
[01:31:00.300 --> 01:31:02.600]   at our reasoning patterns, and they're not deeply
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:04.660]   understanding all the how we do our reasoning,
[01:31:04.660 --> 01:31:06.500]   but they're sort of saying, "Here's some oddities
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:08.580]   "about the reasoning and some things you need
[01:31:08.580 --> 01:31:09.420]   "to think about it."
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.180]   But also, as I emphasize in some things I've been writing
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:15.500]   about, you know, AI, the revolution hasn't happened yet.
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:17.240]   - Yeah, great blog post.
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:19.860]   - I've been emphasizing that, you know,
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.660]   if you step back and look at intelligent systems
[01:31:22.660 --> 01:31:24.900]   of any kind, whatever you mean by intelligence,
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:26.420]   it's not just the humans or the animals
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:29.400]   or, you know, the plants or whatever, you know.
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:31.880]   So a market that brings goods into a city, you know,
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:35.580]   food to restaurants or something every day is a system.
[01:31:35.580 --> 01:31:37.560]   It's a decentralized set of decisions.
[01:31:37.560 --> 01:31:38.840]   Looking at it from far enough away,
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.200]   it's just like a collection of neurons.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:42.740]   Every neuron is making its own little decisions,
[01:31:42.740 --> 01:31:44.340]   presumably in some way.
[01:31:44.340 --> 01:31:46.460]   And if you step back enough, every little part
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.220]   of an economic system is making all of its decisions.
[01:31:49.220 --> 01:31:51.180]   And just like with the brain, who knows what,
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:54.320]   an individual neuron doesn't know what the overall goal is,
[01:31:54.320 --> 01:31:56.360]   right, but something happens at some aggregate
[01:31:56.360 --> 01:31:58.320]   level, same thing with the economy.
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:01.240]   People eat in a city and it's robust.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:04.740]   It works at all scales, small villages to big cities.
[01:32:04.740 --> 01:32:07.040]   It's been working for thousands of years.
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:09.160]   It works rain or shine, so it's adaptive.
[01:32:09.160 --> 01:32:12.160]   So all the kind of, you know, those are adjectives
[01:32:12.160 --> 01:32:15.240]   one tends to apply to intelligent systems, robust,
[01:32:15.240 --> 01:32:17.840]   adaptive, you know, you don't need to keep adjusting it,
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.840]   self-healing, whatever, plus not perfect.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:22.440]   You know, intelligences are never perfect
[01:32:22.440 --> 01:32:24.560]   and markets are not perfect.
[01:32:24.560 --> 01:32:25.920]   But I do not believe in this era
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:28.240]   that you can say, well, our computers,
[01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.560]   our humans are smart, but no markets are not.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:33.000]   Well, markets are, so they are intelligent.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:37.960]   Now, we humans didn't evolve to be markets.
[01:32:37.960 --> 01:32:40.160]   We've been participating in them, right,
[01:32:40.160 --> 01:32:43.280]   but we are not ourselves a market per se.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.200]   - The neurons could be viewed as the market.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.840]   - You can, there's economic, you know,
[01:32:46.840 --> 01:32:48.080]   neuroscience kind of perspectives.
[01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.280]   That's interesting to pursue all that.
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:52.720]   The point, though, is that if you were to study humans
[01:32:52.720 --> 01:32:54.800]   and really be the world's best psychologist
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.840]   and study for thousands of years
[01:32:55.840 --> 01:32:57.440]   and come up with the theory of human intelligence,
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.440]   you might have never discovered principles of markets,
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.640]   you know, supply-demand curves and, you know,
[01:33:02.640 --> 01:33:04.840]   matching and auctions and all that.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:06.280]   Those are real principles and they lead
[01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.680]   to a form of intelligence
[01:33:07.680 --> 01:33:09.360]   that's not maybe human intelligence.
[01:33:09.360 --> 01:33:11.400]   It's arguably another kind of intelligence.
[01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:13.840]   There probably are third kinds of intelligence or fourth
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.960]   that none of us are really thinking
[01:33:14.960 --> 01:33:16.400]   too much about right now.
[01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:18.440]   So if you really, and all those are relevant
[01:33:18.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   to computer systems in the future.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:23.760]   Certainly the market one is relevant right now,
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:26.160]   whereas understanding human intelligence is not so clear
[01:33:26.160 --> 01:33:28.360]   that it's relevant right now, probably not.
[01:33:28.360 --> 01:33:30.920]   So if you want general intelligence,
[01:33:30.920 --> 01:33:31.960]   whatever one means by that,
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:34.640]   or understanding intelligence in a deep sense and all that,
[01:33:34.640 --> 01:33:37.560]   it definitely has to be not just human intelligence.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:39.080]   It's gotta be this broader thing.
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:40.160]   And that's not a mystery.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:41.240]   Markets are intelligent.
[01:33:41.240 --> 01:33:44.360]   So, you know, it's definitely not just a philosophical stance
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:45.960]   to say we gotta move beyond human intelligence.
[01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:48.240]   That sounds ridiculous, but it's not.
[01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:49.200]   - And in that block,
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.520]   well, as you define different kinds
[01:33:50.520 --> 01:33:52.760]   of like intelligent infrastructure, AI,
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.000]   which I really like,
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.920]   it's some of the concepts you've just been describing.
[01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.000]   Do you see ourselves,
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:02.600]   if we see Earth, human civilization as a single organism,
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.160]   do you think the intelligence of that organism,
[01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:07.040]   when you think from the perspective of markets
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:10.760]   and intelligence infrastructure is increasing?
[01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.320]   Is it increasing linearly?
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:14.080]   Is it increasing exponentially?
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:16.040]   What do you think the future of that intelligence?
[01:34:16.040 --> 01:34:16.880]   - I don't know.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.760]   I don't tend to think,
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:19.760]   I don't tend to answer questions like that
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:21.320]   'cause, you know, that's science fiction.
[01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:23.240]   - I was hoping to catch you off guard.
[01:34:23.240 --> 01:34:25.000]   (laughing)
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:28.120]   Well, again, because you said it's so far in the future,
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.320]   it's fun to ask and you'll probably, you know,
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:33.920]   like you said, predicting the future
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.200]   is really nearly impossible.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:38.960]   But say as an axiom,
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:41.760]   one day we create a human level,
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:43.440]   a superhuman level intelligent,
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.720]   not the scale of markets,
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:47.180]   but the scale of an individual.
[01:34:47.180 --> 01:34:48.480]   What do you think is,
[01:34:49.920 --> 01:34:51.680]   what do you think it would take to do that?
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:53.760]   Or maybe to ask another question
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:56.680]   is how would that system be different
[01:34:56.680 --> 01:34:59.720]   than the biological human beings
[01:34:59.720 --> 01:35:01.360]   that we see around us today?
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:04.200]   Is it possible to say anything interesting to that question
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:06.080]   or is it just a stupid question?
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:08.200]   - It's not a stupid question, but it's science fiction.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:09.040]   - Science fiction.
[01:35:09.040 --> 01:35:11.320]   - And so I'm totally happy to read science fiction
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.400]   and think about it from time of my own life.
[01:35:13.400 --> 01:35:16.200]   I love the, there was this like brain in a vat kind of,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.200]   you know, little thing that people were talking about
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:19.040]   when I was a student.
[01:35:19.040 --> 01:35:21.000]   I remember, you know, imagine that,
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.240]   you know, between your brain and your body,
[01:35:24.240 --> 01:35:26.400]   there's a bunch of wires, right?
[01:35:26.400 --> 01:35:28.040]   And suppose that every one of them
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:31.400]   was replaced with a literal wire.
[01:35:31.400 --> 01:35:32.640]   And then suppose that wire was turned
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.200]   into actually a little wireless, you know,
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:35.920]   there's a receiver and sender.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:38.400]   So the brain has got all the senders and receiver,
[01:35:38.400 --> 01:35:42.120]   you know, on all of its exiting, you know, axons
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.880]   and all the dendrites down in the body
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:45.840]   are replaced with senders and receivers.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:47.560]   Now you could move the body off somewhere
[01:35:47.560 --> 01:35:49.680]   and put the brain in a vat, right?
[01:35:49.680 --> 01:35:52.440]   And then you could do things like start killing off
[01:35:52.440 --> 01:35:54.440]   those senders and receivers one by one.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:55.720]   And after you've killed off all of them,
[01:35:55.720 --> 01:35:56.720]   where is that person?
[01:35:56.720 --> 01:35:58.280]   You know, they thought they were out in the body
[01:35:58.280 --> 01:35:59.760]   walking around the world and they moved on.
[01:35:59.760 --> 01:36:00.880]   So those are science fiction things.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:02.020]   Those are fun to think about.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.960]   It's just intriguing about what is thought,
[01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:05.440]   where is it and all that.
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:09.240]   And I think every 18 year old should take philosophy classes
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:10.560]   and think about these things.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:11.800]   And I think that everyone should think about
[01:36:11.800 --> 01:36:13.680]   what could happen in society that's kind of bad
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:14.520]   and all that.
[01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:15.800]   But I really don't think that's the right thing
[01:36:15.800 --> 01:36:18.160]   for most of us that are my age group to be doing
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:19.500]   and thinking about.
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:22.840]   I really think that we have so many more present,
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:26.360]   you know, first challenges and dangers
[01:36:26.360 --> 01:36:28.520]   and real things to build and all that,
[01:36:28.520 --> 01:36:32.040]   such that, you know, spending too much time
[01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:33.920]   on science fiction, at least in public for like this,
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:35.840]   I think is not what we should be doing.
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:37.440]   - Maybe over beers in private.
[01:36:37.440 --> 01:36:38.280]   - That's right.
[01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.100]   I'm well,
[01:36:39.100 --> 01:36:40.840]   (laughing)
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:42.440]   I'm not gonna broadcast where I have beers
[01:36:42.440 --> 01:36:43.720]   because this is gonna go on Facebook
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:45.320]   and I don't want a lot of people showing up there.
[01:36:45.320 --> 01:36:47.000]   But yeah.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.640]   - I love Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, YouTube.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:54.160]   I have, I'm optimistic and hopeful,
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:36:59.000]   but maybe I don't have grounds for such optimism and hope.
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:04.960]   Let me ask, you've mentored some of the brightest,
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:08.240]   sort of some of the seminal figures in the field.
[01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:13.240]   Can you give advice to people who are undergraduates today?
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.760]   What does it take to take, you know, advice on their journey
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:19.080]   if they're interested in machine learning and AI
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:23.720]   and in the ideas of markets from economics to psychology
[01:37:23.720 --> 01:37:25.520]   and all the kinds of things that you're exploring,
[01:37:25.520 --> 01:37:28.160]   what steps should they take on that journey?
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:29.400]   - Well, yeah, first of all, the door's open
[01:37:29.400 --> 01:37:30.360]   and second, it's a journey.
[01:37:30.360 --> 01:37:31.760]   I like your language there.
[01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:35.560]   It is not that you're so brilliant
[01:37:35.560 --> 01:37:36.760]   and you have great, brilliant ideas
[01:37:36.760 --> 01:37:38.760]   and therefore that's just, you know,
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:39.880]   that's how you have success
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:42.280]   or that's how you enter into the field.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.000]   It's that you apprentice yourself,
[01:37:44.000 --> 01:37:46.880]   you spend a lot of time, you work on hard things,
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:51.520]   you try and pull back and you be as broad as you can,
[01:37:51.520 --> 01:37:53.640]   you talk to lots of people.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:56.760]   And it's like entering any kind of a creative community.
[01:37:56.760 --> 01:37:59.080]   There's years that are needed
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.520]   and human connections are critical to it.
[01:38:01.520 --> 01:38:03.140]   So, you know, I think about, you know,
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:05.960]   being a musician or being an artist or something,
[01:38:05.960 --> 01:38:08.480]   you don't just, you know, immediately from day one,
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:11.120]   you know, you're a genius and therefore you do it.
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:16.120]   No, you, you know, practice really, really hard on basics
[01:38:16.120 --> 01:38:19.520]   and you be humble about where you are
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:21.600]   and then you realize you'll never be an expert
[01:38:21.600 --> 01:38:23.240]   on everything, so you kind of pick
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.400]   and there's a lot of randomness and a lot of kind of luck,
[01:38:27.400 --> 01:38:30.360]   but luck just kind of picks out which branch
[01:38:30.360 --> 01:38:33.800]   of the tree you go down, but you'll go down some branch.
[01:38:33.800 --> 01:38:35.400]   So yeah, it's a community.
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   So the graduate school is, I still think,
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.640]   is one of the wonderful phenomena
[01:38:38.640 --> 01:38:40.640]   that we have in our world.
[01:38:40.640 --> 01:38:43.080]   It's very much about apprenticeship with an advisor.
[01:38:43.080 --> 01:38:45.600]   It's very much about a group of people you belong to.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:46.960]   It's a four or five year process.
[01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:50.120]   So it's plenty of time to start from kind of nothing
[01:38:50.120 --> 01:38:52.520]   to come up to something, you know, more expertise
[01:38:52.520 --> 01:38:54.480]   and then start to have your own creativity start to flower,
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:56.340]   even surprising your own self.
[01:38:56.340 --> 01:38:59.600]   And it's a very cooperative endeavor.
[01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:02.000]   It's, I think a lot of people think
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:04.880]   of science as highly competitive
[01:39:04.880 --> 01:39:07.960]   and I think in some other fields, it might be more so.
[01:39:07.960 --> 01:39:10.560]   Here it's way more cooperative than you might imagine.
[01:39:10.560 --> 01:39:13.480]   And people are always teaching each other something
[01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:16.760]   and people are always more than happy to be clear.
[01:39:16.760 --> 01:39:19.300]   So I feel I'm an expert on certain kinds of things,
[01:39:19.300 --> 01:39:21.320]   but I'm very much not expert on lots of other things.
[01:39:21.320 --> 01:39:23.520]   And a lot of them are relevant and a lot of them are,
[01:39:23.520 --> 01:39:26.280]   I should know, but should in some sense, you know, you don't.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:29.620]   So I'm always willing to reveal my ignorance
[01:39:29.620 --> 01:39:31.840]   to people around me so they can teach me things.
[01:39:31.840 --> 01:39:34.200]   And I think a lot of us feel that way about our field.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.960]   So it's very cooperative.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.920]   I might add it's also very international
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.040]   'cause it's so cooperative.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.560]   We see no barriers.
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:43.200]   And so the nationalism that you see,
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.520]   especially in the current era and everything,
[01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:46.840]   is just at odds with the way that most of us think
[01:39:46.840 --> 01:39:47.960]   about what we're doing here,
[01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:51.200]   where this is a human endeavor and we cooperate
[01:39:51.200 --> 01:39:53.560]   and are very much trying to do it together
[01:39:53.560 --> 01:39:56.520]   for the benefit of everybody.
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:39:59.800]   - So last question, where and how and why
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:01.360]   did you learn French?
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.480]   And which language is more beautiful, English or French?
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:06.360]   - Great question.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:09.240]   So first of all, I think Italian's actually more beautiful
[01:40:09.240 --> 01:40:10.080]   than French and English.
[01:40:10.080 --> 01:40:11.080]   And I also speak that.
[01:40:11.080 --> 01:40:14.200]   So I'm married to an Italian and I have kids
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:15.240]   and we speak Italian.
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.720]   Anyway, all kidding aside,
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:21.480]   every language allows you to express things
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.960]   a bit differently.
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:25.760]   And it is one of the great fun things to do in life
[01:40:25.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   is to explore those things.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:31.760]   So in fact, when I kids or teens or college students
[01:40:31.760 --> 01:40:33.520]   ask me what they should study,
[01:40:33.520 --> 01:40:35.800]   I say, well, do what your heart, where your heart is,
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.840]   certainly do a lot of math.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.480]   Math is good for everybody,
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:40.360]   but do some poetry and do some history
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:41.680]   and do some language too.
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:44.560]   Throughout your life, you'll wanna be a thinking person.
[01:40:44.560 --> 01:40:46.040]   You'll wanna have done that.
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:50.400]   For me, yeah, French I learned when I was,
[01:40:50.400 --> 01:40:53.480]   I'd say a late teen.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.120]   I was living in the middle of the country in Kansas
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:58.440]   and not much was going on in Kansas
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:40:59.880]   with all due respect to Kansas.
[01:40:59.880 --> 01:41:02.860]   And so my parents happened to have some French books
[01:41:02.860 --> 01:41:04.400]   on the shelf and just in my boredom,
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:07.040]   I pulled them down and I found this is fun.
[01:41:07.040 --> 01:41:08.920]   And I kind of learned the language by reading.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:11.280]   And when I first heard it spoken,
[01:41:11.280 --> 01:41:13.040]   I had no idea what was being spoken,
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:14.460]   but I realized I had somehow knew it
[01:41:14.460 --> 01:41:15.520]   from some previous life.
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:16.960]   And so I made the connection.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:20.080]   But then I traveled and just,
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.160]   I love to go beyond my own barriers
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:23.960]   and my own comfort or whatever.
[01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:26.520]   And I found myself on trains in France
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.360]   next to say older people who had lived
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:30.280]   a whole life of their own.
[01:41:30.280 --> 01:41:32.640]   And the ability to communicate with them
[01:41:32.640 --> 01:41:37.640]   was special and ability to also see myself
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:39.700]   in other people's shoes and have empathy
[01:41:39.700 --> 01:41:42.200]   and kind of work on that language as part of that.
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:46.960]   So after that kind of experience
[01:41:46.960 --> 01:41:49.060]   and also embedding myself in French culture,
[01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:52.280]   which is quite amazing, languages are rich,
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:41:53.400]   not just 'cause there's something
[01:41:53.400 --> 01:41:54.520]   inherently beautiful about it,
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.920]   but it's all the creativity that went into it.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:41:59.420]   So I learned a lot of songs, read poems, read books.
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:01.760]   And then I was here actually at MIT
[01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.120]   where we're doing the podcast today.
[01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:08.520]   And young professor, not yet married
[01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:11.920]   and not having a lot of friends in the area.
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:14.000]   So I just didn't have, I was kind of a bored person.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:15.960]   I said, I heard a lot of Italians around.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:17.760]   There's happened to be a lot of Italians at MIT,
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:19.760]   a lot of Italian professors for some reason.
[01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:21.600]   And so I was kind of vaguely understanding
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.440]   what they were talking about.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.620]   I said, well, I should learn this language too.
[01:42:23.620 --> 01:42:25.280]   So I did.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:28.560]   And then later met my spouse and Italian
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:29.780]   became a more important part of my life.
[01:42:30.760 --> 01:42:32.200]   But I go to China a lot these days.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:33.960]   I go to Asia, I go to Europe.
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:37.720]   And every time I go, I kind of amazed
[01:42:37.720 --> 01:42:39.240]   by the richness of human experience.
[01:42:39.240 --> 01:42:42.640]   And the people don't have any idea if you haven't traveled
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:46.840]   kind of how amazingly rich and I love the diversity.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:49.120]   It's not just a buzzword to me, it really means something.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:53.060]   I love the, embed myself with other people's experiences.
[01:42:53.060 --> 01:42:56.440]   And so yeah, learning language is a big part of that.
[01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:58.400]   I think I've said in some interview at some point
[01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.360]   that if I had millions of dollars
[01:43:00.360 --> 01:43:01.380]   and infinite time or whatever,
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:03.720]   what would you really work on if you really wanted to do AI?
[01:43:03.720 --> 01:43:07.180]   And for me, that is natural language and really done right.
[01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.640]   Deep understanding of language.
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.400]   That's to me, amazingly interesting scientific challenge.
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:14.960]   - One we're very far away on.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.840]   - One we're very far away, but good natural language people
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.160]   are kind of really invested in that.
[01:43:19.160 --> 01:43:21.580]   I think a lot of them see that's where the core of AI is.
[01:43:21.580 --> 01:43:22.520]   If you understand that,
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:24.480]   you really help human communication.
[01:43:24.480 --> 01:43:26.080]   You understand something about the human mind,
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.440]   the semantics that come out of the human mind.
[01:43:28.440 --> 01:43:30.960]   And I agree, I think that will be such a long time.
[01:43:30.960 --> 01:43:32.320]   So I didn't do that in my career
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:34.760]   just 'cause I kind of, I was behind in the early days.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:36.520]   I didn't kind of know enough of that stuff.
[01:43:36.520 --> 01:43:39.560]   I was at MIT, I didn't learn much language
[01:43:39.560 --> 01:43:40.960]   and it was too late at some point
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:42.900]   to kind of spend a whole career doing that.
[01:43:42.900 --> 01:43:44.400]   But I admire that field.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:48.440]   And so my little way by learning language,
[01:43:48.440 --> 01:43:52.980]   that part of my brain has been trained up.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:56.720]   - Jan was right, you truly are the Miles Davis
[01:43:56.720 --> 01:43:57.560]   of machine learning.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.440]   I don't think there's a better place than it.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.400]   Mike, it was a huge honor talking to you today.
[01:44:01.400 --> 01:44:02.400]   Merci beaucoup.
[01:44:02.400 --> 01:44:03.480]   - All right, it's been my pleasure.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:04.880]   Thank you.

[01:44:33.480 --> 01:44:37.120]   And now let me leave you with some words of wisdom
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.400]   from Michael I. Jordan from his blog post titled,
[01:44:40.400 --> 01:44:44.240]   "Artificial Intelligence, the revolution hasn't happened yet
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:48.500]   calling for broadening the scope of the AI field."
[01:44:48.500 --> 01:44:51.480]   We should embrace the fact that what we are witnessing
[01:44:51.480 --> 01:44:54.280]   is the creation of a new branch of engineering.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:57.640]   The term engineering is often invoked in a narrow sense
[01:44:57.640 --> 01:45:01.720]   in academia and beyond, with overtones of cold,
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:04.720]   effectless machinery and negative connotations
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:06.540]   of loss of control by humans.
[01:45:06.540 --> 01:45:10.960]   But an engineering discipline can be what we want it to be.
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:13.520]   In the current era, we have a real opportunity
[01:45:13.520 --> 01:45:16.400]   to conceive of something historically new,
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:19.760]   a human centric engineering discipline.
[01:45:19.760 --> 01:45:22.520]   I'll resist giving this emerging discipline a name,
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:25.600]   but if the acronym AI continues to be used,
[01:45:25.600 --> 01:45:28.120]   let's be aware of the very real limitations
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.720]   of this placeholder.
[01:45:29.720 --> 01:45:33.000]   Let's broaden our scope, tone down the hype
[01:45:33.000 --> 01:45:35.780]   and recognize the serious challenges ahead.
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:40.180]   Thank you for listening and hope to see you next time.
