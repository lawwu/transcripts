[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560]   Any places you think that someone might be hearing about when they're planning their trip that are
[00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:12.000]   overhyped or maybe emerging and underappreciated? There's like a cursory kind of coverage that
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.600]   exists around Brittany for whatever reason. Brittany and the Basque Country, honestly,
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.440]   those are the two places I think maybe just being in the shadow of some of these more
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.640]   cinematic places don't get the kind of exposure that they deserve, but they are magnificent.
[00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.880]   And honestly, especially in Brittany, you'll feel like there's probably more in common with
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.800]   the Isle of Jersey and the experience on the English coast than with other places in France.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.440]   So it has this very wild, very natural, totally otherworldly almost experience
[00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.240]   that it offers, and the landscapes are just absolutely breathtaking.
