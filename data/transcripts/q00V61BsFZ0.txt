[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.080]   Hi, my name is Rick Ferry and I'm the president of the John C. Bogle Center for Financial
[00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.400]   Literacy, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that was created in 2012 by the founders of
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.600]   the Bogleheads organization with the assistance of Jack Bogle.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:25.040]   The center's mission is to further financial education worldwide, promote low fees and
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:31.500]   financial well-being and to foster a sense of community amongst our all-volunteer membership.
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.800]   And of course, your tax-deductible donation to the boglecenter.net is greatly appreciated.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.220]   The idea for this online conference came about because of COVID-19.
[00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:49.160]   As many of you know, we normally do an annual conference outside of Philadelphia, but unfortunately
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.960]   we have not been able to do that in the last couple of years.
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.200]   For your planning purposes, we plan to have a large conference in 2022.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.240]   The location has yet to be identified, but please mark your calendars for the fall of
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.400]   2022 for our first large and expanded Bogleheads conference.
[00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.040]   In the meantime, we have the speaker series.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.440]   And I wish to thank a lot of the Boglehead members who have helped put this together,
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.240]   particularly Mike Nolan of Vanguard, who has tirelessly spent a lot of time with his committee
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.880]   putting together this event, and will also be working on the big event in 2022.
[00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.340]   Today we're happy to have our guests from Vanguard, Joe Davis and Maria Bruno.
[00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.600]   Joe is the global chief economist and global head of Vanguard Investment Strategy Group.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.440]   And Maria is the head of the U.S. Wealth Planning Research Group at Vanguard.
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.960]   Joe and Maria will discuss the 2021 Vanguard Economic and Market Outlook and Vanguard's
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.760]   views on global growth, inflation, the financial markets, and the implications for your portfolio.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.780]   We wish to thank all of you who submitted questions for Joe and Maria.
[00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.120]   We hope you enjoy this presentation and tell others about it.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.440]   Today's event is being recorded.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.080]   In a few days it will be available on boglecenter.net.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:25.360]   And we will make a post on the bogleheads.org forum that it is available for viewing.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.080]   Thanks again for joining us.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.760]   And over to you, Maria.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760]   Thank you, Rick.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:31.760]   It's good to be here today.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.720]   It's unfortunate we weren't able to be together in person in our fall conference, but it's
[00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.760]   tremendous how we're able to do this virtually.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.160]   So kudos to the team for putting all this together.
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.360]   So Joe, we're here together.
[00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.320]   As I was thinking, we've been working together on and off for about 15 years now.
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.680]   And this is the very first time the two of us have actually shared the stage together.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.120]   It's a virtual stage, but nevertheless, the first time we're together.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.600]   So I'm looking forward to it.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.720]   And no better audience to do this with than our bogleheads.
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.680]   So with that in mind, I think it's only right for us to talk a little bit about Mr. Bogle.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.480]   So you and I both had the opportunity to work with him and know Mr. Bogle.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.840]   Tell us a little bit how he influenced you and your approach to investing.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:14.840]   Sure, Maria.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.080]   And again, thanks, everyone, to the bogleheads for making time.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.280]   I hope this finds you healthy, you and your loved ones.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.200]   And again, Maria, I can't believe it's 15 years we've never done this before.
[00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.200]   Shame on us.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.520]   For those in the audience, Maria and I go way back.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.760]   I've known Maria since I've started here at Vanguard.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:39.080]   And someone who touched me ever since day one at Vanguard was Jack Bogle.
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.720]   I do miss him considerably.
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:49.240]   I used to have the pleasure and the honor of having lunch with Jack probably about once
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.720]   every two or three months.
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.680]   We used to get together for lunch in the galley, which is our cafeteria.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.680]   We call it the galley at Vanguard.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.680]   And I always recall him having a little cup of soup, whether it's minestrone or chicken
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:04.680]   noodle or whatever.
[00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.200]   And we would-- there's two things I take back from those conversations.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.240]   One-- well, actually, three, Maria.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.480]   One was that tremendous leader known in the industry, obviously leading Vanguard, yet
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.480]   he always found time to talk with individuals.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.560]   He was, in that sense, selfless with his time.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.520]   So that was a wonderful attribute, number one.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:33.040]   Second, what I always enjoyed talking about Jack was-- and was always impressed with his
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.120]   work-- he read widely.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.240]   And so I was always a student of history, but he certainly knew more history than I
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240]   did.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.440]   And so I think we hit it off in part because of that appreciation for history-- from naval
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.080]   warfare to early business cycles in the United States.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.440]   So he was widely read, and I think that he was a tremendous asset for Jack, because you
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.800]   would see that he would draw upon that in his speeches.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:03.520]   He was one of the few individuals I've ever met in the world who could talk about Shakespeare
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.720]   and financial theory within the same conversation.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.520]   And in fact, he would make it actually very relevant.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.880]   So he would span those different disciplines, and it's something that I always admire.
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:17.760]   And I always tell that to my colleagues at Vanguard, to sort of aspire to.
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:22.880]   And then the third something-- more I watched from a distance when Jack was on stage, but
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:25.120]   you would see it in his readings and so forth.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:31.240]   But he did give me this coaching once, and that is that he said, when you do the strong
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.880]   research and you have a finding, particularly that's in the aid and support of investors,
[00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.760]   he says, do not be afraid to show conviction in that idea.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.200]   And so you would see that clearly from Jack.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.920]   It led the industry for low-cost investing in terms of our investment philosophy.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   He would not apologize.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:53.520]   It's the song he would come across in the industry as strident.
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:56.680]   But I always-- and that's a great-- that was-- he demonstrated leadership.
[00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   He would not bend in his conviction of his ideas, particularly when they were well-grounded
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.960]   as they always were, and well-researched.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.840]   So those were the three things, Marie, I took back from Jack, continue to think about him
[00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:11.840]   on occasion.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.360]   And again, when I pass through the statue-- I'm on campus today-- when I pass through
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:21.560]   Jack's statue, those images come back to me with regularity.
[00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.040]   I'm near spot on.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:27.200]   I think the one thing I would add, too, is just really the focus on our clients.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.200]   And we're clients, right?
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.840]   We're shareholders as well.
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.680]   And being a research team and doing the work that we do, unless we have key takeaways in
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.000]   how do you make it actionable, there's very little relevance to what we do, right?
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.760]   So how do we take our learnings and how do we apply these to help investors improve their
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.780]   financial outcomes, improve their chance for investment success?
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:51.360]   So I continue to take that through the years.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.360]   Marie, we both, right?
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.120]   I mean, he's been an aspiration for both of us.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.400]   I love what you just said.
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.840]   I mean, it's like rigorous work, rigorous but relevant research, right?
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.200]   Because it's got to be practical and applicable.
[00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:09.040]   If not, I mean, it's nice, but why should the shareholder help support the work that
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.040]   you and I do?
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.040]   That was always Jack's more star and something I've always aspired to be and to follow.
[00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:20.200]   But he set a very strong path for all of us.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.560]   And you and I both, as part of the research at Vanguard, in many ways, we're trying to
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.360]   carry his legacy in our small way.
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.760]   So he continues to serve as inspiration for us and for our crew.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:35.760]   Yes.
[00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.840]   So I think that segues really well into how we're going to spend the next hour or so,
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.840]   Joe.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:47.840]   So let's talk about our economic outlook and what does Vanguard expect and then how do
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.440]   we take this and apply that into our own portfolios and key messages for investors.
[00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:58.960]   So let's start first with, so Vanguard published our 2021 economic outlook and we think about
[00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.240]   the framework that we have for our near term prospects.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:07.520]   But if we look at the recovery, highly contingent upon health outcomes and also consumer reluctance.
[00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:11.240]   So let's talk a little bit about that in terms of where we're heading as we're starting the
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:14.800]   year and as what we might expect throughout the year.
[00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.800]   Sure, Maria.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:21.280]   You know, so as soon, you know, going back through even replaying these, you know, very
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.960]   challenging and traumatic events, you know, ever since the beginning of 2020, I'm very
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   proud of the team.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.640]   You know, we very quickly realized how significant, didn't know exactly how the events of 2020
[00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:39.440]   and even today would continue to unfold, but I'm proud of the team of really focusing on
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:44.400]   the framework that a healthy economy or an impaired economy would begin and end health.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.440]   And so we very quickly, first time in my career, I had to very seriously think about health
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:55.640]   outcomes driving the economy in such around the world.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:09:00.320]   And so what we did is, you know, we applied, you know, the sort of, you know, what the
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:05.240]   sort of the concerns around health, fear of catching the disease, the supply impacts,
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.600]   the inability to either go to school or to conduct business.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:14.920]   And we and we applied a lot of data through that framework, say which sectors are going
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.320]   to be highly impaired because of social activity, so-called face-to-face activity.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.120]   And that framework continues to serve us well.
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:27.280]   I mean, that told us that the global economy would suffer the deepest recession in world
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   history.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:34.040]   It would be short in the sense of it would fall very profoundly, it would start to grow
[00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:38.080]   and that the pace of recovery would largely be dictated by the path of the virus.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.480]   And that has generally held out to be the case.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:45.800]   It gave us, I think, a great deal of accuracy, or at least as best you can have given the
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:47.120]   uncertainties of the virus.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.360]   So where do we stand today?
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:53.480]   It's an environment where, you know, we look at the percentage of the world that has yet
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.960]   to achieve immunity to the virus, which is considerable.
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:03.760]   And that once you can have an estimate of the immunity gap and how quickly that achieves
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:09.440]   herd immunity, so-called 70% or 80% of the world that becomes immune to the virus, the
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:13.360]   COVID-19, that will then dictate the pace of the recovery, particularly with respect
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.560]   to social-based activities.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:21.240]   So think about restaurants, hotels, travel, which has been, has suffered the vast majority
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.880]   of the slowdown, whether you're looking at China, Europe, or the United States.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:31.120]   And so when we look at that, you know, we look at our immunity gap as a factor of two
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.120]   variables.
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:37.300]   One is how, how, how, how effective is any vaccine?
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:43.340]   We've long thought a vaccine would likely be developed, but that was certainly as much
[00:10:43.340 --> 00:10:45.640]   of our hope as our forecast.
[00:10:45.640 --> 00:10:50.320]   And secondly, you know, what, what surprised us positively several months ago was that
[00:10:50.320 --> 00:10:55.640]   the efficacy of the vaccine, at least some of the two that are already approved for emergency
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:59.440]   use are well above the 60% threshold, which is deemed baseline.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:03.320]   In fact, it was well above even childhood efficacy rates.
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:07.200]   So it's roughly over, roughly 90%, somewhat higher.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:10.680]   That plus the percentage of the population that actually takes the vaccine, you, you
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.880]   combine those two percentages, and then you get a timeline of when we will quote unquote
[00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:21.600]   get back to what normal or at least more normal activity.
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:28.240]   And so that, when we apply that framework, it looks like certainly by the end of 2021,
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.120]   the largest economies in the world, the United States, China, Europe, will have achieved
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:40.200]   what's so-called herd immunity, which means such a large percentage of the society has
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:47.040]   effectively become immune that the spread of disease is much less rapid and it starts
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.040]   to dissipate.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:50.920]   And so that continues to be our framework.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:56.040]   It means that growth for 2021, our theme was approaching the dawn.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.400]   We're not quite there yet.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:01.020]   There's going to be some unsettling next few weeks.
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:03.320]   We expected actually a retraction activity.
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:09.840]   I think we saw for the jobs report, the past, you know, Friday, we started to see lost jobs,
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:11.680]   some restaurants had to close.
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:17.360]   But as we proceed through 2021, that we will see an acceleration activity.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.900]   Part of that is getting just recovering the losses from 2020.
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.160]   But certainly 2021 should be a stronger year for the economy.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:30.600]   And that was even before additional fiscal stimulus, which will be enacted.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:37.440]   But it's a positive economic outlook, but still that also has to, I underscore that,
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:43.080]   you know, we continue, just our hearts are out to those that continue to be, you know,
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:49.600]   affected by this virus, both from the health side, as well as for those that operate businesses,
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.680]   which, you know, they're still struggling right now because there's still a decent amount
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.120]   of pain out there in certain sectors.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:57.120]   Okay.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.040]   Joe, you had mentioned acceleration.
[00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:01.600]   Let's talk a little bit about trends.
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.520]   So you and your team have talked a lot throughout the pandemic about certain trends that we've
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.560]   seen accelerated, but then equally are important are trends that we've seen that haven't been
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:14.120]   impacted that we maybe would have expected from the pandemic.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.640]   Can we talk a little bit about that in terms of what we might have seen and what we might
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   expect to see?
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   Sure.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.840]   I mean, you know, I think we can bucket into three, we have three broad buckets in terms
[00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.920]   of how the world may have been affected or we think will be affected by COVID-19.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.880]   Again, I think it's to underscore, I know COVID-19 has impacted me profoundly on a personal
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:43.480]   level, you know, and I would imagine others as well on the call today.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:46.640]   You know, I think our study of history, as well as our own personal experience, this
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.520]   has been a traumatic global experience that is shared by billions around the world, but
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.760]   I think it is reasonable to expect some changes.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:59.520]   I think one bucket of changes are trends that were already on their way that have been accelerated.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.240]   So the move, and much of this has been discussed by others in the media and so forth, things
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:09.380]   that we research as well, you know, the move to the increased digitization of the economy,
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.400]   you know, whether it's media, financial services, others, that was already well on their way.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:15.400]   That's only accelerated.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.560]   We've seen this in the retail sector.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:22.160]   Again, I think what, you know, the future has been, you know, fast forwarded to some
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   extent.
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:29.240]   And so I think a five years worth of some call it disruption, others call it acceleration
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:34.240]   of certain business models, you know, that's been compressed into roughly a year's time.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.360]   But that trend was on their way already and it's something we've researched.
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:44.120]   I think, you know, one thing that I think, you know, we did a lot of work on the future
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.960]   of automation and what that may or may not mean to the labor market.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:51.240]   The one thing that at least I didn't worry about in the past was the location of that
[00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.240]   work.
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:56.320]   But looking at that framework, I think another bucket, something that, again, I think part,
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:15:01.040]   you could argue was a trend that was going to occur anyway, but this is clearly been
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   a step function.
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:07.760]   That is the move towards a virtual work, as best we can estimate using all the data and
[00:15:07.760 --> 00:15:12.960]   our sense of the type of tasks that can be conducted remotely versus still the need for
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.920]   face-to-face interaction, Maria.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:20.640]   We this best I ask, we estimate roughly 15% of the occupations or the jobs in the United
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:26.480]   States, for example, will be are just as effective on a permanent basis, are just as effective
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:33.080]   being conducted remotely as they are in a, let me say, an office, but it's not all jobs
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:34.200]   are conducted in office.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   Now, that may not seem like a lot, but that's equivalent to the number of jobs in the ten
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:41.140]   largest cities in the United States.
[00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.360]   So there's going to be real estate implications for that.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:48.000]   You know, I think there are some things in some of the largest cities, or there'll be
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:53.760]   some, there'll be some disruption there, without doubt, in commercial real estate.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:57.920]   And then I think there's other trends that I think were, you know, I think in one sense,
[00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:04.560]   they weren't, I don't think they were completely changed or unaltered by the current crisis.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:12.800]   One that clearly has, however, I think is the likelihood that we are going to see conditional
[00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:13.800]   stimulus.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:20.720]   There was a reluctance, I think, in some economies to provide additional fiscal stimulus.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:27.280]   Clearly we saw central banks very aggressive, taking interest rates to zero, even in some
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:30.920]   countries negative, which they remain to this day.
[00:16:30.920 --> 00:16:36.760]   I think that has been a pivot from the past 20 or 30 years, and I don't think it'll stop.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:41.040]   That has some implications for the bond market, potentially for inflation, which I think we
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.040]   could get to.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:46.520]   And then finally, some things that I think have been unaltered, believe it or not, with
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:47.520]   COVID-19.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.520]   I think some trends with respect to innovation and productivity.
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:55.440]   I think we were going to see this sort of innovation, whether we were working virtually
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   or in person.
[00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:00.640]   And I think we could touch upon that with the vaccine, because I think that ties to
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.000]   the vaccine discovery.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.480]   And then I think some of the tensions, quite frankly, between the United States and China.
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.600]   I think we were going to see continued tensions between two of the largest economies in the
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.200]   world with or without COVID-19.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:16.640]   So I have not seen anything that will decelerate, I think, some of those tensions.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.440]   And so I think that's something that we'll have to continue to monitor in the years ahead.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.320]   So I think there's been, again, acceleration in some trends.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   Secondly, pivots.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.400]   Fiscal is particularly a pivot.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:33.920]   And then finally, something I think would be unaltered, and that would be, you know,
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:40.720]   like COVID, you know, the China tensions, globalization is related to that as well.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.440]   And then things around innovation, what we call the idea of multiparty.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   Okay, good.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   All right.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:50.200]   I do want to move over to monetary and fiscal, Joe, because I think that lends nicely into
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   that.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.480]   Although we got right into it, and I forgot to do my job as a moderator to stress that
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.280]   we are taking questions.
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.360]   So we've got a few questions prior to the event.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.680]   So we'll weave those in, Joe.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:09.240]   But for those that are listening live, if you do have questions or want us to, you know,
[00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:10.240]   expand on anything, just let us know.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.440]   Michael is at the helm there going through questions, and he'll be able to share any
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.540]   questions that we might be able to take live as well.
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:19.320]   So please don't hesitate if you do.
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:25.360]   So Joe, as we think about monetary and fiscal policies, right, we've seen a lot of stimulus
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.360]   activity.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:33.520]   You know, how much will it continue, what will be required to continue the road to recovery
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:34.520]   in your thoughts?
[00:18:34.520 --> 00:18:40.660]   Well, I mean, I think, you know, policy by and large, Maria, will continue to remain
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:41.660]   very accommodative.
[00:18:41.660 --> 00:18:46.720]   I mean, again, and you take a step back, we have some of this in our annual outlook, as
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:50.080]   you mentioned and referred to.
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:56.160]   The combination of fiscal, monetary as well, but fiscal monetary support that we saw in
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:03.640]   many economies, the US in particular, in 2020, in part to address COVID, was among the most
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.320]   significant we have seen probably since World War Two.
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:13.160]   You know, the CARES Act, which was well over $2 trillion, pieces of legislation which we
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:18.400]   even at Vanguard, I spent a lot of time, even before some of those were enacted, just to
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.720]   give our thoughts from a macro perspective, in a bipartisan way, that was significant
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.040]   policy response.
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:33.280]   And there are still areas that need to address, I think, the $900 billion of additional fiscal
[00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:40.040]   support, particularly for those that are unemployed, in part because of inability to work, particularly
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:44.120]   the restaurants and face-to-face intensive sectors, that that will be helpful.
[00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:48.520]   They tend to skew lower income, which is really unfortunate.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:54.480]   I think going forward, I think we will very likely see increased tendency for fiscal spending,
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:56.840]   and that may concern some, given our debt levels.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:01.080]   I think, and we can talk more about that, I think, you know, fiscal policy should be
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:02.680]   split into two components.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:08.160]   One is, you know, really addressing the near-term economic weakness.
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.440]   And I think there's still some impairment.
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:16.080]   If our forecast is right, the need for those measures will dissipate as we proceed through
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:17.160]   the course of this year.
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:22.160]   I think monetary policy, regardless, will remain, interest rates, short-term interest
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.000]   rates by the Federal Reserve will remain near zero for the foreseeable future.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.640]   I think the earliest they would raise rates is the year 2023, a little bit earlier than
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:35.360]   the bond market expects, but not materially different.
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:36.440]   Inflation is the wild card there.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:40.320]   And then, you know, the other component of fiscal, which is, I really relate to longer-term
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   spending initiatives.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:44.920]   Now, many will focus on Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid.
[00:20:44.920 --> 00:20:50.480]   I think the one area that, regardless of your political leaning, I think you can make a
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.520]   very strong case, and I would make a very strong case for, is infrastructure.
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.920]   There is the need for certain infrastructure spending, certainly in the United States,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:05.560]   particularly if you travel by plane, train, or automobile, you know, the infrastructure
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:06.560]   needs.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:09.960]   So, I think we will see some of that in the coming year.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.120]   And I think part of that could help, but that will be a, so I think we will, you know, we
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:19.360]   will see, you know, additional fiscal stimulus at some point.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:24.040]   I think the bond market will start to apply a little bit greater pressure through a little
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:25.040]   bit higher interest rates.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   I think that process is just starting.
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:32.720]   And, again, I am not saying we're going to see a material rise in interest rates, but
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.160]   they are slightly higher than what they are currently today.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:39.040]   I mean, there, you know, the 10-year Treasury, which is a benchmark interest rate, 10-year
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:42.080]   Treasury, the yield on the 10-year Treasury is roughly 1%.
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.560]   I mean, it was 2% before COVID-19.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:52.040]   So I think, you know, we will march over the course of 2021, maybe not quite get there,
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.120]   but perhaps close to it.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.920]   And I think, hopefully, it does so in an orderly way.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:05.120]   If it was unorderly, I think the Federal Reserve, I think, actually would step into the markets
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.560]   and actually purchase some Treasury bonds, because that would be counterintuitive.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.600]   The market dislocations, it would be counterintuitive to be counterproductive to their objectives
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:17.360]   to kind of stabilize the rise in interest rates.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.560]   But as a bond investor, you know, longer term, I'm hopeful for somewhat higher interest rates.
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:26.480]   I mean, interest rates are negative after the rate of inflation.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:30.680]   So I just hope that that rise is gradual and orderly and not unorderly.
[00:22:30.680 --> 00:22:36.240]   Yeah, Joe, and I do want to talk about that a little bit more as we get into the market
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:40.200]   outlook, because as on the financial planning side, those are lots of the questions I get
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:46.320]   in terms of what do we think we're looking at in terms of market returns, but also yields
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:49.600]   and what does that mean for, you know, savers and spenders alike?
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:52.800]   Okay, you had mentioned inflation earlier.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:56.200]   Is that even a very real risk for us right now?
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:57.200]   Right.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.160]   So if you think about who's with us today, many Bogleheads have seen different cycles.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:05.520]   Inflation under the Volcker era, where we've seen record high, you know, inflation rates
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.600]   and what, you know, in modern history, in modern times.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.440]   But now we're seeing, you know, very low inflation.
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.200]   And there's other concerns that go along with that.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.680]   How real is the risk of inflation or what do we need to think about inflation in the
[00:23:17.680 --> 00:23:20.000]   context of of our portfolios?
[00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:21.800]   Yeah, it's a great question.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:26.160]   I mean, that's the one part, you know, as an investor, it's one of the risks you always
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.680]   always have on one's radar screen, right?
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:31.680]   I mean, anyone who particularly remembers their calls in 1970, even for two or three
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:37.120]   years of rapid rise in inflation can be near term, you know, some pain on a balanced portfolio.
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.520]   So we all should take it seriously.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:42.360]   I would say, you know, three things with respect to inflation.
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:44.440]   One is just historical context.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.640]   Inflation, believe it or not, is still fairly low.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.680]   It doesn't feel like that when I go to the grocery store, it feels like everything is
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:56.480]   up like two X. But but in a broad basket of consumer prices, inflation is actually it's
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.640]   only roughly one, one and a half percent.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.960]   It's below where most central banks want it to be.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   That's one.
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:05.400]   So it's and it's that has been generally the case for the past 20 years.
[00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:07.680]   That's actually been a problem.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.680]   Central banks have.
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:12.960]   And that was actually our hypothesis, Maria, right, that central banks would and and the
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.120]   economy in the digital world would struggle to generate consistently 2 percent inflation.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.840]   That's one of the primary reasons why interest rates are as low as they are.
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:26.280]   Not the only one, but it's one of the reasons that's one it's been actually lower, somewhat
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:29.100]   lower than what quote unquote is ideal.
[00:24:29.100 --> 00:24:31.160]   If you want to use the word.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:35.200]   Secondly, is the forecast on a cyclical basis, it is very likely that we will see a rise
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.200]   in inflation.
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.000]   Part of that is is is just anticipated recovery in the economy.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.440]   Part of that is a little bit healthy.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.360]   I mean, we will see a recovery and in the service sector if our forecast is right.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:52.160]   And that means a little bit affirming and, you know, things for air travel, hotels and
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.280]   some social activity will return.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   Right.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.680]   There'll be some long term impairments and business travel and so forth.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:03.280]   But domestic travel, if you look at China, is almost quote back to pre-COVID level restaurants
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   again.
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:08.640]   And so we will see that and so we will see affirming in those areas and that will get
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:10.560]   us closer to the 2 percent.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:16.080]   And then third is the risk for the first time since I've been at Vanguard, other than perhaps
[00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:22.280]   early 2006, we saw that oil prices, as we recall, going to one hundred dollars a barrel
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.280]   for the first time.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:29.400]   You know, our team, Maria, sees a modest risk towards the upside in inflation, not material,
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:31.140]   nowhere near the 70s.
[00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:35.720]   This notion that we will return to a high inflation world, I think, underestimates some
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.840]   of the forces that have kept inflation at bay for a long period of time.
[00:25:39.840 --> 00:25:43.280]   Technology, globalization and the Federal Reserve.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:47.280]   But that's not to say that even with those forces, you can't you can't have inflation
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.500]   a little bit higher than expected.
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:51.380]   So I think fiscal policy is the wild card.
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.940]   This fiscal policy and increased fiscal spending, if it's consistently aggressive over the coming
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:26:03.100]   three or four years, does that start to raise everyone's expected inflation rate?
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.080]   Maybe not 2 percent, maybe two and a half, three percent.
[00:26:06.080 --> 00:26:07.080]   That's that's the wild card.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:09.940]   That's what we have started to model and what we think about.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:13.220]   It would mean that interest rates would be a little bit the rise would be a little bit
[00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:15.660]   higher than we anticipate.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.660]   But that's the risk.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.940]   So it's but this is not a return, you know, believe me, it's not.
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:24.860]   It's certainly in the next few years a return to, you know, the seven, the 1970s.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:26.380]   And I am not complacent on it.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:30.580]   I'm just telling you, when you do all the math and all you look at all the what drives
[00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:35.420]   inflation and it's a comp explain, you know, in understanding inflation is a very complex
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:36.420]   phenomenon.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:40.940]   But when you apply all all the all the variables that matter, you know, we have an impaired
[00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:43.380]   labor market and we have also pent up demand.
[00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:44.980]   And we do all that calculus.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.460]   It does say we're going to have inflation start to rise.
[00:26:47.460 --> 00:26:52.060]   It should kind of crest roughly around 2 percent, maybe a little bit higher than and then kind
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.980]   of settle in around two.
[00:26:53.980 --> 00:26:58.180]   But if there's a risk, it may go a little bit, you know, at the end of this year, may
[00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:00.380]   recover a little bit more quickly.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:06.100]   And that can take that, you know, we don't get we have to stay in the course of our investment
[00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:07.100]   portfolios.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:09.460]   But that's the one probably source of volatility this year.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:14.180]   If the market's temporarily down five or 10 percent, I would say more likely than not,
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.180]   probably because we're going to have a month or two where inflation perhaps comes a little
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.180]   bit higher than expected.
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:20.420]   We had that a few years ago.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.260]   Eventually, things will calm down.
[00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.340]   But that's probably the sort of and we identify that in our risk report.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.580]   You know, that's the one sort of source of volatility this year that we should just be
[00:27:31.580 --> 00:27:34.820]   prepared for, you know, and just try to look for.
[00:27:34.820 --> 00:27:35.820]   OK.
[00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:36.820]   Good.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.820]   OK.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:38.820]   Another.
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:39.820 --> 00:27:40.820]   This is a common question.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:41.820]   So 2020 was an election year.
[00:27:41.820 --> 00:27:45.740]   There's lots of uncertainty that goes along with that now that as we move into 2021 and
[00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:50.100]   we have more and it was just not the presidential election, but also with Congress, as we have
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:51.740]   more clarity as we're heading into this year.
[00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:56.100]   What do you think about the policy changes that might be proposed and then what we might
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:28:01.460]   need to keep an eye out on or your thoughts around any potential policy changes and implications
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:02.460]   throughout the year?
[00:28:03.220 --> 00:28:08.740]   Well, you know, again, I mean, I think there's that that's actually among my biggest question
[00:28:08.740 --> 00:28:09.740]   marks as well.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.380]   I mean, right now we're going to, you know, much greater the focus is on, you know, aiding
[00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:15.380]   the recovery.
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:20.780]   And the biggest thing is, is is the quickest we can get to anything, any dollar spent for
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:26.900]   vaccine distribution is you will make the recovery that much more quickly and have revenue
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   stabilized.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:33.100]   And as I said, I think longer term, we will see increased focus on on on tax rates to
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:34.940]   help fund some of the increased spending.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:40.060]   Again, we had structural deficits under both parties, both political parties, you know,
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:42.740]   in the past, the past five or 10 years.
[00:28:42.740 --> 00:28:47.380]   And so that was that was an issue that if you look at the congressional budget office,
[00:28:47.380 --> 00:28:52.820]   which is nonpartisan agency projecting higher debt levels for the next 30 or 40 years, it's
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:58.300]   in large part because revenues fall short of expenditures by roughly three or four percent
[00:28:58.300 --> 00:28:59.300]   a year.
[00:28:59.300 --> 00:29:00.460]   And so that gap is going to have to close.
[00:29:00.460 --> 00:29:05.020]   I think we will see a number of things on the table with respect to the revenue side,
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.140]   I think, particularly for higher income households.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:09.140]   I think we will.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:16.500]   I think it's reasonable to expect that we will see modestly higher, you know, tax rates.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:22.780]   But again, my personal view is, you know, there's a there's a whole cottage industry
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:26.540]   that tries to guess and you feel more than I do, Maria, right?
[00:29:26.540 --> 00:29:30.900]   Like how exactly should I should I anticipate the tax rates?
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:36.620]   I would personally rather kind of wait to see actually how they unfold rather than prognosticate
[00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:40.000]   on what form of tax rates we will see.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.500]   And then once I have that clarity, if that has some implications for my estate planning
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:49.220]   or my tax planning, I do it with one hundred percent more information rather than trying
[00:29:49.220 --> 00:29:50.220]   to guess.
[00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:55.340]   I do know that, you know, regardless of that, you know, Vanguard will continue to underscore
[00:29:55.340 --> 00:30:00.740]   and I think we'll we'll clearly endure the importance of retirement savings, the importance
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   of savings.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:08.140]   And I think the last point, which is not so much a tax policy perspective, Maria, it was
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:14.460]   everything you mentioned with respect to the headlines and the fact that all Vanguard investors,
[00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:15.460]   particularly those on the call.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:23.100]   I mean, I think everyone's long term orientation to continue to remain invested, balance, diversify,
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:24.100]   stay in the course.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.180]   You know, if there was ever going to be a year that was going to challenge that investment
[00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:31.860]   philosophy, 2020 and Covid was going to be it.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:37.020]   And if one had seen the headlines, I think many in March and April, I remember seeing
[00:30:37.020 --> 00:30:41.460]   the media, many were saying run for the hills and and look at the returns that we've seen
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:42.460]   this year.
[00:30:42.460 --> 00:30:43.460]   And I think it's just a vindication.
[00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:47.660]   And I think everyone is a long term investor should be pat on the back because the headlines
[00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:48.660]   were extremely troubling.
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:53.580]   It was, you know, something I felt because it was the headlines impacted one's not only
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:58.380]   professional life, it also impacted one's personal life and family and friends.
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:02.420]   It was a lot of emotion to take into account.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:07.900]   And I think everyone should really pat themselves on the back that that was not easy to do emotionally.
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:08.900]   Right.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   Kudos.
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:14.980]   And so, again, it was just another underscore moment for for the long term orientation.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:19.700]   And that's always something I think that I know everyone on this call takes in mind.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:24.180]   That's something I think I continue to remind family and friends, even more so than the
[00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:27.820]   task, which are fair questions for you with respect to tax rates and so forth.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.940]   Like first order principles, continuing to stay invested in the markets, can you continuing
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:33.940]   to stay diversified?
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:37.460]   OK, if that's yes, then I'm happy.
[00:31:37.460 --> 00:31:38.460]   Tax rates are going.
[00:31:38.460 --> 00:31:41.260]   But let's make sure that we take care of business first.
[00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:42.260]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.260 --> 00:31:43.660]   No, last year was hard, Joe.
[00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.660]   Yes.
[00:31:44.660 --> 00:31:48.840]   Because, I mean, a lot of individuals are impacted by it, not just personally, but professionally
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:52.100]   as well, unanticipated furloughs and things like that.
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:56.260]   And while some of the provisions in the CARES Act could help, I mean, we have individuals
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:01.100]   who are really dealing with some significant financial challenges, both near term and long
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:02.100]   term.
[00:32:02.100 --> 00:32:06.700]   So how do you actually unpack that and focus on the things that you need to now, you know,
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:11.820]   as opposed to just, you know, reacting and looking at this longer term?
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:13.220]   In terms of the taxes, you're spot on.
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.140]   I'm starting to get more questions around that now in terms of, you know, some of the
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.980]   Biden proposal has some structural changes in it, as well as with the state taxation.
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:24.140]   But we don't know exactly it's a proposal.
[00:32:24.140 --> 00:32:29.840]   We don't know what or when or how and if individuals are thinking through things, you know, my
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:33.580]   suggestion there would be, you know, maybe hold off until we maybe we have some more
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:39.460]   clarity around this or some certainty, but never really let the tax situation drive the
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:44.140]   fundamental decisions of investing.
[00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.860]   But there are, you know, certainly on our watch list this year.
[00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:50.920]   And as we get more clarity around that, we'll see more from Vanguard as well on that front
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:51.920]   too.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:52.920]   OK.
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:33:01.020]   That's why it's good to know Maria Bruno at Vanguard, not only because for my own, for
[00:33:01.020 --> 00:33:04.500]   my other questions I have, I mean, Maria is my first call.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   Help me out here.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.780]   Well, the thing is, if I don't know the answer, I know where to go.
[00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:08.780]   Right.
[00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.780]   We've got strong teams with us.
[00:33:09.780 --> 00:33:10.780]   Right.
[00:33:10.780 --> 00:33:11.780]   All right.
[00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:15.560]   So, Josephine, let's think about the financial markets.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:22.460]   So the market recovery that we had in 2020 was just as surprising as the decline was.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:26.660]   Given what, where we were, where we are now, do you think the markets are fairly valued?
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:27.660]   What are your thoughts there?
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:31.620]   Well, as everyone on the call, you know, it's, you know, Vanguard, you know, I'm really proud
[00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:32.620]   of our framework.
[00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.620]   We take, you know, we don't talk about short-term market, you know, ups and downs.
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:42.460]   When we talk about our reasonable range of expected outcomes for whether it's stock returns
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:43.460]   or bond returns.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:48.780]   We're talking about broad portfolios, say the total stock market, total bond market.
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:52.540]   And we look out for a long period of time, at least 10 years.
[00:33:52.540 --> 00:33:54.180]   And I'm proud of our forecast.
[00:33:54.180 --> 00:33:57.980]   I think it's also reasonable to expect that those expected returns can vary through time.
[00:33:57.980 --> 00:34:00.540]   I mean, we all know that as bond investors, right?
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:03.900]   The expected return on the bond portfolio today is materially different from where it
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:06.140]   was in 1980.
[00:34:06.140 --> 00:34:11.700]   And so we just use that simple logic, but also recognize humility that this is the future
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:12.700]   we're talking about.
[00:34:12.700 --> 00:34:17.820]   So it's all ranges of return, but it's really grounded in the latest academic research from
[00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:20.760]   finance, which we apply at Vanguard.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.060]   So we're both humble, but also rigorous with respect to that.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:25.060]   But that is context.
[00:34:25.060 --> 00:34:27.780]   I'd say, you know, our outlook, I've been fairly proud.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.300]   I mean, even though the course of 2020, Maria, right?
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:36.420]   We were actually, you know, remember March and April, the free fall in the stock market?
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.420]   I remember.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:38.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:39.420]   We're not market timing.
[00:34:39.420 --> 00:34:42.860]   We're just saying if anything, our market outlook had gotten more positive for the first
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   time.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:47.580]   It was a material upgrade in our long-term equity projections because we dropped below
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:52.940]   fair value as the market really sold off very aggressively.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:54.860]   And so we said we didn't know the timing of it.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:00.380]   But again, close one's eyes next five or 10 years, expected returns on stocks are going
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:05.180]   to be higher than what we have in the historical average.
[00:35:05.180 --> 00:35:07.580]   So we got certainly the direction right.
[00:35:07.580 --> 00:35:09.100]   But certainly the magnitude surprised me.
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:13.700]   I mean, it was a very aggressive rise, most of which can be explained by the drop in interest
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:15.500]   rates, but not all of it.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:16.820]   So how do you read that?
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:20.900]   It means today that we're above these wide ranges of what we call fair value.
[00:35:20.900 --> 00:35:27.300]   Fair value for any asset is what is reasonably explained by, say, earning for the stock market
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.860]   earnings growth, the level of interest rates, because these are discounted cash flows in
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:34.500]   the futures for all for all, say, publicly traded U.S. companies.
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:37.100]   And so you don't have a wide fair value range.
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:41.980]   And most of the time the stock market is in that range, which means historical like expected
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:48.340]   returns of eight or nine percent for planning purposes is reasonable, right?
[00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:51.460]   But every so often you deviate from those ranges.
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.780]   We deviated well above.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:58.140]   We were way expensive in the late 1990s, which led to, you know, had we had our capital market
[00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:03.140]   small, we would have had just expect lower expected returns in the next five or 10 years.
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.820]   Not sell one's investments, just for planning purposes, expect lower returns.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.820]   We sit here today.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:12.100]   The outlook for the equity risk premium is still positive, somewhat lower than historical
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:13.100]   average.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:17.360]   The biggest reason why we expect lower returns, Maria, is not because the stock market itself.
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:22.620]   We still expect in the vast majority of cases, high probability that the next 10 years stocks
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.500]   will outperform fixed income.
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.420]   It's just that the fixed income and money market returns are materially lower.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.540]   And that's because the level of interest rates in the Federal Reserve.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.540]   Right.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.540]   So that is the prime.
[00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.780]   So all the expected returns for all assets in one's portfolio are modestly lower.
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:42.720]   It's not because we're bearish on the financial markets.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:47.780]   It's because of just the level of interest rates in money market funds.
[00:36:47.780 --> 00:36:51.660]   It's not because of money markets, but it's because of Federal Reserve and Fed funds rate.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:54.660]   That has implications for the bond premium.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:58.620]   So why should I have expected returns higher for a bond fund than a money market or for
[00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:02.140]   a stock fund equity risk premium over bonds and money market?
[00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.900]   That impression is more for everyone.
[00:37:05.900 --> 00:37:07.600]   So that's the primary implication.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.660]   And we generally have shaped two or three, the model shaped two or three percentage points
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:18.860]   off the expected returns for all those portfolios on a five or 10 year basis.
[00:37:18.860 --> 00:37:21.700]   But it's not because the markets are grossly overvalued.
[00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:24.180]   You know, they're at the high end of the range.
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:30.820]   I have some concerns about some of the aggressive, I'm starting to see some aggressive behavior,
[00:37:30.820 --> 00:37:36.660]   not by Vanguard investors, but the industry at large, the IPOs, some mega cap growth companies,
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:39.260]   you know, really concentrated returns.
[00:37:39.260 --> 00:37:44.660]   So I think there's definitely froth in parts of the market, things even, quite frankly,
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:50.780]   like Bitcoin, I see there's some froth, one could argue, but it doesn't mean the market
[00:37:50.780 --> 00:37:56.580]   is unsustainably high, it just means that we may see a little bit of a correction.
[00:37:56.580 --> 00:38:00.620]   One thing I think that is missed by many in the market is that even if we have modestly
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:04.500]   expected returns, say for U.S. stock, let's say in the four or five percent range over
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:09.300]   the next 10 years, that's certainly lower than historical average of nine or 10, say
[00:38:09.300 --> 00:38:10.980]   roughly five percent.
[00:38:10.980 --> 00:38:16.140]   If you own a broad basket of securities, that certainly could outperform a very concentrated
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.140]   one.
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:21.300]   You know, gross stocks have outperformed value companies by the largest in U.S. history ever
[00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.300]   recorded.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:28.820]   And so if one is, you know, if one is taking a broadly diversified approach, I think that
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:31.300]   may mitigate some of the risks.
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:34.340]   Some investors, I think, have become very concentrated.
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:38.700]   It has served them well in the past several years, but past is not necessarily prologue.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.740]   And so some investors, you know, could see actually lower expected returns than our central
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.420]   tendency because of those concentrated conditions.
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:52.700]   So that is a broad brush, but it's not bearish.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.460]   Lower expected returns, but that's in part because of what is going on in interest rates
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.300]   in general, which I think is a natural expectation.
[00:38:59.300 --> 00:39:00.300]   OK.
[00:39:00.300 --> 00:39:03.740]   Joe, actually, I'm looking over here at my monitor because we're actually getting some
[00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:04.740]   questions in.
[00:39:04.740 --> 00:39:09.100]   As we go deeper into the financial markets, I think we've got a question in that is interesting
[00:39:09.100 --> 00:39:15.020]   and maybe just to briefly set the context, the underlying philosophy of a true bobblehead
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.540]   is really to tune out the noise, particularly with the near term.
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:20.540]   Why?
[00:39:20.540 --> 00:39:26.680]   Why are these projections, when we think about either the near term or the 10 year, important?
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:31.260]   And when you think about it in longer term planning, the relevance of a, say, a one year
[00:39:31.260 --> 00:39:34.780]   or a 10 year outlook versus, you know, a longer term.
[00:39:34.780 --> 00:39:35.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.100]   And one of the reasons that I appreciate the question, Marie, you know, that's one of the
[00:39:39.100 --> 00:39:42.140]   reasons why even our outlook, we focus on 10 year numbers.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:47.780]   I mean, most of the industry, including many of our competitors, in fact, we're not even
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:51.180]   in some media surveys because they're one year outlooks.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:56.960]   So if you refuse to participate in them, that means we're not on TV as much, but so be it.
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:40:02.200]   Ten years is a, I think it's a relevant horizon, it's a very long horizon, but it's a relevant
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   horizon, say, for planning.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:07.880]   Now, for some, some, if I'm 22 years old and saying for retirement, it's well beyond the
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:11.840]   planning cycle, I think the outlook is less, it's less relevant.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:18.440]   But for many, they may have a 10 or 15 year planning horizon and the cornerstone of asset
[00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:23.040]   allocation, which is the cornerstone of Vanguard's investment philosophy, stay diversified, balanced
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.240]   long term.
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:29.560]   But one of the things that that divides in a portfolio and asset allocation, say between
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:34.480]   stocks and bonds, that is predicated and the foundation of that is based upon the expected
[00:40:34.480 --> 00:40:35.480]   returns.
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:39.860]   If one, I mean, that's the foundation of Vanguard's philosophy.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.860]   So you have to have a, what is a reasonable expected return?
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.920]   And so if we don't have this sort of outlook, what does one assume for a bond portfolio
[00:40:47.920 --> 00:40:51.840]   to my previous comments, right, Maria, should I assume historically, it would actually be,
[00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   could you share, it would not be responsible to say, you're going to get historical like
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   six or seven returns in fixed income, if I'm saving for the next 10 years, that means that
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:04.720]   I'm not going to be successful, the odds of me, that would mean the probability of me
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.680]   being successful in whatever invested saving and spending strategy I have as a retiree,
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:13.160]   as a saver, it's going to be miscalibrated.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.640]   And so we have a responsibility to say, what are reasonable ranges of expected returns
[00:41:17.640 --> 00:41:23.360]   that one can then plug into the investment problem or the investment goal one is trying
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   to achieve, right?
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:29.680]   It may not mean radical changes, but you know that, right, and even our advice units and
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:33.520]   our calculators on our website, how much do I need to save for retirement?
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:37.040]   How can I, how much can I spend safely in my retirement?
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:43.080]   That requires the expected returns being somewhat reasonable, not perfectly accurate.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   No one has that.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:49.680]   If you don't, no one has that, but certainly we have, and expected returns do vary through
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.680]   time.
[00:41:50.680 --> 00:41:54.280]   And so we have a responsibility to say, what is a reasonable range for that?
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:56.520]   Sometimes a little bit higher than historical averages.
[00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:59.160]   Sometimes they're a little bit lower than historical averages.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.600]   I think that's important to lay that information out there so that investors can make, you
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:08.560]   know, as intelligent, you know, decisions on their own certainty as possible in this
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.560]   world.
[00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.520]   And I, you know, we've done that for 10 years, I'm very proud of it because our first outlook
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:17.720]   10 years ago, there was many investors, very concerned to invest at all, given the financial
[00:42:17.720 --> 00:42:23.200]   crisis, the low, this new normal, and actually we were, you know, our outlook was saying,
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:29.160]   actually, we're going to have historical like returns in the equity market, stay invested,
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.560]   stick to the plan, and that forecast was generally accurate.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:38.440]   We didn't get the ups and downs along the way, but we got the end point, and that's
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:44.440]   important for planning purposes and doing risk return trade-offs with one client.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:49.320]   Yeah, no, I agree, Joe, I get these questions a lot, particularly for retirees, and we can
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:51.180]   talk more about that.
[00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:56.000]   But when you're doing long-term projections, it's fine to use a Monte Carlo simulation
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.920]   where you're looking at different outcomes.
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.440]   But if you are looking at in the next, you know, one to three to five years, how much
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:05.160]   I should be spending for my portfolio, it would be imprudent not to think about what
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.600]   the initial conditions are.
[00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:13.280]   It's risky to bank on higher-type return expectations when the portfolio isn't expected to produce
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   that.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.040]   Yeah, I sit on some investment committees, I imagine you have many clients or, you know,
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:19.040]   council clients.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:20.040]   Right.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:24.640]   Like, for example, what's, I'm a very conservative investor, but I'm trying to draw 4% for my
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:28.360]   portfolio over the next decade for spending.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:35.000]   Or some institutions I serve on, they have a fixed, they have a target of 4% spending.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.280]   How should they allocate their portfolio now?
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:38.280]   It may be different.
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.040]   In fact, it is different.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:46.040]   My council versus 25 years ago when they could have been 60/40 because of the bond return
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   component.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:51.240]   This does not mean that bonds don't have value, it just means a lower expected return.
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:56.760]   It may mean they either cannot spend 4% from their portfolio, they have to save more, I
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:59.240]   mean, that's one certain viable path.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.640]   Or they're going to have to, there's no magic bullet, they're going to have to take on more
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:05.480]   risk, which means more equity-like risk, perhaps 70/30, right?
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.280]   And let's talk about those trails, it's not one better than the other, let's just, let's
[00:44:10.280 --> 00:44:14.180]   look at the comfort level with that, the pros and cons of that.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:18.800]   And I think that's the sort of conversation that these sort of ranges of returns allow
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:20.440]   investors to have.
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:27.240]   Again, if one has a hundred year horizon or so, the initial conditions do not matter.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:31.380]   But for, again, for some investors that's appropriate, for many investors, anywhere
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:38.440]   from a horizon from five years to 15 or 20 years, then I think that's where our sort
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:42.080]   of planning projections, I think can be helpful.
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:43.080]   Right.
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:44.080]   Right.
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:49.800]   So, Joe, let's get a little deeper with our market outlook.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:56.940]   So US equity returns, we're looking at a projection, you know, not much unchanged from
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.000]   last year, right?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:06.020]   Anywhere around 3.7% to 5.7%, I believe, in terms of the 10-year forecast for equities.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:09.280]   Let's talk about that, I guess, in a couple of facets.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:14.840]   One, we would be remiss at a BogleHeads event if we do not discuss US versus international.
[00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.240]   So the projections are much more bullish than the national forecast.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:22.480]   So let's talk a little bit about what's causing that, what to expect, what to think about
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:25.680]   that in terms of diversification and asset allocation.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:30.820]   And that's, you know, that's one of those rich topics, Maria, you know, Jack and I used
[00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:31.820]   to talk about.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:38.040]   You know, he was not as big of a fan, certainly, or supporter of having, you know, non-US equity
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.040]   exposure.
[00:45:39.040 --> 00:45:40.480]   He wrote about it.
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:47.640]   I mean, obviously, the US market has been the strongest performing equity market among
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:49.680]   the highest in the world in the past five or 10 years.
[00:45:49.680 --> 00:45:53.080]   It's steadily outperformed non-US markets.
[00:45:53.080 --> 00:45:54.480]   But you know, past is not prologue.
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:59.280]   I mean, without doubt, the lowest volatility portfolio is a global portfolio.
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:05.920]   That does not mean, you know, that necessarily that US were out or underperformed depends
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:08.760]   upon where the fundamentals are.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:15.360]   We are expecting or projecting, more likely than not, that non-US equity markets will
[00:46:15.360 --> 00:46:18.160]   have somewhat higher expected returns going forward.
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.400]   It's not because of any sort of view on the US dollar, it's primarily because of where
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   valuations are.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:29.240]   And if you look at, particularly in the US growth arena, valuations are at pretty high
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:30.240]   levels.
[00:46:30.240 --> 00:46:32.440]   I mean, they're close to late 1990s.
[00:46:32.440 --> 00:46:38.200]   So if there, and there is, there's some, certainly some strong evidence historically that when
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:44.840]   you have these sort of, you know, dislocations or deviations, I should say, that over time
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:49.400]   they tend to, you know, conditionally they tend to converge.
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:57.000]   And so that is the primary reason why we anticipate non-US markets to have higher equity returns
[00:46:57.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   in the US.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:02.960]   It doesn't mean that US, you know, it's, it's not a negative view on the US economy.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.760]   It's not a negative view on US earnings.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:10.440]   It's the fact that the prices that investors are already paying for US fundamentals is
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:15.760]   markedly higher than they are for European companies, emerging market companies and Asian
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:24.240]   companies, and history shows that where we currently sit, you know, the risks are towards,
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:29.560]   it's one sense that the price is being paid for the rest of the world's growth is much
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.560]   cheaper today.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:35.360]   And so if you have a long-term orientation, and certainly I adhere to this, in our, in
[00:47:35.360 --> 00:47:40.800]   our, in many of our portfolios we provide clients, right, balance portfolios, have non-US exposure,
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   right.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.360]   And we can all debate what that, what that optimal one is.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:49.080]   But certainly have some non-US exposure is going to help on our return perspective.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:52.960]   I think it's prudent to have it, even if one doesn't expect part of the world to outperform
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:58.580]   the other, because it's about modest volatility reduction on average, but, you know, that,
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.400]   that is a component of our outlook.
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.560]   In fact, most parts of the, of the equity market globally, if they're outside of US
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:10.160]   technology companies are projected to modestly outperform.
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:16.080]   And we're not picking on that sector, it's just that those valuations are so extraordinary
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:20.820]   that it's, it's, it's, we've rarely, we have seen this before, but the times we've seen
[00:48:20.820 --> 00:48:26.360]   it before, you know, were the late 1920s and the late 1990s.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:31.960]   I'm not saying, and that's the, that's the one thing about today's global equity market.
[00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:38.160]   We've seen a fantastic performance of the past five or six months, but it has not been
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.160]   broad based.
[00:48:39.160 --> 00:48:43.760]   It isn't like every single company has, you know, has doubled in value.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:50.400]   It's, it's, so that's, that's good news in the sense of being broadly diversified, could
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.200]   help, you know, smooth out some of the underperformances, some companies that may have been starless.
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:48:59.360]   And I don't know what that time it is, I'm not picking on any one company, I'm just saying
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:03.440]   it's unlikely that all of them are going to continue to grow to the moon.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:09.040]   And so having the broad basket, I think you'll see if our forecast is right, companies that
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:14.960]   are more value oriented, particularly some outside the US, will play some catch up over
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   the next several years.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.040]   The timing, who knows, but over the course of the next five years, it's, it's highly
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.040]   likely.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:26.840]   You know, you beat me to that one, because we got that question before, Joe, around the,
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.720]   what are we going to get out of this value coma?
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:29.720]   It's been debating the industry.
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.720]   It is, yes.
[00:49:30.720 --> 00:49:35.360]   It's funny, I had the, I had the honor and the privilege to present to Vanguard's board
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.160]   of directors in December, it was on this topic, what's going on between growth and value.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:46.240]   We have a lot of our active managers in our Vanguard active funds, you know, you know,
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:51.800]   whether it's like, you know, many of our active managers, some of us have a value sort of
[00:49:51.800 --> 00:49:57.680]   orientation, they tend to buy stocks that are, you know, lower in price to book, you
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:05.040]   know, so today, some of those value type companies are in the financial banking sector, energy
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:10.560]   companies, some tied to face to face services, some of them have gotten absolutely hammered
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:17.760]   on a price relative to some, you know, large technology companies and, and, but the perplexion
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:23.240]   is that actually, for the past 10 years, growth companies on average have drastically outperformed
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.240]   value.
[00:50:24.240 --> 00:50:29.080]   So there's some in the industry actually questioning the value philosophy, which is actually a
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:37.160]   cornerstone of everything from Vanguard's generally active approach, and, and, and many
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.160]   academic research.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.080]   So there's a big debate, but my research I presented to the Vanguard board of directors
[00:50:43.080 --> 00:50:49.040]   was that you can explain not all but but a lot of values on a performance in part because
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:52.120]   of the sector dropping in inflation and interest rates.
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:58.760]   And so if we have a modest recovery is participating, value companies will generally, you know,
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:51:03.760]   come back a little bit, they may not completely, you know, recover all the relative on a performance.
[00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:09.520]   I mean, the US growth index is up by 40% over the US value index.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.560]   And that's, that's like, that's astronomical.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:18.040]   I mean, that's like, five years worth of historical like, stock returns squished in the one year
[00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:19.920]   on a relative basis.
[00:51:19.920 --> 00:51:26.560]   And we've rarely ever seen that dichotomy and, but and then over and above the fundamentals,
[00:51:26.560 --> 00:51:31.640]   those stocks have continued to outperform you when you control for things like secular
[00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:36.100]   change and platform effects and all these technology buzzwords.
[00:51:36.100 --> 00:51:42.080]   So I'm not saying that this is the, you know, the turning point when some of these value
[00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:46.520]   companies start to come back and contribute more quality to the equity market.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:52.200]   It's just that, you know, continued outperformance is unlikely at least over a five year basis.
[00:51:52.200 --> 00:51:58.520]   But, you know, that that, again, there's there's a lot of active managers, in part have underperformed
[00:51:58.520 --> 00:52:03.560]   in part because of the value premium, not really manifesting themselves in the equity
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.560]   market.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:05.560]   Okay.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.560]   All right, Joe, we've got a few minutes left.
[00:52:08.560 --> 00:52:09.560]   Time is flying.
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:15.600]   Let's um, let's just real quick talk about there's two things I want to touch upon.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:20.200]   One is we've talked about the bond environment, low yields.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.720]   What's the message to investors, particularly retirees who are looking to try to eke out
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:29.400]   extra yield either through, you know, credit or the yield curve?
[00:52:29.400 --> 00:52:30.920]   What are your briefly your thoughts there?
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:35.960]   Well, I'd say, you know, I think, again, the more that one tries to eke out the returns,
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:42.680]   I just the more one just is going to have to weather, you know, a month or two or a
[00:52:42.680 --> 00:52:48.160]   quarter to potentially where the nav drops a little bit because you're just we're going
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:52.360]   to we have we have credit spreads that are approaching, you know, whether it's municipal
[00:52:52.360 --> 00:52:56.880]   spreads over treasuries or corporate bond spreads over treasuries that are approaching
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:58.200]   close to historical hikes.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:53:03.080]   Yeah, there's still an expected return on a corporate bond portfolio or municipal bond
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:05.960]   portfolio is certainly higher than treasuries because of the risk there.
[00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.920]   But that doesn't that's not a free launch.
[00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:12.600]   And so that doesn't mean don't lose a message just means that you have a very low income
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   cushion as well.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:17.400]   Yield to maturity is fairly low, historically.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:22.440]   And so I think we all hope for a somewhat higher return from our bond portfolio.
[00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   That means that we're going to have to just look through, you know, period two where you
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:27.960]   have a slight drop in the nav.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   That's the natural reset.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   Right.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:35.240]   And you have less income cushion to absorb, you know, a modest rise in corporate spreads
[00:53:35.240 --> 00:53:40.240]   or municipal bond yields, right, particularly as the recovery continues.
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:46.640]   So, again, a healthy recovery means healthier bond returns for the five or 10 or 15 year
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:47.640]   period.
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:48.640]   Certainly that's what I'm hoping for.
[00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:51.680]   I mean, if we're here five years from now with the same interest rates, Maria, something
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:55.680]   has gone terribly wrong.
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:57.800]   And so I don't think anyone wishes that.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:02.600]   So the converse, though, is, OK, if I want higher expected returns, you know, no pain,
[00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:03.600]   no gain.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:04.600]   And I'm not talking about a lot of pain.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:09.440]   I'm just talking about some nav fluctuations as we kind of have a gradual rise in interest
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:11.520]   rates over the next several years.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:15.840]   So that's going to be a little bit different from, you know, the past.
[00:54:15.840 --> 00:54:19.920]   But I do know, particularly for conservative investors, that can be a little bit unnerving
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:24.480]   if they see the bond portfolio drop down in value for a little bit, right, because they're
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.480]   more conservative investments.
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:29.160]   Hey, I expect that from equity bonds, but I don't expect that from fixed income.
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:33.000]   Well, the more they're going to try to reach for yield then, particularly dabbling into
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.960]   high yield or emerging market, yeah, there's a higher risk premium because of the greater
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.960]   volatility.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:42.640]   But one, I just I hope they don't have the expectations for money market like returns
[00:54:42.640 --> 00:54:46.680]   without any volatility because we have a low income question.
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.960]   And so we just have to, you know, just have to be mindful that I know I'm prepared for
[00:54:49.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   that.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:54.800]   But we're going to have to talk to ourselves, I think, before they occur.
[00:54:54.800 --> 00:54:56.080]   And I think I'll generally be orderly.
[00:54:56.080 --> 00:54:59.160]   We won't have a massive spike in interest rates.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.160]   We're not.
[00:55:00.160 --> 00:55:01.160]   OK.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:02.160]   All right.
[00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:03.160]   Good.
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.160]   Thank you for that.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:05.160]   And then last thing.
[00:55:05.160 --> 00:55:06.160]   But we did get this question before.
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.160]   We get this question a lot.
[00:55:08.160 --> 00:55:09.160]   Bitcoin.
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:15.440]   Well, it's not a currency, I think the market's expecting it to be a future currency.
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:16.440]   I think it's debatable.
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:21.240]   I don't think, to be honest, I don't think many central governments will allow it to
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.000]   become legal tender.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:29.220]   I'm particularly skeptical that China or the United States would allow Bitcoin to usurp
[00:55:29.220 --> 00:55:32.320]   the U.S. dollar in Chinese renminbi.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:36.880]   The Bitcoin market is spitting in my face on that, to be blunt.
[00:55:36.880 --> 00:55:40.700]   However, it could very well become a collectible.
[00:55:40.700 --> 00:55:43.640]   I used to collect baseball cards.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:48.760]   If you collect the baseball cards or other, the Mickey Mantle baseball cards were worth,
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:50.740]   I think, over a million dollars in mint condition.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:56.440]   So it is not to say something that is very finite supply that is valued by a community.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.680]   It cannot have utility value.
[00:55:58.680 --> 00:56:03.000]   And collectibles generally have that, where my brother would say, I could care less if
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.240]   I had that baseball card.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.480]   That has utility for me.
[00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:07.600]   Others, it's Beanie Babe or something else.
[00:56:07.600 --> 00:56:10.040]   I don't mean to be dismissive of Bitcoin.
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.160]   It could have value.
[00:56:11.160 --> 00:56:15.800]   But I think, you know, but I've been shocked by its astronomical rise.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:20.640]   The one thing that's difficult with Bitcoin, Maria, is that it's very tough to argue what
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:21.760]   is its fundamental value.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:29.120]   But I can tell you that the cost to mine the coin is lower than today's price, right?
[00:56:29.120 --> 00:56:31.780]   And so that would suggest potentially it's overvalued.
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:36.320]   But again, I don't think it'll ever become legal tender.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:41.020]   That does not mean, however, that could mean the price could go closer to zero.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:46.120]   But it may mean it could still stay up well above zero because it becomes a sort of, when
[00:56:46.120 --> 00:56:50.680]   I say commodity, I think collectible is the more, the more, you know, there's value.
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:54.120]   But at the end of the day, it's just a piece of fabric, right?
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.400]   But the Picasso painting has some incredible value.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:57.400]   I just don't know.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   I mean, is it a Picasso?
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.360]   Is Bitcoin a Picasso?
[00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:04.440]   Or is it the thousands of paintings that are produced every day that have hardly any value?
[00:57:04.440 --> 00:57:05.440]   Right, right.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.440]   OK.
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   That's the heart of the question.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.440]   OK.
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:09.440]   OK, good.
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:10.440]   Thank you, Joe, for that.
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:11.440]   So, all right.
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:13.080]   So, of course, we run out of time.
[00:57:13.080 --> 00:57:16.920]   But I do want to have a little fun because I think our Boglehead friends are expecting
[00:57:16.920 --> 00:57:17.920]   a little fun, too.
[00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:20.640]   So, I want to start you with a quick lightning round of questions.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:21.640]   And I mean quick.
[00:57:21.640 --> 00:57:22.640]   OK.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   So, here we go, Joe.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:27.400]   What's the first media source that you go to in the morning when you log on?
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:29.000]   Barry Reynolds.
[00:57:29.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   OK.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.800]   What's the last book that you read?
[00:57:32.800 --> 00:57:33.800]   Life Fragility.
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:34.800]   OK.
[00:57:34.800 --> 00:57:35.800]   So, here's a good one.
[00:57:35.800 --> 00:57:40.840]   I came up with these this morning, in case you're wondering, Joe.
[00:57:40.840 --> 00:57:47.600]   So, what would Joe, the senior economist that you are today, tell Joe, the more junior economist
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:50.400]   that I met 15 years ago?
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:56.680]   Be more patient in one's personal life.
[00:57:56.680 --> 00:57:57.680]   Is your wife watching?
[00:57:57.680 --> 00:58:03.640]   I'm a very impatient person that has positives and negatives to it.
[00:58:03.640 --> 00:58:04.640]   OK.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.640]   All right.
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:10.880]   And lastly, sum up 2021 for us in one word.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:11.880]   Your days ahead.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:18.080]   If I were to ask this question of myself, I'd say hope.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:21.080]   All right.
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.080]   Thank you, Joe.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:23.800]   It's been a pleasure sharing this virtual stage with you.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:28.240]   And I thank the Bogleheads as well for their interest and their time.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:31.520]   So, Rick, I'll turn it back over to you.
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.520]   OK.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.800]   Well, thank you, Maria and Joe, for that great discussion.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:41.240]   It's always interesting to hear Vanguard's perspective on what's going on and particularly
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.800]   what might come forward.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:48.000]   This presentation has been recorded and it will be available soon on boglecenter.net.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:52.480]   And our next Boglehead speaker series live event will be next month.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:57.000]   And it will be a panel discussion from some of your favorite Boglehead experts.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.880]   So thank you, everyone.
[00:58:58.880 --> 00:59:02.280]   And we hope you have a safe and happy new year and see you next time.
[00:59:02.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:03.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:04.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   Bye-bye.
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:16.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
