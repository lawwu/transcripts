[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240]   A few days ago, I tweeted, "I will do as many pushups and pull-ups next 30 days as this tweet
[00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.840]   gets likes, retweets, and comments. No number is too high. Bring it." It got 20,000. So thank you,
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:23.280]   internet friends, for the love and the suffering. It was probably about four or more times the
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.960]   amount that I was mentally preparing myself for. In the name of health, I decided to spread that
[00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.440]   around across multiple bodyweight exercises, including pushups and pull-ups, but also squats,
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.000]   ab rollers, and running. One mile of running equals 42 pushups. Lex math. And, all happy with
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.440]   myself, I wrote to David Goggins, asking for his advice, thoughts on this challenge. If you don't
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.120]   know David Goggins, he, to me, is one of the toughest, most inspiring humans on the planet.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.080]   Retired Navy SEAL, ultra marathon runner, former record holder for the most pull-ups in 24 hours,
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:07.200]   author of the book, "Can't Hurt Me," that I highly recommend, especially the audiobook.
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.240]   Anyway, I asked him a few questions about this challenge, and he was kind enough to respond.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.440]   I'll interleave the clips into the video. So the first thing I did is I explained to him the
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.880]   challenge and the way I spread it around across multiple bodyweight exercises, and just asked him
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.600]   for his thoughts about what I'm doing. Well, I think it's a pretty good damn workout,
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:34.800]   but this is the issue right there, man. I believe that you told people on, I think it was Twitter,
[00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.040]   I'm not quite for sure, I think it was Twitter, that you would do pushups and pull-ups for the
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:50.320]   number of week retweets that you had. Now I'm hearing running, I'm hearing squats,
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.560]   I'm hearing, I am hearing pushups and pull-ups, but I'm hearing all kind of different other
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.680]   exercises. And you also told people that, guess what, bring it. No number's too high.
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.280]   But now I hear other exercises, so that must mean that there is a number too high.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.880]   So be careful what you wish for, my friend. So that being said, I would have stuck with the damn
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:24.960]   pushups and pull-ups and challenge yourself to the umpteenth degree of pain and suffering,
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.480]   and that would have really taught you a humongous lesson about yourself
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:35.440]   and everything else. But what you have here is also amazing, but it's nothing compared to
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:42.080]   what you had previously talked about. Well, there you have it. When David Goggins calls
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.320]   you out on your bullshit, you got to step up. So I'm going to do what I originally promised,
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.880]   which is the 20,000 pushups and pull-ups. And on top of that, I'll do my best to do also the other
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.200]   bodyweight exercises really for the sake of health. So we're talking about squats,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.320]   ab rollers, and running. The whole goal I wanted to do here is something that's healthy,
[00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.520]   but still pushes me to my limits physically and mentally, and allows me to build up a habit
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.600]   of doing some efficient exercises every day. You know, something that takes less than an hour,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.080]   but keeps me in pretty sharp, hard shape. That's what I'm going to do here. Certainly with 20,000
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.240]   pushups and pull-ups, that's a whole nother level. I don't know what's going to happen,
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.280]   but I will learn something about myself for sure. So I want to mention some of the reasons,
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.440]   some of the motivations of why I'm doing this challenge. So first is I didn't think too much
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.640]   about it. I just dived right in. I was actually just laying in bed and tweeted it out. I think
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.160]   some of the craziest, most fun, some of the most ambitious things we can take on in life
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.920]   sometimes can be just on a whim. So I'm decided on a whim, but I'm going to take it to completion.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.400]   Also, I wanted to do an exercise program that I've done often in the past that takes very little
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.920]   effort. So like being busy is not an excuse. It can take 20, 30 minutes a day just to get a hard
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:06.640]   workout in. You can do it at home. There's no excuse not to do it. The other thing is that
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.480]   travel is not an excuse because it's body weight. You can basically do it anywhere.
[00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.800]   You probably heard me talk a lot about it before, but I'm a huge believer in habits
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.320]   because habits remove the need for day-to-day motivations that can go up and down. I have a
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.520]   lot of research, work-related habits that are part of my life, but I wanted to get exercise
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.840]   as part of a daily routine in my life. I think especially in these times of the coronavirus and
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.320]   all the madness that's going on in the world, being healthy, making sure you're strengthening
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.080]   your immune system with good diet, good sleep, good exercise is really important for everybody.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.760]   Everybody's kind of locked up and it's easy to slack on the exercise. I wanted to motivate others
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.800]   perhaps to join me on getting their exercise back on, getting back out there, getting a little bit
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:57.920]   of movement every single day. Also, I wanted to harden up that muscle of doing a thing you don't
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:02.880]   want to do for that long period of time and getting it done. So I actually asked David,
[00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:09.360]   "What should I do when things get tough?" - This is a good fucking question, man,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.840]   because it's going to get fucking difficult day after day after day. That's the thing about what
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.920]   you're doing right now that's challenging is a lot of motherfuckers can sign up for the fucking
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.560]   one-day event. A lot of people do. A lot of these CEOs, a lot of these people who don't want to
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:32.560]   suffer as a living, who don't want to suffer as making it a habit, what they do is they go out
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:39.280]   and they recruit these people to put them through a two-day, three-day fucking challenge. Anybody can
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:45.840]   do that shit because your mind can process two or three fucking days of suck. What you're doing,
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:52.960]   my friend, is going to be damn near a month of suck. So basically, you're going to have a lot
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.000]   of days, especially in the morning time. The mornings when you wake up and your body says,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.960]   "Go fuck yourself because I don't fucking feel like doing this today," and you're going to look
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:07.680]   at it because you're running six miles a day, I believe. What's going to happen to your fucking
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.160]   ass is you're going to wake up in the morning and you're going to fucking do what I do. People
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.560]   think, "Oh, David Goggins just wakes the fuck up and he just gets his shit on. He gets his
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:24.720]   fuck out." No, I don't. I don't get up and get after it. I look at my shoes sometimes for hours.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:32.800]   I pass them. I go, I get something to drink. I go to the bathroom. I watch TV. I'll start doing
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.080]   some work. I look at those fucking shoes because my body's saying, "Go fuck yourself." So you have
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:46.800]   to be able to win the morning. You have to be able to not allow that to get too deep in your brain.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:55.440]   When things get really tough for you, when you're out there on day 17 and your knees are hurting,
[00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.080]   and your back is hurting, and your shoulders are hurting, and your elbow tendonitis, and
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:06.880]   all kinds of shit going on, you got to start remembering your resume. A lot of people don't
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:14.160]   remember what the fuck they've accomplished in life. At that time of suffering, you have to be
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:21.520]   able to fucking go through and pull up that fucking "Who the fuck I am" resume and say, "Oh,
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:29.360]   for you, I'm sure you studied your fucking ass off for hours and days and years to get where
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:35.840]   you're at. I guarantee you did shit harder than this." And that's basically what you have to go
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:42.480]   back to, but it's hard to do because in that moment of suffering, all you can fucking think
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:47.600]   about is getting the fuck out of it. So you got to take that one second to pull yourself out of
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:54.320]   that suffering to have a clear fucking thought. It's hard to have clear thoughts in the midst
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:02.720]   of extreme pain and suffering. Find that clear thought. Remind yourself of what you've been
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.600]   through back in the past, back in the day, to get to where you're at today. So that's what I do
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:14.320]   is a counselor reminder. And then through that process, I guarantee you your mind and body will
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:21.280]   say, "Oh, we got this. We've been here before." Maybe not in that kind of pain and suffering,
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:27.440]   but we've been here before in the demons of your own mind. So that's the best reminder in the world.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:33.920]   All right. So what I'm going to attempt, what I'm going to do is 20,000 pushups and pull-ups
[00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:40.720]   combined. And on top of that, I'm also going to do squats, ab rollers, and run six miles every day.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:48.320]   So the routine is this, run six miles and then do 34 rounds of the following, 15 pushups,
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:56.800]   five pull-ups, five ab rollers, and 10 squats, just over and over 34 times a day. I might split
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:03.440]   it up three times a day. I might do it twice a day. I might do it just one in a day. My plan is
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:09.760]   to do the hardest one early on in the day, try to get as much done as possible, most likely about
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:16.400]   14 rounds, and then do another 10 and 10 later on in the day. The goal is for each round like that
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:24.800]   to take about two minutes. So for 34 rounds, that's 68 minutes. So the start is tomorrow,
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.760]   Wednesday, June 10th, going on for 30 days after that. So let me quickly do a round
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:32.560]   to give you a sense of the form and then talk about it.

[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   So there you have it, that's one round.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:36.960]   The hope for that is to take about a minute
[00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.960]   and the total is two minutes, so you get a break
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:40.960]   of about a minute between each session.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   Obviously good form is important.
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.960]   There's always going to be a keyboard warrior out there,
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.960]   I'm looking at you,
[00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:48.960]   with some sweatpants in their mom's basement
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   with Cheetos all over the place,
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.960]   way out of shape,
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.960]   who's going to comment about the fact that the pushups
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   aren't all the way down or aren't all the way up
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   and the same with the pull-ups, so on and so forth.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   None of that matters.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.960]   Good form, in this case,
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   for a pushup and a pull-up
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:06.960]   is something that minimizes
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:08.960]   the risk of injury.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:10.960]   I think this whole thing is a tough workout,
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:12.960]   to be honest.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   Yesterday and the day before,
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960]   I did over 400,
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   which I was trying to see, is this even possible?
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   Can I do 680 total
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   pushups and pull-ups in a day?
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:24.960]   It seems like an insane number to me.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   So I did 400
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   and it was tough,
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.960]   but doable,
[00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   and I think if 400 is doable,
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.960]   then 680 is too.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   I think I can
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.960]   certainly, with a little bit of suffering,
[00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   do it for a few days.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   If I can be fortunate enough to avoid injury,
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   the rest of the month is just mental.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   That's where the battle is.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.960]   That's where all the good lessons have to be learned.
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:50.960]   So I also asked David,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   by the way, there's a laptop over here,
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.960]   that's why I'm looking over here.
[00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:56.960]   I also asked David about the fact
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.960]   that some people
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:00.960]   might join in on this challenge
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:02.960]   in whatever capacity they can
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:04.960]   and what he recommends
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.960]   for me and for others
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.960]   to stay injury-free while still
[00:12:08.960 --> 00:12:10.960]   pushing their body and their mind to the limit.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:12.960]   Well, this challenge, you're going to get injured.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:14.960]   If you don't have a good base,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.960]   like for instance, if you don't do
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.960]   a lot of pull-ups, a lot of pushups,
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   what you do
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:22.960]   for both is you're
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   utilizing
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   these elbows, which you get
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:28.960]   tendonitis severely bad,
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.960]   and your shoulders.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   So with the pushup, you're here,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   this is your hinge part.
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.960]   Yeah, you are using your chest, using your triceps,
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:38.960]   but this hinge is being
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:40.960]   used an awful lot, this elbow hinge.
[00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.960]   These shoulders are being
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   used an awful lot, even the pull-up
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.960]   motion is being used an awful lot.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:48.960]   So basically,
[00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:50.960]   what happens is you're going to get
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   injured. So
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   for a lot of you, I would
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.960]   definitely suggest doing a lot more
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   squats, do a lot more
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   abs, doing things like
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.960]   that, even abs, you can injure your abs, but
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   going from zero to hero,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   you will have some
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:08.960]   injuries, and
[00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.960]   you got this isom,
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   try to get your body to recover as fast
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:14.960]   as possible, taking in proteins,
[00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   taking in aminos,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.960]   things like that, getting as much rest as you
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.960]   can, but you're going to get over
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   overused
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   training issues with your body.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   That just comes with the, it's just nature of the beast.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.960]   And like I said, those of you who start
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   to get injured, start doing
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   those, start making those squats,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   you know, your
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   go-to because your legs
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:38.960]   can handle so much. When I was doing
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   the pull-up record, people wondered
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   why that was so hard for me.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   First of all, I had a jacked-up body
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   when I was doing it, a very
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   I guess out of alignment
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   body, but your only contact
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:52.960]   point is your hands.
[00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:54.960]   And there's been times
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:56.960]   in 200-mile races
[00:13:56.960 --> 00:13:58.960]   where I tore my quad, completely
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:00.960]   tore my quad, I was able
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:02.960]   to bandage it up and walk
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.960]   it out. I was able to walk 75 miles.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.960]   So that's the thing, your
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.960]   legs can handle a lot of
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.960]   abuse, a lot of abuse.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:12.960]   So when you start hurting, go to your legs.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:14.960]   So there you have it.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.960]   Don't use any kind of injury
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.960]   as an excuse to stop
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.960]   moving, stop exercising, just
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.960]   find an alternative exercise that doesn't
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:24.960]   hurt. I'm going to really try
[00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.960]   to stick to the push-up and pull-up and do
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.960]   everything I can to remain injury-free.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:30.960]   For me, a part of
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:32.960]   avoiding injury is
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.960]   stretching really well, also
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.960]   doing good warm-up. For me, I'm doing
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.960]   the six-mile run before
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.960]   doing the bodyweight exercises.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.960]   Also, obviously
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:44.960]   nutrition is important.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   Everybody has their own journey.
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   I've dieted
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   my whole life all kinds of ways.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:52.960]   I did combat sports my whole life, so
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   cutting weight and performing optimally
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   was always important.
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:58.960]   For me, whatever you think about it,
[00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:00.960]   the main
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:02.960]   diet that I've come to enjoy
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.960]   is either keto
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:06.960]   or carnivore, so primarily a meat-based
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.960]   diet, meat and fat, very low
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   carb. So mostly for me, that
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   just means ground beef,
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.960]   sometimes steak, and
[00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.960]   keto-friendly, low-carb snacks
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   here and there. Nutrition-wise,
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   it's pretty basic, but I do take
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:22.960]   some stuff. I take
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   sodium in my food,
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   so I put quite a bit of salt
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   in there, magnesium.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   Also, I take fish oil
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.960]   and pill form, not much, like two or
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   three fish oil pills
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.960]   a day and an emaldivitamin.
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.960]   That's it. It would be, of course,
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.960]   awesome if other folks, if you
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:42.960]   decided to join in on this challenge, at
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.960]   whatever level you want, it would just be fun
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   to do push-ups and pull-ups together,
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:48.960]   or any kind of difficult exercise,
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:50.960]   activity
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:52.960]   that will challenge you.
[00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:54.960]   Do it every single day. If you haven't ramped
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:56.960]   up to it, you haven't done it much,
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.960]   what I would recommend is
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.960]   to start very low to where
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:02.960]   almost you're comfortable, and
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   then increase it day by day to when
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960]   you quickly become uncomfortable.
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.960]   But give your body time to adjust. That's
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.960]   really important. Again, the
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   point here is to do
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:14.960]   a difficult exercise,
[00:16:14.960 --> 00:16:16.960]   but really is to do it for 30 days.
[00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:18.960]   And what I'm doing,
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   and I hope you do as well, it's not just for
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.960]   30 days. For 30 days you do
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:24.960]   something difficult, but you form that
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:26.960]   habit and you stick to it
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:28.960]   for months to
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   come. Especially in these times, exercise
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   is just so important for staying
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.960]   healthy and staying sane.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:36.960]   I'd love it if you joined in on the challenge.
[00:16:36.960 --> 00:16:38.960]   I'll have a spreadsheet
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:40.960]   linked in the description where I'll keep
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.960]   track of the reps that I'm doing
[00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   on a daily basis, just so you can follow
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.960]   along. You can also just copy that spreadsheet
[00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   and use it for yourself
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   to track your own numbers.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.960]   Share it with me on any of the social platforms.
[00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.960]   I'd love to see your progress.
[00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:56.960]   I'll also maybe
[00:16:56.960 --> 00:16:58.960]   go live on one of the platforms,
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.960]   Instagram, YouTube,
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:02.960]   on our Discord server,
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:04.960]   Twitter, I don't know.
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   I don't know if there's interest in that.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   I'll be honest, I tried Instagram
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   live a couple of days ago
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   to work out, and it was a little weird
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.960]   for me to work out while other people watch, so I'm not
[00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:16.960]   sure. But maybe if there's interest, let me know.
[00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.960]   Maybe I can take a few questions about
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.960]   the challenge. I'll probably record
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   a video throughout the month and just
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   publish it at the end. So with
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   that, I'd like to thank David Goggins.
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   I follow him on Instagram, and he's
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:30.960]   a constant reminder that
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   I need to push
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   myself to my limit,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.960]   mentally. I asked him,
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.960]   of course, whether
[00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.960]   he'd want to be a guest on the podcast.
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.960]   Let's see what he had to say.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:44.960]   No problem, man.
[00:17:44.960 --> 00:17:46.960]   I love what you do.
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   I've seen some of your work.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:50.960]   You're an extremely intelligent guy.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:52.960]   So your intelligence,
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   and I see that you're willing
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   to go the next
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   mile. So you're willing to be
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   a guy that is just not...
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:02.960]   Alright, so for instance, when I was in the military,
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   they said, "You better be real smart
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   or you better fucking be
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.960]   real hard."
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.960]   I was the real hard guy,
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   and I had to develop the smarts.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:14.960]   I see that you're a really smart
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   guy, and you're developing the hard.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   So I think that
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   we can really have a good
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   podcast together. It'd be a pretty
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   interesting conversation.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   So there you have it. It's on.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:28.960]   I think I'm recording this
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   video, but most of this journey is
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   quiet. It's on my own. It's with myself.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   It's a quiet journey of suffering.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   So yes, it's a way to get
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.960]   exercise back in my life,
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   but it's really a chance to
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   rediscover myself by doing something
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.960]   really, really difficult for
[00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.960]   a prolonged period of time.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   No matter what,

[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   and stay hard.
