[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.380]   Well, today, Pastor John and I fly west to Portland, along with others on the Desiring
[00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.160]   God team for a gathering of our ministry partners in the Pacific Northwest, surrounded by the
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.780]   beauties of the Columbia River Gorge.
[00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.060]   I am always looking forward to that trip and certainly looking forward to seeing and thanking
[00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.820]   in person a number of financial donors who listen to this podcast and who pray for and
[00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.820]   support our labors here.
[00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.700]   But before we head out, we have a question about junk food.
[00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.200]   A young man writes in to ask it, "Dear Pastor John, I'm from Singapore.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:40.140]   If we are about to eat a meal we know is unhealthy, like fried chicken or fast food that will
[00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.500]   not serve our bodies like more healthy food will, should we pray and thank God for the
[00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.340]   food or is our praying over this food a phony act because the food itself will wrong the
[00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.740]   body he gave to us to care for?
[00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.700]   How should we think of gratitude and junk food?"
[00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.700]   Oh, good question.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:08.860]   Here's my answer in a couple of sentences, and then I'm going to just kind of ramble.
[00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.060]   I want to talk Bible here, but kind of hard, but you'll see if it helps.
[00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.060]   Here's my answer.
[00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.500]   To the degree that you are justified in eating something, to that degree you are justified
[00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.260]   in giving thanks for it.
[00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.940]   That's my short answer.
[00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:33.100]   Or to say it another way, to the degree that your conscience is clear in eating something,
[00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.980]   to that degree your thankfulness can be offered with a clear conscience.
[00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:45.060]   Or to put it one more way, if your heart is divided, partially approving and partially
[00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.420]   disapproving, when you eat something, then your heart is going to be divided when you
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.980]   attempt to give thanks.
[00:01:53.980 --> 00:02:01.580]   Now see whether or not these passages—I'm going to just refer to a couple of passages—see
[00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.380]   whether or not they shed light on the issue.
[00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.700]   Consider the temptations of Jesus in the wilderness in Matthew 4.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.580]   Satan suggests, "Turn these stones into bread.
[00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:16.700]   Jump off the temple.
[00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.700]   Bow down and worship me."
[00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.580]   Now the first two temptations are based on perfectly legitimate expectations of God's
[00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   favor.
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.220]   God will nourish with bread.
[00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.940]   God will keep his feet from crashing into the pavement below.
[00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.540]   The Bible says so.
[00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.500]   Presumably then, Jesus would be able to give heartfelt thanks for these good gifts of God's
[00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.900]   provision and protection.
[00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.900]   So go ahead, Jesus, and act in a way that creates an occasion for a great thanksgiving.
[00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.820]   And he won't do it.
[00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.140]   The possibility of thanksgiving does not carry the day.
[00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.380]   In other words, can I do something because I can give thanks for it?
[00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.380]   It doesn't carry the day.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.620]   The argument doesn't suffice.
[00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:13.340]   There are other factors that make the miracles here unadvisable.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.460]   Jesus is on a path of suffering on his way to the cross.
[00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.980]   That's what's in front of him.
[00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.220]   It's not a path of self-serving miracles.
[00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:32.100]   It does not matter that God's goodness and power might be shown turning stones to bread
[00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.980]   and catching the sun as he falls.
[00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.900]   It doesn't matter that Jesus could have rejoiced and given thanks for those miracles.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:47.340]   They were off limits because of the path assigned to Jesus.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:54.440]   So I commend that we reflect on that in relation to what's permitted in one sense but maybe
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.980]   not advisable for other reasons.
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:00.240]   First Corinthians 10, think about this.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.580]   When Paul was dealing with whether Christians should eat meat that had been offered to idly,
[00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:12.460]   he argued like this, "The earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof."
[00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.540]   Every food he made.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:21.980]   If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is
[00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.380]   set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
[00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:35.580]   In other words, the food that is being set before you belongs to the Lord of the earth.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:40.220]   The Lord is your Father and this is a gift from him.
[00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:46.900]   If you receive it from him with thankfulness, it's good whether he has been, whether it
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.380]   has been offered to idols or not.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.940]   Then he continues like this, "But if someone says, 'This has been offered in sacrifice,'
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:00.460]   then don't eat it for the sake of the one who informed you."
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:09.180]   And then he adds this argument, "If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.220]   of that for which I give thanks?"
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:17.780]   Now, this is relevant to the question, it seems, because it's an argument that isn't
[00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:18.780]   really necessary.
[00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.700]   I mean, he just adds it on.
[00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.180]   He's already settled the issue, but he adds it.
[00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:32.020]   And what it seems to add is this, if you regard something as questionable, not certainly evil
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:40.460]   or certainly good, but something where true believers may disagree with each other like
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:47.900]   they were disagreeing in Corinth, then the issue of genuine thankfulness becomes relevant.
[00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.780]   Let me read it again.
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:56.860]   If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:02.260]   So my thankfulness is morally relevant here on this questionable issue.
[00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.700]   So Paul is arguing like this.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:09.940]   Here is my brother doing something that seems questionable to me, say, like eating something
[00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.100]   that I regard as less than most healthy, and he has a genuine heartfelt thankfulness to
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:18.580]   God for what he's eating.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:28.420]   Therefore my attitude should be to rejoice that his heart is good toward God, and leave
[00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:34.300]   to God and his conscience whether eating the questionable food is sinful or not.
[00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.300]   Let me read that sentence again.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:43.460]   If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
[00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.820]   In other words, the thankfulness itself is part of the reason for not denouncing the
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.540]   action, and that's kind of what our friend was asking about.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.100]   The next verse says, "So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all to the
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.700]   glory of God."
[00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:05.780]   This is Paul's final criterion for eating every kind of food.
[00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:12.580]   Is my eating of this food an expression for how much I value the glory of God?
[00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:14.500]   I'm content in the glory of God.
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.580]   I esteem the glory of God.
[00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:23.100]   And this verse speaks to the one who is watching the person eat, as well as addressing the
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:24.380]   eater himself.
[00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:29.820]   If the eater is supposed to eat and drink in a way that gives glory to God, then the
[00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:36.740]   watching person is also supposed to assess his eating and drinking in a way that glorifies
[00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.740]   God.
[00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:44.900]   And this raises the difficult issue, not only of what is in the eater's heart, but
[00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:53.300]   also what food is really off limits for one who would eat to the glory of God.
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:08:01.780]   And I'm highly skeptical that we can judge with confidence what foods are certainly junk
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.580]   and what are not.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.100]   That may be heresy to some people, but that's my skepticism.
[00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:12.540]   What foods damage health and what foods serve health?
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.340]   What foods are more or less neutral?
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:24.060]   My guess is that when it comes to eating this food or that, we are in greater spiritual
[00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:30.900]   danger of judging people where we shouldn't than we are in physical danger of eating what
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:31.900]   we shouldn't.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:39.900]   So, summing up, Jesus says that just because you give thanks for a divine gift doesn't
[00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:42.660]   mean you should take it.
[00:08:42.660 --> 00:08:49.460]   And Paul says, if you can give thanks for something that is not clearly wrong, better
[00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:52.780]   to rejoice in the thanks than to condemn the wrong.
[00:08:52.780 --> 00:08:55.140]   Yeah, very, very interesting connection.
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.600]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:00.980]   And thank you, APJ listeners, for sending in excellent questions and for listening regularly.
[00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.980]   We really appreciate it.
[00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:06.220]   To find our archives, read transcripts of episodes, or to ask us a question, go to our
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:11.420]   online home at DesiringGod.org/AskPastorJohn.
[00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:15.960]   We addressed the topic of cremation on the podcast back in episode 874.
[00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:20.900]   We addressed the topic of giving the body to science back in episode 406.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:24.980]   But what about if you give your body to science and that program cremates the remains they
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.940]   don't need or use by way of a standard policy?
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:31.260]   That question has not been answered, and it's next time.
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:33.980]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke, and we will see you on Monday.
