[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020]   Like buses, AI news can sometimes be slow and sometimes arrive all at once.
[00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.680]   In the last few days we have had dramatic new leaked insights into the sheer breadth
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.080]   of Google's Gemini. Just today we've had the release of Meta's Code Llama and earlier their
[00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:26.240]   impressive multilingual seamless M4T model. And last but definitely not least, this 88 page
[00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.640]   AI consciousness report. And yes, I read it all, it's juicy so I'm saving that for the end.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.620]   But let's start with two major paywalled articles, one from the Information and one from the New
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.000]   York Times, about Google's Gemini model. From both of them I counted a total of 9 new revelations,
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.360]   so let's get straight to it. To give you a sense of timeline by the way, Google's newly merged AI
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.040]   SWOT team they call it, is preparing for a big fall or autumn launch. The takeaway
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.360]   for me from both articles is that Gemini is going to be the everything model. Did you
[00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.240]   know it's going to be the rival to Midjourney and Stable Diffusion? Midjourney only has
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.960]   11 full time staff so it is more than plausible that Google's Gemini could outperform Midjourney
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.940]   version 5. Next we may be able to create graphics with just text descriptions and control software
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.840]   using only text or voice commands. These next two are speculation so I'm not even
[00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.660]   counting them in the list of leaks. But I've already covered in a previous video that Gemini
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.780]   has been trained on YouTube video transcripts. And the speculation is that by integrating video
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.880]   and audio into Gemini, it could perhaps help a mechanic diagnose a problem with a car repair
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.340]   based on a video. Or be a rival to Runway ML by generating advanced text to video based on
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.080]   descriptions of what a user wants to see. You can start to see why I'm beginning to think of it as
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.340]   the everything model.
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:00.520]   Another leak is that one of the co-founders of Google, Sergey Brin is working on the front
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.860]   lines of Google Gemini. And lastly from this article I found it really interesting that
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:11.640]   Google's lawyers have been closely evaluating the training and they made researchers remove
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.040]   training data that had come from textbooks. Even though those textbooks helped the model
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.360]   answer questions about subjects like astronomy or biology. And I do wonder if they privately
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.440]   benchmarked Gemini before removing that crucial data.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:33.000]   But if that's not enough, prepare to also receive life advice. My theory here is that Google wants to compete
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.780]   directly for market share with Inflection's pie. What if you want scientific, creative or professional
[00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.500]   writing? Yep, they're working on that too. In fact, we already know that Google has software
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.460]   named Genesis that they're pitching to the New York Times, which can generate news articles,
[00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:55.240]   rewrite them, suggest headlines, etc. But some people will be more interested in this feature that
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:00.780]   Google DeepMind is working on. The ability to draft critiques of an argument and generate quizzes,
[00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.880]   word and number puzzles. It's almost easier at this point to ask what might Google Gemini not
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.200]   be able to do. And yes, this is not Gemini, but Google DeepMind is also using AI to design the
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.260]   next generation of semiconductors. But if the fall seems far away, how about today when we got
[00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.040]   Code Llama from Meta? I spent much of the last two hours reading most of the 47 page
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:31.040]   paper and you can see Code Llama in action on screen. Some highlights include that the Code Llama
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:37.020]   models provide stable generations with up to 100,000 tokens of context. Obviously, that could
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.240]   be used for generating longer programs or providing the model with more context from your code base
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.580]   to make the generations more relevant. It comes in three versions, Code Llama, Code Llama Instruct,
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.660]   which can better understand natural language instructions, and Code Llama Python,
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.840]   better, of course, at Python. It's available for commercial
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.880]   use. And as you can see, some of the versions rival GPT 3.5 on human eval. That top score of
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:09.340]   53.7% on Passat1 puts it in the same ballpark as Phi1. I've actually done a full video on Phi1,
[00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.860]   so do check that out. But that got 50.6%. But it is about 25 times smaller at 1.3 billion parameters.
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.980]   Interestingly, the Code Llama paper, which also came out about two hours ago,
[00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:24.780]   mentions Phi1 directly, saying that it follows in a similar,
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.680]   similar spirit, but the difference is that Phi1 is closed source.
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:34.140]   Anyway, a couple more interesting things before we move on from Code Llama. And the first one
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.080]   is the self-instruct method that they use. Let me know if you also find this fascinating,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.020]   because step one was to generate 62,000 interview-style programming questions by
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:50.320]   prompting Llama2, the 70 billion parameter model. Then they removed duplicates in step two.
[00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.720]   But here's where it gets interesting. For each of those questions, they first generated a unit test,
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:05:01.260]   by prompting Code Llama 7 billion parameters. Then they generated 10 Python solutions by prompting
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.800]   Code Llama. Finally, they ran unit tests on those 10 solutions, and they added the first solution
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:11.600]   that passes those tests, along with the corresponding question and test, to the self-instruct
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:16.900]   dataset. If that sounded a bit complicated, let me try to distill it a bit. They asked the big brother
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.680]   Llama2 model to generate questions, then got the little brother Code Llama to generate tests for
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.720]   those questions. Then they added the little brother Code Llama to generate tests for those questions.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.140]   Then got the model to generate solutions to its own tests, found the good solutions that don't
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:35.860]   forget it produced, and then used those to further train the model. To be honest, synthetic data and
[00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.360]   self-instruct seem to be the future of feedback. One final interesting quote from the paper on
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.600]   safety, and that was an argument advanced by one of their red teamers. They made the point that
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:54.240]   various scripts and code is readily available on mainstream public websites, hacking forums, or the
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.640]   web. And the advanced malware development is beyond the current capabilities of available LLMs. And even
[00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:06.400]   an advanced LLM paired with an expert malware developer is not particularly useful at the moment,
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.100]   as the barrier is not typically writing the malware code itself. Let me know what you think in the
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.980]   comments. But we must move on to Seamless M4T released a couple of days ago from Meta, which
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:24.640]   frankly seems amazing for multilingual translation. That speech to text, speech to text, speech to text
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:32.640]   to speech, text to text, and more. It has speech recognition for nearly 100 languages and can output in 36
[00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:35.840]   languages. But there's one feature I find particularly cool.
[00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:43.340]   Now, let's talk about code switching. Code switching happens when a multilingual speaker
[00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.840]   switches between languages while they're speaking. Our model Seamless M4T automatically
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.600]   recognizes and translates more than one language when mixed in the same sentence. As a multilingual
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:07:00.640]   speaker, this is a very exciting capability for me. I often switch from Hindi to Telugu when I speak
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:05.100]   with my dad. Notice in the following example when I change languages.
[00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:17.940]   I can speak Hindi, Telugu, and English. Sometimes, I can use all three languages in one sentence.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:24.560]   I can speak Hindi, Telugu, and English. Sometimes, I use English. Sometimes, I use English. Sometimes, I
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.860]   use all three languages in one conversation.
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:35.260]   Speaking of cool though, we had this epic story out yesterday. AI gave a paralyzed woman her voice back.
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:41.900]   In a moment, you're going to see her being plugged in to the model. There we go. And the short version
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:48.260]   is that this woman suffered a stroke that left her unable to speak. But now, for the first time,
[00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:54.520]   her speech and facial expressions can be synthesized from her brain signals. Decoding these
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:59.860]   signals into text at nearly 80 words per minute, up from 14 words per minute.
[00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:06.720]   But let's now end on this, an 88-page report on consciousness in artificial intelligence, which counts as one of its
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:14.060]   co-authors, Yoshua Bengio, the Turing Award winner. It was dense and quite technical, but well worth the read.
[00:08:14.060 --> 00:08:16.680]   Look at this sentence in just the abstract.
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:24.480]   "Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to build
[00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:28.020]   AI systems which satisfy these indicators."
[00:08:28.020 --> 00:08:39.020]   These are the indicators and each one gets a few pages in the report. And the reason that they're split up is because each one rests on a certain theory of consciousness.
[00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:46.640]   Obviously, the key problem is that we don't have a consensus theory on what consciousness is or how it comes about.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:54.440]   So in a way, to hedge their bets, they group in different theories and look at the kind of indicators that would satisfy each one.
[00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:59.680]   Let's say that list seems so theoretical, why not just test the model or even ask the model?
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.940]   For more on that approach, see my theory of mind video.
[00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:12.440]   But the problem is, as they say on page four, the main alternative to a theory heavy approach is to use behavioral tests for consciousness.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:20.740]   But as I talked about in the other video, that method is unreliable because AI systems can be trained, of course they are, to mimic human behaviors,
[00:09:20.740 --> 00:09:23.340]   are working actually in very different ways.
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.400]   Essentially, LLMs are the most efficient way to manipulate human behavior.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:25.940]   They can be used to manipulate the behavior of other people.
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:27.240]   They can be used to manipulate other people's behavior.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.240]   They can be used to manipulate other people's behavior.
