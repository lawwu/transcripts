[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Here's an interesting follow-up to what we talked about yesterday.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.360]   A listener writes in to ask this, "Pastor John, my beautiful girlfriend is questioning
[00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.600]   God's goodness.
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.360]   She is a religion major and understands that God can do whatever He wants, and that goodness
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:23.860]   to Him is whatever He wants it to be.
[00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:29.320]   Just like how we saw it was good to see His Son on the cross, or good to have Stephen
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:35.840]   killed, she lives in constant fear that God will have her injured or disabled and count
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.840]   it as good.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.080]   I don't know what to say, but I thought you could help me."
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:49.160]   She is certainly not irrational to tremble at the absolute sovereignty of God over her
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.160]   life.
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:58.840]   It is true, as she says, that God can do whatever He wants.
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.280]   Indeed, He does do whatever He wants.
[00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:08.780]   Psalm 115, verse 3, "Our God is in the heavens; He does all that He pleases."
[00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.440]   The person who does not tremble at this has simply not faced up to the power of God greater
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:28.280]   than a billion hydrogen bombs or the holiness of God, a purity burning like a million galaxies.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:36.760]   Or the mystery of God acting in ways that none but He can fathom.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:40.840]   She's not irrational to tremble before such a God.
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.420]   She would be crazy if she didn't.
[00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:56.160]   Maybe one fruitful place to start would be with her statement, "Goodness to God is
[00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.280]   whatever He wants it to be."
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:05.680]   Now, I know this is coming through her boyfriend and may not be precisely what she thinks,
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.440]   but then again, maybe it is.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.320]   What I hear in those words, "What is goodness to God is whatever He wants it to be," what
[00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:25.240]   I hear in those words is a heavy emphasis on God's sovereign freedom seen as a divine
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.640]   arbitrariness.
[00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.840]   And there seems to be perhaps a tinge of cynicism, and this may be what he's concerned about.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.760]   Here's one piece of counsel that I would offer when dealing with the various attributes of
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:54.120]   God like His freedom and sovereignty and power and goodness and wisdom and grace and patience
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.200]   and justice and wrath and so on.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:07.440]   The counsel is, keep these attributes in living, dynamic relation to each other.
[00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:16.200]   Let each one have its emotional and intellectual effect on each of the others.
[00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:25.080]   And the best way to do this is to keep our hands on the texture of Scripture itself.
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.200]   If all is feeling rough and sandpapery under our fingers, make sure we move our hands around
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:39.080]   the Scriptures to feel the smooth parts or the moist parts or the soft and tender parts
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.320]   or the jagged parts.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:49.240]   It's the mixture of the sensations that create the truest feeling for God.
[00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:59.760]   Specifically, in this case, if God's goodness starts to seem utterly arbitrary—Jesus gets
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:06.000]   killed, Stephen gets killed, James gets killed, Peter goes free, and in our lives one child
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:14.720]   lives and another child dies—when God's goodness starts to seem arbitrary, we need
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.840]   to remember God's wisdom alongside it, in and through it.
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.920]   Oh, the depth of the riches and the wisdom and the knowledge of God.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:30.280]   How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable are his ways.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.960]   Who has known the mind of the Lord?
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.000]   Who has ever been his counselor?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.340]   Nobody.
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.840]   So we preach to ourselves the wisdom of God's sovereignty.
[00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.540]   It's not willy-nilly.
[00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.960]   It's not capricious.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:55.360]   It's not exactly right for her to say the goodness to God is whatever he wants it to
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.800]   be.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.120]   That seems to isolate the want-to, whatever he wants it to be.
[00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:10.360]   It isolates the want-to of God as though it were not connected to the wisdom of God.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.600]   No, his goodness is not merely whatever he wants it to be.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.480]   It is what it is in accord with infinite wisdom.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:26.120]   It is what it is in accord with the revelation of the grace of Christ.
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:32.400]   It is what it is in relation to the totality of God's repeated revelation as a God ready
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.400]   to forgive, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, abounding in steadfast love.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:44.720]   And if we start to disconnect any one of these attributes into its own little sector, it's
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.440]   going to go bad on us.
[00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.680]   It's going to start feeling like something we don't really like.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:06:02.880]   So encourage her not to spin out seemingly rational inferences from one divine attribute
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:03.880]   or another.
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.580]   Rather, encourage her to constantly bring them together.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:17.060]   The glory of God is not found in dissecting his perfections into separate parts, but in
[00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:23.860]   seeing them whole and keeping them in connection with each other.
[00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:29.020]   One final way of doing that to suggest.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:37.060]   Encourage her to ponder the stories of the Bible whose clear intention is to show the
[00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:45.420]   inscrutable ways of God leading through suffering to amazingly wonderful ends.
[00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:53.180]   I think of the story of Joseph in Genesis and how his years and years of sorrow were
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.660]   designed for the salvation of Israel and for his own great power and joy.
[00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:08.220]   Or I think of the story of Esther and how the strangest turns of affairs reverse the
[00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:16.060]   destruction of God's people and Mordecai moves from being a serf to the king's favorite,
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:21.460]   while Naaman dies on Mordecai's gallows.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.140]   And the return of the exiles from Jerusalem, when it looks like the adversaries are going
[00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:32.780]   to shut the whole thing down and in a sudden turn of affairs, you not only get the king
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.380]   back in the enemy territory supporting it, but paying for it.
[00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.380]   God is amazing.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:46.060]   At the worst of times, he seems to turn things around and make the bad work for good.
[00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:55.540]   And of course, Jesus, brutally murdered, rose from the dead, giving life to all who trust
[00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:57.700]   him, the best story of all.
[00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:05.860]   So the point of all those stories is to help this young woman trust God when his goodness
[00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:10.020]   seems most arbitrary.
[00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:12.220]   So yes, we do tremble.
[00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:18.280]   We do, and we should tremble before the goodness of a sovereign God.
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:24.980]   It may cost us our lives, but we do not give way to cynicism.
[00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:30.860]   We do not call his goodness whimsical or capricious.
[00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:40.180]   We fix our eyes on his infinite wisdom and his proven kindness, and we trust him with
[00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:41.180]   our lives.
[00:08:41.180 --> 00:08:42.180]   Amen.
[00:08:42.180 --> 00:08:43.180]   Yes, we can.
[00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:45.140]   Thank you, Pastor John, for that wisdom.
[00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:48.100]   These are the tricky pastoral questions that we've been tackling on the podcast now for
