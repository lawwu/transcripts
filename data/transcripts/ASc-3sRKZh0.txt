[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Let us look again at the words which are to be found in the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans in verses 26 and 27.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Verses 26 and 27 in the eighth chapter of Paul's epistle to the Romans.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   Likewise, the Spirit also helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we should pray for as we ought,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   but the Spirit itself, or himself, maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   And he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   because he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Now we've been through the various statements in these two verses, and we've seen the significance of the terms which the apostle uses and implies.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   And we have seen the great comfort and consolation which the apostle gives us in this statement.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   It is the proof of our ultimate, complete, and final salvation.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   So that far from being discouraged by the fact that we at times may find ourselves not knowing what to pray for,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   not knowing the what to pray for as we ought, and finding ourselves only capable of groaning,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   far from being discouraged by that, we should find in that a proof of our calling and election,
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   a proof of the fact that we are the children of God, because as we've already seen,
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   the Spirit is the cause and the author of these groanings in us.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And he only does that in the saints.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   He maketh intercession for the saints and for nobody else.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Therefore the presence of this in us is a proof of the fact that we are saints,
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   and that is a proof that we are the children of God,
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   and that in turn is a proof of the fact that our ultimate salvation is guaranteed and absolute.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   In other words, it's a part of the great theme which the apostle is developing as he goes on in this great eighth chapter.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Well now then, we've really finished our exposition of these two verses as such,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   but it seems to me that we can't quite leave it at that.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   The statement is such an important one, such a vital one, and at the same time such a very practical one,
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   that I feel we must draw certain lessons and deductions from it.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   This whole question of prayer can be, and often is to many Christian people, a difficult one,
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   one that causes them to be troubled.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And it seems to me therefore that if we are to reap the full benefit out of this great statement which the apostle makes,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   that we must now proceed to draw certain general lessons from what he teaches here.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Now here are some of them.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Let's look for a moment at what we may well call the mystery of prayer.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Now there is in prayer undoubtedly a very mysterious element, and people are often puzzled by this.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   The puzzle arises in this way, that there is a kind of seeming contradiction here.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   We are told to pray, and yet we are told at the same time that these prayers of ours are originated by the Holy Spirit,
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and that God knows the mind of the Spirit.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   He understands the working of the Spirit, and what the Spirit is saying, and giving us to say.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   How the Spirit acts as an intercessor in us, and gives us these prayers, as we saw last week.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   And that indeed, even beyond that, this intercession of the Spirit within us, this prompting of us to pray,
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   is something which is done according to the will of God.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Very well, the question that arises therefore in the minds of many people is this.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   If that is so, why pray at all?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   It seems to them to be a kind of circle.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   Here are we praying to God, and yet it is God himself who puts in us what to pray for, through the Spirit.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   So that they tend to feel that there is surely very little point in praying at all.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   Not only that, we are told everywhere in the Scripture that God knows all things, God is omniscient.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   He knows what we stand in need of before we even ask him.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Therefore, what point is there, what purpose is there in praying?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Now that question is raised here, because we are told that it is the Spirit who makes this intercession within us.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   The prayer is given to us, as it were, by the Spirit.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Well then, what's the point of it?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Well now, here is a question I'm sure that has often presented itself to you.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   There are many Christian people who, for this kind of reason, have come to the conclusion that there is no need to pray.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   That all you do is to go on trusting God, and that there is no need to pray at all.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   But clearly this is an obvious fallacy.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   The same kind of point could be made like this, and some have even fallen into this error.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   I refer again to Philippians 2.13.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God that worketh in you, both the will and to do of his good pleasure."
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   The argument is that because it's all originated by God, well, what need is there for us to do anything at all?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   Well now, what is the answer to this kind of difficulty?
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And it seems to me that here are some itinerant of the answers.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   The first is that we are clearly commended to pray.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It's always a good thing to start with a clear commendment.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Whether you and I understand prayer and its meaning or not.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   When we've got a clear commandment to pray, well then it is our business to pray.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   We should never argue with a commandment.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Now, here's a point of course which I could generalize.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   There are people who constantly get into trouble with this kind of a point.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   There are people who misunderstand a doctrine like the doctrine of election.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   They say, "If God elects those to salvation and he knows who they are and they're going to be elected, well, what's the point of preaching?"
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   You've often heard that argument, I'm sure.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   If it is to be, it will be.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   Well now, what's wrong with that of course is that it is God who commands preaching.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   It is God who sends out preachers.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It is God who gives them the ability to preach.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   It is God who calls men, all men, everywhere to repent.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   Now, these are clear statements of the scripture.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   And we must never allow any kind of logic, or what we may regard as logic,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   to carry us to a point in which we find ourselves contradicting either plain commandments, instructions, or indications of the scripture.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And therefore I say this is really a sufficient answer in and of itself.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   That we are not only commanded to pray, we are even taught how to pray.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   And our Lord himself gave that instruction as we all remember.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   Now, that is really sufficient in and of itself.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   But we can supplement that with various other answers.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   And here's a very important one.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   God not only ordains the ends, but also the means to that end.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   God is not concerned only about the ultimate result.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   He is equally concerned as to how that result is to be brought about.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Now, there's an obvious illustration here.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   In nature, we know very well that ultimately it is God who is responsible for all the crops.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   That are reaped and harvested in late summer and autumn.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It is God by sending the sun and the rain and so on, that produces all these results.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Yes, but we know equally well that God has ordained that the farmer should plough and harrow,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   and break up the ground, and sow it, and roll it, and do many other things to it.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   God ordains not only the ends, but the means to the ends.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Don't ask me why, that's a part of the great mystery of the will of God.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   To me it's very wonderful that God has arranged to do things very often through secondary causes.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   And you get that constantly in nature and in the whole of life.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   God works through means, and he is as responsible for the means as he is for the ends.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   And here we therefore come to this point, that clearly prayer is one of God's own appointed and chosen means
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   to bring us to that ultimate glory that awaits us.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Now, it's obvious that he could have brought us to that end without this, but he has chosen to do it in this way.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   It's the way in which God teaches us.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   It's the way in which he trains us.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   It's the way in which he brings us to a greater knowledge of himself.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   It's a very wonderful way of teaching us.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   He puts us in positions where we don't quite know what to do, and we turn to him.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   And often in these crises we get to know God in a way that we'd never have known him otherwise.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   And thus he has appointed prayer as one of the ways in which he gives us an increasing revelation and knowledge of himself.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   And he trains us up, and he perfects us, tries us, and tests us,
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   in order that ultimately we may come into the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ himself.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   In other words, for me to deal finally with this particular section,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   all I'm trying to say is seen most perfectly, of course, in the case of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ himself.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Here he is, God the second person in the blessed Holy Trinity.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   In perfect communion with God, and yet he spent much of his time on earth praying.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Praying to God.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Now, very well then, if he prayed and had to pray,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   if it was a part of his being made perfect as the captain of our salvation,
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   how much more necessary is it in our case?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   So the very fact that the Spirit himself, as it were, indicts this prayer,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   and acts as an intercessor within us in this way,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   is far from being an argument against prayer, a great argument for prayer.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Now I trust that this point is made very plain and clear.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   I'm emphasizing it for this one reason.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   That it is unfortunately the case, it's true to say,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   that very often people who understand certain of these doctrines of grace most clearly,
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   are the people who are most guilty of misunderstanding them to this extent,
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   that they cease to pray.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I know many people who are very orthodox, but who don't have prayer meetings,
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   and who spend very little time in prayer in their own personal lives.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   That is the point at which you've left your doctrine,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   and are just following your own logic, and your own intellectual formulations.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   It is an utterly false deduction.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   To understand this teaching truly should make us pray more than ever, not less.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Very well, there is what I call the mystery of prayer.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   And if your doctrine, my friend, is not making you pray more and more as you go on,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   you'd better examine yourself and your doctrine.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   This great apostle was a man of great prayer,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   and similar teachers have been men of prayer throughout the centuries.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   The second point I take up is this one.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   I call it the wrongness of advising all and sundry to pray.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   Now, here again is a point that seems to me to come out here.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   He maketh intercession, we are told, for the saints.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   I just touched on this at the end last Friday night, but I haven't got time to develop it then.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   He maketh intercession for the saints, not for anybody else.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   He doesn't put these prayers into the mind and the heart of anybody else.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   It is only for the saints.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   There is no teaching anywhere in the Bible that the Spirit helps the unbeliever in this matter of prayer.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   None whatsoever. It's entirely confined to the saints.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Indeed, we remember that statement made by the blind men, referred to in the ninth chapter of John's Gospel.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   He said a very profound thing.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   "God heareth not sinners," he said.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   You remember this man had been healed by our Lord,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   and the authorities were criticizing our Lord and regarding him as a blasphemer.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And this man who was so ignorant, he replies by saying, "God doesn't hear sinners."
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   But he's evidently heard this man.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Therefore, this man cannot be a sinner.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   But there is a proposition which is true.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   "God heareth not sinners."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Now, there's an idea abroad today, it seems to me,
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   that we can always tell people to start praying immediately.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   A good deal of this is done on the wireless and the television,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   especially in times of difficulty and of crisis.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   The whole country is called upon to pray.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   People talk about having a national day of prayer and things like that,
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   and invite everybody to crowd into places of worship to pray to God.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   We did it during the war, and there is a desire on the part of some to do something similar at the present time.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   Now, surely this is a matter which should be examined in the light of this kind of teaching.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   We surely need to instruct people as to how to pray.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   And we must show them that any man at any moment is not in a position to pray to God.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   It's not enough to tell people to pray, we must teach them how to pray.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   The disciples, you see, living in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ, realized that.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   They watched him pray, and they began to feel they knew nothing at all about this.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   So they said, "Lord, teach us how to pray," as John also taught his disciples.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And a man who's never felt any need of being taught how to pray
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   is really telling us that he never has prayed, and he doesn't know what prayer is.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Owing to our unworthy and imperfect ideas of God, we all think we can turn to God whenever we like.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   But the Bible teaches us very plainly that that is not the case,
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   and that we need much instruction with regard to this whole question of prayer.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   The first question we must ask is this, "How do we obtain entry into the presence of God?"
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   Now, if you've never asked that question, I say that you've never prayed. You can't have.
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   May I use an obvious human analogy?
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   If you wanted an audience with the Queen in Buckingham Palace,
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   the first thing you'd do would be to try to find out how it would be possible.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   How can you get there? What have you got to do?
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   What is essential? What introduction?
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   How do you conduct yourself? How do you dress yourself? How do you comport yourself?
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   What's your whole approach to be? Isn't it obvious?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Well, you can multiply that by infinity, and there is a soul-seeking God.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   And if you don't stop to ask, "How can I get into the presence of God?"
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Well, I say it just means that you can't possibly be praying to God.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   We've got to realize something about God himself, and the moment we do that,
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   we realize that certain things are absolutely essential before we can ever pray.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   We can't pray as we are. We have no standing.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   You see, the moment you begin to realize this, you say with joy,
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   "Oh, that I knew of some daysman who could come between us.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   Oh, that I knew of somebody who could take me by one hand,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   and as it were, take God by the other, and bring us together."
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   The moment we begin to realize something about God and the being of God,
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   we realize how lost and helpless and hopeless we are,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   and we realize the need of someone, something, to bring us into the presence of God.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   And that, of course, is the whole message of the Gospel.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   To tell people, "Stop praying, get on with it, keep on with it,"
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   and no more, is to deny you virtually the whole of the Christian Gospel.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   The Gospel is here to tell us this, that there is only one way to God,
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   and that the Lord Jesus Christ came into the world and did all that he did for this end,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   that he might bring us to God.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   That is why he said what I'm never tired of quoting in this generation,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   the talk so glibly about prayer,
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man cometh unto the Father but by me."
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   There it is, and it's the teaching of everyone.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Listen to the Apostle Paul teaching it to the Ephesians, Ephesians 2.18.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   "For by him," he says, referring to our Lord,
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   "we both," the Jew and the Gentile who are now believers,
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   "we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father."
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   And it's the only way.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   There is no entry into the presence of God, there is no prayer,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   except through the Lord Jesus Christ, by the influence and the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   It is the only way.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And for us to forget that for a moment is, I say, not only to deny the Gospel,
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   but to mean that we cease to pray at that point.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Or if you prefer it, take the statement of the author of the epistle to the Hebrews in chapter 10 and verse 19.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   This is how he puts it.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   "Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus."
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   That's the only way.
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   "By a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil,"
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   that is to say, his flesh.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   "And having an high priest over the house of God,
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   and our bodies washed with pure water."
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   Now that's the way to pray.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   And it is the only way.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   And to tell all and sundry when they're in difficulties,
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   to start praying immediately and to keep on, that they can do it any time they like,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   is to me a denial of the whole of the New Testament Gospel.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It makes the cross of Christ entirely unnecessary.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   And thus is surely to make despite of the very blood of the cross itself.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   It's a very serious matter.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   This impression that is given,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   "Ah yes, these preachers, they talk about their theology and their doctrine and so on,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   but they're complicating the whole thing."
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   All you need to do is to turn to God and pray.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   You can't pray without this doctrine.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   You can't go into the presence of God except with the blood of Jesus.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   There is no other way of getting there.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   There is no entry into the holiest of all without this particular offering.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   Even the shadows of the Old Testament were only temporary.
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   But they at any rate realized that they needed an offering.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   They killed their animals.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   They took the blood.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   This is but a shadow.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   The truth, the real truth of the matter is that they're all pointing
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   to this one offering of Christ once and forever,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   by which and by which alone there is any access into the presence of God in prayer.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Well now then, let's be clear about these things.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   He maketh intercession only for the saints, not for anybody else.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And it is our duty to teach people that,
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   lest they may be deluding themselves and just treating themselves psychologically.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   By imagining that they're praying, they're only talking to themselves.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   They say they feel greatly helped by it.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   I know, psychology can help you.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   By talking to yourself you can help yourself a great deal.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   Or by sending up beautiful thoughts you can make yourself feel much happier and better.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   But it doesn't mean that it's prayer.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   The Spirit only helps the saints,
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   because they're the only people who have any standing in the presence of God,
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   who have any access into his holy presence.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Then let us go on to a third point, which is what I would call types of prayer.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Now what I mean is this.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   I noticed that some of the commentators
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   draw a deduction like this from this statement that we are looking at.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:38.000]   That really the finest and the best and the highest type of prayer is just groaning.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   What they say is this, you see.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   They say, "Oh, there are many people who can be very voluble in prayer,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   and offer long prayers and so on.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   But the real prayer, true prayer,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   is that prayer in which you can't say anything at all.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   You just growl."
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   Now that is a deduction that is actually drawn by a number of commentators.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   And there are many who are ready to follow them in that deduction.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   But of course it is completely and entirely wrong.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   Now let me prove what I'm saying.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   Of course you see where the devil comes in.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Wonderful excuse that for people who have never taken part in a prayer meeting.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   See, they are not these people who can pray in words, they only groan.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   They are such great saints that they never pray in words.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   That's why they don't take part in prayer meetings.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   But my dear friend, that's the wiles of the devil.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   And it's entirely contrary to scriptural teaching.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   What do I mean? Well, take Hosea, if you like, 14.3.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   The prophet exhorting the children of Israel, "Take with you words.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   Go back to him," he says.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   And he doesn't merely leave it at going back to God.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   He tells them that when they do go back to God,
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   they've got to say certain things unto him.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   "Take with you words," he says.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   "Say unto him."
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Look at it there in that last chapter of the book of the prophet Hosea.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   "O Israel, return unto the Lord thy God,
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Take with you words and turn to the Lord.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   Say unto him, 'Take away all iniquity and receive us graciously.'
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   So will we render the carves of our lips.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Asher shall not save us, we will not," so on.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Well now, there it is.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   Again, that's quite enough in and of itself.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   The prophet was writing under the inspiration of the Spirit.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   That's the teaching of the Spirit.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   The Spirit, who at times so deals with us that we can do nothing but groan,
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   at other times tells us to take words and gives us the words,
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   instructs us exactly as to what we are to say.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   That, I say, is enough in and of itself.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   But, of course, the Bible is full of similar teaching.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   Look at the many prayers that are recorded in the Scriptures.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Some of the greatest and most wonderful prayers that have ever been offered,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   they are recorded here in the Scriptures.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Look at many of the psalms.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   Most of those psalms, in a sense, are prayers, but they're in words.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   And very wonderful words, very eloquent words, very beautiful words.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   Words, not just groaning, but statements, words.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   Look at the prayers of Daniel that are recorded for us.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   Look at the prayer of Hezekiah.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Don't you remember how he took a document once and spread it before the Lord
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   and then pleaded on the basis of that.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Now, these are the great prayers of the Scriptures,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   laying the matter open before God.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   Not only that, we find some remarkable instances of prophets of God,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   mighty, holy men of God, not only praying in words,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   but pleading with God, reasoning with God, using arguments with God.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   One of the best illustrations of this, of course,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   is to be found in the book of the prophet Isaiah.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   You remember how particularly in chapter 63 and 64 he does this.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   He's literally pleading with God.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Listen to this kind of thing in verse 15 of chapter 63.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   "Look down from heaven," he says, "and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory."
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   He says, "Where is thy zeal and thy strength,
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me?
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   Are they restrained?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   Doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   Thy name is everlasting.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   O Lord, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and hardened our hearts?
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Return for thy servants' sake.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   So that thou wouldst rend the heavens, and that thou wouldst come down,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   that the mountains might flow at thy presence.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   We are thine, he says, thou never barest rule over them.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   They were not called by thy name.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance."
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   And so on.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   You're familiar with that.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   In the Psalms, and there in the prophets, in so many different places,
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   the man praying not only uses words, but he ventures to reason with God,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   and to argue with God, and to plead with God,
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   to remind God of his own character, and of his own promises.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Well now, the Bible is full of that sort of thing.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   So it is a very false deduction to say that the highest form of prayer
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   is just a groan or a sigh.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   Indeed, let me put it like this, as I tried to last Friday night.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   That isn't what the apostle is saying here at all.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   What he is saying is that there are times,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   when in exceptionally difficult circumstances,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   undergoing these trials and tribulations about which he is writing,
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   the sufferings of this present time.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   We really are in perplexity, and we don't know what to pray for.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   But this is unusual, this isn't common.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   This isn't the general condition of the child of God.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   This is only a very special case.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   And in that special condition, we can do nothing but groan
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   in the way that we have seen, or perhaps just sigh.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000]   But that's not to be the norm of the Christian life.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   The Christian as a child is to talk to his father.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   He is to commune with his father.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   He is to speak to him and to listen to him.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   It is to be this constant conversation, as it were.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   That is prayer, that is true worship.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   Even as our Lord himself did, so are we meant to do.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   Therefore, let us beware that the devil doesn't trap us at this point.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   And make us, I say, feel that the fact that we can't pray,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   and we stammer and stutter and groan,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   and never know any liberty in prayer, is a sign of great spirituality.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   It's the other way around.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   The more spiritual a man is, the more he'll pray.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And the greater freedom he'll know in prayer,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   the greater liberty, the greater enjoyment.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Very well then, let's examine ourselves very carefully at that point.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   But let me add this,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   that if we've never known what it is to groan in this way, or to sigh,
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   it is again indicative of something wrong with us.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   For the Christian does enter this state,
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   it is an experience that the Christian should know.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   And the more one realizes the true character of the spiritual warfare,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   the more one will know something about this groaning and sighing.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Not as something which replaces prayer,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   but as an occasional experience of one who has entered to such an extent
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   into the fellowship of Christ's sufferings,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   that he knows just a little of what it is to groan,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   as our Lord himself groaned there at the grave of Lazarus,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   and on other occasions.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:28.000]   Very well then, there we have what I would call types of prayer.
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   But I'm most concerned about that false deduction,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   which is suggested to many by the devil.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Well now then, having said that, let us close on this point.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Some general rules concerning prayer, in the light of all this.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   And of course, the text itself indicates that we all do stand in need of these rules.
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   We know not what to pray for as we ought, in these conditions.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Very well then, is there no guidance for us in the Scripture?
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Well, thank God we are given this great comfort,
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   that the Spirit is there interceding within us the whole time.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   But we can go beyond this, we can show elsewhere in the Scripture,
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   how there is very practical advice and help given to us.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   It's the thing as it were that you fall back upon,
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   to realize the intercession of the Spirit.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   You don't start with that.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   That is your final comfort, when you really can do nothing.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   But you end with that, you don't start with that.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   You don't, the moment you're in difficulties, just sit back and groan and say,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   "I don't understand." No, no.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   You do everything you can before you come to this.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   What can you do?
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   Well, here are certain rules it seems to me.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   The first thing always is to start with a realization
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   of what you're doing when you pray.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   If you like, a realization as to who God is.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   Now there is something we can always do.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000]   Whatever our circumstances, whatever our condition,
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   start with a realization of who and what God is.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   And that you are in relationship with God.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   Now let me use it, let me use this illustration.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Not only to save time, but because it puts the thing so plainly and so clearly.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Whenever you find yourself in this position that you don't know what to pray for as you ought,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   what can you do?
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000]   Well, I'll tell you what you can do.
[00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   You can always worship God.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   You can always adore Him.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   You can always praise Him.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   "Ah, but you say I'm in difficulties now."
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Yes, I know you're in difficulties about this one thing.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   But you shouldn't be in any difficulty with regard to God.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   Very well then, if you can't talk to Him about this one thing,
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   and if you don't know what to say about this one thing,
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   talk to God about something that you do know about.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000]   Now then, I've got a classical example.
[00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   I read it at the beginning, Acts 4.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   That's exactly why I read that passage.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:00.000]   You remember the story, Peter and John on trial,
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   because they'd healed the laymen at the beautiful gate of the temple.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   They're on trial.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   They're let off, but they're let off with a very severe warning.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   They are told if they go on preaching or teaching in the name of this Jesus,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   well, certain things are going to happen to them.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   They straightly threaten them,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   which undoubtedly means that they told them not only that they'd put them in prison,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   but that they'd put them to death.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   Even as James the apostle was put to death quite soon afterwards.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Here they are, Peter and John, let out of the prison,
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   let out of the court, and straightly threatened.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   They went back to their own company, to the church, and they reported this.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   What they said, of course, was that the authorities were determined to put an end to this Christianity.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   They were out to exterminate the church.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   They were out to put an end to all preaching,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   or anything being done in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   The Christian church is, as it were, face to face with the end of all things.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   And you remember what they did. They prayed.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   They lifted up their hearts to God with one accord, and said,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   and what did they say? Now that's the great thing in that recorded prayer.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   Unlike us, they didn't start with themselves and their problem.
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   They started with God.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   Though they're in this desperate condition, this is how they prayed.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   "Lord, thou art God which has made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that in them is."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   See, they didn't know what to do. They didn't know where to turn, nor what to do.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   So what do they talk about? Well, not about that.
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   They talk about what they're sure of, and that is that,
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   "Lord, thou art God which has made heaven and earth and the sea, and all that in them is."
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   They start by praising God.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   And you can always do that. It's always a safe thing to do.
[00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Whatever your perplexity, whatever your problem,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   when you don't know what to pray for as you ought,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   praise God, worship God, adore God.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Remind yourself of who God is, and ascribe unto him all praise and honor and glory.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   Now that's the universal teaching of the scripture.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:15.000]   Paul in Philippians 4 teaches exactly the same thing.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Philippians 4, 5, and 6, "In nothing be anxious."
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   Nothing. "In nothing be anxious, but in all things,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving."
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   That's what he puts first, you see. "Let your requests be made known unto God."
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   You don't immediately become speechless because of your perplexity.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   No, no. You start with doing what you can, do what you know.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   And this is to worship and adore and to praise God.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   That's the way. And that is something that we can always do.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   Very well, there's my first suggestion.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   But here's the second one.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   Spiritual requests are always right,
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   because they are always in accordance with God's will.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   Spiritual requests. What do I mean?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   Well, I mean this, prayer for the success of God's work and God's kingdom.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   That's always right. You can always pray for that.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   But the trouble with us all is, of course, that we are so concerned about our little problem
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   and our particular difficulty, we forget everything else,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   as if this was the one thing in the whole universe. It isn't.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   Pray for the success of God's kingdom, for the spread of the kingdom,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   for the success of his work. Not only that.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It's always a safe prayer to pray for greater knowledge of God,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   a greater knowledge of his love,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   a greater knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   a greater understanding of his love to you.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   You need never hesitate about offering such prayers.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   They're always acceptable to God.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   They're always well-pleasing in his sight.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   He delights in them.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   And the more we pray like that, the more God will be pleased with us.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Prayer for greater holiness, greater sanctification,
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   greater strength and help in the battle.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   Always right. You need never hesitate at all.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Spiritual prayers, as I call them, are always right.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   And you need never be in any hesitation at all concerning them.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   And thirdly, I would say this,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   it is always right to plead the promises of God.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I've given you examples of that already,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   and I would universalize that as a principle,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   and say that whenever you've got a clear promise of God, plead it.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   The promises of God are meant to be used.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.000]   And likewise, quote Scripture.
[00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Notice those people in Acts 4.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   They quoted the second psalm to God himself.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   Well, you say, what's the point of that?
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   God is the author of this through the Spirit.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   What's the point of quoting his own psalm to God?
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Isn't that a waste of breath and a waste of energy?
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   It isn't. It's true prayer.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   Analogies always break down,
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   but you can understand it like this.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Does a father ever object to a little child quoting his own words to him,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   reminding him of something that he's said?
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   No, of course he doesn't. He likes it. He enjoys it.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   He's always pleased when his own child or grandchild
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   quotes his own words to him against himself, as it were,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   in order to get something from him.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Well, God is our Father.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   You're always right when you quote the promises of God,
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   or when you quote God's own word to God.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Now, there's no need to hesitate there.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   But now then, let me come to a second group of instructions,
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   which are cautions.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And these cautions are obviously necessary.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   We've already seen that in our exposition.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   I would lay it down as a general principle
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   that we should exercise great care and caution
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   concerning purely personal requests.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Apart from what I've already said,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I've been dealing with personal spiritual requests
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   for growth, for a knowledge of God, for greater love, and so on.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But now I'm concerned now about requests for ourselves
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   outside these spiritual desires and spiritual requests.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Here we've got to be very cautious, very careful.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   And especially when we come down to the matter of details.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   Otherwise we may well find ourselves
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   not only praying for something against the will of God,
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   like what I quoted to you a fortnight ago
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   happened in the case of Moses,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   and the case of the Apostle Paul with the thorn in his flesh,
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   but for a still more serious reason.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   If you and I are too urgent and insistent
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   in our particular requests
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   with regard to personal things that we desire,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   we may very well bring upon ourselves
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   most undesirable results.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   Let me read a terrible verse to you.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Psalm 106 verse 15.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "And he gave them their request,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   but sent leanness into their soul."
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Now that's a reference to the children of Israel.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   and tempted God in the desert.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   They kept on pleading with him for quails
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   and for other things like that, matters of food and so on,
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   and various other requests.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   They lusted exceedingly in the wilderness
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   and tempted God in the desert.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   "And he gave them their request,
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   but sent leanness into their soul."
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   You bombard God with certain particular
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   personal material requests
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   or certain other requests which you particularly want in your own life.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Well, there is this possibility.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   This is the scriptural teaching that he lets you have it.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   And you'll bitterly regret it.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   He may grant you your request,
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   but because it wasn't a true request,
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   not in your best interest,
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   and because you wouldn't listen to him
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   and his discouragement to you,
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   he'll let you have your request,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   but you'll find leanness in your soul.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And the day will come when you'll bitterly regret
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   that you ever made that request.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And you'll almost upbraid God with having answered you.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   But if you see the folly and repent,
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   God will graciously forgive you again.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   And you will probably learn one of the great lessons
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   of your spiritual and your Christian life.
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   Let us be extremely careful
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   when we come to these personal requests.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   The apostle, you see, he wanted that thorn to be taken out.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   God didn't grant him his request.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   And he came to see that it was a very good thing for himself.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   If that thorn had been taken out,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   it would probably have been the worst thing
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   that could possibly have happened to the great apostle.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   This is the realm in which we don't understand.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Let us therefore be cautious and careful
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   in our pleadings for personal requests.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   But let me go on to a second point,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   which I'll put like this.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Where God's will is not certainly known,
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   again exercise great care and caution.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   If you're in that position that you don't quite know,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   is it to be this or that?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   And we are often in that position.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   Well now, you've got to be very cautious here.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   And you've got to exercise great care.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   What do we do?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Well, I suggest this is what we do.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   First of all, utterly submit yourself to God and his will.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Tell him so.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   Tell him that your one desire is not so much to do this or to do that,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   as to do his will.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   That you want to know what his will is,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   that that's your supreme desire.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And further, say this,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   that you are ready to do his will and to be content with it,
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   whichever it is.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Though you may personally prefer to do this one on the right,
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   tell God if it's your will that I go on the left,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I will go on the left, and I will gladly go on the left.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Only to do thy will, my will shall be.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   Tell him that. Utter submission.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Now that is something of which we're always capable.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   We don't know what to pray for as we ought.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   Well then, don't pray for anything in particular,
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   but start by telling God that you're absolutely submitted to him.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   You require nothing but the knowledge of his will,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   in order that you may do it.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Then having done that, let your requests be made known unto him.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   In all things with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving,
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   let your requests be made known unto God.
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   That's what we can always do.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Tell him what your request is.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Always, having first of all put it entirely as it were into his hands,
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   then having let your requests be made known unto God,
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   make absolutely certain that you've got within you the peace of God
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   that passeth all understanding.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Now why do I put it like that?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   Well, because of the nature of the statement made by the apostle there in Philippians 4.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   He says, "In nothing be anxious,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   but in all things with prayer and supplication and thanksgiving,
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   let your requests be made known unto God,
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   and, do that, and the peace of God which passeth all understanding,
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   shall keep your heart and mind in the knowledge of Christ Jesus."
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   So you must be sure that you are enjoying the peace of God
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   that passeth all understanding.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   And if you're not, it's because you haven't surrendered it fully to God.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   You're holding on to something.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   You're not really willing for God to have his way with you.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   You must be certain that you are enjoying and that you go on enjoying
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   the peace of God that passeth all understanding.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:11.000]   You still don't know what's happening to you.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   You still don't know which is right, this or that.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   In a sense, you still don't know what to pray for as you ought.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   But, you should always be enjoying the peace of God that passeth all understanding
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   in your mind and in your heart.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   It is an absolute promise.
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   And we should always make sure that we are enjoying it.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   My next, my third caution is this one.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Never demand anything of God.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Never claim anything of God.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.000]   There's a great deal of teaching along this line today.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Claim this or that.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   When you realize who God is, you don't claim.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   You make your requests known.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Don't claim.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   People claim healing and many other things.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   They get some sort of answer to their requests very often as the children of Israel did.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   But God knows it isn't always healing.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And some of us have to deal with the tragedies along that line.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   Be careful.
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   Don't claim things.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Don't demand.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Realize who God is.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   God, as I say, allows you to come as a child with that kind of sweet and engaging reasoning
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   and pleading that we saw there in Isaiah 63 and 64.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   That's a very different thing from claiming, demanding, almost telling God that he has to do it.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:36.000]   Reverence and godly fear, my friends.
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   Our God is a consuming fire.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   The children of Israel demanded those things in the wilderness.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   They got their requests.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   But it was accompanied by leanness in the soul.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Be careful then, Isaiah.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Even about these desires for healing, yes, I'm going to add,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   even a prayer for the salvation of somebody who is very dear to you.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   Don't demand it.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Don't claim it.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Pray for it.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   Don't demand it.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   Don't claim it.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   The Bible has got strange teaching about this.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   No saint has a right to argue that all his children must be saved.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   It's not true to scriptural teaching.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   It's certainly not true either to the history of the Christian church.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   Don't claim.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Don't demand.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   Let your requests be made known.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   Let them come from your heart.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   God will understand that.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   But don't demand.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Don't claim.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   We have no right even to demand revival.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   There are people tending to do that at the present time, it seems to me.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   Pray urgently.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   Plead.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   Use all the arguments.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   Use all the promises.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   Don't demand.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:42.000]   Don't claim.
[00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   Never put yourself into the position of saying, "If we only do this, then that must..."
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   No, no.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   God is a sovereign Lord.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   And these things are beyond our understanding.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   Never let the terminology of claiming or of demanding be used.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   So I put it finally like this.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   There is nothing that is wrong but everything that is right in telling God when we are in
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   this position that we don't know the what to pray for as we ought.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   At that point, as I've been trying to indicate, there is nothing wrong in groaning or in sighing.
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   God knows our sighs.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   He counts our tears.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   He that searcheth the hearts, He knows all about it.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   And don't feel that you're failing.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   And don't feel that the man who goes claiming and demanding things is a man of greater faith
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   than you.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   No, no.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   He's a man of very small faith.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   Indeed, if he's not sinning at that point, God prefers the sigh of the humble saint that
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   doesn't know but that leaves it to him and/or rejoices in the fact of the intercession of
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   the Spirit within him.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   Very well.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   But then let's remember this as a final word.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   I've got to add it to make the doctrine complete.
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   "Are you not leading us to this point?" says somebody, "That we can therefore never be
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   certain as to what we pray for?"
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Far from it.
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   I am still dealing with these exceptional circumstances.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   I have shown you matters about which you can pray freely.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   I want to end on this note.
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   There is such a thing as the prayer of faith.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   What is that?
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   James talks about it, if you remember.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   "The prayer of faith shall save the sick, heal the sick."
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   What does Mark 11, 24 mean?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   "What thingssoever ye desire when ye pray, believe that ye receive them, and ye shall
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   receive them."
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   What's that?
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   How do we do that?
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   How do I offer the prayer of faith?
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   What am I told to do when I'm told, "What thingsoever ye desire when ye pray, believe
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   that ye receive them"?
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   How do I do that?
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   Now there are many people today who think that that just means this, that you say to
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   yourself, "I believe it."
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   You try to work yourself up into saying, "Yes, I do believe it.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   It is the word of God.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   I do believe it."
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   It doesn't mean that at all.
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   It's almost the exact opposite of that.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   That's to be frantic.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   That's to be desperate.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   That's the kind of whistling to keep up your courage in the dark.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   That's a kind of attempt to persuade yourself that isn't the prayer of faith, that isn't
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:08.000]   really believing that you receive them.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   What is this then?
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Oh, I'll tell you what it is.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   It is an absolute certainty that is given occasionally by the Holy Spirit himself.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   He puts a prayer into your mind and into your heart.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   He gives you a prayer and he tells you as he gives it that it's going to be answered.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   It's not a very common experience, but it is an experience.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   It does happen.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   It ought to happen to us more and more frequently.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   And as we grow in the school of prayer, it will.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   There is such a thing as that.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000]   It is an absolute certainty.
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Let me give you an illustration.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   You remember what we are told.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   I've already referred to it about Peter and John healing the men at the beautiful
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   gate of the temple.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Here's the men crying out, asking for alms of Peter and John, you remember.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   They hadn't got anything to give him.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   But we are told that Peter, fastening his eyes upon him, with John said to him,
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   "Don't forget that fastening his eyes.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Silver and gold have I none, but such as I have, give I thee.
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk."
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   What was happening?
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   I'll tell you what was happening.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Peter wasn't trying an experiment there.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Peter wasn't trying to work up a great faith, wondering whether it would come off or not.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.000]   No, no.
[00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Peter was given a commission.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   Peter knew that that man was going to rise.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   There was no uncertainty.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   There was no doubt at all.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   He was given a commission.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   He was absolutely certain, as he spoke the word, that it would happen.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   Paul did the same with the lame men at Lystra.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   You'll find it in Acts 14.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Beholding that this man had got faith to believe, he spoke that it happened.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   Of course.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   There were no failures in the case of the apostles in this matter.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   As I've often put it, there are two things you notice about the work of the apostles
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   which differentiate them from so many who claim great faith today
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000]   and who claim to do things in the name of faith.
[00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   The apostles never announced beforehand that they were going to work miracles.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   They didn't say next Wednesday there would be meetings with miracles and healings.
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   Never.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   They never said beforehand.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Why?
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Because they didn't know beforehand.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   They never knew until the commission was given.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   But when it was given, they were absolutely certain.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   Secondly, there were no failures.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   Yes, failures before Pentecost, never after.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   They always knew.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   The commission was given by the Spirit, and it never failed.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   Now, I use that as an analogy.
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000]   There is a prayer given by the Spirit, and He tells you that it's going to be answered.
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:50.000]   That's the prayer of faith.
[00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   It's not an experiment.
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   It's not trying to persuade yourself or work yourself up.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   It is an absolute certainty that is given by the Spirit.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000]   And you know, therefore, when you are praying and making your request,
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   that your prayer is answered.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   You do believe that it is going to happen, and it does happen.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Because it was given, and the assurance of it was given, by the blessed Holy Spirit Himself.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Well, may God bless to us these considerations concerning this vital and important matter of prayer.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Thank God that we have behind us always this ultimate consolation.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   That when we know not what to pray for as we ought,
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   the Spirit Himself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   And he that searcheth the house knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit,
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:49.000]   for he maketh intercession for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   Let us pray.
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   O Lord, our God, we know not how to thank Thee again
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   for the mystery and the marvel and the glory of Thy ways with respect to us.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   We can but ascribe unto Thee all praise and honor and glory.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   O Lord, open our understandings, we pray Thee, that we may be kept from the pitfalls.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   O Lord, shed Thy love abroad in our hearts, lest we may lust after things that are bad for us.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   O God, we surrender ourselves unto Thee.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   We desire to know and to do Thy holy will.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Lord, grant that we may desire this more and more with the whole of our being.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   Thus, O Lord, we leave ourselves in Thy loving and almighty hands.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Be especially near, we pray Thee, to those who are in this position of perplexity at this hour
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.000]   with respect to any given matter.
[00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   Grant, O Lord, that they may thus humble themselves before Thee,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   that they may enjoy that peace of Thine which passeth all understanding
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.000]   and have the blessed experience of knowing that their minds and their hearts
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   are being kept quietly, perfectly, and garrisoned in the knowledge of Thy dear Son.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   And now, may the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   and the fellowship and the communion of the Holy Spirit abide and continue with us now this night
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   throughout the remainder of this hour's short, uncertain earthly life and pilgrimage
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   and until we shall be with Him in the glory,
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   no longer groaning in this body, but glorified in every respect, everlastingly.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   Amen.
